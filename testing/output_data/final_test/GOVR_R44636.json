    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund federal agencies through 12 regular appropriations bills. If the process is delayed, continuing resolutions (CRs) can provide interim funding based on a prorated rate of operations for a specified period. Continuing resolutions (CRs) provide interim funding based on the previous fiscal year's budget authority. Funding levels can be established by referencing the prior year's appropriations acts or using other methods. Congress has the flexibility to set CR funding rates on any basis. Continuing resolutions (CRs) can establish funding rates based on various sources such as the President's budget request or previous appropriations bills. Full text appropriations in CRs fund activities by incorporating text from regular appropriations bills, functioning similarly to enacting regular appropriations. The \"Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, FY2011\" (P.L. 112-10) provided funding for DOD through full text appropriations in Division A, while other projects were funded using a formula based on previous fiscal year's appropriations laws in Division B. Different ways to determine funding levels for base defense appropriations and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending were considered, including establishing separate formulas for defense spending or funding defense and nondefense activities under the same formula. The level of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending under a Continuing Resolution (CR) could be determined by a general formula or an alternative rate. For example, the first CR for FY2013 (P.L. 112-175) specified that OCO funding should be continued at a rate permitted by the amount in the President's budget request. Continuing resolutions (CRs) may include limitations to preserve congressional prerogatives, such as prohibiting agencies from starting new projects without prior funding. Congress can also restrict production on programs not funded in previous years and limit contractual actions like multiyear procurement contracts. An interim CR may provide funds at the rate of the prior year's appropriation, potentially causing a mismatch at the account level between the agency's request and the CR funding level. This discrepancy, known as an issue with the color of money, is prohibited by the Antideficiency Act. The use of anomalies in appropriations accounts under a CR aims to provide flexibility and prevent adverse effects, allowing time for Congress and the President to agree on full-year appropriations and avoid a government shutdown. Factors influencing Congress's decision to include additional authority for DOD under a CR may include funding differences between CR and full-year appropriations, past flexibility delegated to DOD, and the potential impact of a CR on operations. Under a longer-term CR, the impact on DOD can be directly related to the length of time it operates under the CR. Extended delays in passing a full-year defense appropriations bill may increase management challenges and risks for DOD. Anomalies, such as specific funding rates for operations or extending expiring authorities, may be included in CRs. For example, the second CR for FY2017 granted anomalies for DOD, including funding for the Columbia Class Ballistic Missile Submarine Program and multiyear procurement contracts for helicopters. Section 157 of the FY2018 CR provided funding for the Air Force's KC\u201346A Tanker, allowing procurement of 15 aircraft instead of the previous rate of 12. DOD submitted a list of programs that would be affected under a CR to OMB, including delays for 75 programs and negative impacts on 40 programs due to production quantity limitations. OMB may or may not forward this list to Congress for consideration, with some analysts suggesting that anomalies in a CR could hinder reaching a budget agreement. After the FY2018 CR was extended through March 23, 2018, with anomalies addressed in the fourth measure (P.L. 115-123), OMB provides detailed directions to executive agencies on fund availability and budget execution. An automatic apportionment of funds is announced for obligation as a percentage of the annualized amount provided by the CR. Funds under a CR are apportioned based on the time period or historical spending patterns. An interim CR may allow OMB to mitigate furloughs by apportioning funds for personnel compensation at a higher rate. CRs lock DOD funding accounts at previous year's levels, impacting scheduled activities. Funding needs across DOD accounts vary yearly due to emerging threats. Funding constraints under a CR can lead to delays in personnel actions, maintenance, and training activities within DOD. These restrictions can cause ripple effects such as personnel shortages and equipment maintenance backlogs. Additionally, DOD is limited in initiating new programs or increasing production quantities beyond the prior year's rate, resulting in delays in weapon system development and fielding. Under a CR, DOD's funding constraints can lead to delays in weapon system development and fielding. This can result in challenges for defense acquisition programs, especially during transitional periods in the acquisition process. Color of money issues may also arise, impacting the allocation of funds for research, development, test, and evaluation activities. The Columbia class Ballistic Missile Submarine Program faced limitations on funding color, affecting procurement. A Continuing Resolution (CR) can cause issues with funding apportionment in the Navy's Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) appropriation account, managing funding at the line-item level. The Navy's Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) appropriation account faces challenges with funding apportionment at the line-item level under a Continuing Resolution (CR). The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provides additional authorities for DOD's mission, including end strengths for military forces and training activities with allied forces in contingency operations. Some authorities expire at the start of the fiscal year, while others expire at the end of the calendar year. The NDAA may be delayed, leading Congress to address expiring authorities through a CR. The effects of a CR on the military are hard to quantify, with DOD prioritizing funding for readiness activities in its FY2018 budget request. The CR's funding for operations is 13% below the President's budget request, causing uncertainty and decisions to prioritize available funds. The uncertainty of a CR's duration leads to prioritizing funding for urgent needs, resulting in deferred training, maintenance, and supply activities that can erode military readiness. Testimony before the Senate Subcommittee highlighted how CRs create budget uncertainty, disrupt agency operations, and cause inefficiencies. Agencies are forced to take limited funding actions during a CR, impacting their ability to carry out missions and plan for the future. Krause testified that agencies take various actions to manage inefficiencies during CRs, such as shifting contract cycles and providing spending guidance for flexibility. CRs lead to additional paperwork, short-term contracting needs, and managerial complications. The government can save money through bulk purchases or contract extensions under annual appropriations. During a continuing resolution (CR), federal agencies face management challenges, with the Department of Defense (DOD) encountering unique obstacles in providing military forces. Secretary of Defense James Mattis highlighted that longer CRs impact readiness and equipment, limiting the ability to adapt to security threats. DOD officials emphasize the need for stable funding and new start activities to maintain a modernized force. Former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter warned that CRs restrict commanders' flexibility in responding to evolving threats. CRs have put commanders in a \"straight-jacket,\" limiting their ability to adapt to national security challenges like the Islamic State. Congress has passed CRs in all but 4 of the past 40 years to allow agencies to operate without annual appropriation bills. DOD has operated under a CR for an average of 125 days per year since FY2010, compared to 32 days per year from FY2002-FY2009. This has totaled over 38 months since 2010, impacting military readiness and equipment. Senior defense officials have adjusted to the expectation that full-year appropriations bills will not be completed on time, leading to the military operating in three fiscal quarters per year. DOD program managers and leaders plan ahead to minimize contracting actions in the first quarter due to the frequent use of Continuing Resolutions (CRs). The Defense Acquisition University emphasizes the need to consider late enactment as the norm when planning acquisitions. Defense officials have adjusted to the expectation of delayed appropriations bills, leading to the military operating in three fiscal quarters per year. To minimize contracting actions in the first quarter, managers can defer hiring, restrict travel, and cancel nonessential events. These efforts have reduced the need for specific anomalies in Continuing Resolutions. However, short-term funding still creates inefficiencies according to former Defense Department Comptroller Mike McCord."
