    "content": "The \"School Milk Nutrition Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows. The Dietary Guidelines recommend daily dairy consumption for children and adolescents, who typically fall short of these recommendations. Milk is a key source of essential nutrients like vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, crucial for bone health. Low-fat and skim milk also provide significant protein content. Dairy foods, including milk, are beneficial for bone health, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Milk has historically been a part of school meal programs, but declining participation may lead to fewer students consuming milk. Promoting milk consumption in schools is important for the health of the school-age population. SEC. 3. FLUID MILK. Milk consumption in schools is important for the health of the school-age population. Section 9(a)(2) of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to require schools participating in the school lunch program to offer students a variety of fluid milk consistent with Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This includes flavored and unflavored fluid milk options, including low-fat flavored milk with specific nutritional requirements. Schools participating in the school lunch program must offer students a variety of fluid milk options, including flavored milk with no more than 150 calories per 8-ounce serving, lactose-free milk, and substitutes for students with dietary restrictions upon receiving a physician's written statement. Non-dairy beverages can be substituted if they are nutritionally equivalent to low-fat fluid milk. The curr_chunk states that non-dairy beverages can be substituted for fluid milk in schools if they are nutritionally equivalent and meet specific nutritional standards for students with dietary needs. The school must notify the State agency before implementing any substitutions. The school can implement non-dairy beverage substitutions for fluid milk if they meet nutritional standards for students with dietary needs, with written approval from a medical authority or parent. The school is not obligated to provide beverages beyond acceptable substitutes, and any excess expenses are the responsibility of the school food authority. Any excess expenses not covered by reimbursements under this Act shall be paid by the school food authority. SEC. 4 amends the Child Nutrition Act to ensure all beverages sold in schools have the same maximum volume. SEC. 5 focuses on evaluating school milk trends. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a study on recent trends in fluid milk consumption in schools, including factors affecting consumption, assessment of Federal milk programs, review of relevant scientific studies, and consultation with various experts. The Secretary of Agriculture will submit a report to Congress within one year of this Act, including the results of a study on milk consumption in schools, recommendations for increasing milk consumption, and consideration of nutrition education programs like Fuel Up to Play 60. SEC. 6. FLUID MILK PROMOTION. The Secretary will implement a pilot program to increase fluid milk consumption in schools by providing grants to cover additional costs, testing various venues for milk distribution, and evaluating the impact of improved refrigeration. The pilot program aims to increase fluid milk consumption in schools by testing different distribution methods and evaluating the effectiveness of improvements like refrigeration and packaging. It will terminate 4 years after enactment, with a report due to Congress summarizing the findings within 5 years. The Secretary will provide lactose-free milk with extended shelf life in 8-ounce containers to schools under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act. Women in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children can request reduced fat milk for themselves and children 24 months and older."
