    "title": "SB 632",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 22358.4 of the Vehicle Code allows local authorities to establish lower speed limits based on engineering and traffic surveys. The speed limit can be set at 20 or 15 miles per hour if deemed necessary for safety. The ordinance must be approved and appropriate signs must be erected before the new speed limit is enforced. Local authorities can establish prima facie speed limits of 15 miles per hour in a residence district near schools when children are present. This limit also applies near school grounds without physical barriers while children are using the area. In a residence district near schools, a 25 miles per hour prima facie speed limit applies when children are present, either during school hours or recess. This limit also applies near school grounds without physical barriers while children are using the area. The prima facie speed limits near schools apply to highways with two lanes and a 30 miles per hour limit. The limits apply to all lanes in both directions, and local authorities must consider Section 627 when lowering speed limits. An ordinance or resolution is only effective once appropriate speed limit signs are erected. For school warning signs near school grounds, speed limits of 15 mph can be placed up to 500-1,320 feet away, while speed limits of 25 mph can be placed between 500-1,320 feet away. Local authorities must reimburse the Department of Transportation for costs incurred. Local authorities have the option to extend speed limits and school warning signs based on engineering surveys of school attendance boundaries or travel patterns. No reimbursement is required for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes."
