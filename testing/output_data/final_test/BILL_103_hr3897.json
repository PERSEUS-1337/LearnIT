    "content": "The Act titled \"Higher Education Accumulation Program Act of 1994\" establishes the Higher Education Accumulation Program (HEAP) Accounts for tax deductions on contributions. The Higher Education Accumulation Program Act of 1994 allows individuals to deduct cash contributions to a HEAP account for their child's educational expenses. The maximum deduction is $5,000 per child ($2,500 for married individuals filing separately) and not to exceed $15,000 ($7,500 for married individuals filing separately) in total. The deduction for contributions to a HEAP account cannot exceed the compensation included in the taxpayer's gross income. Only one HEAP account can be established for an individual, and no deduction is allowed after the beneficiary turns 18. A HEAP account is defined as a trust created in the US exclusively for educational purposes. A trust created in the US exclusively for educational expenses must meet specific requirements: contributions limited to $5,000 in cash per year, trustee must be a bank or approved person, no investment in life insurance contracts, and assets cannot be used for life insurance. The trust assets must not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund. Upon termination, the balance in the account is distributed to the beneficiary or can be treated as an individual retirement account. The term 'child' is defined by section 151(c)(3), and the 'termination date' is when the beneficiary reaches age 25. The term 'educational expenses' includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and a reasonable allowance for meals and lodging while attending an eligible educational institution. An eligible educational institution can be an institution of higher education or a vocational school. An institution of higher education is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, while a vocational school is defined in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. Any contribution made on account of the preceding taxable year must be done by the time prescribed for filing the return for that year. Distributions from a HEAP account are generally included in the beneficiary's gross income for the year received, unless used for educational expenses, in which case only a portion is included. The distribution of excess contributions to a HEAP account before the tax return due date is not subject to inclusion in the beneficiary's gross income. The tax treatment of excess contributions to a HEAP account includes the distribution of net income attributable to the excess contribution, which is included in the individual's gross income for the year the excess contribution was made. Additionally, a HEAP account is generally exempt from taxation unless it no longer qualifies as a HEAP account. The tax treatment of a HEAP account includes taxes imposed on unrelated business income. If prohibited transactions occur, the account will lose its exemption. The tax treatment of a HEAP account includes taxes imposed on unrelated business income. If prohibited transactions occur, the account will lose its exemption. In cases where an account ceases to be a HEAP account, all assets are treated as distributed. If the account is used as security for a loan, the portion used is considered distributed to the individual. Additional tax may apply on certain distributions. Additional Tax on Certain Distributions from a HEAP account includes a 10 percent tax liability if the payment is not used for educational expenses. In cases of distribution on termination, a 5 percent tax applies. However, these taxes do not apply in cases of disability or death of the account beneficiary. The tax implications for distributions from a HEAP account include a 10 percent tax if not used for educational expenses, and a 5 percent tax on termination distributions. However, these taxes do not apply in cases of disability or death of the account beneficiary. Community property laws are not considered in applying these rules, and custodial accounts are treated as trusts if certain conditions are met. The trustee of a HEAP account must report to the Secretary and the account beneficiary on contributions, distributions, and other matters as required by regulations. Deductions are allowed in arriving at adjusted gross income for retirement savings. Paragraph (7) of section 62(a) of the tax code is amended to include deductions for education and HEAP accounts.
