    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007\". Congress finds that alien smuggling is a transnational crime that violates US borders, compromises sovereignty, risks terrorist activity, and goes against the rule of law. Aggressive enforcement is necessary to protect borders and ensure national security, with recognition given to frontline defense agencies like the Border Patrol and Coast Guard. Alien smuggling is a security threat that requires statutory tools for law enforcement. It destabilizes border communities and existing penalties are inadequate. Existing alien smuggling laws are ineffective in addressing the actions of smugglers, transporters, recruiters, guides, and boat captains. Laws regarding failure to heave to are insufficient in punishing boat operators and crew involved in reckless transportation of aliens at sea. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is necessary to prosecute smuggling rings operating outside the US. Alien smuggling can involve dangerous conditions putting individuals at high risk of harm or death. The Secretary of Homeland Security will check alien smugglers and smuggled individuals against terrorist watch lists at U.S. borders. Additionally, there will be strengthened prosecution and punishment for alien smugglers.
