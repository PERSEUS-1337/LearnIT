    "content": "H.R. 3200, America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, was referred to multiple House Committees for consideration. Committees on Education and Labor, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce reported their versions of the bill. This report summarizes key provisions related to private health insurance in the Act. Division A of H.R. 3200 focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, providing financial assistance to certain individuals, and implementing mandates for individuals and employers to maintain health insurance coverage. Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be included, with acceptable coverage under a qualified health benefits plan. The bill focuses on reducing the number of uninsured and restructuring the private health insurance market. It includes market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. Acceptable coverage would be offered through a qualified health benefits plan, either through the Exchange or employer plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. Subsidies would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level through the Exchange. This report provides a background on the private insurance market and summarizes provisions in H.R. 3200 affecting private health insurance. The bill aims to reduce the number of uninsured and reform the market with measures like modified community rating and guaranteed issue. Premiums would only increase as allowed by statute, and plans covering specific services like dental or vision care would not be affected. Most provisions would be effective starting in 2013. H.R. 3200 includes provisions to alter private health insurance markets, focusing on individuals buying coverage directly or through small employers. Insurers would be required to cover pre-existing conditions and not exclude potential enrollees. However, there is concern that individuals may only enroll when sick, leading to coverage exclusions for pre-existing conditions. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) has agreed to reform pre-existing condition exclusions, but only if individuals are required to purchase coverage to prevent coverage that excludes pre-existing conditions. Adequate premium subsidies must be provided to make the individual mandate practical, which is necessary for market reforms. Premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies may result in individuals having health insurance they cannot afford to use. The private health insurance provisions in Division A of H.R. 3200 include an individual and employer mandate, private health insurance market reforms, and the Health Insurance Exchange with a public health insurance option. Removing any provision could hinder the implementation of the others. The Energy and Commerce Version of H.R. 3200 includes provisions for public health insurance option, premium and cost-sharing subsidies, abortion and medical malpractice regulations, utilization review and appeals processes, and end-of-life care. Americans can obtain health insurance through various methods such as employment-based coverage, private sector, or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fitting into one of three segments - the large group market, the small group market, and the nongroup market. Large employers, who make up more than 95% of large employers, are generally able to obtain lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool of enrollees. This allows them to offer large subsidies toward health insurance for their employees. Employers offer subsidies towards health insurance, making it attractive for both healthier and sicker workers to enter the risk pool. States have experimented with creating a single site for comparing insurance plans and pooling risk, with some models proving more sustainable than others. Private-sector companies also help individuals and small groups compare health insurance plans. Less than half of small employers provide health insurance. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to lack of economies of scale. Small pools are less stable, impacting risk pool with employee changes. Purchasing insurance through larger pools could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or higher premiums based on health status in nongroup market. Reforms affecting premium ratings are likely to occur. Reforms may impact premiums for different individuals based on age, health, and behaviors. States regulate private health insurance, with federal regulations mostly affecting employer-sponsored plans. HIPAA requires guaranteed issue coverage for small groups, and some states extend this to self-employed individuals. In the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating. Only two states use pure community rating in nongroup markets. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for other factors like age or gender. States have rules to reduce the period of pre-existing condition exclusions in health insurance. In the small group market, 21 states have stricter rules than federal standards. In the individual market, 42 states limit the exclusion period for non-HIPAA eligible enrollees. There is debate about offering a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform, with some seeing it as potentially more cost-effective than private options. Some proponents argue that a public health insurance plan could offer additional choice and increase competition by charging lower premiums. Opponents question if this would give the government an unfair advantage and drive private plans out of the market. H.R. 3200 includes a mandate for individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. Individuals who do not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage may be required to pay an additional tax, prorated based on their income. Some may receive subsidies to help with premiums and cost-sharing, while others may be exempt from the mandate. H.R. 3200 would require employers to provide full-time employees with a QHBP or pay into the Exchange, with exceptions. Employers include private-sector, government, and church entities. Employers could apply for a waiver from health coverage requirements for a two-year period. For those offering health insurance, specific rules would apply. Employers could offer coverage through an Exchange plan or employment-based coverage. Current health plans would be grandfathered for five years, with employers required to contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost qualified benefits plan. Employers would automatically enroll employees into the plan for individual coverage unless the employee opts out. Under the proposed legislation, employers with aggregate wages over $400,000 who do not offer coverage would face an 8% payroll assessment. Employees could opt for Exchange plans instead of employer-sponsored insurance. Employers with wages above $400,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages to the Exchange for employees. Small employers would have similar adjustments. The payroll assessment would not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. The Energy and Commerce Committee version included an amendment that changed limits for applying affordability credits in Exchange plans. Full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer would not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. Employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan would not have the employer's payroll assessment apply towards their premium. The Energy and Commerce Committee amendment changed limits for applying affordability credits in Exchange plans, affecting full-time employees' eligibility for premium or cost-sharing credits. The amendment did not alter the required employer payroll-assessment percentages for small businesses specified in sections 313 and 412 of the bill. Additionally, within 90 days of enactment, H.R. 3200 would establish a temporary reinsurance program with funding up to $10 billion to assist employment-based plans in providing health benefits to eligible retirees. The Secretary would reimburse employment-based plans for 80% of claims above $15,000 and below $90,000. Amounts paid would lower costs for participants but not for employers. The Education and Labor bill prohibits reducing retiree health benefits unless also done for active participants. Small businesses could get a 50% credit for coverage costs, phased out as employee compensation increases. The small business credit for coverage costs would be phased out as employee compensation increased from $20,000 to $40,000 and the number of employees increased from 10 to 25. The credit would not apply to employees with compensation exceeding $80,000 and would only be available to businesses with a tax liability. Non-profit organizations would be ineligible for this credit. H.R. 3200 would establish new federal health insurance standards, including prohibiting coverage exclusions for pre-existing health conditions. H.R. 3200 establishes new federal health insurance standards, including prohibiting exclusions for pre-existing health conditions, determining premiums using adjusted community rating rules, allowing premiums to vary based on age, premium rating areas, and family enrollment, and requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. The issuer must accept every applicant for health coverage under the requirement of \"guaranteed renewal.\" New non-discrimination standards and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers are imposed. H.R. 3200 also mandates coverage of certain benefits, limits cost-sharing on preventive services, and sets standards for the essential benefits package. Compliance with a medical loss ratio standard is required for Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs). Under the Education and Labor version, QHBPs would need to have a medical loss ratio of at least 85%. New individual policies issued in 2013 or later could only be offered as an Exchange plan. Existing group plans would have to meet QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies would be grandfathered as long as there are no changes to the coverage terms or conditions, with premiums only increasing according to statute. Pre-existing health conditions exclusions would be reduced from 12 months to 3 months for most individuals. The Energy and Commerce version of the bill shortens pre-existing health condition exclusions from 12 months to 3 months for most individuals. QHBPs would be required to cover an essential benefit package, limit cost-sharing, and ensure provider network adequacy. The package must be equivalent to employer-sponsored coverage as certified by the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The essential benefits package under the bill would cover hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, mental health services, preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, and well baby care for individuals under 21. The essential benefits package under the bill includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, mental health services, preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, well baby and child care, early screening, diagnostic and treatment services for individuals under 21. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments. The essential benefits package, specified by the Health Benefits Advisory Committee and HHS Secretary, covers 70% of health care claims. Plans in the Exchange can offer richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, or Premium-Plus. Employer plans can have cost-sharing levels less than those for the essential package. A Health Benefits Advisory Committee makes recommendations on coverage and benefits in the Exchange. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would develop cost-sharing structures for different plan tiers offered in the Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Secretary must adopt or reject the Committee's benefit standards within 45 days, providing reasons for the decision and allowing for revisions. Initial benefit standards must be adopted within 18 months of enactment. H.R. 3200 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange, similar to entities like the Massachusetts Connector and eHealthInsurance, would provide access to insurers' plans without being an insurer itself. It would also negotiate with plans, oversee requirements, and enforce regulations in coordination with state insurance. Under H.R. 3200, a federal Health Insurance Exchange would be established under a new independent federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, headed by a Commissioner. The Exchange's costs would be covered by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. Under the proposed legislation, a federal Health Insurance Exchange would be established, funded by various sources including taxes on individuals without coverage and penalties for non-compliant employers. States could operate their own Exchanges, funded through federal matching grants, with criteria set by the Commissioner. States with existing Exchanges could transition to state-based Exchanges, subject to meeting required standards. Additionally, states could opt to operate a \"single payer system\" with employer contributions and a single state entity managing coverage. The proposed legislation includes the establishment of a federal Health Insurance Exchange funded by taxes and penalties. States could operate their own Exchanges with federal matching grants. States could also opt for a \"single payer system\" with employer contributions managed by a single state entity. The Exchange would offer public health insurance options and income-based credits for certain individuals. Only 6 million workers are projected to enroll in employer coverage through the Exchange out of 162 million total enrollees in employer-sponsored coverage. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage starting in 2013. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage starting in 2013, unless they have employer-sponsored coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, DOD or VA benefits. Once enrolled in an Exchange plan, eligibility continues until they are no longer enrolled, with exceptions provided by the Commissioner. An open-enrollment period would be offered annually, lasting at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for certain circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers could meet the requirements of the employer mandate by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employers with 10 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible in 2013, and in 2014, employers with 20 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. Beginning in 2015, the eligibility criteria would change. In 2014, employers with 20 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. Beginning in 2015, the Commissioner could permit larger employers to participate in the Exchange; these additional employers could be phased in or made eligible based on the number of full-time employees or other considerations the Commissioner deems appropriate. In the Education and Labor version of H.R. 3200, in 2013, employers with 15 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2014, employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2015, employers with 50 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. Exchange plans would have to meet federal requirements of all private health insurance plans. Exchange-participating entities offering health insurance plans must meet federal requirements and standardize cost-sharing options into four tiers: Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans with varying levels of cost-sharing for essential benefits packages. The entity offering health insurance plans must meet federal requirements and standardize cost-sharing options into four tiers: Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans with varying levels of cost-sharing for essential benefits packages. Premium plans may also offer Premium-Plus plans with additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Plans must adhere to cost-sharing levels specified by the Secretary, with some flexibility to vary by up to 10%. State requirements for additional benefits beyond the essential package would apply to Exchange plans if the state reimburses the Commissioner for any resulting net increase in premium credits. Under H.R. 3200, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange. Eligible individuals could enroll in the public option and receive income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet Exchange plan requirements, offer Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and possibly Premium-Plus plans, and have geographically adjusted premiums. Limited start-up funding would be repaid within 10 years. Under the Energy and Commerce version of H.R. 3200, the public option would be prohibited from receiving federal funds if insolvent. The Secretary would establish payment rates for services and providers, with the authority to adjust rates based on payment reforms. Physicians in the public option can be preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians not allowed to balance-bill. Non-preferred physicians can balance-bill up to 115% of the established payment rate. Payments for outpatient prescription drugs would be based on negotiated rates. Physicians and other health care practitioners participating in both Medicare and the public option would receive a 5% payment increase for the first three years. The Secretary would establish rates to ensure payment accuracy, beneficiary access, and affordability. Rates could not increase overall medical costs beyond the adjusted Medicare level plus 5%. Under the Energy and Commerce version of H.R. 3200, the Secretary would negotiate payment rates with medical providers for the public option, ensuring rates are not lower than Medicare but not higher than average rates from other health benefit entities. Medicare-participating providers would also serve the public option unless they opt out through a process established by the Secretary. The Energy and Commerce version of H.R. 3200 includes a public notice and comment period. The Secretary can enter into no-risk contracts for the administration of the public option, similar to the Medicare program. Administrative functions would involve payment determination, beneficiary education, provider services, and establishing a prescription drug formulary. Additionally, a federal grant and loan program would assist in establishing health insurance cooperatives for coverage through the Exchange. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3200 may also qualify for cost-sharing subsidies. These subsidies would be available for Basic plans in 2013 and 2014, and for Enhanced or Premium plans starting in 2015. Exchange-eligible individuals must be lawfully present in a state to receive credits. Individuals eligible for premium credits in the Exchange must be lawfully present in a state in the United States, not enrolled in an Exchange plan through an employer, have a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), and be ineligible for Medicaid. The Exchange will determine Medicaid eligibility first and then provide a premium credit based on an affordable premium amount. The affordable premium amount for individuals is based on a percentage of their income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner will adjust percentages to maintain the government's share of premiums in each income tier. Premium credits are calculated based on the reference premium, which is the three lowest-priced Basic plans in the area. Enrollees receive an affordability premium credit if their premium exceeds the affordable amount. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on income tiers, with credits calculated monthly for those whose premium exceeds the affordable amount. Assistance would also be provided for cost-sharing, with reductions specified by the Commissioner to align with actuarial values. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits based on income tiers and provide assistance for cost-sharing. Estimates exist for the levels of cost-sharing, and insurers would receive additional payments to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. State laws regarding abortion coverage would not be preempted under H.R. 3200, and federal conscience protection laws would not be affected by the bill. The Energy and Commerce version of the bill would prevent discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. It would also restrict the recommendation of abortion-related standards in health plans. QHBPs could still cover abortions in certain cases where federal funds allow. The public option under the Energy and Commerce version of the bill would cover abortions in cases of rape, incest, physical danger to the woman's life, and where federal funds permit. Affordability credits cannot be used for elective abortions, and the Commissioner must estimate the cost of including elective abortion coverage in a basic plan. The Commissioner must estimate the costs of including elective abortion coverage in a basic plan, ensuring that at least one Exchange plan in each premium rating area provides coverage for elective abortions. If a plan covers elective abortions, it cannot use affordability credits to pay for them. The Energy and Commerce version of the bill prohibits Exchange plans from discriminating against healthcare providers regarding abortion services. States can receive incentive payments for implementing alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. The Secretary determines compliance based on the law's effectiveness in improving the medical liability system. The state law would require an \"early offer\" system or a \"certificate of merit\" program for medical malpractice suits, promoting fair resolution of disputes and access to affordable liability insurance. An early offer allows defendants to offer periodic payments within 180 days, raising standards if declined. A certificate of merit program mandates expert testimony to establish claim merit at filing. States can receive incentives for implementing compliant laws. The bill authorizes incentive payments for states to improve healthcare, but does not provide funds. QHBPs must offer end-of-life planning information and advance directives, but are prohibited from promoting suicide. The Energy and Commerce version includes utilization review processes. The Energy and Commerce version of the bill includes utilization review processes for QHBPs and QHBP-offering entities. This involves monitoring the use of coverage, clinical necessity, and efficiency of health care services, as well as providing notice of appeal rights for denied claims. Individuals have 180 days to file for a full and fair review, conducted by a physician or specialist not involved in the initial denial. The QHBP-offering entity must review and make a decision on denied claims, providing written notice of the outcome and appeal rights. An external appeals process must be available for decisions based on medical necessity, experimental treatments, or missed internal review deadlines. The external review standards for denied claims include fair determinations, consideration of medical needs, review of plan language, and evidence from internal reviews and healthcare professionals. Plans must authorize benefits promptly if a denial is reversed or modified. External appeals entities must be independent and their decisions binding on the plan, with non-compliance leading to civil money penalties."
