    "content": "The U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) includes State-State and investor-State dispute settlement procedures, following U.S. FTA practice. Investor-State dispute settlement aims to provide a stable resolution for investment disputes and de-politicize them. The KORUS FTA includes provisions for dispute settlement, aiming to de-politicize investment disputes and resolve them without State Department involvement. The agreement also incorporates labor and environmental obligations with State-State dispute settlement provisions. The KORUS FTA dispute settlement is limited by the obligations of the agreement, including exceptions from WTO agreements. The KORUS FTA incorporates obligations from GATS for trade in goods and services, including an \"essential security\" exception. State-State dispute settlement panels are rarely used due to informal dispute resolution mechanisms. Resorting to panels may encourage early settlement of disputes. The WTO dispute settlement process can provide leverage for settlement at an early stage of a dispute. South Korea and the United States have initiated multiple disputes against each other since 1995, with trade remedy issues being a significant aspect. South Korea has brought 15 complaints against WTO Members, with nine disputes against the US, mainly involving antidumping or countervailing duties. The US, on the other hand, has initiated 100 WTO disputes, with six involving South Korea. The United States has initiated 100 WTO disputes, with six involving South Korea. U.S. complaints challenge restrictive Korean trade requirements on agricultural products and alcoholic beverages, including beef imports. Investor-State claims are prevalent under NAFTA, with cases against the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The U.S. State Department lists 17 claims, mostly by Canadian investors. Additionally, five investor-State cases have been filed under DR-CAFTA, with cases against the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and other parties. DR-CAFTA cases have been brought against the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala by U.S. investors. One pending claim under the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement by Renco Group. Investor-State claims have not been filed under other U.S. FTAs. The United States has BITs and FTAs with developing countries, importing capital rather than exporting it. There is potential for investor-State disputes, especially with South Korea, which imports capital to a greater degree. The extent of disputes involving Korean investors under U.S. investment agreements remains uncertain. The U.S. has been successful in all investor-State cases so far. Dispute settlement procedures in U.S. free trade agreements follow the WTO pattern, including consultations, dispute panels, implementation periods, and remedies for non-compliance. State-State dispute settlement in the KORUS FTA is outlined in Chapter Twenty-Two, Section B. Dispute settlement under the KORUS FTA involves consultations and may escalate to dispute panels if not resolved within 60 days of the initial request. Dispute resolution under the KORUS FTA involves escalating to the U.S.-South Korea Joint Committee if not resolved within 60 days, with the option to refer to a dispute settlement panel if necessary. The KORUS FTA establishes a settlement panel consisting of three members, with each party appointing one panelist. If a party fails to appoint a panelist, one will be selected by lot from a roster of panelists. Peremptory challenges can be made if a panelist is not on the contingent list. If the parties cannot agree on a chair within 28 days, one will be chosen by lot from the contingent list. The KORUS FTA establishes a settlement panel with model rules of procedure ensuring a right to hearings, public access, submission of written documents, and consideration of amicus briefs from NGOs. The panel must present its initial report within 180 days. The panel established under the KORUS FTA must present its initial report within 180 days, containing findings of facts, determinations on compliance with obligations, and any requested determinations. The report must include reasons for findings and determinations, and may also include recommendations for resolving the dispute. The final report is due 45 days after the initial report, to be made public within 15 days. The panel under the KORUS FTA must present its initial report within 180 days, based on relevant provisions and arguments. The report should be in accordance with international law rules of interpretation. Once the final report is received, the Parties should agree on a resolution, usually following the panel's findings and recommendations. If a Party is found in violation of its obligations, the resolution should address this issue. The defending Party must eliminate any violation, nullification, or impairment of benefits. This could involve withdrawing or modifying laws, regulations, or practices. Compensation, suspension of benefits, and monetary assessments can be temporary measures. Dispute settlement results under trade agreements are non-self-executing in U.S. law, requiring legislation for compliance. If a resolution cannot be reached within 45 days after receiving the final report, the defending Party must take action. After receiving the final report, the defending Party must negotiate compensation with the complainant. If no agreement is reached within 30 days, the complaining Party can suspend benefits, such as imposing tariff surcharges. The defending Party can request further panel proceedings or pay a monetary assessment if they believe the proposed retaliation is excessive. If the defending Party believes the proposed retaliation is excessive, they can request further panel proceedings. The complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the determined level of retaliation unless the defending Party complies or agrees to pay a fine. The disputing Parties must consult on the amount of the fine. The disputing Parties must consult on the amount of the fine, which will be set at 50% of the level of benefits determined by the panel or 50% of the amount proposed by the complaining Party if no panel determination. The fine is to be paid in equal quarterly installments, unless the Joint Committee decides to use it for trade initiatives. The defending Party has the right to a compliance determination by a panel before sanctions are imposed or fines are paid. The panel must issue its report within 90 days of the defending Party's request. If the panel rules in favor of the defending Party, any trade retaliation must be terminated, and the defending Party is no longer obligated to pay any monetary assessment. The KORUS FTA incorporates principles from the May 10, 2007 trade agreement, adding labor and environmental obligations. Disputes under Chapter Nineteen are subject to State-State dispute settlement procedures, with compliance determined by a panel before any fines are paid. If the panel rules in favor of the defending Party, trade retaliation must cease, and no monetary assessment is required. The KORUS FTA requires each Party to enforce labor laws effectively, including fundamental labor rights from the 1998 ILO Declaration. These rights include freedom of association, collective bargaining, elimination of forced labor, abolition of child labor, and non-discrimination in employment. The KORUS FTA includes provisions on enforcing labor laws effectively, specifically focusing on fundamental labor rights from the 1998 ILO Declaration. It prohibits derogation from these rights in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties. The KORUS FTA requires labor issues to be resolved through consultation provisions before invoking dispute settlement. If consultations fail, the Labor Affairs Council can assist. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days, the complaining Party can seek assistance from the U.S.-Korea Joint Committee. Unlike previous FTAs, the prevailing Party in a KORUS FTA dispute is not limited to seeking monetary payment. The KORUS FTA allows for fines up to $15 million annually for non-compliance with labor obligations. The prevailing Party can impose trade sanctions if the defending Party fails to pay the fine. The KORUS FTA allows for fines up to $15 million annually for non-compliance with labor obligations. The prevailing Party can impose trade sanctions if the defending Party fails to pay the fine. In addition, the agreement's environment chapter requires each Party to effectively enforce its environmental laws affecting trade or investment. The KORUS FTA includes provisions for enforcing environmental laws affecting trade or investment between the Parties. It requires each Party to adopt, maintain, and implement laws to fulfill obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. Disputes under this chapter must first be resolved through consultation provisions before resorting to general dispute settlement procedures. In case of a dispute under the chapter, either Party can request assistance from the Environmental Affairs Council, a KORUS FTA entity. If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days, the complaining Party can seek consultations or a meeting of the U.S.-Korea Joint Committee. If a dispute panel is convened, it must consider compliance with KORUS FTA environmental obligations, especially if it involves a covered multilateral environmental agreement. The KORUS FTA dispute settlement procedures allow the prevailing party to impose fines on the defending party for non-compliance, with fines capped at $15 million annually. If the defending party does not pay the fine, the prevailing party may impose sanctions. The KORUS FTA dispute settlement procedures allow the prevailing party to impose trade sanctions on the non-complying party based on the value of the dispute. If trade sanctions are proposed, the defending party can choose to pay an annual monetary assessment or contribute to a fund for compliance. Disputes related to motor vehicles may be settled under Annex 22-A of the KORUS FTA. Annex 22-A of the KORUS FTA provides specific dispute settlement procedures, including panels determining the impact on originating goods, shorter deadlines, and the option for tariff increases on motor vehicles as a remedial measure. These procedures are set to terminate after 10 years unless a violation or nullification of the agreement occurs. The KORUS FTA Annex 22-B outlines dispute settlement procedures, including referral to the Joint Committee and panel selection within shorter timeframes. Panels consist of representatives from South Korea, the United States, and a neutral chairperson. The rules of procedure and panel selection process differ from Chapter Twenty-Two rules, with a focus on resolving disputes efficiently. The KORUS FTA Annex 22-B outlines dispute settlement procedures, with panels consisting of representatives from South Korea, the United States, and a neutral chairperson. The panel must determine if there is a violation or nullification of benefits and whether the challenged measure has materially affected the sale of originating goods. The panel process is expedited, with the initial report due within 120 days, written comments within 7 days, and the final report within 21 days. The KORUS FTA Annex 22-B outlines dispute settlement procedures with expedited panel process. The final report is due within 21 days after the initial report. Adverse panel determinations may lead to increased customs duty on passenger motor cars to prevailing most-favored-nation rates. Increased duties can remain until compliance is achieved. The United States and South Korea exchanged letters on motor vehicle tariffs, safety standards, and transparency, referring to it as an \"understanding\" under the KORUS FTA. They agreed to apply dispute settlement provisions and Annex 22-B with necessary changes. The United States and South Korea exchanged letters under the KORUS FTA, clarifying dispute settlement provisions and prohibiting private rights of action for non-conformance with FTA obligations. Implementing legislation would also restrict challenges to U.S. actions by non-U.S. entities. The KORUS FTA investment chapter, similar to other U.S. investment agreements, includes provisions for investor-State dispute settlement through binding arbitration. It aims to facilitate investment between the United States and South Korea by providing rights and obligations for nationals of both countries. Key elements involve coverage of all forms of investment, national and most-favored-nation treatment for foreign investors, and a minimum standard of treatment. The KORUS FTA investment chapter includes provisions for investor-State dispute settlement through binding arbitration. It grants foreign investments a minimum standard of treatment, compensation for expropriation, free transfer of investment-related funds, and refrains from imposing certain performance requirements. Chapter Eleven obligations have specific exceptions and annexes pertaining to specific matters.

Claims can involve federal, state, and local measures subject to the agreement. Investors can initiate arbitral proceedings if the other Party breaches investment obligations, resulting in loss or damage. Investors under the KORUS FTA can file claims for breach of investment obligations, resulting in loss or damage. Dispute settlement can be invoked for financial services institutions in the US and South Korea. The agreement does not cover actions to enforce general laws like competition laws. Investment agreement grants rights to covered investments or investors for natural resources, public services, and infrastructure projects. Must wait 90 days before arbitration claim submission. The investment agreement allows investors to claim arbitration rights after waiting 90 days and meeting a six-month deadline. A statute of limitations of three years applies, and the KORUS FTA permits investor claims against the US and South Korea. Investors can submit Chapter Eleven claims against the US and South Korea through various arbitral mechanisms without exhausting local remedies. Both countries are Parties to the ICSID Convention. Once a claim is filed, a three-member arbitral tribunal will be appointed. Chapter Eleven allows investors to file claims against the US and South Korea through arbitral mechanisms. A three-member tribunal is established, with each party appointing an arbitrator and the presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement. The Secretary-General of ICSID appoints arbitrators if needed. Rules for arbitration conduct, transparency, and efficiency are outlined in Chapter Eleven. Amicus submissions may be considered by tribunals. Tribunals in arbitral proceedings can accept amicus submissions from non-disputing parties and must rule promptly on any preliminary objections raised by the defending Party. Claims with common elements can be consolidated, and documents and tribunal decisions are made public. Public hearings are also conducted in cases involving alleged breaches. In cases involving alleged breaches of a KORUS FTA obligation, the tribunal must decide in accordance with the agreement and international law. The U.S.-Korea Joint Committee's interpretation of a provision is binding on the tribunal, which can only make monetary awards such as damages or restitution. The tribunal may also award costs and attorneys' fees. The tribunal may award costs and attorneys' fees, but not punitive damages. An arbitral award is only binding between the disputing parties and for the specific case. A prevailing investor must wait 90 or 120 days before seeking enforcement of the final award. If the defending Party does not comply, the investor can request a compliance panel under the KORUS FTA State-State dispute settlement chapter. The prevailing investor can also seek judicial enforcement of the award under the ICSID Convention or the New York Convention on the Recognition. The arbitral award can be enforced under the ICSID Convention or the New York Convention, which are multilateral conventions recognized by the United States and South Korea."
