    "content": "The Act is titled the \"San Francisco Old Mint Commemorative Coin Act\" and includes findings. The San Francisco Old Mint played a crucial role in the nation's history by converting miners' gold into coins. Designed by architect A.B. Mullett, it survived the 1906 earthquake and fire, serving as the only operational financial institution and treasury for disaster relief funds in San Francisco. Coins minted there are distinguished by the \"S\" Mint Mark. The San Francisco Old Mint, known for its rare coins like the 1870-S $3 coin valued over $1,000,000, will have the first commemorative coin to honor a mint. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury shall mint $5 gold coins and $1 silver coins in commemoration of the San Francisco Old Mint. The $5 coins will weigh 8.359 grams, have a diameter of .850 inches, and contain 90% gold. The $1 coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver.
