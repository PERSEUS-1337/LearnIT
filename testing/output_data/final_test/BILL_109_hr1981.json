    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Adult Day Care Services Act of 2005\". Congress finds that adult day care services provide essential support to seniors and their caregivers, helping to keep seniors in their family homes. A significant number of workers provide elder care, and the number of households involved in caregiving is expected to increase. The pool of potential family caregivers, primarily women, provides an estimated $257 billion in \"free\" services annually. Caregiving families have lower incomes, with caregivers losing $659,139 in wages and benefits over a lifetime. The loss in productivity in US businesses due to caregivers ranges from $11 billion to $29 billion annually. Adult day care centers nationwide offer quality health options for the elderly population. The aging baby boomer generation will increase the need for health options for the elderly population. SEC. 3. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF SUBSTITUTE ADULT DAY CARE SERVICES.

An adult day care facility must meet specific standards set by the Secretary to ensure quality care and safety for individuals receiving services. The Secretary has the authority to waive the surety bond requirement if a comparable bond is provided under State law.
