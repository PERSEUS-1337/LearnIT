The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark evaluates models on diverse NLU tasks, favoring those with general linguistic knowledge. Multi-task training outperforms separate models per task, but there is a need for improved general NLU systems. The need for improved general NLU systems is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of developing models with a broader understanding of language. The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark offers a collection of NLU tasks for model evaluation and comparison, focusing on tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, and textual entailment. GLUE does not restrict model architecture, but requires the ability to process single-sentence and sentence-pair inputs for making predictions. GLUE benchmark evaluates models on various NLU tasks using single-sentence and sentence-pair inputs. Training data availability varies across tasks, favoring models that can efficiently learn and transfer knowledge. Datasets in GLUE are not newly created but chosen for their difficulty and interest. Some datasets have privately-held test data to ensure fair benchmarking. The GLUE benchmark evaluates models on NLU tasks using single-sentence and sentence-pair inputs. Test sets with private labels are used. Experiments show that multi-task trained models slightly outperform single-task models. The best model utilizes ELMo BID2 pre-training but still achieves a low score. Baseline models handle lexical signals well but struggle with logical structure. The suite includes nine NLU tasks with an online evaluation platform based on private test data. The evaluation platform and leaderboard are based on privately-held test data and can evaluate any method capable of producing results on all nine tasks. Collobert et al. (2011) used a multi-task model for sentence representation learning. Recent work has focused on sentence-to-vector encoders and leveraging unlabeled data for developing general NLU systems. Recent work in natural language understanding (NLU) has focused on leveraging unlabeled and labeled data to develop models for tasks such as machine translation, question answering, and natural language inference. Evaluation practices like SentEval and GLUE assess the performance of models on classification tasks involving sentences, with SentEval specifically evaluating sentence-to-vector encoders. GLUE is designed to support methods that require cross-sentence contextualization and alignment for optimal performance. GLUE diverges from SentEval in evaluation tasks, aiming for diversity and difficulty. McCann et al. (2018) introduce decaNLP, scoring NLP systems on multiple datasets with question answering tasks. GLUE focuses on unifying all NLU under question answering, unlike SentEval. It includes nine English sentence understanding tasks of varying domains and difficulties to spur development of generalizable NLU systems. The GLUE benchmark aims to unify NLU tasks, including tasks like CoLA for English sentence acceptability judgments. The tasks are evaluated on accuracy and balanced across classes. The GLUE benchmark evaluates NLU tasks like CoLA for English sentence acceptability judgments. It uses Matthews correlation as the evaluation metric, with a range from -1 to 1. The test set includes SST-2 for sentiment prediction and MRPC for paraphrase detection. The Quora Question Pairs 2 dataset contains question pairs from Quora, aiming to determine semantic equivalence. The class distribution is imbalanced (63% negative). The Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark involves sentence pairs annotated with similarity scores. MNLI evaluates NLU tasks across various genres. The MNLI dataset consists of sentence pairs with entailment annotations from various sources. It includes a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence to predict entailment, contradiction, or neutrality. The dataset is evaluated using Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. The QNLI dataset is a question-answering dataset with question-paragraph pairs. The QNLI dataset is a question-answering dataset that consists of question-paragraph pairs. The task involves determining whether the context sentence contains the answer to the question, with a focus on sentence pair classification and filtering out pairs with low lexical overlap. This modified version of the original task removes the requirement for the model to select the exact answer and challenges the assumption that the answer is always present in the input. The QNLI dataset, derived from RTE and WNLI datasets, involves question-answering and reading comprehension tasks. RTE datasets are from textual entailment challenges, while WNLI is a reading comprehension task with manually constructed examples. The datasets are converted to a two-class split for consistency. The task involves converting a problem into sentence pair classification by replacing ambiguous pronouns with possible referents to predict if the sentence is entailed by the original. An evaluation set with new examples from fiction books is used, and the test set is imbalanced between classes. The GLUE benchmark evaluates models on various tasks, including the converted dataset WNLI, which has an imbalanced test set and adversarial development set. Results are uploaded to gluebenchmark.com for scoring, with per-task scores and a macro-average determining a system's leaderboard position. The website provides detailed results on the diagnostic dataset, inspired by previous competitions. A small test set is included for system performance analysis, focusing on specific phenomena. Each diagnostic example in the NLI task is tagged with demonstrated phenomena. The NLI task evaluates skills in sentence understanding, including resolving syntactic ambiguity and pragmatic reasoning. Data diversity is ensured by using examples from various linguistic phenomena and natural sentences from different domains. The annotation process involves editing sentences to demonstrate target phenomena, similar to the FraCaS suite. The NLI task evaluates sentence understanding skills by creating sentence pairs with high lexical and structural overlap, labeling them as entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Evaluation is done using a three-class generalization of the Matthews correlation coefficient. The study audits crowdsourced data for artifacts and trains classifiers to predict entailment labels. Human baseline performance is established with high interannotator agreement. The diagnostic examples in Section 5 are hand-picked to address specific phenomena in NLI, but performance on them may not reflect overall performance in downstream applications. The analysis set is meant for comparing models, not categories, and serves as a tool for error analysis and model comparison. Baselines include a multi-task learning model trained on GLUE tasks and variants based on recent pre-training methods, implemented in the AllenNLP library. More details can be found in Appendix B. The baseline architecture for sentence-to-vector encoders is available on GitHub. It uses a two-layer BiLSTM with max pooling and GloVe word embeddings. For single-sentence tasks, the sentence is encoded and passed to a classifier. For sentence-pair tasks, sentences are encoded independently and passed to a classifier. An MLP with a 512D hidden layer is used as the classifier. A variant of the model includes an attention mechanism for sentence pair tasks. The model architecture includes a BiLSTM with max pooling and GloVe word embeddings. It incorporates ELMo and CoVe pre-training methods. Training involves using Adam optimizer with a batch size of 128 and stopping criteria based on validation performance. The model architecture includes a BiLSTM with max pooling and GloVe word embeddings, incorporating ELMo and CoVe pre-training methods. Training uses Adam optimizer with a batch size of 128 and stops when the learning rate drops below 10^-5 or after 5 validation checks. Single-task models are trained without tuning parameters for fair comparison with multi-task models. Various sentence-to-vector encoder models are evaluated, including CBoW, Skip-Thought, InferSent, DisSent, and GenSen BID11, with task-specific classifiers trained on their representations. The study compares the performance of single-task and multi-task models using attention or ELMo embeddings. Multi-task training generally outperforms single-task training, with ELMo embeddings showing consistent improvement over GloVe or CoVe. Among pre-trained sentence representation models, GenSen performs the best, followed by InferSent. Overall, using ELMo and multi-task training leads to better results in various benchmark tasks. The study compares the performance of single-task and multi-task models using attention or ELMo embeddings. GenSen outperforms all but the two best models. Sentence representation models underperform on CoLA compared to models trained directly on the task. Models trained directly on STS-B lag behind the best sentence representation model. No model performs well on tasks like WNLI and RTE, indicating current models are not capable of solving GLUE. Overall, performance is low for all models in various categories. Multi-task models are consistently outperformed by single-task models, likely due to destructive interference. Models trained on GLUE tasks generally outperform pretrained sentence representation models. Attention has a greater impact on diagnostic scores compared to ELMo or CoVe, indicating its importance for generalization in NLI. Fine-grained subcategories show that most models handle universal quantification well. Subcategories Most models handle universal quantification well, with lexical cues like \"all\" aiding performance. Double negation poses challenges for GLUE-trained models using GloVe embeddings, improved by ELMo and CoVe. Attention has mixed effects, particularly struggling with downward monotonicity. Models are sensitive to hypernym/hyponym substitution and word deletion but often predict entailment in the wrong direction. This aligns with recent findings on subsequence relations in NLI systems. GLUE is a platform for evaluating natural language understanding models. McCoy & Linzen (2019) found that models use the subsequence relation between premise and hypothesis as a heuristic shortcut. Restrictivity examples, especially those involving quantifier scope, are challenging for most models. Attention mechanisms may improve performance on out-of-domain data, but increased representational capacity can lead to overfitting. Transfer methods like ELMo and CoVe encode specific linguistic information. The platform and diagnostic dataset aim to help model designers understand generalization behavior and implicit knowledge. GLUE is a platform for evaluating natural language understanding models. Models trained jointly on tasks show better performance than those trained separately. Attention mechanisms and transfer learning methods like ELMo improve NLU systems. However, models still struggle with linguistic phenomena. GLUE aims to address the challenge of designing general-purpose NLU models. The text discusses converting datasets into NLI format using a similarity metric based on CBoW representations with pre-trained GloVe embeddings. It mentions the implementation of an attention mechanism for computing matrix H and obtaining attention weights \u03b1 i. This approach is related to previous work on textual entailment and argues that many NLP tasks can be reduced to textual entailment. The text describes the process of training models with a BiLSTM sentence encoder and post-attention BiLSTMs shared across tasks. It also mentions using a classifier trained separately for each task, with tasks sampled for training based on the number of training examples. The models are trained using Adam with specific parameters, and the validation metric used is the macro-average score over all tasks. The validation metric used is the macro-average score over all tasks, with a validation check every 10k updates. The learning rate is divided by 5 when validation performance does not improve, and training stops when the learning rate drops below 10^-5 or performance does not improve after 5 validation checks. Various sentence representation models are evaluated, including CBoW, BiLSTM with max-pooling, and GenSen BID11. Task-specific classifiers are trained on top of frozen sentence encoders. The GLUE website limits users to two submissions per day to prevent overfitting. Best development set results achieved by baselines are presented. GLUE's online platform is built using React, Redux, and TypeScript, with Google Firebase for data storage. Diagnostic dataset statistics by coarse-grained category are shown in Table 7. The dataset allows for analyzing various levels of natural language understanding. The dataset provided on the GLUE website allows for analyzing different levels of natural language understanding, categorized into Lexical Semantics, Predicate-Argument Structure, Logic, and Knowledge. These categories are further divided into fine-grained subcategories to understand linguistic phenomena and entailment. The dataset serves as an analysis tool rather than a benchmark, based on issues identified by linguists in the study of syntax and semantics. The dataset provided on the GLUE website allows for analyzing different levels of natural language understanding, categorized into Lexical Semantics, Predicate-Argument Structure, Logic, and Knowledge. It serves as an analysis tool to highlight phenomena that a model may or may not capture, and to develop adversarial examples. Lexical entailment can be applied at both the sentence and word level, focusing on aspects of word meaning. Lexical entailment involves the relationship between words where one word entails another, such as \"dog\" entails \"animal\" and contradicts \"cat\". This connection is explored in natural logic systems and often involves monotonicity in language. Morphological negation is a special case where one word is derived from another, like \"affordable\" to \"unaffordable\". Factivity is also considered in these examples. Factivity propositions in a sentence can have different entailment relations with the sentence as a whole, determined by lexical triggers like verbs or adverbs. For example, \"I recognize that X\" entails \"X\", while \"I believe that X\" does not entail \"X\". Constructions like \"I recognize that X\" are called factive, as the entailment persists even under negation, while constructions like \"I am refusing to do X\" are called implicative and are sensitive to negation. Factivity propositions in a sentence can have different entailment relations with the sentence as a whole, determined by lexical triggers like verbs or adverbs. Some propositions are implicative and sensitive to negation, while others entail the existence of an entity mentioned in the sentence. Intensional readings deal with properties denoted by a description rather than the set of entities that match the description. These phenomena are categorized under Factivity and Lexical Semantics. Symmetry/Collectivity in Lexical Semantics deals with propositions denoting symmetric relations and the ability to collect arguments into the subject. Redundancy in sentences occurs when a word can be removed without changing the meaning, reflecting an understanding of lexical and sentential semantics. Named Entities refer to words naming entities in the world, with various aspects to understand about them. The curr_chunk discusses the semantics of names and logical quantification in natural language, focusing on lexical items and the interchangeability of quantifiers. It emphasizes understanding the meaning of sentences through lexical semantics. The curr_chunk addresses syntactic ambiguity in English, focusing on relative clauses, coordination scope, and prepositional phrase attachment. It also discusses core arguments in relation to verbs selecting specific subjects and objects. The curr_chunk discusses core arguments in English, including ergative alternation and rearrangements of core arguments. It also mentions syntactic alternations such as Active/Passive, Genitives/Partitives, Nominalization, and Datives. The curr_chunk discusses ellipsis and implicits in text, where arguments of verbs are omitted and the reader fills in the gap. It provides examples of entailment and contradiction in sentences. Coreference and anaphora are closely related phenomena where multiple expressions refer to the same entity or event. Pronouns like \"she\" or \"it\" are examples of anaphors that are co-referent with their antecedents. Coreference can also occur between definite noun phrases or with words like \"other\" that require an antecedent for clarification. This category includes cases where there is an explicit phrase co-referent with another phrase. Intersectivity in modifiers, like adjectives, can be intersective or non-intersective. Intersective modifiers entail properties that intersect, while non-intersective modifiers do not. For example, \"old men\" is intersective as it refers to entities with both properties, while \"fake surgeon\" is non-intersective. Intersectivity is related to Factivity and is often formalized using set intersection. Intersectivity in modifiers can be intersective or non-intersective. Restrictivity refers to a property of noun modifiers, with restrictive modifiers identifying entities and non-restrictive modifiers adding extra details. Examples illustrate the distinction between the two types. The development of mathematical logic was guided by questions about natural language meaning, from Aristotelian syllogisms to Fregean symbols. Propositional logic operations like negation, double negation, conjunction, disjunction, and conditionals are present in natural language."
