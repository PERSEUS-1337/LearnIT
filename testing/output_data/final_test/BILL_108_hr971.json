The \"Small Savers Relief Act of 2003\" excludes interest received by individuals from gross income. The aggregate exclusion amount is limited to $100 ($200 for joint returns) per taxable year. Interest includes interest on deposits with banks and amounts paid by various savings institutions. The curr_chunk discusses the types of interest that are excluded from gross income, including interest on insured deposits, evidences of indebtedness issued by domestic corporations, and obligations of the United States or its subdivisions. The curr_chunk explains special rules regarding interest exclusion from gross income, including distributions from regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts. Interest properly allocable to a beneficiary under specific sections is also deemed received. The curr_chunk discusses rules for interest exclusion from gross income for nonresident alien individuals, specifying conditions under which subsection (a) applies for tax purposes. Chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item after section 115. Section 116 excludes interest received by individuals aged 65 or older from gross income. Amendments are made to sections 265(a)(2), 584(c), and 643(a) of the Code to reflect this exclusion. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph (8) in section 643(a) and adding a new subsection in section 854 for the treatment of dividends as interest under section 116. The Internal Revenue Code amendments include treating dividends as interest for regulated investment companies based on income percentages. Deductions are applied to reduce gross income and interest received. Shareholders are notified of distributions that can be considered as interest. The exclusion under section 116 limits interest designated by the company in a notice to shareholders. Definitions clarify that gross income excludes stock or securities gains, and aggregate interest received includes specific interest types. Section 857(c) is amended to impose limitations on dividends received from Real Estate Investment Trusts, denying deductions under section 243. For tax purposes, dividends received from a real estate investment trust meeting certain requirements are not considered as dividends. Such dividends may be treated as interest if they meet specific criteria, including the trust's gross income being at least 75 percent interest. The portion of a dividend that does not qualify as interest may be treated as interest based on specific criteria. Gross income and aggregate interest received are adjusted by deductions allowable by section 163, with certain limitations. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, and include provisions related to aggregate interest received and notice to shareholders regarding distributions by real estate investment trusts. SEC. 3 increases the minimum amount of interest required to be reported from $10 to $100 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
