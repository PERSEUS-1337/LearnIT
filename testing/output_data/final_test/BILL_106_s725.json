    "content": "The \"Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1999\" aims to preserve, sustain, and restore coral reef ecosystems by supporting conservation programs, providing financial resources, and establishing a mechanism for collecting donations from the private sector. The \"Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1999\" defines key terms such as Administrator, Coral, and Coral reef to encompass various species and habitats associated with coral reefs. The \"Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1999\" defines key terms related to corals and coral products, conservation methods, and the preservation of coral reefs in maritime areas under US jurisdiction. The \"Coral Reef Conservation Act of 1999\" defines activities related to resource management, habitat monitoring, law enforcement, conflict resolution, and community outreach for coral reef conservation. The Act also defines terms like \"organization\" as a non-profit promoting coral reef conservation and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Commerce. The Coral Reef Conservation Program is established under SEC. 4. The Secretary provides grants for coral conservation projects with matching requirements for federal funds not exceeding 50% of total project costs, which can be waived for projects under $25,000 or deemed unreasonable by the Administrator. The Administrator may waive the matching requirement if no reasonable means are available for the applicant to meet it and the project's benefits outweigh the public interest in the requirement. Eligible entities can submit coral conservation proposals, and the Administrator will ensure funding for grants prioritizes geographic and biological diversity. Funding for grants under this section must be distributed as follows: 40% for coral conservation projects in the Pacific Ocean, 40% for projects in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea, and the remaining funds for emerging priorities or threats identified by the Administrator. Project proposals must include the responsible individual or entity's name. The project proposal must include a statement of purposes, qualifications of individuals, estimated funds and time, support from government representatives, matching funding information, alignment with criteria, and any other necessary information for funding eligibility. The Administrator reviews final coral conservation project proposals to determine if they meet criteria. Within 3 months of receiving a proposal, the Administrator requests comments from relevant government agencies for approval or disapproval. The Administrator reviews coral conservation project proposals for approval based on jurisdiction, regional peer review for projects over $25,000, written comments consideration, and notification of approval or disapproval to relevant parties. The Administrator may approve final project proposals that enhance coral reef conservation by implementing programs for sustainable development, addressing conflicts near coral reefs, enhancing compliance with laws, and developing scientific information. The Administrator may consult with the Coral Reef Task Force to obtain guidance in establishing coral conservation projects, including developing scientific information, promoting cooperative conservation projects, and increasing public awareness. Grantees must provide periodic reports for project evaluation. Within 90 days of enacting this Act, the Administrator will establish guidelines for implementing coral conservation project priorities in consultation with regional and local entities. SEC. 5. CORAL REEF CONSERVATION FUND. The Administrator may enter into an agreement with an organization to receive, hold, and administer funds for supporting partnerships between the public and private sectors. The organization can also solicit donations to further the purposes of this title and maintain the funds in a separate interest-bearing account. The Administrator can transfer funds to an organization for a grant program review. The organization can use the funds for matching contributions from private and government entities. The Administrator can provide emergency grants to State, local, or territorial agencies for unforeseen coral reef-related disasters. Authorization of appropriations is also granted. Authorization of appropriations is granted for grants under section 4 and emergency assistance under section 6. The Secretary is authorized $3,800,000 for each fiscal year 2000-2002 for grants and $200,000 for emergency assistance. Up to 5% of the funds can be used for administration. Only amounts appropriated for this purpose are subject to the requirements."
