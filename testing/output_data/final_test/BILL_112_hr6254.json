    "content": "The Act titled \"Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2012\" focuses on the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to define the term 'Administrator' as the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 'deficient dam' as a dam that the State identifies as deficient. The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to define a 'publicly-owned dam' as a dam owned by State, local, municipal, or tribal governments, including those owned by nonprofit organizations established by these entities. The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to include a program for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams owned by State, local, municipal, or tribal governments. This includes providing public benefits such as flood control districts, public water utilities, and irrigation districts. Rehabilitation refers to the repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to include a program for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams owned by State, local, municipal, or tribal governments. This involves providing public benefits such as flood control districts, public water utilities, and irrigation districts. Rehabilitation includes repair, replacement, reconstruction, or removal of a dam to meet State dam safety standards. The Administrator will establish a program within FEMA to provide grant assistance to States for rehabilitating publicly-owned deficient dams. States interested in grants can submit applications meeting specified requirements. Grants may be awarded for the rehabilitation of deficient dams to States. The Administrator will provide grant assistance to States for rehabilitating publicly-owned deficient dams. States can submit applications for grants, and the Administrator will enter into project grant agreements with the States. The agreements will include terms for the grant and project, as well as assurances for maintenance of the dam. The Administrator will develop a risk-based priority system for identifying deficient dams eligible for grants. Funds allocated for a fiscal year will be used for this purpose. Funds allocated under subsection (h)(1) for grants to States are divided equally among applying States and based on the proportion of non-Federal publicly-owned dams identified as a danger to human health within each State. None of the funds provided can be used for other purposes. The funds provided under this section cannot be used for rehabilitating Federal dams, routine maintenance, hydroelectric power modifications, increasing water storage capacity, or any other modifications that do not improve dam safety. The Federal share of rehabilitation costs for deficient dams cannot exceed 65%. States receiving grants must require contractual obligations for grant recipients. The grant recipient must award contracts and subcontracts for various services in the same manner as contracts for architectural and engineering services under specific regulations. Contracts awarded in this way do not give the United States a proprietary interest. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these purposes. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2013-2017 include $10,000,000, $15,000,000, $25,000,000, $50,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively. An additional $400,000 is allocated for FEMA staff employment each year from 2013 to 2017. Amounts allocated under this section remain available until expended. The Administrator of FEMA must issue a proposed rule within 90 days and a final rule within 120 days after the enactment of the Act regarding the amendments to the National Dam Safety Program Act."
