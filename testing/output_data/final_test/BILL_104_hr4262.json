    "content": "The \"Child Passenger Protection Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings of the Act are also included. The Congress finds that annually in the United States, motor vehicle collisions result in over 800 deaths and 80,000 injuries to children under 4 years old. Properly used child restraints can significantly reduce the risk of serious or fatal injuries in these collisions. However, common seating designs in vehicles make secure installation of child restraints challenging, leading to a high percentage of improperly installed or misused restraints. There is a need to expand child restraint education programs to address the challenges of installing and misusing child restraints due to the complexity of seat belt and restraint designs. Child passenger education programs are being expanded to address challenges with installing and misusing child restraints. The Secretary may provide funding to State highway offices and child passenger safety organizations for child restraint education programs aimed at preventing injuries to children up to age 4. Programs include educating the public on proper installation of child restraints and selecting appropriate designs. The funding provided by the Secretary supports child restraint education programs for children up to age 4. This includes educating on proper installation and design selection, harness threading, and adjustment. Professionals and educators are trained in all aspects of child restraint use. Funds must be distributed with 25% for nationwide programs, 25% for state programs, and at least 50% for new national, state, and local programs. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS AND REPORTS.
