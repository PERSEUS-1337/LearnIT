    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined. The Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund Act aims to support economic opportunity and political progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina by creating an enterprise fund for small and medium-sized enterprises. Congress recognizes the importance of preventing economic challenges from overshadowing stability and reconciliation efforts since the end of the Bosnian War in 1995. Unemployment rates exceeding 40% have led to widespread frustration and protests in the country. Economic progress hinges on the growth of small and medium-sized businesses. The private sector credit-to-GDP ratio in Bosnia and Herzegovina has stagnated at around 65 percent since 2008, significantly lower than advanced economies. Bank lending has only grown slightly by 1 percent annually. International financial institutions and foreign-owned investment funds have mainly supported larger companies and infrastructure projects, neglecting SMEs. Bosnia and Herzegovina's demographic, income, and geographic characteristics are conducive to SME growth. The country has a population of nearly 4 million people with a growing per capita income. It imports around $10 billion worth of goods annually, presenting an opportunity for domestic SME production. Congress enacted the SEED Act and the FREEDOM Support Act to support the private sector in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The FREEDOM Support Act authorized $1.2 billion for USAID to establish 10 Enterprise Funds, which channeled $10 billion into 500 enterprises, leveraged $6.9 billion in private investment, created/sustained 300,000 jobs. Establishing an enterprise fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina in partnership with the people would sustain economic reform efforts, empower entrepreneurs, and improve financial institutions. Enterprise funds in other European countries have proven beneficial to their economies. Establishing an enterprise fund for Herzegovina would improve financial institutions, provide investment vehicles for SMEs, and attract domestic and international investors. The Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund aims to improve financial institutions, offer investment opportunities for SMEs, and attract investors. The Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund aims to promote the private sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina through various measures such as loans, equity investments, and technical assistance to strengthen the private sector, encourage good corporate governance, and foster competition. The Bosnia and Herzegovina-American Enterprise Fund aims to foster competition, improve productivity in businesses, strengthen local capital markets, promote security through job creation, and create a middle class in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
