    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that current law only allows airlines that qualify as \"a citizen of the United States\" to provide service between cities in the United States or on international routes. The law requires that an airline be under the actual control of U.S. citizens to qualify. The Civil Aeronautics Board previously interpreted the law as requiring U.S. interests to be in actual control of all airline operations. Congress passed an amendment in 2003 to ensure airlines are under the actual control of U.S. citizens, following the policies set by the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Department of Transportation. The Department seeks to increase foreign control of US airlines by changing rules on \"actual control\", requiring US citizens to make decisions on airline commitments but not control voting stock. The Department's proposal to redefine \"actual control\" for US airlines would not require US citizens to control economic decisions like city selection, fares, and fleet size, contrary to Congress's intent. This change would impact long-standing policies that currently define \"actual control\" as overseeing all airline operations, not just certain aspects like safety and security. The Department's proposal to redefine \"actual control\" for US airlines goes against Congress's intent and long-standing policies. Any major change in the definition should be done through the legislative process, not unilaterally by the executive branch. An \"open skies\" agreement between the US and Europe is crucial for market access and benefits both parties. SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON CERTAIN ACTIONS. The Secretary of Transportation is prohibited from making any decisions or changes related to airline control definitions for one year after the enactment of the Act. Any final rule issued during this period will be considered a major rule for congressional review. The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing the impact of proposed rules on allowing greater foreign participation in US airlines. The report will evaluate consequences on national defense, competition, growth of international air services, US aviation industry, and access to aviation services for US citizens, especially those in rural areas. The Department will analyze the potential effects of proposed rules allowing foreign owners to gain control of US airlines through supermajority voting or agreements, considering national defense, competition, access to domestic aviation services, and statutory requirements. The Department will analyze how to ensure US citizens maintain control over airline matters if foreign interests are allowed to control day-to-day operations, market strategy, and fleet management. The proposed rules would apply a new interpretation of \"actual control\" only when a foreign country grants permission. The Department will analyze how to ensure US citizens maintain control over airline matters if foreign interests are allowed to control day-to-day operations, market strategy, and fleet management. The proposed rules would apply only in cases where a foreign country grants reciprocal access to investments in their carriers. The analysis includes how to define \"actual control\" based on foreign country policies, define \"reciprocal access\", ensure US citizens have access to invest in foreign airlines, and determine if control by US interests over economic decisions of foreign airlines is required. The proposed rules aim to ensure US citizens maintain control over airline matters if foreign interests control operations. The analysis includes reviewing the source of foreign capital, effects on US airline employees, and notification of interested parties regarding foreign control of US airlines."
