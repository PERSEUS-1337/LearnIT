In this section, an eligible entity is defined as a State or nonprofit organization eligible for a grant. An Indian tribe is defined differently for Alaska and other states. Private forest land is defined as land that is owned privately. The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative is a program established by the Forest Service to provide assistance for land suitable for growing trees, owned by private entities or Indian tribes. The Secretary of Agriculture oversees this initiative. The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative aims to assist eligible entities in identifying and preserving private forest land to contain suburban sprawl. The Secretary, in consultation with State officials, establishes criteria for identifying private forest land and eligible entities for preservation under this program. The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Initiative aims to assist eligible entities in preserving private forest land affected by suburban sprawl. Grants are awarded to carry out projects to prevent the conversion of private forest land to nonforest use. The initiative aims to assist eligible entities in preserving private forest land affected by suburban sprawl through projects that provide guaranteed public access unless waived by the State planning office. The initiative assists eligible entities in preserving private forest land affected by suburban sprawl through projects that provide public access unless waived. Entities seeking grants must submit an application to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary awards grants to applicants or disapproves applications with reasons provided. Priority is given to projects promoting private forest preservation. The primary purposes of preserving private forest land and containing suburban sprawl include active sustainable management, community and school education programs on sustainable forestry, and community involvement in forest resource management. The Federal share of project costs under grants awarded for these purposes shall not exceed half. The grant awarded under this section shall not exceed half of the total project cost. An eligible entity must provide assurances of securing the non-Federal share of the project cost. The non-Federal share can be in cash or in kind. Grant funds cannot be used for purchasing land or easements. Title to private forest land or an interest in private forest land purchased under this section may be held as determined appropriate by the Secretary. Purchases of private forest land must be from willing sellers at fair market value, with sales at less than fair market value permitted only if certified by the landowner as willingly entered into without coercion. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and necessary sums for each fiscal year thereafter."
