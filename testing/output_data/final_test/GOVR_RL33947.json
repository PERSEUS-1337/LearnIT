    "content": "The federal government influences state juvenile justice systems through agencies and grant programs established by the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974. This legislation created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and the State Formula Grants Program, which have been modified over the years to broaden their mandates and add to the grant programs. The report analyzes federal legislation impacting state juvenile justice systems, focusing on the JJDPA. Key concerns for Congress include expanding or modifying core mandates, effectiveness of grant programs, oversight of funding use, federal coordination, and the focus on rehabilitation or accountability in juvenile justice. The history of juvenile justice in the United States dates back to the establishment of the first juvenile court in 1899 in Cook County, Illinois. This marked a shift towards focusing on rehabilitating young offenders rather than solely punishing them. The federal government also began to play a role in shaping state juvenile justice systems through legislation like the JJDPA. The federal government started influencing state juvenile justice systems in the 1960s and 1970s through legislation like the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act. Congress provided funds for research projects and training for juvenile justice personnel. States had to designate a lead agency to improve delinquency prevention programs to receive funding. Grant authority was placed under the Department of Justice in 1968. In response to the increasing juvenile violent crime rates, Congress passed the JJDPA in 1974, creating grant programs and establishing the OJJDP within the DOJ to manage federal response to juvenile delinquency. In the 1980s, states passed more punitive laws for juvenile offenders, removing certain crimes from juvenile court and instituting mandatory sentences. This trend continued in the 1990s with states modifying juvenile court confidentiality agreements, easing transfer to adult criminal system, and expanding sentencing options. In the 1980s and 1990s, states passed laws expanding sentencing options for juveniles, incorporating more punitive measures into federal funding streams for juvenile justice programs. The early American criminal justice system did not have a separate juvenile justice system, treating juveniles who committed major crimes as adults based on their age. The first juvenile court in the United States was established in Chicago in 1899, based on the British doctrine of parens patriae. This doctrine allowed the state to provide protection and treatment for children in need of care or supervision. The Juvenile Court of Chicago, established in 1899, became the model for state juvenile justice systems. Key features included defining juveniles as under 16, separating them from adults in institutions, and providing probation officers for monitoring. The system focused on the welfare of the child and aimed to transform delinquent children into productive citizens through treatment. The early juvenile justice systems focused on the welfare of the child, with juvenile courts considering both legal and extra-legal factors in decision-making. Procedural due process protections for adult criminal defendants were not incorporated, and judges had discretion in handling cases informally to best serve the child's interests. Attorneys were not always essential, and judges' dispositions were part of a treatment plan for the juvenile. In 1914, the Chicago Boy's Court established diversion, halting formal criminal proceedings for juvenile offenders to provide treatment outside the juvenile justice system. Juveniles were released to community service agencies for evaluation, and if satisfactory, discharged without a formal record. By 1930, only the federal government treated juvenile offenders as adults, prompting the U.S. Attorney General to recommend changes. The U.S. Attorney General recommended that juveniles charged with federal crimes be returned to their home state's juvenile justice system, a proposal supported by Congress. The federal government's involvement in juvenile delinquency began in 1909 with a conference on dependent children, leading to the creation of the U.S. Children's Bureau in 1912. This bureau investigated child welfare, including the juvenile justice system, and in 1936 started providing federal subsidies for at-risk youth, including juvenile delinquents. The Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act of 1938 (FJDA) allowed for federal juvenile proceedings if both parties agreed to it. In 1951, Congress amended the FJDA with the Federal Youth Corrections Act, providing special rehabilitation outcomes for juvenile offenders tried as adults in the federal system. The FJDA remained essentially unchanged for 35 years until major Juvenile Justice reform measures were passed in the 1970s. Additionally, in 1951, the Juvenile Delinquency Bureau was established within HEW. The Juvenile Delinquency Bureau was established within HEW in 1951, reflecting a focus on treatment and prevention rather than punishment. In the 1960s, concerns arose about the effectiveness of juvenile courts in rehabilitating delinquents, leading to Supreme Court rulings for more formal procedures to protect juveniles' legal rights. The landmark ruling of this period was In re Gault. In re Gault ruling in the 1960s mandated legal rights for juveniles in hearings, including notice, counsel, questioning witnesses, and protection from self-incrimination. Congress responded with the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act of 1961, providing grants for projects to prevent and control juvenile crime in urban areas with high delinquency rates. In 1968, Congress passed the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act, providing grant funding for training juvenile court personnel. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act also involved the Department of Justice in juvenile justice for the first time through the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), which channeled federal funding to state and local law enforcement agencies. By the early 1970s, consensus began to form around improving juvenile justice initiatives. In the early 1970s, concerns arose about the federal government's ineffective and underfunded juvenile justice efforts. The House Committee criticized the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1968 for delays, inefficiencies, and mismanagement of funds. Only a fraction of the authorized $150 million was appropriated, with half of that amount left unspent on unrelated projects. Program administration weaknesses and misallocation of funds were highlighted. In the early 1970s, concerns arose about ineffective federal juvenile justice efforts due to program administration weaknesses, dominance of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and inadequate funding. Congress sought to create a new federal entity to oversee juvenile justice efforts, leading to the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act in 1974. The Act was reauthorized in 2002 but its main provisions expired in FY2007 and FY2008. Momentum grew for reform in the juvenile justice system by 1974. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 aimed to prevent juvenile delinquency, deinstitutionalize youth, and keep juvenile offenders separate from adults. It established federal institutions, grant programs for states, and core mandates for eligibility. The Act has been amended over the years but maintains these three components. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 focused on preventing juvenile delinquency and rehabilitating offenders. Subsequent revisions emphasized expanding sanctions and accountability measures. The latest reauthorization consolidated grant programs and modified core mandates. OJJDP was established within DOJ to influence states' juvenile justice efforts. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 established OJJDP within DOJ to coordinate federal efforts in juvenile justice. The Administrator of OJJDP has broad authority to develop plans and oversee programs for juvenile offenders, focusing on prevention, diversion, training, treatment, and research. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 established the lead individual in the U.S. federal government responsible for developing policies on juvenile offenders and coordinating federal juvenile delinquency programs through the Coordinating Council. The Coordinating Council oversees federal programs for juvenile delinquency, unaccompanied minors, and missing/exploited children. It includes heads of various federal agencies and additional members appointed by the President, Speaker of the House, and others. The Coordinating Council for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention consists of nine members appointed by different officials, serving one to three-year terms. The Council coordinates federal government policies and priorities for programs related to juvenile delinquency and unaccompanied minors, reporting to Congress on program operations and fund usage. The Attorney General serves as Chairman, and the OJJDP Administrator as Vice Chairman. The Coordinating Council for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention oversees federal policies on juvenile delinquency and unaccompanied minors. It reviews federal agencies' practices for detaining juveniles and makes recommendations for improvement. Congress requires OJJDP to produce an annual report summarizing data on juvenile detention, funded activities, state compliance, and program effectiveness in reducing delinquency and violent crime among juveniles. The JJDPA authorizes OJJDP to provide formula grants to states for juvenile delinquency programs and justice systems. The grant program, although modified over the years, remains a core component of federal influence on state juvenile justice. Funds are allocated based on the state's population under 18, with minimum amounts set by the JJDPA. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the allocation. The JJDPA authorizes formula grants for state juvenile justice programs, with funds allocated based on the state's population under 18. States must create juvenile justice plans, adhere to funding constraints, and meet core mandates to receive funding. Administrative expenses must be matched by state or local funds. States receiving formula grant funding for juvenile justice programs must submit a plan to OJJDP. Failure to do so or if the plan does not meet requirements can result in funding being allocated to local agencies. Required components include designating an agency to oversee the plan, consulting with local government, establishing an advisory group, and analyzing juvenile delinquency issues. The JJDPA requires states to address delinquency issues, provide gender-specific and mental health services, and allocate funding to local agencies. Funding distribution must align with the state's plan and prioritize units of local government, including Indian tribes and private agencies. Funding for juvenile justice programs must be distributed equitably throughout the state, with at least 75% of funds used for various programs such as community-based alternatives to incarceration, counseling, mentoring, and delinquency prevention. Other programs include addressing child abuse, expanding probation offices, and helping juveniles with learning disabilities and language barriers. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act funds programs to help juveniles and families overcome language barriers, deter gang involvement, prevent substance abuse, promote positive youth development, strengthen families, provide mental health services, and develop post-adjudication restraints. States must adhere to core requirements to receive funding. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act sets core mandates for states to receive formula grant funding, including the Deinstitutionalization of status offences (DSO) and requirements for juvenile detention facilities and staff. Juveniles may be held in jails or lockups for up to six hours before being released, transferred to a juvenile facility, or appearing in court. In rural areas, juveniles can be held for up to 48 hours in adult facilities. States must implement programs to reduce the disproportionate number of minorities in the juvenile justice system or face funding reductions. The state faces a 20% funding reduction for noncompliance with mandates, must allocate 50% of funds to achieve compliance, and can receive grants for juvenile delinquency prevention projects. The Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program consolidates grant programs and authorizes necessary funds through FY2007. The Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program consolidates grant programs and authorizes necessary funds through FY2007 for a wide array of services, treatments, and interventions for juvenile offenders and at-risk juveniles, including projects providing treatment, services, and educational support. The Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program funds projects to address school violence, vandalism, and juvenile delinquency through coordinated policies, mental health services, probation officer programs, counseling, training, mentoring, community-based services, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and postsecondary education scholarships for low-income juveniles in high-crime areas. The Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program funds projects to prevent juveniles from joining criminal gangs. Grant funding is based on the state's population under 18. States must assure that only 5% of the grant will be used for administrative costs. No appropriations have been made for this grant program yet. The Challenge Grants program, authorized by the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, allows OJJDP to provide discretionary grants for innovative initiatives to prevent juvenile delinquency. The program replaced the Demonstration Programs grant and expired in FY2007. The Title V grant program under the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention authorizes OJJDP to provide discretionary grants to states for delinquency prevention programs for juveniles in contact with the justice system. The program is currently unauthorized but has received appropriations. The Title V Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention program, although unauthorized, continues to receive appropriations. Activities funded through the program include alcohol and substance abuse prevention, educational programs, child and adolescent health services, recreational programs, leadership programs, job training, and other evidence-based prevention programs. Priority is given to programs that promote service coordination, collaboration with other grant recipients, private sector involvement, and state-wide subsidy programs. The JJDPA includes grant programs for delinquency prevention activities at the state and local levels. Local government entities must comply with state plan requirements and submit a comprehensive plan to receive funding. Grants are disbursed by the state with a 50% match requirement. The JJDPA includes various grant programs for juvenile delinquency prevention, such as the State Formula Grant program, Delinquency Prevention Block Grant program, Challenge Grant program, and Title V Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention program. These programs provide funding for a range of prevention purposes, with different levels of discretion in administration. Notably, the Delinquency Prevention Block Grant has not been funded since its inception. The Delinquency Prevention Block Grant has not been funded since its inception. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program, created in 1998, falls outside the scope of the JJDPA but is a significant component of federal juvenile justice efforts. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program, created in 1998, allows the Attorney General to provide grants to states and local governments to strengthen their juvenile justice systems and promote accountability. The program focuses on holding juveniles accountable for their actions and shifting towards punishment rather than rehabilitation. States must implement graduated sanctions to be eligible for funding. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program, established in 1998, provides grants to states and local governments to enhance their juvenile justice systems. It includes funding for various accountability-based measures such as implementing graduated sanctions, building juvenile facilities, and hiring court officers. The program was last authorized in 2006 and is currently unauthorized, but funding has been requested annually by the Administration. The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program supports various initiatives to improve the juvenile justice system, including hiring and training court officers, establishing drug and gun courts, implementing risk assessments for early interventions, and promoting restorative justice programs. Grants are awarded to states to fund these efforts. The JABG program awards grants to states and local governments for implementing activities with grant funding, assessing program effectiveness, and implementing graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders. Graduated sanctions ensure escalating intensity for delinquent offenses and flexibility in tailoring sanctions and services to individual juveniles. The JABG program awards grants to states and local governments for implementing activities with grant funding, assessing program effectiveness, and implementing graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders. States must require each juvenile court to submit an annual report on the implementation of graduated sanctions. Eligible states and units of local government must establish an advisory board to recommend a coordinated enforcement plan for the use of JABG funds. The JABG program allocates funds to states and local governments based on population ratios. States must establish an advisory board with various members to oversee the use of funds. At least 75% of the funds received by states must be passed along to local government units. The JABG program requires states to consult with local governments regarding expenditures and pass along funding based on juvenile justice costs and violent crimes ratios. The Attorney General can make grants directly to qualified local governments if states do not qualify for funding, reserving up to 75% of the state's allocation for this purpose. The Attorney General can use the average amount allocated by states to local governments as the basis for awarding funds to qualified units of local government under the JABG program. Only 5% of the total amount awarded can be used for administrative costs. Funds cannot be used to replace existing funding but must increase funding for state juvenile justice systems. The federal share of activities funded through a JABG grant cannot exceed 90%, except for construction of juvenile court or detention facilities where it cannot exceed 50%. Congress may consider reauthorizing the JJDPA and JABG as their major provisions expired in FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009. Congress may consider reauthorizing funding for juvenile justice programs, facing issues around the federal role in the states' juvenile justice system, response to juvenile violence and crime, and rehabilitation vs. accountability for juvenile offenders. The grant programs' effectiveness in supporting juvenile justice efforts is also under scrutiny. The juvenile justice system has shifted towards holding juveniles more accountable for their actions, moving away from a focus on rehabilitation. This trend was evident in the 1990s when many states enacted laws to make their juvenile justice systems more punitive. The federal juvenile justice system swings between rehabilitation and accountability, with a focus on teaching juveniles responsibility through punishment. Congress may need to decide whether to prioritize rehabilitation, accountability, or a combination of both. The JABG program, which expired in FY2009, favored accountability. The federal government influences states' juvenile justice systems through core mandates for JJDPA state formula grant funding, using grants as incentives for changes in how juvenile offenders are treated. Congress may need to consider modifying or expanding these core mandates. Expanding core mandates for JJDPA state formula grant funding could be effective in improving detention standards for juvenile offenders. However, opponents argue that the disproportionate minority contact mandate has been ineffective. Policy options for expanding mandates could include requiring evidence-based delinquency prevention programs. The JJDPA mandates states to reduce minority contact in juvenile justice, expand programs for female juveniles, and implement mental health screening. There is a disparity between the legislation and grant program structure, with some programs being consolidated into the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant. The current disconnect between authorization and appropriation for grant programs poses challenges for OJJDP. Reconciling differences between old and new funding mechanisms may not be the best use of staff time. States and local governments may face challenges in applying for funding due to disparities. Congress must decide on the implementation of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant. The current grant programs within the JJDPA may need to be modified or broken up to better reflect appropriation. The State Formula Grant and Delinquency Prevention Block Grant programs overlap in purpose areas such as counseling, mentoring, after school programs, and substance abuse prevention. The Delinquency Prevention Block Grant, Challenge Grants, and Title V Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs allow OJJDP to fund additional programs. Congress may need to address the overlap in juvenile justice grant programs. Policy options include targeting funding for specific activities, consolidating grant programs, or creating new tailored grant programs for activities like gang-prevention, restorative justice, mentoring, and mental health treatment. The limited federal resources in the juvenile justice arena have decreased over the years, leading to a potential issue for Congress on whether existing grant programs are adequate, need modification, or if new programs should be enacted. The Administrator of OJJDP coordinates federal programs for juvenile offenders and delinquency prevention, including prevention, diversion, training, and rehabilitation. The federal government focuses on prevention, diversion, training, treatment, rehabilitation, evaluation, research, and improvement of states' juvenile justice systems. The Coordinating Council helps agencies better coordinate efforts. Overlapping federal programs offer services for juveniles, leading to duplication of efforts and funding opportunities, such as youth violence prevention. The federal government has various programs addressing youth violence prevention, but there are concerns about coordination between departments. Questions have been raised about the oversight of federal juvenile justice grant programs, including accountability of grantees, adequacy of regulations, and monitoring compliance. Some doubt the effectiveness of the metrics in place for monitoring states' compliance with the core mandates of the JJDPA, particularly the \"disproportionate minority contact\" requirement. The \"disproportionate minority contact\" (DMC) requirement is seen as the most challenging mandate in juvenile justice systems. States must implement prevention programs to reduce the overrepresentation of minorities without specific quotas. There are calls to strengthen the DMC mandate by requiring measurable progress in reducing racial disparities. Policymakers may consider additional oversight if the mandate is not enforced adequately by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) of 1974 may need to be amended to ensure states' compliance with core requirements for receiving funding. Concerns have been raised about OJJDP's enforcement of the DMC mandate and transparency in reporting non-compliance. Policymakers may debate changes to the act to address these issues. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) was first passed in 1974 and reauthorized in 2002. It established federal institutions, grant programs for states, and core mandates for juvenile justice. The focus was on preventing delinquency and rehabilitating offenders. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) established federal institutions and programs to coordinate juvenile delinquency efforts. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) was created within the Department of Justice to oversee federal juvenile justice initiatives. The act empowered the Administrator of the LEAA to coordinate government-wide juvenile justice efforts. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act endowed the Administrator with powers to oversee federal juvenile delinquency programs and coordinate all related activities. The Administrator was tasked with implementing policies, developing objectives, and presenting annual reports to Congress on OJJDP's activities. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act established the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to coordinate federal programs. The Council includes representatives from various federal agencies with decision-making authority. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act established the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to coordinate federal programs. The Council includes representatives from various federal agencies with decision-making authority. Additionally, the act created an Advisory Committee composed of 21 individuals appointed by the President to serve in an advisory capacity, with expertise in juvenile delinquency prevention, juvenile justice administration, or community-based programs. Members were to meet at least four times a year without compensation, with at least one-third being younger than 26. The Advisory Committee, part of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, makes recommendations to the OJJDP Administrator on juvenile delinquency programs. The National Institute coordinates data collection, research, and training for juvenile justice practitioners. The National Institute was given power to request data from federal agencies for its mission. The JJDPA created grant programs to help states improve their juvenile justice systems and prevent delinquency, including a program for runaway youth. The formula grant program aimed to improve juvenile justice systems by providing funding based on state populations under 18. States had to submit plans to receive funding, create juvenile justice entities, and allocate two-thirds to local programs. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) mandated that 75% of state funds be used for advanced techniques in preventing juvenile delinquency and providing community-based alternatives to detention facilities. States were also required to avoid placing status offenders in detention and ensure juveniles were not in facilities with regular adult contact. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act authorized grants for delinquency prevention and treatment programs, community-based alternatives, diversion programs, improved services for delinquents and at-risk youth, and programs to keep students in school. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act established a grant program for innovative youth development and delinquency prevention. Grants could be awarded to government agencies and nonprofits for one year. The Juvenile Justice Amendments of 1980 streamlined the juvenile justice system within the DOJ. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) made significant changes within the DOJ. It gave OJJDP more independence by having the Administrator report directly to the Attorney General. The act also mandated the removal of juveniles from adult jails to receive funding. Additionally, the focus shifted towards sanctions for serious juvenile crimes. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) made changes to the DOJ, focusing on sentencing for juveniles and enhancing the juvenile court system. It allowed OJJDP to use 7.5% of its funds for delinquency efforts and added key officials to the Coordinating Council. The act also required the Advisory Committee to include individuals under 24 years old. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act required states to stop detaining juveniles in adult jails, with exceptions for serious crimes. Failure to comply within five years would result in funding termination unless substantial compliance was achieved. Compliance included removing juveniles from adult facilities. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act required states to remove juveniles from adult jails and lockups, with substantial compliance defined as removing at least 75% of juveniles and committing to full compliance within two years. The act also expanded the Prevention and Treatment Programs Grant to include programs aimed at removing juveniles from adult facilities and allocated funding to specific territories. The Juvenile Justice, Runaway Youth, and Missing Children's Act Amendments of 1984 reauthorized the JJDPA through FY1988 and elevated OJJDP to a stand-alone office within DOJ. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1988 made significant changes, including expanding the Prevention and Treatment Programs Grant program. This program allocated 15% to 25% of funding for state grants and allowed for various purposes such as community-based alternatives to detention, advocacy activities, strengthening families, and youth employment programs. Private nonprofit agencies were to receive at least 30% of the funding. The Amendments to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1988 required OJJDP to publish an annual comprehensive plan and report on juvenile justice trends, including offenses, custody rates, state compliance, and efforts to reduce minority youth confinement. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1988 amended funding allocations for states, included technical assistance in grant programs, and established a new grant program for gang prevention and treatment programs. The act aimed to reduce juvenile gang membership through various purpose areas and grant opportunities. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 reauthorized the JJDPA through FY1996 and elevated disproportionate minority confinement to core mandate status. States not in compliance within three years would lose funding eligibility, while those in \"substantial compliance\" would receive funding for two more years. New grant programs were created for community-based gang intervention, state challenge activities, juvenile victims of child abuse, and mentoring. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 reauthorized the JJDPA through FY1996 and added a new Title V for the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Program. It also modified the Coordinating Council composition and established various grant programs, including the Community Based Gang Intervention Grant. Members of the Coordinating Council were appointed without regard to political affiliation. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 reauthorized the JJDPA through FY1996 and added a new grant program, the Gang-Free Schools and Communities Grant, as well as the Community-Based Gang Intervention Grant. The grants aimed to reduce juvenile gang participation through community engagement, funding coordination mechanisms, accountability measures like graduated sanctions, and various prevention efforts. Funding was also allocated for interventions such as probation, mediation, restitution, community service, intensive supervision, electronic monitoring, and boot camps. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 reauthorized the JJDPA through FY1996 and introduced new grant programs aimed at reducing juvenile gang participation through community engagement and prevention efforts. One of the new programs, the State Challenge Activities Grant, allowed for funding towards treatment for juvenile gang members, substance abuse prevention, and services to prevent juveniles from re-entering the juvenile justice system due to gang-related activities. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 introduced new grant programs aimed at reducing juvenile gang participation and providing treatment for juvenile offenders who are victims of child abuse and neglect. This included developing programs to prohibit gender bias in the juvenile justice system and increasing aftercare services for juveniles coming out of placement. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 introduced new grant programs for juvenile mentoring and military-style boot camps to support at-risk youth, discourage drug use and violence, and promote community service. Funding could not be used to compensate mentors directly or support litigation. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments Act of 1992 introduced military-style boot camps for at-risk youth in up to 10 states, providing discipline, physical training, education, and counseling. States had to offer post-release supervision and after-care services. Additionally, the act created Incentive Grants for local delinquency prevention programs, funding services like recreation, tutoring, job skills, mental health, and substance abuse support. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act of 2002 reauthorized OJJDP and made revisions to the JJDPA, consolidating grant programs and amending state plans. States had to provide a 50% match for grants and comply with Title II mandates to receive funding. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act of 2002 amended the state plans section of the JJDPA and modified the disproportionate minority confinement core mandate provision. The revision directed states to address disproportionate minority confinement without needing to meet numerical quotas for funding. It also mandated certification and training for individuals working with juveniles in detention facilities and added stipulations to state plans, such as notifying public agencies within 24 hours of a child's apprehension for a status offense and allocating up to 5% of formula grant funding for incentive grants to reduce probation officer case loads. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act of 2002 amended the state plans section of the JJDPA and modified the disproportionate minority confinement core mandate provision. States were required to incorporate child protective services records into juvenile case files and ensure child welfare records are available to the court. Failure to comply would result in a 20% reduction in formula grant funding for each mandate not met. States had to spend 50% of funding on achieving compliance unless substantial compliance was achieved. The act also eliminated grant programs within Title II of the JJDPA. The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act of 2002 amended the state plans section of the JJDPA and modified the disproportionate minority confinement core mandate provision. It required states to incorporate child protective services records into juvenile case files and ensure child welfare records are available to the court. Failure to comply would result in a 20% reduction in formula grant funding for each mandate not met. The act also eliminated grant programs within Title II of the JJDPA, replacing them with a Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Block Grant aimed at funding programs that reduce juvenile delinquency."
