    "content": "Reforming or limiting itemized tax deductions for individuals is being considered by policymakers to increase federal tax revenue, simplify the tax code, and reduce incentives for inefficient economic behavior. Analysis of tax filer data informs discussions on this topic, with a focus on who claims itemized deductions, what they claim them for, and the amount claimed. Additionally, the report presents the revenue loss associated with larger deductions using data from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Individual income tax filers can claim either a standard deduction or itemized deductions on their federal income tax. Itemized deductions require reporting each item separately and providing documentation for IRS audits. The deduction amount, whether standard or itemized, is subtracted from adjusted gross income to determine taxable income. Adjusted gross income (AGI) is used to determine taxable income before itemized deductions and personal exemptions. Itemized deductions are only beneficial for individuals with deductions exceeding the standard deduction. Some deductions have minimum threshold amounts based on a percentage of AGI to simplify tax compliance. For example, medical expenses must be at least 10% of AGI to be eligible for an itemized deduction. Itemized deductions have a floor and some are subject to caps to limit benefits. For example, the deduction for home mortgage interest is capped at the first $1 million of mortgage debt. Public tax data from the IRS is used to analyze trends among itemizers. Itemized deductions are designed to target specific groups and are often discussed in tax policy. Analysis of data on itemized deductions can inform discussions over reforming tax provisions. The report aims to identify who claims these deductions, how much they claim, and for which provisions. In 2014, 30% of tax filers chose to itemize deductions instead of claiming the standard deduction. This data could be relevant to the 115th Congress, which has shown interest in reforming or limiting itemized tax deductions for individuals. Some reasons for reform include increasing federal tax revenue, shifting the tax burden to higher-income filers, simplifying the tax code, and reducing incentives for inefficient economic behavior. In 2014, 30% of tax filers chose to itemize deductions instead of claiming the standard deduction. Higher-income individuals were more likely to itemize deductions compared to lower-income individuals. For taxpayers with an AGI greater than $200,000, the share that itemized ranged from 91% to 93%, with average sum of itemized deductions claimed per itemizer ranging from $43,131 to $424,864. In 2014, higher-income tax filers were more likely to itemize deductions, with an average of $25,598 in deductions claimed for AGI between $100,000 and $200,000. Five percent of tax filers with AGI less than $20,000 also chose to itemize, claiming an average of $15,857 in deductions. The majority of itemizers had incomes less than $100,000, and 86.8% had an AGI less than $200,000. Itemizers with AGI greater than $100,000 accounted for 63.6% of total itemized deduction claims. Tax filers with AGI over $1 million claimed 13.1% of all itemized deductions in 2014, while those with AGI between $500,000 and $1 million claimed 5.3%. In contrast, filers with AGI between $50,000 and $100,000 claimed 23.5% of deductions. Different income ranges led to varying frequencies of specific itemized deductions. Tax filers in different income ranges claimed specific itemized deductions at varying frequencies in 2014. Higher-income tax filers claimed deductions for charitable gifts, state and local income taxes, and real estate property taxes more often than lower-income tax filers. For example, the deduction for charitable gifts was claimed by 37% of tax filers with an AGI between $50,000 and $100,000, 68% of tax filers with an AGI between $100,000 and $200,000, and over 86% of tax filers in income ranges over $200,000. Fewer tax filers with an AGI over $1 million claimed the home mortgage interest deduction compared to those in the $100,000-$1 million income groups, possibly due to the ability to pay for home purchases with cash. In 2014, few tax filers claimed deductions for extraordinary medical and dental expenses, especially at higher income levels. The 10% of AGI floor limited eligibility for this deduction. The mortgage interest deduction was the largest claimed by tax filers with an AGI less than $500,000, aside from medical expenses. The deduction for state and local income taxes was the largest average deduction amount claimed for tax filers with an AGI greater than $500,000. The average charitable gift deduction increases sharply for tax filers with an AGI of $1 million or above. The distribution of specific deductions as a share of all itemized deductions varies across income classes. The home mortgage interest deduction is significant for itemizers with AGI between $20,000 and $200,000, while state and local income taxes deduction is prominent for those with AGI over $200,000. As income rises, deductions for state and local income taxes and charitable contributions increase. Deduction claims as a share of income decrease as income increases, with total deductions amounting to 18.9% of AGI for all itemizers. The largest deductions for itemizers with less than $200,000 in AGI are for home mortgage interest, while those with AGI over $200,000 claim the most for state and local income taxes. Some deductions are considered tax expenditures, contributing to federal revenue losses. The top four itemized deductions are expected to have the highest tax expenditures in FY2018. The largest tax expenditures in FY2018 are projected to come from four itemized deductions, including state and local income or sales taxes, home mortgage interest, charitable gifts, and real estate taxes. These deductions are estimated to contribute to approximately $241.2 billion in net individual tax expenditures. Congress may consider policies to further limit itemized deductions, viewed as a way to increase federal revenue, enhance the progressive nature of the income tax code, simplify the tax system, and reduce economic distortions. Limiting deductions can lead to higher taxable income for filers. Some argue for limits to increase tax progressivity, where higher-income individuals pay a larger share of taxes. However, there are concerns about the economic effects of broad limits on deductions. Advocates for reform suggest targeting specific provisions rather than implementing broad limits. Some argue for reform of specific itemized deductions rather than broad limits to increase tax progressivity. Proposals include caps on total deductions, limits on deduction values, conversion to credits, and other options. Data analysis provides insights for the debate on reform options. Efforts to target limits on itemized tax deductions towards higher-income tax filers are restricted in revenue raising potential. Suggestions include a fixed dollar amount cap to target primarily higher-income households. However, setting the cap high enough to avoid impacting most households would limit revenue generation. Data shows that a cap of $25,000 would affect average itemizers with an AGI less than $200,000, indicating that a higher cap may not significantly increase revenue. The data indicates that most itemizers have an AGI below $200,000, accounting for a majority of itemized deductions claimed. Limiting deductions could impact tax filer behavior, with activities like charitable giving potentially being reduced in favor of others. Limiting deductions could impact tax filer behavior, with activities like charitable giving potentially being reduced in favor of others. Tax filers might adjust their behavior to accommodate for limits in itemized deductions, such as renting a residence instead of deducting mortgage interest. Limits not tied to fixed amounts could be structured based on a share of the tax filer's income to avoid trade-offs among tax-deductible activities. Limits on itemized deductions based on a share of the tax filer's income may reduce the tax-beneficial value of activities, potentially leading to smaller deductions. The revenue increase from these limits depends on their structure and could result in more tax filers claiming the standard deduction instead of itemizing. The limit on itemized deductions may lead to more tax filers opting for the standard deduction, offsetting the impact on tax revenue."
