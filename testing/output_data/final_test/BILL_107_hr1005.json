The Congress finds that television, including broadcast, cable, and video programming, has a significant influence on children's perception of societal values and behavior. There is empirical evidence that exposure to violent and indecent programming at a young age can lead to increased violent and aggressive behavior later in life. Children exposed to violent video programming are more likely to view violence as acceptable and imitate such behavior. This exposure also leads to increased fear of violence, resulting in self-protective behaviors and mistrust of others. Government has a compelling interest in limiting these negative influences and scheduling violent content when children are not likely to be watching. A significant amount of violent programming accessible to minors remains unrated. The majority of violent programming accessible to minors is not specifically rated for violence, making age-based ratings ineffective in allowing parents to block violent content. Technology-based solutions like the V-chip can help protect some children but fall short in the government's interest to protect all children from violent programming. Restricting the hours of violent programming can protect children whose parents are unable to supervise or use technology-based solutions. The FCC may find that age-based ratings and blocking technology are not enough to shield children from violent video content. If the FCC determines that violent video programming is harmful to children, channeling it will be the best way to limit their exposure. SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT RATING SYSTEM AND V-CHIP EFFECTIVENESS IN BLOCKING VIOLENT PROGRAMMING. The Federal Communications Commission is required to assess the effectiveness of measures for rating and encoding programming that can be blocked by parents using the V-chip. They must report their findings to specific committees within 12 months of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter. The Commission must assess the effectiveness of rating and encoding measures for programming that can be blocked by parents using the V-chip. If these measures are found to be insufficiently effective, the Commission must prohibit the distribution of violent video programming during times when children are likely to be a significant part of the audience. Any terms defined in the Communications Act of 1934 have the same meaning in this section. SEC. 715 of the Communications Act of 1934 prohibits the distribution of violent video programming that is not specifically rated for violence and cannot be blocked electronically. The Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act prohibits the distribution of violent video programming to the public during times when children are likely to be watching. The Commission will conduct a rulemaking proceeding to implement these provisions and may exempt certain programming that does not conflict with the goal of protecting children from violent influences. The Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act aims to shield children from violent video content. It exempts certain premium and pay-per-view programming and defines terms like 'hours when children are likely to watch' and 'violent video programming'. The Commission enforces this act with a forfeiture penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation. The Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act enforces regulations on violent video content. Violations result in penalties and possible license revocation for repeat offenders. The Commission considers compliance with the Act during license renewals. Definitions for terms like 'blockable by electronic means' and 'distribute' are provided. The term 'distribute' includes various methods of transmission but excludes interactive computer services. 'Violent video programming' is defined by the Commission and may involve excessive violence. Excessive or gratuitous violence is defined by the 1992 Broadcast Standards for the Depiction of Violence in Television Programs. FTC will conduct a study on marketing strategy improvements. The Federal Trade Commission will study the marketing of violent content by entertainment industries to children, assessing improvements in marketing practices under self-regulation. Results and recommendations will be reported to relevant committees within 18 months. The House of Representatives Committee on Commerce will receive the results and recommendations from the Federal Trade Commission's study on the marketing of violent content to children within 18 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 6. SEPARABILITY. If any provision of this Act or an amendment made by it is found unconstitutional, the rest of the Act or amendment will not be affected. SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE. The prohibition in section 715 of the Communications Act of 1934 will take effect 1 year after regulations are adopted."
