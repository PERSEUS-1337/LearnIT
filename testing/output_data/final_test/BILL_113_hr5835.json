    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Comprehensive TB Elimination Act of 2014\" and includes findings related to tuberculosis. The Congress finds that tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health issue, with approximately 9 million people getting sick and 1.5 million dying from TB each year. There is a lack of investment in TB control, research for new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines, as well as in the relationship between TB and HIV/AIDS. The rise of multi-drug resistant TB, including extensively drug-resistant TB, poses a serious global health threat. Cases of TB are reported annually in every State within the United States, with a total of 9,582 cases of active TB reported in 2013. An estimated 8-10 million people in the US are infected with TB bacteria. Drug-resistant TB is a challenge due to high treatment costs and shortages of TB drugs in 2013. New tools are needed for more effective TB control. New tools are urgently needed to prevent, diagnose, and treat TB effectively. Only one new TB drug has been developed in the last 40 years in the US, and the treatment for MDR TB is lengthy and toxic. The existing vaccine does not protect adolescents and adults, only infants and children against pulmonary TB. Expertise in TB identification and treatment lies within the CDC and the US public health system. Preventive treatment for the millions of TB-infected individuals in the US is crucial to prevent future active TB cases. Preventive treatment for TB-infected individuals in the US is crucial to eliminate active TB cases. The text discusses amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to enhanced coordination for preventing drug shortages in tuberculosis treatment. The text discusses prioritizing programs for high-risk populations, including foreign-born, homeless, and uninsured populations, in grants under the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, it mentions grants for coordination of programs and services for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Public Health Service Act prioritizes programs for high-risk populations like foreign-born, homeless, and uninsured individuals. Grants are available for coordinating programs and services to ensure timely tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The Public Health Service Act prioritizes programs for high-risk populations like foreign-born, homeless, and uninsured individuals. Amendments are made to Section 317E regarding the definition of a qualified health center and changes in subsections for conformity. The Federal Tuberculosis Task Force's duties are also revised. The Federal Tuberculosis Task Force is mandated to advise on research into new tools and strategies to prevent drug shortages related to tuberculosis. Additionally, the National Strategy for Combating Tuberculosis is reauthorized with funding allocated for fiscal years 2013 through 2019. The National Institutes of Health are enhancing research on tuberculosis, focusing on drug-resistant tuberculosis, infection progression, and pediatric tuberculosis."
