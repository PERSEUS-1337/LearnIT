    "content": "Multiemployer pension plans are classified by whether they are sponsored by one employer or by more than one employer. In 2013, there were 1,435 multiemployer DB pension plans covering 10.4 million participants with $422.9 billion in assets. These plans owed participants $1.0 trillion in benefits, resulting in underfunding of $610.8 billion. Multiemployer plans meeting financial criteria report their condition to the IRS as endangered, critical, or critical and declining. In 2014, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) reported that 164 plans were in endangered or seriously endangered status, 323 plans were in critical status, and 779 in green zone status. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) allowed plans in critical and declining status to apply to the Department of the Treasury to reduce benefits. MPRA did not address new pension plan structures like composite plans, but some Members of Congress see composite plans as a continuation of MPRA's work. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by ERISA to insure benefits in private-sector DB pension plans. PBGC operates two insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer pension plans independently. When a multiemployer plan becomes insolvent, PBGC provides financial assistance, but benefits must be reduced to a maximum per participant benefit as set in statute. The maximum benefit is calculated based on years of credited service. The PBGC's multiemployer program receives funds from premiums paid by participating employers and investment income. The financial condition of some multiemployer pension plans threatens PBGC's solvency, with no provisions for assistance from the U.S. Treasury. PBGC reported a deficit of $58.8 billion in the multiemployer insurance program at the end of FY2016. PBGC faces a high risk of insolvency due to multiemployer pension plans exhausting their assets. CBO estimates a $9 billion shortfall in claims from 2017 to 2026 and a $30 billion shortfall from 2027 to 2036. The CBO's fair-value estimate of PBGC's future obligations is $101 billion. Stakeholders are exploring alternative pension plan designs to address challenges facing multiemployer DB pension plans, such as target benefit plans in Canada and composite plans in the United States. These alternative plans would need authorization in ERISA. The NCCMP is proposing a composite plan for multiemployer pension and health plans, which would combine elements of both DB and DC plans. Key features include benefits based on a formula, fixed employer contributions, and a required funding ratio of 120%. Plans must take corrective action if assets are insufficient to meet this ratio. The NCCMP is proposing a composite plan for multiemployer pension and health plans, combining elements of DB and DC plans. Corrective actions may include employer contribution increases and benefit reductions. Composite plans would not be covered by PBGC, so sponsors wouldn't pay premiums and benefits wouldn't be protected if insolvent. Legacy plans could coexist with composite plans, with withdrawal liability not applicable to composite plans. The discussion draft proposes a legacy plan where participants would stop earning benefits in the legacy plan and start earning benefits in the composite plan. Employers would need to contribute to the legacy plan at minimum funding levels to restore it to 100% funding over time. The draft authorizes the creation of multiemployer composite plans with specific requirements and rules for existing plans. Legislation affecting private-sector pensions typically amends Title 29 and Title 26 of the Labor and Internal Revenue Code. The discussion draft proposes a composite plan for employer-sponsored multiemployer pension plans, distinct from traditional DB and DC plans. Benefits would be calculated based on a specified formula, providing monthly payments for the participant's lifetime. The plan aims to align with existing provisions in Title 29 and Title 26 of the U.S. Code. The composite plan for employer-sponsored multiemployer pension plans would involve the employer contributing 120% of the plan's normal cost in the first year. The plan would conduct annual actuarial assessments to determine the current and projected funded ratios. If the projected funded ratio falls below 120%, corrective action would be necessary. Trustees of the plan would include a retiree or beneficiary receiving benefits. The composite plan could be integrated into an existing multiemployer plan or established as a standalone plan, as long as the multiemployer DB plan is not in critical status or expected to be for the next five years. The composite plan and multiemployer plan would be maintained separately, with assets held in a single trust but with separate accounts. They could choose to pool assets but are not required to. Each plan's assets would be managed for the exclusive benefit of its participants. A composite plan would report its CFR and PFR annually, with CFR calculated as assets divided by liabilities and PFR projected 15 years ahead. PFR could include anticipated contribution increases. Reasonable assumptions would be used for costs, liabilities, and interest rates. The plan actuary would use reasonable assumptions and offer the best estimate of the plan's anticipated experience. Changes to actuarial assumptions would be documented. Plan assets would be valued at market values, and liabilities would use the unit credit funding method. If a composite plan's PFR falls below 120%, a realignment program would be required to achieve a PFR of 120% the following year, which could include employer contribution increases or benefit accrual reductions. If the plan's PFR falls below 120%, a realignment program could be implemented to achieve the required funding level. This program may involve reducing future benefit accruals, adjustable benefits, and core benefits for participants. If necessary, accrued benefits could also be reduced for participants not yet receiving benefits. The program would need to be implemented equitably and could only take effect if bargaining parties fail to agree on contribution increases. The discussion draft contains provisions for composite plans to restrict benefit increases unless well funded. Requirements include CFR and PFR thresholds, and limitations on increasing plan liabilities. The discussion draft allows existing multiemployer DB plans to adopt composite plans under certain conditions, such as not being in critical status or expecting to be in critical status in the next five years. Legacy plans would still be required to pay participants' earned benefits, with provisions for equitable distribution of benefit increases. If an employer withdraws from a multiemployer DB plan, their employees would not be affected. Composite plans must meet \"transition contribution requirements\" to ensure continued contributions to the legacy plan. The transition contribution rate must fund the DB plan's normal cost, amortize initial unfunded liabilities over 25 years, and subsequent liabilities over 15 years. It cannot be lower than the first year's rate and would increase if the legacy plan's status worsens. Composite plans can merge if the legacy plan is fully funded, has been fully funded in at least three of the previous five years, and is projected to be fully funded in the following four years. The resulting plan must also be a composite plan, and accrued benefits cannot be lowered as a result of the merger. Employers would continue to contribute to legacy plans if composite plans merge, and composite plans would not be covered by PBGC insurance or pay PBGC premiums. If the provisions of the discussion draft were to be enacted, concerns have been raised regarding the composite plans proposal. Participants' benefits could be adjusted based on investment performance, relieving employers from increasing obligations. Legacy plans may have no withdrawal liability if fully funded for three of the previous five years, with no unfunded vested benefits, and projected to remain fully funded for the next four years. The adjustable benefit plan allows for a minimum guaranteed benefit with a variable benefit based on investment performance, different from the composite plan proposal. Benefits are insured by PBGC, and employers are still subject to withdrawal liabilities. The composite plan proposal would lower funding for existing multiemployer plans by extending the amortization period for underfunding to 25 years. Contributions to legacy plans would be lower each year compared to current law. Contributions to legacy plans in critical or endangered status would likely increase. The proposal includes a provision that the composite plan must receive at least 25% of the combined contributions to the legacy and composite plan. This could worsen the funded status of the legacy plan if its required contributions exceed 75% of the total. Employers' withdrawal liability payments would likely decrease or be eliminated under the composite plan proposal. The discussion draft excludes contributions to a composite plan from withdrawal liability calculations. If a legacy plan becomes 100% funded, it is relieved of withdrawal liability permanently. If the plan later becomes underfunded, employer contributions may increase. Employers can exit the plan without paying withdrawal liability if it becomes insolvent. The investment policy of a pension plan determines asset allocation among various options like equities, fixed income, real estate, and alternative assets. In composite plans, participants bear most of the investment risk, with benefits decreasing in response to losses. Asset allocation for composite plans may differ from traditional DB plans based on risk tolerance. Participants in DC plans have more control over their investment allocations compared to DB plans. The investment policy for pension plans is typically determined by an investment policy committee. In composite plans, participants do not have a direct influence on the investment policy. Some suggest that clarity is needed on the realignment program for composite plans if funding levels drop below 120% of liabilities. The discussion draft on realignment programs for multiemployer plans leaves trustees with discretion on adopting specific measures, potentially causing uncertainty for participants on how their benefits may be affected by funding shortfalls. The draft lacks provisions to assist plans in critical status, with the PBGC warning of insolvency by 2025 due to large plans in decline. Existing multiemployer plans are not mandated to adopt the proposed measures. The composite plan proposal is limited to sponsors of multiemployer pension plans, with some features like fixed contributions and no withdrawal liability being attractive to employers. Employers with single-employer DB pension plans may also consider adopting the composite plan model, although they have fewer obstacles to freezing or terminating their plans and switching to DC plans. Various stakeholders have raised concerns and identified potential issues with the proposed composite plans. The proposal for composite plans in multiemployer pension plans addresses concerns such as uncertainty over future contribution increases and withdrawal liability for employers. This proposal aims to attract new employers to existing multiemployer DB plans by offering fixed contributions and no withdrawal liability. Additionally, it aims to prevent employers from leaving their DB plans and establishing DC plans due to concerns about unexpected increases in contributions. The composite plan proposal aims to prevent employer withdrawal from multiemployer DB plans by offering fixed contributions and no withdrawal liability. Concerns about withdrawal liability may deter employers from joining existing plans, as they would be liable for unfunded benefits if they leave. The composite plan proposal aims to address concerns about withdrawal liability for employers in multiemployer DB plans. Employers may find the absence of withdrawal liability attractive in composite plans, which also eliminate per participant annual premiums to PBGC. Participants in composite plans are not subject to longevity risk but are exposed to investment and other risks that could increase plan liabilities. The composite plan proposal aims to address concerns about withdrawal liability for employers in multiemployer DB plans. Participants could spend all their assets while alive, leading to worries about outliving retirement savings. Despite options to purchase annuities, only 14% had bought one. Benefits in composite plans would not be insured by PBGC, posing risks if the plan becomes insolvent. In DB plans, risks such as investment losses and changes in assumptions can decrease the plan's funding ratio, requiring sponsors to increase contributions. DC plan participants bear investment losses through smaller account balances and can increase contributions up to the annual limit. Composite plans address investment losses with a mix of contribution adjustments and benefit reductions, without the obligation for sponsors to increase contributions like in DB plans. Composite plans differ from DC plans in that sponsors cannot increase contributions in the event of investment losses, and plan participants cannot make contributions. Plan liabilities and funding ratio would decrease if participants live longer, actuarial assumptions change, or employers withdraw from the plan. Changes in discount rates could increase future benefit obligations, requiring potential contribution increases and benefit reductions in composite plans. The proposed composite plan would not be covered by PBGC insurance, leading to a decline in premium revenue for PBGC. This would result in a shrinking premium base and fewer resources to provide financial assistance to multiemployer plans over time. Legacy plans would still pay premiums to PBGC, but the number of participants in these plans would decrease gradually."
