The \"Preclearance Authorization Act of 2014\" allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance operations in foreign countries to prevent security threats, ensure compliance with laws, and facilitate the processing of eligible travelers to the United States. The Secretary may also determine other necessary objectives to protect the country. The Secretary of Homeland Security must notify congressional committees 180 days before establishing U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance operations in a foreign country. The notification should include the proposed agreement, the foreign country involved, the location of operations, the estimated start date, and funding sources. The assessment of preclearance operations includes impacts on trade, travel, homeland security threats, staffing, economic effects on US carriers, and anticipated security benefits. The benefits of establishing preclearance operations include information on security vulnerabilities, staffing models, anticipated costs over the next five years, agreements, and other necessary factors for Congress to assess the appropriateness of such operations. The Secretary of Homeland Security must provide certifications to Congress 90 days before establishing U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance operations at an airport in a foreign country, ensuring homeland security benefits and compliance with specific conditions. The Secretary of Homeland Security must certify to Congress before establishing preclearance operations at a foreign airport, ensuring equal access for US carriers, considering alternatives, avoiding delays at US airports, and explaining additional objectives. The Secretary of Homeland Security must certify to Congress before establishing preclearance operations at a foreign airport, ensuring equal access for US carriers, consulting with relevant parties, and providing a report on the basis for certifications. Additionally, any substantial modifications to existing agreements must be shared with congressional committees 30 days prior. The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection must provide monthly measurements of customs processing time at top U.S. airports to congressional committees. Quarterly assessments will determine if processing times significantly exceed those at preclearance operations. The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection must provide a remediation plan to reduce customs processing time if it significantly exceeds that of preclearance operations. The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection must implement parts of the plan using existing resources, excluding personnel transfers. Failure to submit the plan within 60 days will result in a suspension of negotiations for preclearance operations. Stakeholder recommendations must be considered in the remediation plan. The assessment and report may be submitted in classified form if deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Homeland Security. SEC. 5. Aviation security screening at preclearance airports. Prior to commencing preclearance operations at foreign airports, the Transportation Security Administration must establish security agreements with the respective governments to ensure comparable aviation screening standards. If a foreign country fails to maintain these standards, rescreening will be required in the United States. Passengers arriving on flights from foreign airports with preclearance operations must undergo security rescreening by the Transportation Security Administration before boarding domestic flights in the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security must ensure foreign countries share information on lost and stolen passports with INTERPOL before establishing U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance operations at their airports. This Act applies only to countries without existing preclearance operations. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 8, 2014. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
