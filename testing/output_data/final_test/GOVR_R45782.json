    "content": "The opioid epidemic in the United States has led to a significant gap between the need for substance abuse treatment and the capacity of the healthcare system to provide it. In 2017, over 47,600 people died from opioid-related drug overdoses, with 11.4 million people misusing opioids. Despite the high numbers, the majority of individuals in need of treatment do not receive it. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is considered the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is widely accepted as the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. Three medications used in MAT for opioid addiction are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone and buprenorphine are opioids used in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) to mitigate withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. Methadone and buprenorphine are regulated under the Controlled Substances Act for treating opioid addiction in federally certified opioid treatment programs. These programs, also known as methadone clinics, offer medications and counseling for individuals addicted to opioids. Treatment can be inpatient or outpatient, with no federal limits on the number of patients treated, but an average of 262 to 334 patients per program is recommended by HHS. Buprenorphine can be used to treat opioid use disorder within or outside an OTP with a DATA waiver. Practitioners must notify the HHS Secretary, certify as a qualifying practitioner, refer patients for counseling, and comply with regulations. Practitioners treating opioid use disorder with buprenorphine must comply with patient limits and state laws. Treatment typically occurs in an outpatient setting, similar to methadone treatment. Federal regulations aim to increase access to opioid treatment. The federal government has implemented policies to increase access to opioid agonist medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in response to the rise in opioid overdoses and deaths. Legislation such as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act have expanded eligibility for healthcare providers to obtain DATA waivers, allowing for more practitioners to prescribe methadone and buprenorphine. The legislation has increased access to opioid agonist medication-assisted treatment (MAT) by expanding eligibility for healthcare providers to obtain DATA waivers. This has led to a significant increase in the number of facilities providing buprenorphine treatment and the number of physicians with patient limits for prescribing medication for substance abuse treatment. Despite these efforts, access to substance abuse treatment still remains a challenge. Access to substance abuse treatment has not kept pace with the rising rates of opioid addiction in the United States, despite an increase in facilities providing buprenorphine treatment and the number of physicians with patient limits for prescribing medication. A 2018 study found that practitioners with DATA waivers are not treating to capacity, with only 13.1% prescribing buprenorphine at or near the patient limit. Geography plays a crucial role in evaluating opioid agonist MAT capacity, as treatment location may be more important than the number of patients a practitioner is allowed to treat. The 2018 study on DATA-waived clinicians found that lack of patient demand was the top reason for not prescribing buprenorphine, indicating a discrepancy between practitioners and patients in need. Barriers to accessing opioid agonist treatment may include insurance coverage, reimbursement, transportation, stigma, awareness, and motivation for recovery. The report identifies the geographic distribution of opioid treatment providers in the US using SAMHSA data. The report identifies the geographic distribution of opioid treatment providers in the US, including certified opioid treatment programs and practitioners with DATA waivers. Availability of treatment is influenced by factors like costs, demand, wait times, and awareness of options. The report does not assess total capacity for treatment or evaluate need for services. SAMHSA provides data on OTPs and DATA-waived practitioners. As of June 1, 2019, there were 1,674 federally certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs) in the United States. The total number of DATA-waived providers exceeded 50,000 with varying patient limits. Over 4,800 practitioners had a 275-patient limit, allowing for at least 4 million patients to be treated with buprenorphine. CRS used ArcGIS to map the distribution of DATA-waived providers and OTPs in 2018. The distribution of DATA-waived providers and OTPs in the United States was mapped using Jenks natural breaks optimization to create shading categories based on the number of practitioners in each county. The Northeast region was displayed separately to highlight the high concentration of OTPs. Other regions with clustered OTPs, such as California and Florida, were easily discerned on the national map and not displayed separately. Parts of the Midwest were shown in a regional map for better visibility. The analysis examined the geographic distribution of OAT providers in the United States, showing that services are not evenly distributed across the country. Results indicated that 39% of counties, populated by an estimated 17.5 million people, had no DATA-waived practitioners. 321 million nationally, or 5.5% of the population) had no DATA-waived practitioners. Nearly 2,500 counties (80% nationally), populated by an estimated 77.5 million people (24% of the population), had no OTPs and 1,202 counties (38%), populated by 16.8 million people (5.2%), had neither an OTP nor a DATA-waived practitioner. Nearly half of the over 1,200 counties with no OAT providers are rural. Texas, Georgia, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri have the highest percentages of counties with no OTPs or DATA-waived providers. Twenty-five counties with no OTPs or DATA-waived practitioners had more than 50,000 residents. Counties vary in geographic size and population, affecting treatment availability. The presence or absence of OAT providers does not always indicate access. Federal lawmakers are introducing bills to expand opioid use disorder treatment with MAT. The bill aims to increase accessibility to buprenorphine treatment by removing some requirements for providers to receive DATA waivers. Identifying the location of treatment providers is crucial for improving access to treatment, as simply increasing capacity may not address the needs of areas with high opioid-related overdoses. Factors like treatment financing and state regulations also impact the availability of treatment. Congress may need to consider incorporating geographic factors in strategies to increase treatment capacity and availability. Rural areas may face barriers to care, such as transportation issues for patients receiving methadone at OTPs. DATA-waived providers may lack resources for complementary services like counseling and housing. Vermont has implemented a \"hub-and-spoke\" system to address geographical obstacles to care for patients seeking treatment for OUD. Patients start at an OTP for intensive services, then transition to a DATA-waived provider in their community for maintenance treatment with buprenorphine. If patients relapse, they can return to the OTP until ready to transition back to outpatient buprenorphine. Throughout treatment, patients are followed by the same care management team to access appropriate services. Vermont's hub and spoke strategy involves distributing OTPs throughout the state to reduce treatment gaps. Other states use mobile methadone units to reach rural patients. Increasing treatment providers is only effective if accessibility is also addressed, focusing on location in relation to patient population. Congress may explore solutions like telemedicine services to address barriers such as stigma and financing in increasing availability of treatment for opioid use disorder. Identifying provider locations is crucial for policymakers seeking to improve access to services."
