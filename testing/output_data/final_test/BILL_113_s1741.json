    "content": "The \"Military Savings Act of 2013\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. Additionally, a Consumer Financial Products Pilot Program is established. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) will conduct a 5-year pilot program to create financial products promoting savings and wealth-building for active duty members of the Armed Forces. These products aim to increase savings rates and offer alternatives to high-cost short-term lending services. The pilot program aims to provide advances on salary payments to Armed Forces members, allowing for more frequent installments and limiting interest rates. It also aims to address obstacles to traditional banking for members with limited credit history and promote savings and wealth creation among active duty personnel. The pilot program aims to provide salary advances to Armed Forces members without exacerbating credit overextension. The Under Secretary will select at least 10 military installations for implementation, and financial institutions must offer consumer financial products developed under the program. Members of the Armed Forces will be notified about these products. The Under Secretary will consult with experts and organizations in developing consumer financial products for Armed Forces members. An independent evaluation of the pilot program will be conducted annually. The pilot program under this section will be evaluated to determine its success in increasing usage of savings products among active duty Armed Forces members. The evaluation will be conducted by a contractor with expertise in consumer financial products. The Under Secretary will submit a report to relevant committees after each evaluation. The Under Secretary may expand the pilot program nationwide to improve savings rates and reduce reliance on payday lenders among Armed Forces members without causing credit overextension. \"Financial institution\" refers to insured depository institutions or credit unions."
