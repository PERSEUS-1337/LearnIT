Congress finds it appropriate to use enforcement authority to prevent discrimination against mobile service providers and consumers through excessive taxes and burdens. This is in response to a history of discriminatory taxation faced by the industry. Congress finds it appropriate to use enforcement authority to prevent discriminatory taxation on mobile service providers and consumers, similar to the analogy of state and local taxation in the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976. Federal legislative measures are needed to prohibit new discriminatory taxes and ensure a uniform remedy. SEC. 3. MORATORIUM. During a 5-year period after the enactment of this Act, no new discriminatory tax can be imposed by any State or local jurisdiction on mobile services, providers, or property. Mobile service is defined as commercial mobile radio service or any service intended for mobile devices, including digital goods. Mobile service property refers to all property used by mobile service providers for their business. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a mobile service provider and a new discriminatory tax imposed by State or local jurisdictions on mobile services. The curr_chunk discusses discriminatory taxes imposed on mobile service providers based on charges, receipts, or revenues, compared to other businesses or property subject to property tax levy. The curr_chunk defines terms related to taxes, including regulatory authority, State or local jurisdiction, and the definition of tax as a charge imposed by a governmental entity for generating revenues. The curr_chunk further clarifies that the term \"tax\" excludes fees imposed for specific privileges or benefits, such as those related to universal service programs or E-911 communications systems. The determination of whether a tax is discriminatory considers various factors like taxes, exemptions, and credits. Principles similar to those in the Railroad Revitalization Act apply to taxes on mobile service property. The term \"generally imposed\" does not apply to taxes on specific services. The term \"new discriminatory tax\" excludes taxes on specific services, industries, or property types. It also excludes taxes that replace previous taxes on mobile services and are designed to generate similar tax revenues. The new discriminatory tax excludes taxes on specific services, industries, or property types. It also excludes taxes that replace previous taxes on mobile services and are designed to generate similar tax revenues. Mobile service providers are expected to not exceed the amount of tax revenues generated by the replaced tax, or the tax must be approved by voters and collected from mobile service customers. The enforcement of the new discriminatory tax excludes certain taxes and requires approval from voters if tax revenues exceed the replaced tax. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, and declaratory judgments to prevent acts in violation of this Act. The burden of proof is on the party seeking relief, and relief can be granted against a tax. The district courts have jurisdiction to grant relief against discriminatory or excessive taxes under this Act, preventing the imposition of the discriminatory portion as determined by the court. The GAO will conduct a study. The Comptroller General will conduct a study over a 5-year period to assess the impact of local and State taxes on mobile services costs. A report will be submitted to Congress after 6 years with the study results. The Comptroller General will conduct a study over a 5-year period to assess the impact of local and State taxes on mobile services costs. A report will be submitted to Congress after 6 years with recommendations for any changes to laws and regulations relating to the study results.
