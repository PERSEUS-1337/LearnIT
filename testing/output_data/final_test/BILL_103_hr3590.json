The Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 1993 emphasizes the importance of commercializing technology and industrial innovation for the well-being of the United States. The Government can support businesses through Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with Federal laboratories, but ultimately, the success of technology commercialization depends on actions taken by businesses. Government ownership claims on intellectual property developed under these agreements can hinder their establishment with businesses. The Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 1993 highlights the importance of commercializing technology and industrial innovation in the United States. Ownership of intellectual property developed under Cooperative Research and Development Agreements should belong to U.S. companies to enhance technology commercialization. The Technology Transfer Improvements Act of 1993 emphasizes the significance of commercializing technology and industrial innovation in the United States. Ownership of intellectual property from Cooperative Research and Development Agreements should be with U.S. companies to boost technology commercialization. Section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to ensure that title to intellectual property from agreements is assigned to collaborating parties in exchange for compensation. Amendments include removing language regarding government-operated labs and retaining rights to intellectual property. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to allow collaborating parties to retain a license for intellectual property arising from agreements with the government. This includes the right to grant licenses to others if the collaborating party fails to do so. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 allows collaborating parties to retain a license for intellectual property. The laboratory can grant the license itself under certain circumstances if the collaborating party fails to do so. This includes situations where the collaborating party has not taken effective steps for practical application, where action is necessary for health or safety needs, to meet public use requirements, or if the collaborating party has not entered into agreements. In subsection (d), the term 'intellectual property rights' is defined for government-owned laboratories. This includes patents for government-operated labs and patents, copyrights, and computer chip mask work registrations for contractor-operated labs. SEC. 4. Amends Section 14 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to address the distribution of income from intellectual property received by federal agencies or laboratories. The income from licensing or assigning intellectual property by Federal agencies or laboratories shall be retained by the agency or laboratory. The head of the agency shall distribute the income to the employees who have assigned their rights in the intellectual property. The agency or laboratory shall retain income from licensing intellectual property and distribute it to employees who assigned their rights. The agency or laboratory may pay a collaborating party an amount based on a percentage of income received from the intellectual property. The agency or laboratory retains income from licensing intellectual property and distributes it to employees who contribute substantially to its development. The majority share of royalties goes to the laboratory where the intellectual property originated. The income from licensing intellectual property is retained by the agency or laboratory and can be used for administration and licensing expenses. Up to 15% of the income can be used for these purposes, including fees for intellectual property management services. The income from licensing intellectual property is retained by the agency or laboratory and can be used for administration, licensing services, rewarding employees, scientific exchange, education, training, and activities to increase technology transfer potential. Up to 15% of the income can be used for these purposes. The agency or laboratory retains income from licensing intellectual property. Any unobligated and unexpended income at the end of the fiscal year is paid into the US Treasury. If the intellectual property income exceeds 5% of the budget, 75% of the excess is paid to the Treasury, and the remaining 25% can be used for specified purposes. Any payment made to an employee under this section shall be in addition to their regular pay and other awards, and will not affect their entitlement to any other benefits. Payments will continue even after the employee leaves the agency or laboratory. Federal agencies or laboratories can retain income to offset payments for intellectual property and expenses. Remaining income is transferred to the agency for distribution. If the intellectual property was assigned to the agency by a contractor, grantee, or participant, certain conditions apply. Federal agencies must submit an annual report to Congress detailing income from intellectual property and expenditures. The Comptroller General will review income-sharing programs by October 1, 1996. The Comptroller General will review income-sharing programs established under this section and provide findings, conclusions, and recommendations to Congress. Section 210(e) of title 35, United States Code, is amended by inserting \"and the Technology Commercialization Act of 1993\" after \"Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986\"."
