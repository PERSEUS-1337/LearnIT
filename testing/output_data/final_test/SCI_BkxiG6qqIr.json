Cross-lingual plagiarism, such as English-Russian, has become popular. The CrossLang system uses a monolingual approach, translating suspicious documents into English for analysis. The main challenge is designing effective cross-lingual detection methods. The CrossLang system uses machine translation to analyze suspicious documents for plagiarism. It consists of stages like machine translation, source retrieval, and document storage to handle translation ambiguity. The CrossLang system utilizes a modified shingle-based approach for document storage and comparison. The system focuses on comparing vectors of phrases in translated suspicious documents with source documents to address translation ambiguity. The machine translation system aims for sufficient quality rather than ideal translation, with a lower BLEU score compared to Google's. Source retrieval for verbatim plagiarism involves constructing an inverted index based on shingles of reference collection documents. The CrossLang system uses a shingle-based approach for document comparison, focusing on comparing vectors of phrases in translated suspicious documents with source documents. By moving from word shingles to word-class shingles, the system improves source retrieval for verbatim plagiarism detection. This is achieved by substituting each word with the label of the class it belongs to, obtained through clustering word vectors using a word embedding model like fastText. The dimension for word embedding model was set to 100. Agglomerative clustering was applied on word embeddings to group 777K words into 30K classes. A phrase embedding model was used to compare retrieved and suspicious documents by splitting them into phrases and comparing vectors. An unsupervised encoder-decoder model was trained on 10M sentences from Wikipedia for mapping word sequences into a low-dimensional space. The objective function was extended to incorporate phrase similarity using margin-based loss. The objective function was extended to incorporate phrase similarity using margin-based loss. Similar phrase pairs were used to improve quality without strict limitations. Double translation method was employed for generating similar sentences. The system for cross-lingual plagiarism detection for English-Russian language pair was deployed and analyzed. Nearest vectors were found using cosine similarity from source documents. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in cross-lingual plagiarism detection and introduces new methods using phrase embeddings for comparison. It also highlights the lack of results and datasets for the English-Russian language pair, with the creation of a new dataset for this specific problem. The curr_chunk discusses the performance of a system for monolingual paraphrased plagiarism detection using a dataset from the PAN'11 contest. The system achieved Precision = 0.83, Recall = 0.79, and F1 = 0.80. It can be deployed on an 8-GPU cluster with Tesla-K100 GPUs, 128GB RAM, and 64 CPU Cores, and can scale horizontally using Docker containerization and Consul for automatic load balancing. The system can check up to 100 documents per minute, important for peak loads. CrossLang framework introduced for cross-lingual plagiarism detection, using microservices and neural machine translation. Source Retrieval uses shingling method, Document Comparison uses phrase embeddings. The Document Comparison stage utilized phrase embeddings trained with slight supervision to evaluate the effectiveness of main stages."
