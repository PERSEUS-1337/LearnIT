    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"More Books for Africa Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to the act. The World Bank and donor organizations have found that good school books are crucial for advancing education in African schools due to a chronic shortage of books. This shortage contributes to Africa's low literacy rates, hindering development goals set by initiatives like the Millennium Development Goals and Education For All. In Africa and the developing world, education is a key development goal, especially for women and girls. Many African children attending school do not own their own books, with 10-20 students sharing one textbook in some classrooms. Each year of education can increase a person's income potential by 10 percent. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43.5 percent of the population is under 14 years old. Citizens in the United States are donating books and labor to assist in literacy efforts in Africa, with 22,000 books able to be shipped in one cargo container for $11,000. Non-profit organizations are utilizing donated books and labor from US citizens to support these initiatives. Donated books and labor from US citizens, along with cash donations, have enabled the shipment of books to Africa for only 50 cents per book, showing cost-efficiency during budget challenges. The sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of textbooks and library books for education and national security. Additionally, the More Books for Africa Program is introduced. The More Books for Africa Program, established by the Administrator of USAID, aims to donate 3,000,000 text and library books annually to African schools and libraries through unrestricted donations from various entities. The More Books for Africa Program, initiated by USAID, focuses on donating text and library books on various subjects like law, democracy, health, medicine, science, and math. Donated books must have covers, be in good condition, and have legible text. The program also seeks partnerships with US-based organizations for funding and book collection. The More Books for Africa Program, initiated by USAID, focuses on donating text and library books to communities in Africa. The Program leverages funds, collects donated books, and encourages partnerships with African ministries of education for distribution. Volunteers assist in collecting and preparing book shipments, fostering cross-cultural relations. United States ambassadors are also encouraged to support the Program. The More Books for Africa Program, initiated by USAID, encourages United States Ambassadors to prioritize establishing libraries and donating books to schools in African countries. It also leverages the Peace Corps' work in Africa and partners with local organizations for book distribution. Collaboration with African literacy organizations is also promoted. The More Books for Africa Program, initiated by USAID, encourages collaboration with African literacy organizations for training librarians and teachers, distributing donated books, and clearing book containers from port locations. Authorized activities include collecting and processing donated books, shipping them to Africa, distributing them, and establishing partnerships. The Program funds cannot be used to purchase or develop text and library books, with a limit of $750 per 1,000 books for collecting and distributing. Safeguards are in place to prevent donated books from being resold in Africa, and a report on the number of books donated must be submitted to Congress within a year. Authorization of Appropriations: $3,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014 for the Program. This includes the use of donated text and library books, entities involved in book distribution in African countries, and participation of the Ambassador's Special Self-Help Program."
