Despite the expiration of \"fast track\" authority in June 2007, Congress passed PTPA implementing legislation, which became law on December 14, 2007. It went into effect on February 1, 2009. The \"New Trade Policy for America\" announced by Congress and the Administration includes key Democratic priorities such as labor, environment, access to medicine, port security, and government procurement. It aims to raise standards and spread the benefits of globalization. The policy ensures fully enforceable provisions for FTAs, incorporating ILO core labor standards and prohibiting countries from weakening these standards to attract trade or investment. The final text of the Peru FTA includes new limitations on prosecutorial and enforcement discretion, ensuring that FTA countries cannot use resource limitations as an excuse for not enforcing laws related to ILO core labor standards. Peru's congress approved the FTA-related amendments on June 27, 2007. Procedural guarantees are in place to ensure fair access to labor tribunals for workers and employers. The Peru FTA includes provisions to ensure fair access to labor tribunals, with requirements for transparency, written decisions, impartiality, and the right to seek review. It also mandates the establishment of a Labor Affairs Council to oversee implementation of labor obligations. The Labor Council, established under the Peru FTA, would prioritize cooperative and capacity-building activities between government representatives of the two countries. It would work towards advancing labor commitments, including those related to child labor, by establishing guidelines, preparing reports, and facilitating communication. The parties agreed to establish a Labor Cooperation and Capacity Building Mechanism to promote bilateral or regional cooperation on labor issues. Peruvian President Alan Garcia succeeded Alejandro Toledo in 2006, during a period of economic growth driven by mining and exports. Despite this growth, over half of Peruvians live in poverty and face high levels of unemployment and underemployment. The labor force in Peru is significantly smaller than that of the United States, with unemployment and underemployment totaling 64.5% nationwide. During former President Alberto Fujimori's regime, Peru underwent radical economic reforms to stabilize the economy, including privatization and foreign investment relaxation. Labor laws were significantly relaxed during this time. However, in recent years, Peru has strengthened labor protections through reforms and workers' rights. In 2002, Peru ratified two ILO conventions. Peru has implemented labor law reform, ratified ILO conventions on child labor abolition, and improved workers' rights by reducing barriers to union establishment and strengthening labor inspections. Critics argue about some remaining issues in labor standards. The Peru TPA was negotiated under the trade promotion authority in the Trade Act of 2002, incorporating unique labor provisions and new reporting requirements. It was the first agreement to reflect the new congressional-administration trade policy. The Peru TPA includes unique labor provisions such as reporting requirements and capacity-building activities. Supporters argue that it reinforces Peru's labor reforms and enforces ILO core labor standards. Proponents argue that the Peru TPA includes key Democratic priorities such as enforceable ILO core labor standards and dispute resolution procedures. Critics raise concerns about Peru's adoption of new labor laws and enforceability, citing the failure to reverse labor law weakening during the Fujimori administration. The 2005 State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices highlight Peru's non-compliance with U.S. recognized worker rights and ILO labor standards. Issues include lack of protection for workers in informal sectors, forced labor practices, child labor violations, and non-compliance with minimum wage guidelines. Before the new PTPA language was released, observers noted that the United States has ratified only two ILO conventions, while Peru has ratified all eight. Concerns were raised about potential challenges to the U.S. labor code if enforceable ILO core labor standards were included in trade agreements. The PTPA addresses this by restricting provisions to trade-related matters and incorporating only the principles of the four basic ILO rights. The proposed PTPA is unlikely to impact overall U.S. employment levels, but could affect specific industries. The largest U.S. employment gain is projected in wheat production, while declines are expected in metals, rice production, and miscellaneous crops. Peru could see job gains ranging from less than 20,000 to 700,000. Some argue that U.S. exports could harm subsistence farmers in Peru. The Peruvian Congress approved the PTPA in June 2006 and amendments in June 2007. President Alan Garc\u00eda Perez met with President Bush to discuss the agreement. House Democratic leaders delayed implementing legislation until Peru complied with new labor provisions. President Garcia issued \"supreme decrees\" to implement labor obligations. The Peru TPA implementing legislation, H.R. 3688, was passed by the House and Senate in November and December 2007, respectively, and signed into law by President Bush. Issues included the impact on workers, Peru's commitments to reforms, and maintaining confidence in the bilateral trade environment with the United States. The Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable supported the Peru TPA, while the AFL-CIO remained neutral. The AFL-CIO neither supported nor opposed the Peru TPA because they have labor unions on both sides of the issue. Change To Win labor coalition, made up of former AFL unions, urged Congress to oppose the PTPA."
