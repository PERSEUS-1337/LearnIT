    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 18897 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allocate moneys to the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund, reimbursing costs incurred by various departments. For the 2014\u201315 fiscal year, funds appropriated to the State Department of Education will be transferred to the State Department of Social Services for assisting homeless children in California with school supplies and health-related products through a nonprofit organization. The nonprofit organization must provide a minimum 100 percent match for all funds received. The nonprofit organization must provide a 100 percent match for all funds received from the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund, including in-kind materials, verified by the donor. The State Department of Social Services will enter into a subvention services agreement with the nonprofit organization. The State Department of Social Services designates a nonprofit organization every three years, with the first designation valid until January 1, 2017. The designation can be revoked if the nonprofit fails to comply, and a new organization will be designated within three months. Funds are distributed by the State Department of Social Services to local education agencies, domestic violence shelters, and eligible centers after evidence of receiving materials. Nonprofit funds are strictly for procuring, assembling, and shipping school supplies and health-related products, not for administrative or operational purposes. The nonprofit organization may provide school supplies and health-related products to children in domestic violence shelters, homeless children, and homeless youth. The State Department of Social Services will verify the procurement and provision of these supplies. Section 18898 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is being amended. Section 18898 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to specify that the article will be in effect until January 1, 2022, and repealed on December 1 of that year. The Franchise Tax Board is required to determine the minimum contribution amount for the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund each year by September 1. This information is then provided to the State Department of Social Services. The Franchise Tax Board estimates contributions to determine if they meet the minimum amount required for the calendar year. If contributions fall short, the article will not apply for taxable years starting on or after January 1 of that year and will be repealed on December 1. The minimum contribution amount for the School Supplies for Homeless Children Fund is $250,000 for the second calendar year after its first appearance on the personal income tax return, with adjustments made by the Franchise Tax Board starting from the third calendar year. The minimum estimated contribution amount for the calendar year is determined by multiplying the minimum estimated contribution amount by the inflation factor adjustment based on the California Consumer Price Index. Contributions designated prior to the repeal of the article will continue to be transferred and disbursed accordingly."
