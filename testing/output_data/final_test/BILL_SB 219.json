    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1170.05 of the Penal Code in California is amended. The Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in California can offer a voluntary alternative custody program for female inmates committed to state prison. Participants can substitute one day in the program for one day of incarceration, receive sentence reduction credits, and may face credit denial or loss. The Department of Corrections in California can offer a voluntary alternative custody program for female inmates, allowing them to substitute one day in the program for one day of incarceration. The department may partner with various organizations to promote alternative custody placements. The alternative custody program for female inmates in California includes confinement to a residential home, drug or treatment program, or transitional care facility during designated hours. Only female inmates sentenced to state prison for a determinate term are eligible, with exceptions for those convicted of violent or serious felonies. The criteria for determining eligibility for the alternative custody program in California include prior sex offense convictions, high risk of violent offense, and recent history of escape from custody within the last 10 years. An alternative custody program in California may use electronic monitoring or GPS devices to verify participant compliance with program rules. These devices are not for eavesdropping but can record conversations between the participant and their supervisor for voice identification purposes. The California alternative custody program requires participants to agree to an individualized treatment and rehabilitation plan, prioritizing evidence-based programs for successful reentry into society. Case management services are provided to track progress and compliance with the plan. Evidence-based practices are defined as methods proven to reduce recidivism among individuals under supervision. The California alternative custody program requires participants to comply with rules and regulations set by the secretary, including staying within their residence during designated hours. Regulations are adopted to effectuate the program, with participants informed in writing of their obligations. The participant in the California alternative custody program may be searched by a peace officer at any time, and must allow officers into their residence for verification. Failure to comply with the program's conditions may result in immediate return to custody. Whenever a peace officer supervising a participant in the California alternative custody program suspects non-compliance with program rules or malfunctioning electronic monitoring devices, they can retake the participant into custody without a warrant to complete the original sentence. An inmate must comply with rules to participate in the alternative custody program. The program's rules and policies must be provided to the participant upon assignment. The secretary or designee decides on program participation as an alternative to state prison custody. A risk assessment is done for eligibility. Medical conditions do not exclude inmates from the program. The secretary or designee establishes a timeline for the application process, responds to applicants within two weeks, notifies them of eligibility criteria, and provides written notice of acceptance or denial into the program. An individualized treatment plan is developed within 30 days of potential eligibility, and inmates are released to the program within seven business days of acceptance. The inmate may appeal the decision or reapply for the program 30 days after denial, with reasons for denial specified in the notice. The secretary or designee allows program participants to seek employment, attend counseling or training, participate in life skills programs, and access medical services based on their individualized treatment plan. Failure to return to detention or tampering with monitoring equipment is prohibited. Participants who tamper with electronic monitoring devices may face return to custody and forfeiture of credits or disciplinary action. The secretary or designee must provide participant information to law enforcement agencies, including name, address, offense, and program duration. Law enforcement can use this information to monitor the program's impact on the community. The alternative custody program aims to maintain public confidence, credibility, and safety. The program is administered through contracts with public agencies, and participants must agree to program terms in writing. Participants may be returned to confinement at any time, and no fees are charged for the program. The alternative custody program is administered through contracts with public agencies, and participants must agree to program terms in writing. The secretary or designee assists participants in obtaining health care coverage, including reinstating Medi-Cal benefits or applying for private health plans. The state retains responsibility for medical, dental, and mental health needs not covered by participants' health care coverage. Emergency regulations will be adopted for program participants. If a part of this section is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest of the section that can still be enforced. The provisions of this section are declared to be severable."
