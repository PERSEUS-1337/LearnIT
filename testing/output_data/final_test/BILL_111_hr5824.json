    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Transportation and Housing Affordability Transparency Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that households in location-efficient communities can save on transportation costs, but in auto-dependent areas, high transportation costs leave families with less money for essential expenses. Currently, government affordability measures do not consider transportation costs and savings. Households with annual incomes between $20,000 and $35,000, located far from job centers, spend 70 percent of their incomes on housing and transportation combined. The affordability of assisted housing units near public transit is at risk for low- and moderate-income families by 2012. Over two-thirds of federal subsidies for affordable apartments near public transit will expire in the next 5 years. Local agencies should consider affordable housing when planning economic development and transit projects to ensure housing and transportation costs remain affordable. Preservation of existing affordable housing near public transit should be a priority for local, state, and federal agencies. The Act aims to provide consumers with information on housing costs based on location and recognize transportation costs as a crucial aspect of housing affordability. It seeks to ensure transparency in housing and transportation costs for stakeholders at all levels of government. The Act aims to incorporate transportation costs into housing affordability measures and standards to help communities provide transportation and housing choices for residents. The Transportation Affordability Index is introduced in the Act to include transportation costs in housing affordability measures and standards, aiming to offer residents more transportation and housing choices. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is tasked with developing a transportation affordability index to measure transportation costs associated with home location. This index may utilize existing databases and consider other location-specific costs. The Secretary will consult various stakeholders to develop the transportation affordability index, considering factors like location and proximity to public transportation options within certain distances. The Secretary will consult with the Secretary of Transportation to incorporate bus, transit, and other transportation options into the index. Factors considered include average daily vehicle miles traveled, availability of services within 1/2 mile, proximity to employment centers, residential density, and accessibility to various amenities. The Secretary will make the transportation affordability index publicly available online, for use by real estate services, planning organizations, and housing agencies in developing grant programs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development programs are available to various entities for financial literacy counseling and transportation demand management. The Secretary will report to Congress on opportunities and barriers for developing transportation and housing affordability measures. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will develop an implementation plan for alternative housing affordability measures, convene public workshops for input, conduct pilot projects to test transportation cost feasibility, and disseminate information on housing projects near transportation services. The Secretary will update the transportation affordability index every five years or more frequently if possible. SEC. 4. INCORPORATION INTO AFFORDABILITY MEASURES AND STATE AND LOCAL PLANS. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, will incorporate transportation costs into housing affordability measures for federal housing programs. This will not increase rent burden for tenants or override existing affordability standards. Additionally, the Secretary will provide information and resources to States to support their housing plans. The Secretary will provide information and resources to States to incorporate transportation costs into housing and land use plans, including working with regional and local government entities to integrate housing, transportation, and other costs into long-range plans. The Secretary will also consult with organizations to use affordability indexes for housing assistance. The Secretary will collaborate with federal agencies to include transportation costs in housing affordability indexes. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will conduct a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the transportation affordability index established by the Act within 3 years of its enactment. The evaluation will be updated annually and made publicly available. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Development of Index: $3,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2011. Maintenance and Improvement: $2,000,000 authorized annually from 2012 to 2020 for maintaining, improving, and updating the transportation affordability index. 30% of funds available for outreach. For fiscal year 2013, $1,000,000 is authorized for the initial evaluation of the transportation affordability index. 30 percent of funds are allocated for outreach to promote the index."
