    "content": "The Act titled \"Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1993\" is abbreviated as such. Congress finds that there is sufficient neuroscientific data to show that many severe mental illnesses are actually physical neurobiological disorders with significant abnormalities. American families should have adequate health insurance coverage for treating these disorders, without discrimination compared to other illnesses. Unequal health insurance coverage for neurobiological disorders contributes to the problem. Unequal health insurance coverage for neurobiological disorders contributes to stigmatization. Research advancements in brain function have not benefited many severely mentally ill individuals. Equitable insurance coverage for severe mental disorders could result in significant annual savings. Standards for nondiscriminatory treatment of neurobiological disorders in employer health benefit plans are outlined in Section 3. Employer health benefit plans must provide coverage for essential services for neurobiological disorders in a way that is equitable, not more restrictive than coverage for other major physical illnesses, offers financial protection, and aligns with cost control methods. Plans meeting these standards are deemed compliant. The plan includes stop-loss protection for catastrophic expenses, coverage of facility-based care, outpatient medical management, visits for psychological services, coverage of essential prescription drugs, and medically necessary services for comorbidity. SEC. 4980C. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EMPLOYER HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN STANDARDS FOR NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT FOR NEUROBIOLOGICAL DISORDERS. Imposition of Tax: A tax is imposed on carriers or employer health benefit plans for failing to comply with nondiscriminatory treatment standards for neurobiological disorders. The tax amount can be up to 25% of the coverage amounts received during the non-compliance period, with a limit of $100 per day for individual failures. The tax imposed on carriers for failing to comply with nondiscriminatory treatment standards for neurobiological disorders can be up to $100 per day for each individual affected. The carrier is liable for paying the tax, with exceptions for corrections made within 30 days and waivers granted by the secretary. The Secretary may waive part or all of the tax imposed for failures due to reasonable cause, not willful neglect, if payment would be excessive. Definitions for 'carrier' and 'employer health benefit plan' are provided in the Equitable Health Care for Neurobiological Disorders Act of 1993. Sec. 4980C addresses employer health benefit plan standards for nondiscriminatory treatment for neurobiological disorders, with amendments effective for plan years starting after December 31, 1993. The Act defines \"carrier\" as any entity providing health insurance in a State, including insurance companies, prepaid plans, and health maintenance organizations. \"Employer health benefit plan\" refers to a plan offered to employees through an employer. An employer health benefit plan is a plan offered to employees by an employer, where the employer contributes to the plan. A health benefit plan includes various types of health insurance policies but excludes coverage for accident, dental, vision, disability income, long-term care insurance, or medicare supplemental health insurance. Neurobiological disorder is diagnosed in individuals with conditions like affective disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorders, and autism. It can be covered by medicare supplemental health insurance, liability insurance supplements, worker's compensation, automobile medical-payment insurance, or a combination of these. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will direct the National Institute of Mental Health to conduct a biannual review of the definition of neurobiological disorders, including autism and psychotic disorders, within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. The Institute of Mental Health will consult with extramural researchers to review and recommend revisions to the definition of neurobiological disorders. The Secretary cannot modify the definition until the recommendations are reviewed by the National Advisory Mental Health Council."
