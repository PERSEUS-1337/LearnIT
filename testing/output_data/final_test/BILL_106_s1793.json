    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Decommissioning Assurance Act of 1999\". Congress finds that full, safe decommissioning of nuclear power plants is a compelling Federal interest to guarantee public health and safety and protect the environment. Electric utilities must be able to collect adequate revenues to ensure proper decommissioning in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's authority to ensure utilities can collect enough funds for decommissioning is limited because they do not set electric rates directly. Many decommissioning trust funds are insufficient, and current electric rates may not cover future decommissioning costs. The potential restructuring of the electric utility industry could worsen the situation by putting competitive pressure on rates. There is a Federal interest in establishing a national approach to address these challenges. The Federal interest in establishing a national policy is to ensure that electric utilities owning nuclear power plants can recover funds for decommissioning. The Act aims to guarantee utilities can meet decommissioning obligations set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provide ratemaking bodies with authority to recover funds for decommissioning. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which indicates that the following text will define specific terms or concepts. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms related to decommissioning, including decommission, decommissioning obligation, nuclear decommissioning trust fund, and State commission. The term \"State commission\" is defined in section 3 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796). SEC. 4. Nuclear decommissioning assurance determination by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows licensees to petition for a determination on the adequacy of funds in the decommissioning trust fund and future funding for nuclear power plants. The petition must include current minimum amounts set by the Commission and cost recovery rates. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission allows licensees to petition for a determination on the adequacy of funds in the decommissioning trust fund and future funding for nuclear power plants, including rates, deposits, collection timing, and other relevant information. Within 180 days of receiving a petition, the Commission must issue a determination on the fund's sufficiency. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission considers various factors when determining the adequacy of funds in the decommissioning trust fund for nuclear power plants, including current fund levels, approved rates, assurance of cost recovery, timing of cost recovery, and other relevant information. This ensures full and safe decommissioning of the facility. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission can review the minimum amounts set for decommissioning funds. Notice of findings will be given to the licensee and relevant parties. SEC. 5 of the Federal Power Act is amended to include a declaration regarding the decommissioning of nuclear power plants, stating that federal regulation in this area is necessary in the public interest. Additionally, a new section, SEC. 215, is added to address nuclear decommissioning assurance. The text discusses the process for electric utilities to recover costs related to decommissioning obligations in wholesale rates. It allows utilities owning nuclear power facilities to seek approval from the Commission for rates and charges to ensure adequate funding for decommissioning. Any determination made under the Nuclear Decommissioning Assurance Act of 1999 is considered conclusive in this process. The Nuclear Decommissioning Assurance Act of 1999 allows electric utilities owning nuclear power plants to seek approval for rates and charges to ensure adequate funding for decommissioning. Any determination made under the Act is conclusive, and utilities can seek review if their application is denied. Costs of decommissioning can be recovered in retail rates through a proceeding before a State commission initiated by the utility. The Nuclear Decommissioning Assurance Act of 1999 allows electric utilities owning nuclear power plants to seek approval for rates and charges to ensure adequate funding for decommissioning. The Commission and State commissions must establish rates, terms, and conditions within 180 days of an application submission. Failure to comply is considered a denial and can be appealed. If a State commission denies a request for funding under the Nuclear Decommissioning Assurance Act of 1999, the electric utility can seek relief from the United States district court to establish necessary rates, terms, and conditions for adequate funding."
