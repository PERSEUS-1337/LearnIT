The method involves parameterizing the transition matrix using singular value decomposition (SVD) to control its singular values, effectively solving the gradient problems. The svdRNN method stabilizes gradients and mitigates the vanishing gradient issue, offering a solution applicable to any rectangular weight matrix. The SVD parameterization can be applied to any rectangular weight matrix, including in deep neural networks like multi-layer perceptrons. The parameterization maintains expressive power and simplifies optimization. Experimental results show faster convergence and good generalization, especially with deep networks. Deep neural networks face challenges with vanishing and exploding gradients, especially in RNNs. Methods like LSTM and residual networks have been proposed to address these issues. Recently, orthogonal RNNs have been introduced to enforce orthogonality in transition matrices. However, these methods can limit network expressivity. This paper introduces an efficient solution to optimize deep neural networks. This paper presents an efficient parametrization of weight matrices in deep neural networks to stabilize gradients during training while maintaining network expressivity. The method involves using singular value decomposition (SVD) to track and control singular values, particularly in recurrent neural networks. The proposed svdRNN method imposes spectral constraints on the RNN transition matrix with similar space and time complexity as existing methods. Our proposed svdRNN method imposes spectral constraints on the RNN transition matrix, showing superiority over RNN/oRNN and LSTMs in various tasks. The SVD parametrization simplifies optimization and eliminates gradient issues in deep networks like MLPs and residual networks. In Section 2, related work is discussed, followed by the introduction of the SVD parametrization in Section 3. The svdRNN model is proposed in Section 4 to efficiently control singular values of transition matrices. Non-square weight matrices are addressed in Section 5, and optimization landscape of svdRNN is explored in Section 6. Experimental results on MNIST and time series data are presented in Section 7, with conclusions and future work in Section 8. Various approaches to the vanishing gradient problem are also mentioned, such as LSTM and residual networks. The vanishing gradient problem is addressed by various approaches, including residual networks, gradient clipping, and spectral regularization. Unitary RNN (uRNN) algorithm ensures the transition matrix is unitary by parameterizing it with reflection, diagonal, and Fourier transform matrices. The unitary RNN (uRNN) algorithm ensures the transition matrix is unitary using reflection, diagonal, and Fourier transform matrices. An improvement over uRNN is the orthogonal RNN (oRNN), which uses Householder reflectors to represent an orthogonal transition matrix. However, the strong constraint of orthogonality limits the model's expressivity, leading to the proposal of a factorized RNN where the transition matrix is parameterized by its SVD and updated using geodesic gradient descent. Our work aims to address the gradient vanishing/exploding problem in deep neural networks by showing that being close to orthogonality in recurrent neural networks is sufficient to prevent spurious local optima. Additionally, we consider generalization in training deep neural networks by providing a generalization bound based on a spectral Lipschitz constant. Our work focuses on addressing the gradient vanishing/exploding issue in deep neural networks by emphasizing the importance of orthogonality in recurrent neural networks. We also introduce a generalization bound based on a spectral Lipschitz constant for neural networks, which helps reduce generalization error and sensitivity to adversarial examples. The SVD parametrization allows for efficient constraint of weight matrices, particularly in maintaining the transition matrix of an RNN in its SVD form during training. The Householder reflector is a tool commonly used in numerical linear algebra to update vectors through forward and backward propagation. It is a symmetric and orthogonal matrix with eigenvalues of 1 and -1. Storing a Householder reflector only requires storing the vector u. By combining a series of vectors using Householder reflectors, an orthogonal matrix can be obtained. The Householder reflector is used in numerical linear algebra to update vectors. By combining Householder reflectors, an orthogonal matrix can be obtained. The image of M 1 is the set of all n \u00d7 n orthogonal matrices. Any W \u2208 R n\u00d7n can be expressed as the product of two orthogonal matrices U, V and a diagonal matrix \u03a3. The image of M 1,1 is the set of n \u00d7 n real matrices. The parameterization ensures the RNN's full expressive power by representing any matrix. The svdRNN algorithm applies the SVD parameterization to RNNs, computing hidden states and output vectors. Theorem 3 states that the parameterization covers all orthogonal matrices when the total number of reflectors exceeds a certain threshold. The svdRNN algorithm parametrizes the transition matrix W using Householder reflectors, allowing control over singular values. This offers advantages over regular RNNs, with the ability to balance expressive power and complexity. The choice of reflectors can influence the matrix's singular values, which can be constrained to a small interval near 1. The svdRNN algorithm uses Householder reflectors to control singular values in the transition matrix W, balancing expressive power and complexity. Singular values can be constrained near 1, with a parameterization that includes a penalty term in the objective function. This approach allows for efficient computation without additional cost or memory. The svdRNN algorithm utilizes Householder reflectors to manage singular values in the transition matrix W, optimizing computational efficiency during forward and backward propagation. The computation of W h (t\u22121) involves iterative processes using Householder matrices and a diagonal matrix, resulting in a total cost of O((m 1 + m 2 )n) floating point operations. Back propagation for svdRNN involves computing partial gradients iteratively by analyzing each Householder matrix individually. The svdRNN algorithm uses Householder reflectors for efficient computation in forward and backward propagation. The method extends parameterization to non-square matrices and discusses the time complexity of various algorithms, including Hprod and Hgrad. The scaling of u k in the Householder transform affects gradient updates, with Algorithm 2 requiring 6k flops and Algorithm 3 using (3n + 10k) flops. By reusing \u03b1 in back propagation, 2k flops can be saved. The svdRNN algorithm utilizes Householder reflectors for efficient computation in forward and backward propagation, extending parameterization to non-square matrices. It discusses the time complexity of algorithms like Hprod and Hgrad, with a focus on the scaling of u k in the Householder transform for gradient updates. The method shows that only 2 min(m, n) reflectors are needed to parametrize any m \u00d7 n matrix. The svdRNN algorithm extends parameterization to non-square matrices using Householder reflectors for efficient computation in forward and backward propagation. This method allows for controlling and upper bounding the singular values of the transition matrix, eliminating the exploding gradient problem. It can be applied to various deep learning models such as RNN, MLP, Residual networks, and LSTM. The svdRNN algorithm addresses the exploding gradient problem by controlling singular values. Analytically illustrating its advantages, the linear recurrent neural network simplifies input data and transition weights for efficient computation. The output is further simplified, considering input data relation to output and individual loss. The svdRNN algorithm controls singular values to address the exploding gradient problem in linear recurrent neural networks. It simplifies input data and transition weights for efficient computation, leading to a global minimum in population risk. The SVD parameterization shows advantages in both RNNs and MLPs, with empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness. In this experiment, various models such as RNN, IRNN, oRNN, LSTM, MLP, and ResNet were implemented using different initialization methods and activation functions. The models were trained using the Adam optimizer with stochastic gradient descent. The focus was on time series classification, where RNNs sequentially process the data to predict the correct class at the end of the sequence. The dataset used was a large collection of class-labeled time-series with varying lengths. The experiment focused on implementing various models for time series classification using the UCR time-series collection. The models tested were RNN, LSTM, oRNN, and svdRNN with specific parameters. Dropout was not used in the models to observe the impact on training, leading to some overfitting but showing svdRNN's ability to prevent it. The experiment compared different models for time series classification using the UCR time-series collection. The svdRNN model showed the ability to prevent overfitting and potentially generalize better than other schemes due to its control over spectral norms. The experiment involved testing models on the MNIST image dataset, with accuracy scores shown in Table 2 and test accuracy on networks with different depths illustrated in Figure 2(a)(b). The svdRNN algorithm outperforms other models in terms of test accuracy on networks with different depths. The choice of r does not significantly affect the final precision. The spectral margin of the transition matrix is explored, with larger margins expected to have a greater impact on deeper networks. IRNN shows a small spectral margin initially but deviates from orthogonality, leading to inferior performance compared to oRNN and svdRNN. RNN experiences vanishing gradients in the first 50k iterations, while oRNN and svdRNN are more stable. LSTM, RNN, and svdRNN were tested with different levels of non-linearity using leaky Relu. SvdRNN showed resistance to varying levels of non-linearity, converging faster and achieving higher accuracy regardless of the leak factor. SvdRNN was found to eliminate the gradient vanishing issue, unlike RNN, which struggled with higher non-linearity. Results for various algorithms on the pixel MNIST dataset are shown in Table 2. MLP models with different numbers of layers and hidden dimensions were tested, with svdMLP and svdResNet performing similarly to ResNet on a 40-layer network. However, as the network depth increased, MLP and ResNet struggled, while SVD-based methods remained resilient. MLP failed with more than 35 layers and ResNet with more than 70 layers, whereas SVD-based methods maintained higher precision. In this paper, an efficient SVD parametrization of weight matrices in deep neural networks is proposed to track and control singular values, preventing gradient vanishing and exploding problems. The method allows for fast forward and backward propagation without restricting the network's expressive power. Empirical results show good performance in RNN and MLP frameworks, with potential application to other deep networks like Convolutional Networks. Further experimentation is needed to understand the impact of using different reflectors in the SVD parameterization. The influence of using different reflectors in SVD parameterization is explored, along with investigating the structures of the image of M when k1, k2 = 1. The proof of Proposition 1 shows the factorization desired for n = 1, and the result holds for any n by mathematical induction. The image of M1 is a subset of O(n), and the converse is also true, as shown in the proof of Theorem 1. The proof demonstrates the factorization for n = 1 and holds for any n by mathematical induction. The image of M1 is a subset of O(n), and the converse is also true. Given A \u2208 O(n), there exists an upper triangular matrix R with positive diagonal elements and an orthogonal matrix Q such that A = QR. The proof shows the factorization for n = 1 and extends it by mathematical induction. The image of M m,n * is a subset of R m\u00d7n. For time series classification, datasets are taken from the UCR time series archive, with 20% of the training set used as validation data. Experimental results are provided in TAB3 BID1. The Adding task involves remembering and adding two numbers in a sequence. Experimental results show that shallow networks outperform the baseline, but on longer sequences, IRNN fails and LSTM converges slower. Only svdRNN and oRNN beat the baseline on longer sequences. The experimental results show that svdRNN consistently outperforms all other models on the adding task with multiple layers and hidden dimensions. The first layer gradient of oRNN/svdRNN does not vanish regardless of depth, while IRNN/LSTM's gradient vanishes as depth increases. The network is tasked with copying a sequence with a time lag, and svdRNN beats all other models according to empirical results. The IRNN and LSTM models fail to outperform the baseline with large time lag, indicating they do not retain useful information over time."
