In 1999, 14.8 million Americans used illicit drugs. States face growing demands for drug treatment programs, with methamphetamine abuse on the rise. Methamphetamine accounts for 5.1% of treatment admissions, following cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. Youth are increasingly using methamphetamine, with 2.7 million substance abusers in need of treatment. In California, the average cost to taxpayers per inmate, per year, is $23,406 versus $4,300 for a full treatment program. Drugs and alcohol cost taxpayers nearly $276 billion annually in preventable health care costs, extra law enforcement, auto crashes, crime, and lost productivity. Nationwide, 59% of police chiefs believe that drug offenders should be treated rather than incarcerated. Current treatment programs in San Francisco and Baltimore focus on local drug abuse needs and should be encouraged. States have developed programs for non-violent drug offenders, which should also be supported. Increasing drug treatment prevention programs can effectively address the needs of those seeking treatment before committing a crime. The purpose of this Act is to provide treatment on demand for individuals seeking drug abuse treatment, eliminate waiting lists for treatment, reduce drug-related crimes, and implement alternative drug treatment programs for non-violent offenders. The Act defines a drug treatment program as a licensed community program that includes outpatient treatment, halfway house treatment, narcotic replacement therapy, and drug education. It does not include programs offered in prison or jail facilities.
