    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Moving to Work Charter Program Act of 2006\" and authorizes the Moving to Work Charter Program. The Moving to Work Charter Program Act of 2006 aims to provide flexibility for public housing agencies and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to implement cost-effective approaches for housing assistance, reduce administrative burdens, incentivize work for assisted families, increase housing choices for low-income families, and enhance independent living for low-income elderly residents and persons with disabilities. The Moving to Work Charter Program Act of 2006 authorizes the Secretary to enter into charter contracts with up to 250 public housing agencies starting in fiscal year 2007. By the end of fiscal year 2007, at least 80 public housing agencies must have charter contracts in place. The Moving to Work Charter Program Act of 2006 allows the Secretary to enter into charter contracts with public housing agencies. By the end of fiscal year 2008, at least 160 agencies must have charter contracts, and by the end of fiscal year 2009, at least 250 agencies must have charter contracts. Charter contracts supersede annual contributions contracts and provide benefits to participating agencies. The agency shall receive capital and operating assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937 and assistance provided under section 8 of the same Act. This assistance can be combined and must be used to provide locally designed housing assistance for low-income families, including services to facilitate the transition. The Moving to Work Charter program allows public housing agencies to undertake activities authorized by State or local law, excluding certain provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The Moving to Work Charter program allows public housing agencies to participate in activities authorized by State or local law. Certain provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937 apply to housing assisted under a charter contract, excluding housing solely occupied by families receiving tenant-based rental assistance. Public housing developed under the Act is subject to Section 18 regardless of its use under a charter contract. Charter contracts specify that agencies can combine assistance received. The Moving to Work Charter program allows public housing agencies to combine assistance received under sections 8 and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for housing assistance and related services. Agencies must certify citizen participation in their application for participation in the program. The Moving to Work Charter program requires public housing agencies to consider public comments, ensure 75% of assisted families are very low-income, and establish a reasonable rent policy. The Moving to Work Charter program requires public housing agencies to establish a reasonable rent policy that encourages employment, self-sufficiency, and homeownership, includes transition and hardship provisions, is included in the annual plan, and allows for public participation. Additionally, agencies must continue to assist a similar number of low-income families as they would have without entering into such contracts. The agency entering into a contract must maintain a comparable mix of families, ensure housing quality standards are met, receive training and technical assistance, and not have their assistance diminished under the United States Housing Act. In selecting agencies for the Moving to Work Charter program, the Secretary considers their potential, performance under the Housing Act, diversity, and other relevant factors. The agency must maintain a mix of families, meet housing standards, receive training, and not have their assistance reduced. Each public housing agency under a charter contract must submit an annual charter report to the Secretary, as the sole means of reporting on assisted activities, as specified by the Secretary. Each public housing agency under a charter contract must submit an annual charter report to the Secretary, documenting the use of assistance, analyzing the impact of assisted activities, and certifying the preparation of an annual plan with goals and objectives. The annual charter report submitted by public housing agencies under a charter contract to the Secretary must include goals, objectives, proposed use of assistance, how activities will meet goals, budget and financial statements, and compliance with a public process. The annual charter report submitted by public housing agencies under a charter contract must describe how residents and the community can participate in the development of the annual plan, including a public hearing. The report must also include any additional information required by the Secretary. If the report is not disapproved within 45 days, it is deemed approved. The Secretary may determine non-compliance based on the report or inconsistent information. Public housing agencies must keep records for the Moving to Work Charter program and ensure compliance. The Secretary has access to these documents. The Secretary has access to documents for audit and examination related to assistance and requirements under this section. Access is limited to information from the annual charter report, unless non-compliance is suspected. The Comptroller General of the United States also has access to documents. The Comptroller General of the United States, or authorized representative, has access to books, documents, and records for audit related to the Moving to Work Charter program. State or local procurement laws conflicting with federal requirements do not apply to public housing agencies under the program. The Secretary can approve procurement procedures for these agencies to reduce administrative burdens. The Moving to Work Charter program allows public housing agencies to have procurement procedures approved to reduce administrative burdens. Public housing agencies under the program are not subject to conflicting subsequent laws unless expressly provided. Existing agreements with the Secretary are honored regardless of any other laws. The Moving to Work Charter program allows public housing agencies to continue operating under existing agreements with the Secretary or enter into charter contracts with favorable terms. By the end of fiscal year 2007, the Secretary will appoint a Federal advisory committee consisting of public housing agencies with charter contracts. A committee will be established by the Secretary, consisting of various stakeholders in the public housing industry, to develop a demonstration program for a national public housing agency accreditation system. A report with recommendations for the establishment of this system is due by the end of fiscal year 2009."
