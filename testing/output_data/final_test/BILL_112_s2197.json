    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fairness in Disclosure of Evidence Act of 2012\" and includes a duty to disclose favorable information. Chapter 201 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a duty to disclose favorable information in criminal prosecutions brought by the United States. Covered information refers to data that may benefit the defendant in determining guilt, preliminary matters, or sentencing. The prosecution team, including the Executive agency, must adhere to this requirement. In criminal prosecutions brought by the United States, there is a duty to disclose favorable information. This duty applies to the prosecution team, including any entity or individual acting on behalf of the United States. In criminal prosecutions brought by the United States, the attorney for the Government must provide the defendant with any covered information in their possession without delay after arraignment and before any guilty plea. This duty applies to the prosecution team and includes information that is known or would become known with due diligence. The defendant must be provided with covered information by the prosecution team promptly after arraignment, regardless of a guilty plea. This requirement applies despite other laws, with classified information handled according to specific procedures. Protective orders can be issued to prevent immediate disclosure of such information to the defendant. The court may delay disclosure of covered information to a defendant if it could impeach a witness and disclosing it would threaten the safety of the witness or others. The court may delay disclosing covered information to a defendant until a reasonable time before trial or when the requirement ceases to exist. The United States can file a motion under seal to protect a potential witness's identity, but not ex parte. The defendant must be provided with a summary of any undisclosed portion of a motion filed under this subsection to ensure a meaningful opportunity to be heard. A defendant cannot waive a provision of this section except in open court, and the court must determine if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily offered in the interests of justice. Before judgment, if the Government's attorney fails to comply with specific subsections, the court can order a show cause why the United States is not in compliance. If noncompliance is found, the court will determine the extent and reason for it. Remedies may be required in such cases. If the United States fails to disclose information as required by specific subsections, the court can order remedies such as postponement of proceedings, exclusion of evidence, ordering a new trial, or dismissal. In fashioning a remedy for failure to disclose information, the court considers factors like seriousness of the violation, impact on the proceeding, intent, and effectiveness of alternative remedies. The court may order the United States to pay for costs and expenses incurred by the defendant if a violation was due to negligence, recklessness, or knowing conduct. This includes attorney's fees. In cases of negligence, recklessness, or knowing conduct, the court may order the United States to pay for costs and expenses incurred by the defendant, including attorney's fees. Qualifying entities for representation include Federal Public Defender Organizations, Community Defender Organizations, and funds for financially unable individuals. Costs and expenses ordered by the court shall be paid by the Executive agency bringing the prosecution.

Costs and expenses ordered by the court shall be paid by the Executive agency bringing the prosecution. The Judiciary may receive reimbursement from appropriations accounts to carry out section 3006A. In appellate proceedings, errors not in compliance with this section must be shown to not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. Technical and conforming amendments are made to the United States Code, including adding a new section on duty to disclose favorable information and amending demands for production of statements and reports of witnesses."
