    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Prohibition of Cigarette Vending Machines Accessible to Minors in Federal Buildings and Lands Act.\" It includes findings related to the issue. The Congress finds that cigarette smoking and the use of tobacco products are major health hazards causing over 420,000 deaths annually, with significant costs to the United States in healthcare expenses. Tobacco products contain harmful additives and nicotine, making them addictive and poisonous. Despite state laws prohibiting sales to minors, enforcement has been ineffective. The use of tobacco products among minors in the United States remains poorly regulated, with little progress made in reducing teenage smoking rates. Most smokers start before the age of 18, and a significant number of cigarettes are illegally sold to minors annually. Tobacco use is linked to illicit drug use, and the Federal Government plays a crucial role in discouraging tobacco use among minors. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"Federal agency\" refers to Executive agencies and specified entities, \"Federal building\" includes structures owned by the United States or a Federal agency, \"minor\" is an individual under 18 years, and \"tobacco product\" includes cigarettes and cigars.
