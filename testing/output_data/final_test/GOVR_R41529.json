    "content": "Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, effective since July 21, 2010, authorizes the Federal Reserve to supervise and regulate payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) activities in the financial sector. These activities facilitate various financial transactions such as retail purchases, securities trades, and foreign exchange transactions. PCS systems play a critical role in the economy, with large-value payment systems in the US processing transactions worth $1.06 quadrillion in 2011. The U.S. financial system faced a crisis in 2008 with major institutions like Lehman Brothers and AIG needing government assistance to stay afloat. Systemic risk, where the failure of one firm can disrupt the entire system, was a concern. AIG's crisis was due to its subsidiary's involvement in credit default swaps. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York worked to improve the OTC derivatives market infrastructure, addressing inefficiencies and lack of transparency. Alan Greenspan criticized the reliance on paper records for transactions. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulatory authorities oversaw certain financial transaction systems. Title VIII incorporates recommendations from previous and current authorities. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act gives regulatory oversight authority to the Federal Reserve, SEC, and CFTC for financial market utilities that process various financial transactions in the U.S. economy. It focuses on systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement systems and activities. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act grants regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve, SEC, and CFTC for financial market utilities processing various financial transactions in the U.S. economy. It specifically targets systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement systems and activities, without centralizing approval authority for new utilities or activities. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act grants regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve, SEC, and CFTC for financial market utilities processing various financial transactions in the U.S. economy. Recently, the Federal Reserve released a final rule regarding FMUs, with FSOC designating eight FMUs as systemically important. Title VIII primarily addresses the regulatory framework for payment and settlement systems, while Title VII focuses on derivatives clearing systems and activities for OTC swap transactions. Some Representatives opposed Title VIII, expressing concerns about the supervision of the U.S. financial infrastructure. The report discusses the oversight authority of financial market utilities (FMUs) and financial institution regulators before the enactment of S. 3497, which seeks to repeal Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. This title grants regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve, SEC, and CFTC for FMUs processing financial transactions in the U.S. economy. Some concerns were raised about the supervision of the U.S. financial infrastructure and the discretionary authority given to the Federal Reserve. The report discusses the oversight authority of FMUs and FIs before the Dodd-Frank Act, and the changes made by Title VIII, including the new regulatory authority of the Fed. It also addresses the implementation of Title VIII by relevant agencies and its impact on FMUs and FIs. The Federal Reserve and private sector operate systems for financial transactions in the U.S., some of which have been designated as systemically important. Additional information on selected systems is provided in an Appendix. New financial products and transactions could lead to further developments in the future. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designated eight Financial Market Utilities (FMUs) as systemically important on July 18, 2012. Each FMU was assigned a supervisory agency based on their specific activities. The designated FMUs include The Clearing House Payments Company, CLS Bank, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Clearing, Depository Trust Company (DTC), and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Government Securities Division (GSD) and the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (MBSD) are supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ICE Trust handles credit default swaps and is supervised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) and The Options Clearing Corporation for equity derivatives are also supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Clearing House operates CHIPS and EPN systems, while DTCC operates the Depository Trust Company (DTC) for clearing and custody of various securities in the U.S. These entities form the primary infrastructure for clearing and settlement of transactions involving equities, debt, bonds, and government securities in the U.S. The Federal Reserve Banks provide various wholesale payment services, including Fedwire Funds Service, Fedwire Securities Service, National Settlement Service, and FedACH Service. These services were established in the early 1900s to transfer funds between accounts in different Federal Reserve Districts. In 1981, the Federal Reserve was mandated to price most of its financial services and provide nonmember depository institutions with direct access to these services. The services offered by the Federal Reserve Banks cover equities, corporate debt, municipal bonds, money market instruments, and government securities. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) may adjust the list of designated payment, clearing, and settlement (PCS) systems as needed. The Fedwire services facilitate the transfer of funds and securities nationwide, including real-time settlement between banks and government agencies. The Fedwire Securities Service provides issuance, settlement, and transfer services for U.S. Treasury securities. The National Settlement Service is used by clearinghouses and financial exchanges for multilateral settlement. Transactions are processed in real-time and are final and irrevocable when settled, contributing to the efficiency of Federal Reserve open market operations. The Fedwire Securities Service is crucial for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy through open market operations. The FSOC designated private sector FMUs in 2012, reaffirming international risk-management standards. Other smaller PCS systems, like DTCC, operate essential but non-systemically important services in the U.S. The United States has various PCS systems, including Euro CCP, AVOX, and FICC. Foreign-based systems like SWIFT and LCH.Clearnet also provide services for U.S. financial actors. The infrastructure in the U.S. for these activities is operated by the Federal Reserve and the private sector. PCS activities can be conducted through central parties like the Fed or clearinghouses, or bilaterally between financial institutions. Title VIII covers payment systems, clearing systems, and settlement systems. Payment systems transfer funds electronically, clearing systems transfer credit risk, and settlement systems complete transactions like securities trades. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems has defined standard payment system terminology. The CPSS has defined standard payment system terminology as a system of instruments, banking procedures, and interbank funds transfer systems that circulate money. In the US, the Federal Reserve Banks and private sector operate retail payment systems for consumer transactions, including ACH and debit/credit card transactions. ACH is an EFT system used for credit and debit transactions like direct deposit and bill payments. It is the primary system for federal payments and is governed by NACHA and the Federal Reserve. In 2011, over 20.2 billion ACH payments were made. Wholesale funds transfer systems like Fedwire and CHIPS are used for various financial activities such as securities transactions, loan disbursements, and real estate settlements. These systems handle large per-transaction values with a small number of daily transactions and provide final clearing and settlement for retail payment systems. Financial institutions use intra-bank systems to process large-value payment orders internally and interface with Fedwire and CHIPS. A clearing system facilitates the exchange of payment instructions or financial obligations among financial institutions at a central location. It includes procedures for netting participant obligations for settlement. The term \"clearing\" involves transmitting and reconciling payment orders or security transfer instructions before settlement. Clearing houses in the United States process securities and derivatives transactions. Clearing corporations act as intermediaries, guarantee transaction completion, and hold ownership records of securities. Depositories like the Depository Trust Company (DTC) hold securities certificates and make deliveries for settlements. The Depository Trust Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of The Depository & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) that operates the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). FICC clears government and mortgage-backed securities through its divisions, the Government Securities Division (GSD) and the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (MBSD). The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), also a DTCC subsidiary, provides clearing and settlement services for corporate and municipal securities. In the futures and options markets, a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) must register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide clearing services for futures contracts and options. A DCO enables counterparties in derivatives transactions to transfer credit risk to the clearing house through novation. There were 25 DCOs registered with the CFTC as of August 2012. Settlement involves the transfer of securities or financial instruments from the seller to the buyer, along with the transfer of money. Settlement systems facilitate these transfers, with real-time gross settlement systems processing transactions individually in real time. Securities settlement systems play a crucial role in facilitating the transfer of funds or financial instruments. Securities settlement systems in the United States involve the Federal Reserve Banks and private sector operating different systems for securities transactions. Major securities markets include government securities, corporate equities, bonds, money market instruments, and municipal bonds. Depository institutions play key roles in securities clearing and settlement processes. Depository institutions in the U.S. play various roles in clearing and settlement transactions for government securities. Trading in government securities is done over-the-counter, and the Federal Reserve operates the National Book-Entry System for issuing and transferring these securities. The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation also supports the selling and trading of U.S. government securities. The selling and trading of U.S. government securities, corporate equities, bonds, commercial paper, and municipal bonds occur on established U.S. exchanges and over-the-counter markets. The National Securities Clearing Corporation provides clearing and settlement services for broker-to-broker trades. Concerns about risks related to payment, securities, and financial transactions are addressed in Section 802 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Financial market utilities conducting multilateral payment, securities, and financial transactions may reduce risks but also create new ones. Congress and administrations have recognized the need to regulate and supervise systemically important utilities to reduce systemic risk and promote safety. Heightened supervision by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury has been proposed to address concerns about payment and settlement systems. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has concerns about payment and settlement systems contributing to financial crises, posing a threat to financial markets. Systemic risk is defined by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland as firms with significant spillover effects that could destabilize the financial system. Factors for designating firms as systemically important include contagion, correlation, concentration, and conditions. The International Monetary Fund defines systemic risk as large losses induced by the failure of interconnected institutions. Systemic risk is addressed in the Dodd-Frank Act through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and regulation of systemically significant firms. Payment and settlement systems can increase systemic risk by transmitting financial disruptions. The global infrastructure consists of interconnected systems involving financial market utilities, institutions, and participants. Risks in payment and settlement systems can lead to losses for entities, counterparties, and customers. Financial institutions face risks from disruptions in financial activities, leading to credit losses or replacement costs. Failed trades or operational outages can result in lost revenue for the entity and additional costs for customers and counterparties. Settlement institutions may share risks with participants through loss-sharing arrangements. Interdependencies among entities can further amplify these risks. Interdependencies among financial institutions can lead to disruptions spreading quickly and widely, fueled by factors like globalization, consolidation, and technological advances. The 2008 financial crisis highlighted how failures in large institutions can transmit disruptions through various systems. During the recent financial crisis, international banking regulators noted that financial market infrastructures performed well, helping to prevent the crisis from worsening. Robust infrastructures enable settlement without significant counterparty risk, maintaining market liquidity during financial stress. Some argue that central clearing houses in derivatives transactions pose systemic risk, especially with the clearing of swaps under Title VII provisions. Academics are studying whether central clearing counterparties reduce counterparty risk, as indicated in Title VIII by Congress. In Title VIII, Congress highlighted the importance of well-designed financial market utilities to mitigate risks. The Federal Reserve identifies credit, liquidity, operational, and legal risks in payment and settlement systems. Credit risk involves a counterparty not settling obligations, liquidity risk is the failure to settle on time, operational risk stems from internal or external failures, and legal risk arises from unexpected legal or regulatory issues. Financial institutions involved in wholesale payments face risks such as loss due to unexpected laws or regulations, inability to enforce contracts, and potential systemic risk. Regulators expect these institutions to have effective risk management policies to protect against significant losses, reputation, and strategic risks. They must also manage legal and compliance risks related to economic sanctions and reporting requirements. Operational risks include internal controls, audit, information security, business continuity planning, and vendor management. Security risk in financial institutions can arise from intra-bank funds transfers, specifically in the wire room responsible for payment orders. Prior to Title VIII, supervisory agencies like the Federal Reserve oversaw payment systems with a patchwork of authorities. In 2008, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System requested authority from Congress to oversee systemically important payment and settlement systems, emphasizing the need for effective risk management. Prior to Title VIII, regulatory authorities in the US and internationally called for stronger oversight of financial infrastructure for these systems. The US Department of the Treasury recommended giving oversight of systemically important payment and settlement systems to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, along with regulators and the private sector, worked to strengthen financial infrastructures before the Dodd-Frank Act. In 2005, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York led an initiative to enhance clearing and settling of credit default swaps and other OTC derivatives. They also collaborated with the private sector to improve oversight of tri-party repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve had oversight responsibilities for key private-sector infrastructure systems before the Dodd-Frank Act, including CHIPS, CLS, DTCC, ICE Trust, and SWIFT. The Federal Reserve oversees firms and their payment and settlement activities, acting as the lender of last resort. Other regulatory agencies also supervise payment and settlement systems, such as DTC regulated by the New York State Banking Department, the Federal Reserve, and the SEC. The Federal Reserve Board sets policy and supervises key payment and settlement systems like the Fedwire Funds Service and the Fedwire Securities Service. The Federal Reserve Board oversees payment and settlement systems like the Fedwire Services and conducts regular reviews against international standards. Prudential regulators include the CFTC, SEC, and federal bank regulatory agencies. Before the Dodd-Frank Act, clearing agencies were regulated by the SEC as self-regulating organizations with registration requirements. The SEC regulated clearing agencies as self-regulating organizations with registration requirements. Clearing agencies established rules for their industry and had to self-enforce compliance. The CFTC oversaw derivatives clearing organizations, which had to register and comply with core principles under the Commodities Exchange Act. The CFTC oversees derivatives clearing organizations, which must comply with core principles under the Commodities Exchange Act. The Federal Reserve's PSR Policy addresses risks in payment and settlement activities, setting out minimum standards for risk management. Regulation F requires insured depository institutions to establish policies to avoid excessive exposures in clearing and settlement of payments. The 2003 Interagency Paper on Sound Practices aimed to enhance the resilience of the U.S. financial system post-9/11. A 2008 agreement between the Federal Reserve, CFTC, and SEC focused on cooperation for regulating central counterparties. The CFTC also collaborated with the UK FSA on derivatives clearing organizations. In 2009, the CFTC and FSA signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on clearing organizations. International banking regulators have taken actions to identify risks related to payment and settlement systems. The CPSS, established in 1990, promotes sound payment and securities settlement systems and acts as an international standard-setting body. The CPSS promotes sound payment and securities settlement systems and monitors developments in domestic and cross-border systems. It sets standards for systemically important payment systems, securities settlement systems, and central counterparties. In 2010, a review was launched to strengthen these standards. The CPSS also publishes policy reports on various financial market infrastructure issues. The CPSS oversees payment and settlement systems, including repo markets, and sets international standards for financial market infrastructures. Reports from 2010 and 2012 introduced more demanding standards for clearing and settlement arrangements, raising minimum risk requirements and providing specific guidance. The CPSS introduced new standards for clearing and settlement arrangements, encouraging members to adopt them by the end of 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes regulatory oversight for systemically important financial activities and PCS systems, including OTC derivatives markets. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act regulates clearing of bilateral swap transactions through clearinghouses, strengthening oversight of clearing entities by the CFTC and SEC. The Senate passed a financial reform bill with a similar title to Title VIII, based on proposed legislation from the Obama Administration. The House Financial Services Committee considered but removed a similar title before the House of Representatives' consideration of the bill. During the Conference Committee, changes were made to enhance the authority of the CFTC and SEC regarding their supervised entities. Title VIII defines systemically important entities and the potential risks to the financial system. The CFTC and SEC were given rule-writing authority for risk management standards. Title VIII of the federal agency defines designated financial market utilities and excludes certain registered trading entities and data repositories from its scope. The Title VIII of the federal agency defines designated financial market utilities and excludes certain registered trading entities and data repositories from its scope, including national securities exchanges and swap execution facilities. Exclusions also apply to intermediaries such as brokers, dealers, transfer agents, and investment companies, limited to their named business functions. Additionally, designated clearing entities, systemically important DCOs and CAs overseen by the CFTC and SEC, are excluded from the financial institutions definition. The Title VIII of the federal agency defines designated financial market utilities and excludes certain registered trading entities and data repositories from its scope. The exclusion applies to systemically important DCOs and CAs overseen by the CFTC and SEC. The newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council plays a role in the enhanced regulatory oversight framework in Title VIII. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, including the Secretary of the Treasury as Chairperson, the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board, and heads of other agencies, has the authority to designate financial market utilities or PCS activities as systemically important with a 2/3 vote. The Council can also rescind such designations and considers various factors in making these determinations. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has the authority to designate financial market utilities or PCS activities as systemically important with a 2/3 vote. Factors considered include the monetary value of transactions, exposure to counterparties, relationships with other financial utilities, and the impact of failure on critical markets. Advance notice and opportunity for a hearing are provided to the utility or financial institution. Procedural safeguards may be waived with a 2/3 vote to prevent immediate threats. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can designate financial market utilities or PCS activities as systemically important with a 2/3 vote, including the Chairperson if needed to prevent immediate threats. The Council must make a final determination within 60 days of any hearing or 30 days after the opportunity to request a hearing expires. The Council may extend time periods for consultation, notice, and hearings. The Council can request information from utilities or financial institutions to assess systemic importance. Title VIII aligns with international banking authorities' view that oversight of payment and settlement systems is a central bank's core responsibility. Section 805 of Title VIII authorizes the Fed, except for designated clearing entities. Section 805 of Title VIII authorizes the Fed to prescribe risk management standards for systemically important financial market utilities and financial institutions engaged in PCS activities. The CFTC and SEC may also prescribe similar regulations for designated clearing entities, taking into consideration relevant international standards and prudential requirements. The Fed, CFTC, and SEC may impose risk management standards on entities engaged in PCS activities, addressing areas such as risk management policies, margin requirements, default procedures, clearing and settlement capabilities, and financial resource requirements for financial market utilities. If objections arise, the Council will decide on the applicable standards with a 2/3 vote. The Fed, CFTC, and SEC can set risk management standards for financial market utilities, including margin requirements and financial resource thresholds. Certain areas like clearing requirements and trade execution are excluded from their authority. Federal Reserve standards override less stringent requirements, and certain services apply to designated utilities. Title VIII of the Federal Reserve Act grants designated utilities certain privileges, such as accounts at Federal Reserve Banks, earnings on balances, exemption from reserve requirements, and access to discount and borrowing privileges in exceptional circumstances. Additionally, systemically important financial market utilities must follow specific procedures when proposing changes to their operations. The designated utility must provide its Supervisory Agency with advance notice of proposed changes that could affect risks. The agency can object within 60 days, preventing the change. Emergency changes can be made for safe service provision. Section 807 mandates annual examinations by the Supervisory Agency to assess compliance with Title VIII. The Fed has a role in examinations and enforcement for compliance with Title VIII. Title VIII allows the Fed to conduct examinations of systemically important utilities and take enforcement actions with the Council's approval to prevent risks to financial markets and stability. The Fed may recommend enforcement actions and, with Council approval, take action against designated utilities in case of imminent harm to the financial system. Section 808 authorizes financial regulators to act on financial institutions. Title VIII authorizes the Fed to examine systemically important utilities for compliance with regulations, with the ability to consult with other regulators and enforce actions. The Fed can also exercise back-up examination and enforcement authority with Council approval if there is reasonable cause to believe a financial institution is not compliant. This extends enforcement provisions to financial market utilities as if they were insured depository institutions. Title VIII authorizes the Fed to oversee systemically important utilities and financial institutions to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability. The Fed is granted enhanced supervisory authority to establish uniform risk management standards, but regulatory and supervisory authority of the CFTC and SEC is maintained for designated clearing entities. The Fed must consult with primary supervisors and obtain Council approval for certain actions, while the Council must also coordinate with other agencies. Title VIII grants the Federal Reserve enhanced supervisory authority over systemically important utilities and financial institutions to mitigate systemic risk. The Fed must coordinate with prudential regulators and consult with primary supervisors, but can take actions independently in some cases. The Financial Stability Oversight Council must also coordinate with other agencies for regulatory decisions. Title VIII grants the Federal Reserve enhanced supervisory authority over systemically important utilities and financial institutions to mitigate systemic risk. The Fed, Council, Supervisory Agency, and appropriate financial regulator are authorized to promptly notify each other of material concerns and share reports under Section 809(e). Coordination of examination and enforcement authority is required, except in limited circumstances. Standards prescribed by the Fed supersede less stringent requirements under other authority. Title VIII grants the Federal Reserve enhanced supervisory authority over systemically important utilities and financial institutions to mitigate systemic risk. The Conference Committee added provisions limiting the Fed's role with entities supervised by the CFTC and SEC. The CFTC and SEC can prescribe risk management standards for clearing entities, which the Fed can override with Council approval. Coordination with the Fed is required for exercising certain authorities, including rulemaking. FSOC finalized rules for Title VIII on July 18, 2011. FSOC finalized rules for Title VIII on July 18, 2011, authorizing the designation of systemically important financial market utilities. The Federal Reserve released its final rule on July 30, 2012, prescribing risk management standards for these utilities to mitigate systemic risk. The final rule implements risk management standards for Financial Market Utilities (FMUs) and standards for notifying changes that alter risks. Title VIII grants additional authority to the CFTC and SEC to regulate designated clearing entities. Dodd-Frank Act Section 805 allows for regulations on risk management standards for these entities. The Fed, CFTC, and SEC have outlined rules governing their new authorities over designated clearing entities and activities by financial institutions. The Council makes final decisions with a 2/3 vote, and enhanced risk management standards have been established. Title VIII covers the infrastructure for clearing OTC derivatives under the Dodd-Frank regulatory framework. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the clearing of certain OTC derivatives through central counterparties, with rules to be implemented by the CFTC and SEC. This could lead to systemic importance designations under Title VIII for financial market utilities involved in clearing OTC derivatives, subjecting them to additional supervision and compliance requirements. Systemically important financial institutions may also face increased oversight and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may have increased oversight over payment system infrastructures, especially with the development of new technologies for financial transactions. The impact of Title VIII on entities will vary based on their current supervision status and whether they fall under the regulatory framework established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The impact of Title VIII on entities will depend on their current supervision status and whether they fall under the regulatory framework established by the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulatory actions by various agencies will also play a role in determining the extent of oversight and requirements for financial market utilities and institutions."
