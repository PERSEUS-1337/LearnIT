    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3003 of the Penal Code is amended to specify that an inmate released on parole or postrelease supervision shall be returned to their last legal residence county, excluding where the offense was committed while incarcerated. An inmate may be returned to another county if it is in the best interests of the public. The parole authority must provide written reasons for the decision, considering factors like victim protection and community safety. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may transfer an inmate to another county based on factors such as public concern, work or educational opportunities, family support, lack of necessary treatment programs, and community safety considerations. The paroling authority considers releasing inmates to the county where their joint venture program employer is located if the employer intends to employ them upon release. The Department of Corrections provides local law enforcement with information on paroled inmates, including their name, address, and contact officer details. Contact officer and unit details required for parolees, including name, telephone number, and unit type. Also, a digitized image and fingerprint of the parolee, as well as a geographic coordinate of their residence location for GIS use. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation electronically transmits inmate information to county agencies for post-release supervision, including tuberculosis status, medical and mental health needs, and disabilities. Transmission complies with HIPAA and HITECH regulations. The provision in paragraph 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations will only take effect after approval from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, ensuring it is not preempted by HIPAA. The information required for statewide parolee database shall be provided in a computer-readable format for local law enforcement agencies. Unauthorized release of this information is a violation of Section 11143. An inmate released on parole cannot be placed within 35 miles of a victim or witness of a violent felony or a felony involving great bodily harm if requested by the victim or witness for safety reasons. An inmate released on parole for a violation of Section 288 or 288.5 deemed high risk by the Department of Corrections cannot reside within half a mile of a school during parole. An inmate released on parole for a stalking offense may not be placed within 35 miles of the victim's residence or workplace if requested for additional distance for safety reasons. If unable to be placed in their county of legal residence, the supervising agency can transfer them to another county. The authority considers equitable distribution of parolees and out-of-county commitments when making parole decisions. Inmates may be paroled to another state, and coordination is required for placement on postrelease community supervision. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is responsible for implementing the Law Enforcement Automated Data System (LEADS) and supervising inmates released to postrelease community supervision. County agencies must provide requested information to ensure accurate inmate data. County agencies designated for supervision must notify the department by August 1, 2011. The Department of Justice is responsible for releasing information related to fingerprint cards under LEADS. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation must provide data for the supervised release file in CLETS, notifying law enforcement of persons on postrelease community supervision. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
