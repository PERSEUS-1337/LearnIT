    "content": "The legislation is known as the \"Puerto Rico Admission Act\" and includes findings related to Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Admission Act acknowledges that Puerto Rico has a population of over 3.4 million US citizens who lack equal treatment in Federal law and representation in the national government. The majority of residents in Puerto Rico desire to replace their territory status. Residents in Puerto Rico are seeking to replace their territory status with a permanent form of government that allows for equality and democratic representation in national laws. A plebiscite showed a majority supporting statehood and a transition to equality within the Union of States. Public Law 113-76 responded to this by providing for a plebiscite under Federal law on options proposed by the Elections Commission. The Governor, Legislative Assembly, and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico seek equality and permanence within the United States. Puerto Rico is treated as a State for most laws but lacks equal treatment in various statutes, including those related to health programs and revenue measures. Puerto Rico has been under-developed and in economic depression for decades, leading many residents to move to the mainland for better opportunities. Equality within the United States is crucial for Puerto Rico's social and economic well-being, as well as for democratic reasons. Puerto Ricans have made significant contributions to the nation and transitioning Puerto Rico to equality within the Union is necessary. The policy of the United States allows Puerto Rico to choose between becoming a State or a nation through a plebiscite. If Puerto Ricans choose statehood, Federal laws will be amended to treat Puerto Rico equally with the States by January 3, 2025. In the November 2024 election, Puerto Rico will be considered a State for elector purposes. The number of electors from Puerto Rico will be based on its Congressional representation during the One Hundred Nineteenth Congress. Additionally, the number of Representatives in the House of Representatives will increase at the start of the One Hundred Nineteenth Congress. The number of Representatives in the House of Representatives will be increased based on the population of Puerto Rico in the 2020 census. Puerto Rico will be entitled to additional seats, with elections for Senators and Representatives scheduled for November 2024. The new Representatives will take office in January 2025. The Senate will assign classes to new Senators taking office on January 3, 2025. The Resident Commissioner positions will be repealed effective the same date. Puerto Rico can hold primary elections for federal office positions as long as they comply with election laws. The President will issue a proclamation admitting Puerto Rico into the Union on January 3, 2025, on equal footing with other States. Upon the admission of Puerto Rico into the Union as a State, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will be accepted as the Constitution of the State. The State will consist of all the territory and waters of Puerto Rico. Current government officials will continue to serve, and all laws of Puerto Rico will remain in force, subject to modification by the Legislative Assembly and Governor of Puerto Rico. Upon admission as a State, Puerto Rico's laws will align with federal laws, ensuring equal treatment with other states."
