    "content": "Funding for House committees (except for the Committee on Appropriations) is authorized through a two-step process of authorization and appropriation. The House adopted H.Res. 173 on March 17, 2017, authorizing a total of $266.3 million for committee expenses in the 115th Congress. Committee funds are subject to chamber rules and regulations. The regulations governing committee funds in the House are outlined in various sources such as statutes, House rules, and committee resolutions. Committee funds can only be used for official committee business and not for personal or campaign purposes. Quarterly reports on committee spending are published in the Statements of Disbursement of the House. The report is divided into three sections, covering the committee funding process, funding levels since 1996, and House floor and committee action on committee funding in the 115th Congress. The final section analyzes committee funding spending patterns during six previous years in the 115th Congress. Operating budgets for House committees are authorized biennially through an omnibus resolution, with appropriations included in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. The Committee on House Administration reports an omnibus resolution to authorize expenses for all standing and select committees, except the Committee on Appropriations. The omnibus committee funding resolution sets dollar amount limits for House committees every two years, excluding the Appropriations Committee. This resolution does not appropriate funds but specifies how much of the allocated amount can be used by each committee. Committees must submit operating budget requests for the two-year Congress period in preparation for the omnibus resolution. The chair of each committee introduces a House resolution with their proposed authorization for the operating budget request for the two years of a Congress. Committees approve their budgets at a committee organizing meeting in late February. The Committee on House Administration holds hearings on each committee's request, with the chair and ranking minority member testifying. After hearings, the omnibus funding resolution is introduced for the two-year Congress, serving as the legislative vehicle for committee markup. The omnibus resolution serves as the legislative vehicle for committee markup and is typically reported out of committee without amendment. It is considered by the House in March of the first session of a Congress with little debate. House Rule X, clause 7, authorizes interim funding for House committees between January 3 and March 31 of an odd-numbered year. Funding for all House committees is included in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, provided as a single total amount for all committees except the Committee on Appropriations. Funding for House committees is included in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill as a single total amount for all committees (except the Committee on Appropriations). The authorization and appropriations for committee funds do not align due to biennial authorizations and annual appropriations. Funds can be drawn from money appropriated in three different fiscal years. Appropriations are made annually, with funding remaining available until the end of the second calendar year of the current Congress. Funds for House committees are appropriated biennially and remain available until the end of the second calendar year of the current Congress. House Rule X requires fair treatment of the minority party in committee staff appointments. The House majority leadership encourages one-third of committee staff and resources to be allocated to the minority. Aggregate committee funding levels from 1996 to 2018 are shown in Figure 2. Aggregate committee funding levels increased from $79.4 million in 1996 to $133.6 million in 2018, representing a 68% increase in nominal dollars. In real terms, funding only rose by 8.0% between 1996 and 2017. The Committee on House Administration discussed committee expense requests in 2017, emphasizing the balance between providing funds and cost-consciousness. In 2017 and 2018, the Committee on House Administration addressed the distribution of committee staff and resources, with most chairs and ranking minority Members reaching mutually satisfactory arrangements. H.Res. 173 was introduced in March 2017 and marked up by the Committee on House Administration. In the second session of the 115th Congress, committee resolutions 115-9 and 115-19 were considered. The Committee on House Administration considered resolutions 115-9 and 115-19 in 2018, allocating funds for unanticipated expenses from the reserve fund established by H.Res. 173. The House agreed to H.Res. 173 in 2017, authorizing $266.3 million for committee expenses. Appropriations for House standing committees are typically included in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. In FY2019, $127.9 million was appropriated for House standing committees in H.R. 5895. In FY2019, $127.9 million was appropriated for House standing committees in H.R. 5895. Committee funds are provided to pay ordinary and necessary expenses incurred by committee Members and employees in the United States. Committee funds are subject to review by the committee chair and must comply with federal laws and House rules. Expenditures cannot be used for personal, political, or campaign-related expenses. Committees can hire various types of staff, with employment terms set by the committee chair. Total staff ceilings are determined by the Speaker. Travel expenses for domestic travel are reimbursable from committee funds, but cannot be for personal or political campaign events and must not exceed 60 consecutive days. Committee funds are subject to review and must comply with federal laws and House rules. Expenditures cannot be used for personal, political, or campaign-related expenses. Foreign travel is coordinated through the State Department Travel Office and is subject to House Rule X, clause 8(b)(3). Each Member and employee on foreign travel must submit an itemized report of expenses to the committee chair. Committee expenditures are analyzed to determine the percentage of annual authorization expended and major spending categories. Data on yearly expenditures are compiled using the quarterly Statement of Disbursements of the House. Late-arriving bills for committee expenses may be paid for up to two years. Late-arriving bills for committee expenses may be paid for up to two years following the end of a fiscal year. Financial obligations made by committees in a legislative year may be paid over multiple calendar years. Total expenditures of a committee in a legislative year are calculated using quarterly reports from the year of operation and subsequent years. Total disbursements made for legislative years 2010 through 2015 are analyzed. Between 2010 and 2015, most committees used the majority of their authorized funds, with approximately 55% spending 95% or more, 77% spending 90% or more, and 98% spending 80% or more. House spending is categorized by standard budget object classes. During the years analyzed, most committee spending was allocated towards personnel compensation, accounting for approximately 91% of total expenditures. Other expenses included equipment, supplies and materials, and travel, each making up a smaller percentage of the budget. The use of funds on personnel was consistent across time and individual committees."
