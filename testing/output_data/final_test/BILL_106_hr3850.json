    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Independent Telecommunications Consumer Enhancement Act of 2000\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. Congress finds that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines, which can accelerate the deployment of services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will enable them to deploy advanced services and competitive initiatives in less populated regions, benefiting consumers. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. This will allow carriers to redirect resources towards increasing investment in such initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers through reduced regulatory requirements in a new part IV of the Act. The Communications Act of 1934 defines a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers through reduced requirements in a new part IV of the Act. The Commission must separately evaluate the burden of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers and cannot enforce rules against them without such evaluation. The section provides regulatory relief for two percent carriers by exempting them from certain rules. It also allows for size-based differentiation among carriers as mandated by the Act. The provisions of this section apply to rules adopted after the enactment date. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports. However, carriers must certify compliance annually. SEC. 283 addresses integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services. This includes local and long-distance services, mobile radio, internet, and other enhanced services. Additionally, the Commission cannot mandate separate operations for carriers and their affiliates. SEC. 284 allows a two percent carrier to participate in tariff pools and choose price cap regulation for specific study areas without being obligated to do so for other areas. SEC. 285 pertains to the deployment of new telecommunications services by two percent companies. SEC. 285 allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services by filing a tariff on short notice without needing approval from the Commission for the rate structure. Two percent carriers can deaverage their rates and file tariffs with short notice upon certification of facilities-based entry by an unaffiliated carrier. The Commission will regulate such carriers as non-dominant if a local exchange carrier is engaged in facilities-based entry within their service area, eliminating the need to tariff interstate service offerings. Two percent carriers meeting requirements can participate in the common line tariff by including their study areas. Facilities-based entry in a carrier's service area involves providing local exchange service to at least one unaffiliated customer. A contract-based tariff is a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and customers, including details like contract terms, service descriptions, volume commitments, prices, volume discounts, and other relevant information. The curr_chunk provides information on the general description of classifications, practices, and regulations affecting the contract rate, as well as the definition of the term 'service area' as per section 214(e)(5). SEC. 287. SAVINGS PROVISIONS: Commission retains authority under sections 201-205 and 208. Rural telephone companies' rights preserved. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MERGER REVIEW. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline of 60 days for the Commission to make a public interest determination for mergers involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within the specified period, the application shall be approved. The Communications Act of 1934 amendment establishes a 60-day deadline for the Commission to decide on mergers involving two percent carriers. If no action is taken within this period, the application will be deemed approved without conditions. This provision applies to applications submitted after the enactment of the Act, while pending applications will be subject to the new requirements as if they were filed on the enactment date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in the relief sought being deemed granted. The new provision in the Communications Act of 1934 states that any petition for reconsideration or waiver must be stayed until the Commission issues an order. Any order issued or grant of a petition for waiver will be final and can be appealed. This provision applies to petitions submitted after the enactment of the Act, and pending petitions will be subject to these requirements. The Communications Act of 1934 states that any petition for reconsideration or waiver must be stayed until the Commission issues an order.
