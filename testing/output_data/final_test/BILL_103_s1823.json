    "content": "The \"Video Game Rating Act of 1994\" aims to provide parents with information about video games used in homes or public areas. It defines video games and the video game industry, and establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission (the \"Commission\") is established as an independent executive branch establishment with 5 members appointed by the President. No more than 3 members can be affiliated with the same political party, and all members serve until the Commission's termination. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Chairman receives compensation. The Chairman of the Commission is paid at a rate equivalent to level IV of the Executive Schedule, while other members are paid at a rate equivalent to level V. The amendments made regarding compensation are repealed upon the Commission's termination. The Chairman of the Commission has the authority to appoint an executive director and additional staff without following civil service laws. The executive director's confirmation is required by the Commission, and their compensation can be set by the Chairman within specified limits. The Commission is also allowed to hire consultants through contracts. The Commission can hire consultants through contracts and set a user fee to reimburse the United States. The Commission's funding is authorized until December 31, 1996, and it will terminate either on that date or 90 days after submitting a determination to the President on voluntary standards. The Commission will terminate either on December 31, 1996, or 90 days after submitting a determination to the President on voluntary standards for warning purchasers of violent or sexually explicit content in video games. The Commission's authority and functions are outlined in Section 4. The Commission is required to coordinate with the video game industry to develop a voluntary system for informing purchasers about the content of video games. After one year, they will assess if the industry's proposed standards adequately warn about violence or sexually explicit content in video games. The Commission may regulate video game manufacturers to provide information on violence or sexually explicit content to users. If industry standards are deemed sufficient within a year, the Commission will report to the President and Congress and terminate the regulation process. Antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the video game industry to create voluntary guidelines for disclosing sex or violence content to consumers. This exemption does not cover actions leading to a boycott of any party."
