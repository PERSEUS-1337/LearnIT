    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10540 of the Water Code is amended to allow regional water management groups to prepare integrated plans that incorporate various planning activities such as groundwater management, urban water management, water supply assessments, and agricultural water management. The Water Code allows regional water management groups to prepare integrated plans that include agricultural water management, city and county general planning, stormwater resource planning, and other water resource management planning. These plans must address water supply reliability, drinking water quality, water quality improvement, and threats to groundwater resources. The Water Code allows regional water management groups to prepare integrated plans addressing water supply reliability, drinking water quality, water quality improvement, and threats to groundwater resources. The plans include protection of groundwater from contamination, stewardship of aquatic resources, and consideration of water-related needs of disadvantaged communities. This section does not require local agencies to fund project implementation. Definitions governing the construction of this part are provided in Section 10721 of the Water Code. The Water Code allows regional water management groups to prepare integrated plans addressing water supply reliability, drinking water quality, and threats to groundwater resources. Definitions governing the construction of this part are provided in Section 10721 of the Water Code. An adjudication action is a legal action filed in court to determine rights to extract or store groundwater from a basin. A basin is a groundwater basin or subbasin identified in Bulletin 118. Bulletin 118 is the department's report on California's groundwater. A coordination agreement is a legal agreement between groundwater sustainability agencies to coordinate multiple agencies or plans within a basin. The \"De minimis extractor\" is defined as a person who extracts two acre-feet or less of groundwater per year for domestic purposes. The \"Governing body\" refers to the legislative body of a groundwater sustainability agency. \"Groundwater\" is water beneath the earth's surface saturated with water, excluding water flowing in known channels. A \"Groundwater extraction facility\" is a device for extracting groundwater from a basin, and \"Groundwater recharge\" is the augmentation of groundwater by natural or artificial means. A \"groundwater sustainability agency\" is a local agency implementing provisions for groundwater management. A \"groundwater sustainability plan\" is a plan proposed or adopted by the agency. A \"groundwater sustainability program\" is an ongoing activity to benefit a basin. \"In-lieu use\" refers to using surface water instead of extracting groundwater. A \"local agency\" with water supply, water management, or land use responsibilities in a groundwater basin defines a \"local agency.\" An \"operator\" is someone running a groundwater extraction facility, with the owner presumed to be the operator unless proven otherwise. The \"owner\" is the person owning a groundwater extraction facility or an interest in it, excluding liens. \"Personal information\" is defined as in the Civil Code. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to groundwater management, including terms like \"planning and implementation horizon,\" \"public water system,\" \"recharge area,\" and \"sustainability goal.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the regulations and requirements for sustainable groundwater management. Sustainable groundwater management involves using groundwater in a way that can be maintained without causing undesirable results. Sustainable yield is the maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn annually without causing harm, and undesirable results include negative effects caused by groundwater conditions in the basin. Chronic lowering of groundwater levels, reduction of storage, seawater intrusion, degraded water quality, land subsidence, and depletion of interconnected surface water can lead to significant and unreasonable impacts on water resources. A groundwater sustainability agency may enter into agreements with private parties to implement a groundwater sustainability plan. The Water Code amendment requires groundwater sustainability plans to include measures such as controlling saline water intrusion, protecting wellhead and recharge areas, addressing contaminated groundwater migration, implementing well abandonment programs, replenishing groundwater extractions, promoting conjunctive use, establishing well construction policies, and addressing groundwater contamination cleanup and conservation projects. Efficient water management practices, developing relationships with regulatory agencies, reviewing land use plans, and assessing risks to groundwater quality and quantity, as well as impacts on groundwater dependent ecosystems are key aspects addressed in the Water Code amendment. Prior to developing a groundwater sustainability plan, the agency must provide a written statement on how the public can participate. They may appoint an advisory committee and encourage diverse community involvement in the plan's development and implementation. The groundwater sustainability agency must provide a written statement on public participation in developing the groundwater sustainability plan, including coverage of public water systems regulated by the Public Utilities Commission. Interested parties, including entities monitoring and reporting groundwater elevations in a managed basin, are defined in Section 10927. Section 10732.2 is added to the Water Code, stating specific requirements. Section 10732.2 of the Water Code allows a groundwater sustainability agency to notify the board if a state entity is not cooperating with the implementation of a groundwater sustainability plan. The board can investigate and direct the state entity to cooperate if necessary for the plan's success. Upon adoption of a groundwater sustainability plan, the agency must submit it to the department for review. If multiple plans are developed for a basin, they must be submitted jointly with an explanation of how they satisfy specific sections for the entire basin. The groundwater sustainability agency must submit the groundwater sustainability plan to the department for review. The department will evaluate the plan within two years and may provide recommended corrective actions. The agency is not prohibited from implementing the plan before the department's evaluation."
