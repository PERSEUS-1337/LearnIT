Originally created to replace oil withdrawn from the world market for political reasons, its purpose has evolved to address disruptions caused by natural disasters like hurricanes. The use of SPR oil has helped mitigate economic impacts from events like Hurricane Katrina. Since 2010, the U.S. oil market has undergone significant changes with low growth in petroleum product demand. The oil market in the United States has transformed with low growth in demand, increased domestic production, and reduced dependence on foreign suppliers. Some question the need for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as U.S. oil position strengthens. Legislation mandates SPR oil sales for government funding, raising concerns about maintaining an adequate oil safety net in the evolving world market. The report addresses the need to maintain government-owned reserve holdings in the evolving world oil market. Legislation mandates the sale of over 250 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), raising concerns about the reduced need for oil storage capacity and strategies to optimize reserve capacity. The SPR was established in 1975 to prevent economic dislocation from oil embargoes. The 1973/1974 OAPEC embargo of oil sales to the United States was in retaliation for U.S. support for Israel in the Arab-Israeli War. This event occurred when U.S. oil production was at a peak in 1970, but consumption was expected to increase, leading to growing dependence on imports. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act aimed to create a 1 billion barrel crude oil reserve, but the Strategic Petroleum Reserve only reached 750 million barrels in 1991. The closure of the Weeks Island facility reduced storage capacity to 726.7 million barrels. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) reached its maximum capacity of 726.6 million barrels in 2009, the largest amount ever held. In 2011, 30 million barrels were sold due to the loss of Libyan oil exports. The SPR includes the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NEHHOR) and the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (NGSR) to support regional demand for home heating oil and stabilize gasoline supply after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The International Energy Agency (IEA) was established in November 1974 to coordinate energy policy during emergencies. Member countries, including the United States, commit to maintaining strategic stock holdings of crude oil and petroleum products equivalent to 90 days of their previous year's net imports. Gasoline has a shorter storage life than crude oil, typically lasting only about three months. Active supply management of the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve (NGSR) is necessary due to the short shelf life of gasoline. The United States participates in IEA programs for demand restraint and oil delivery allocation during emergencies. In 2011, the US joined a coordinated IEA oil stock drawdown in response to Libyan oil export disruptions. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) currently holds 649.1 million barrels, satisfying strategic stock requirements. With 170 days of net imports in stock, the SPR exceeds the 90-day IEA requirement of 340 million barrels. The United States holds excess oil reserves that may be sold on the market, as its Strategic Petroleum Reserve can deliver crude oil at varying rates for up to 180 days. The US, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand meet IEA stock requirements with government-owned emergency stocks, while other nations use a combination of private industry and agency stocks. The United States has excess oil reserves in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which can be sold on the market. The most recent emergency release of SPR oil was in 2011 due to the Libyan export curtailment, with 60 million barrels released onto the world market. The U.S. obligation was set at 30 million barrels, and competitive offers were solicited for the purchase of selling oil to be delivered by the end of August 2011. Additionally, the SPR can enter into exchange agreements. In 2011, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) sold 60 million barrels of oil due to the Libyan export curtailment. Exchange agreements allow for oil delivery with return plus a premium. In 2017, 5.2 million barrels were delivered to Gulf Coast refineries post-Hurricane Harvey, all returned by 2018. A test sale in 2014 evaluated SPR drawdown capabilities. Congress mandated SPR sales in 2015 due to evolving U.S. oil production. Congress mandated the sale of Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) oil due to evolving U.S. oil production. The sales revenue from SPR sales was allocated to various uses, excluding energy policy or security. Legislation including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, FAST Act of 2015, 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, 2017 Tax Revision, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, require oil to be sold from the reserve over the period FY2017 through FY2027. The Act of 2015 and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 mandate Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) sales from 2018 through 2025, with additional sales in 2020 and 2021. Legislation for out-year sales from 2023 to 2027 is also in place. Forecasting oil demand and supply is uncertain, leading to price volatility in the market. The DOE sold 10 million barrels of SPR oil in FY2017, earning over $449 million. The Balanced Budget Act of 2015 authorizes the DOE to sell up to $2 billion of SPR crude oil for fiscal years 2017 through 2020. In FY2017, 6.28 million barrels were sold, earning $323.2 million. In FY2018, 5 million barrels were sold, yielding approximately $290 million. Legislation ensures that SPR sales do not violate international commitments or allow holdings to fall below a specified value. The optimal level of oil holdings in the SPR is a controversial issue due to uncertain variables like market responsiveness, price volatility, and geopolitical disruptions. The SPR functions as an insurance policy against low-probability events, such as the closure of the Strait of Hormuz due to conflict in the Persian Gulf. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf could lead to significant disruptions in the world oil market, causing volatile oil prices, economic challenges, and the need for an optimal size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to mitigate risks. In this case, the optimal strategy is to minimize insurance costs and the probability of negative events. Reform factors for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) include the mix of crude oils held and infrastructure for delivery. Legislation in the 115th Congress aimed to reform the SPR by allowing commercial leasing of storage capacity and leasing to foreign governments. The pilot program allows leasing of excess SPR capacity to receive fees compensating the US for storage costs. While beneficial for reducing energy security insurance costs, potential issues may arise due to mismatched usage patterns with SPR facilities. Oil drawn from SPR storage may not align with the physical capabilities of the salt domes used for long-term storage. Leasing excess SPR capacity to foreign governments for oil reserve storage may be a better option than commercial leasing due to potential short-term problems. Frequent brine injection and withdrawal could accelerate structural deterioration of the caverns. Emergency withdrawals of SPR oil may interfere with commercial withdrawals unless infrastructure is enhanced. Some suggest eliminating the reserve due to the transparent oil market and derivative market strategies available now. Analysts propose inventory monetization as a risk-free approach to generate revenue by selling idle oil balances in the SPR through options markets. The government could profit by buying and selling crude oil paper contracts based on future price changes, without actually needing to use oil from the reserve. This strategy could generate significant revenue, exceeding yearly maintenance costs of the reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has faced challenges but has adapted to various purposes over time. While its relevance may have decreased due to changing market conditions, it still serves as a component of energy security policy and meets other policy needs."
