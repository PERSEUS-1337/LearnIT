The success of this method is based on neural networks trained on large datasets that can generate natural images from a low-dimensional latent representation. However, there is limited theoretical justification for this approach, especially in predicting denoising performance based on network parameters. This study focuses on denoising images with additive Gaussian noise using deep neural networks with ReLu activation functions. The algorithm presented minimizes a non-convex loss function and removes a fraction of the noise energy. In numerical experiments, denoising performance is achieved by generative priors learned from data. The goal is to remove noise from an unknown image or signal, with prior assumptions on the image being crucial for effective denoising. The denoising rate is influenced by the conciseness of the image prior or representation. A concise and accurate prior is essential for effective denoising, as real-world signals do not always lie in known subspaces. Research has developed sophisticated image models and algorithms based on sparse representations in dictionaries like wavelets and curvelets, as well as self-similarity within images. Deep learning based denoisers have become the standard for denoising images, with algorithms like BM3D and deep networks being used to learn concise representations for denoising problems. The success of deep network priors lies in their ability to efficiently represent and learn realistic image priors. The quality of deep priors has significantly improved in recent years, leading to smaller latent code dimensionality and more accurate representation of natural signal manifolds. Understanding the theoretical performance of deep networks in inverse problems is crucial as their influence grows. The need for justification on why first-order gradient methods do not get stuck in local minima is highlighted. Theoretical work on noisy compressive sensing with generative priors shows recovery of signal estimate within noise level if global optimizer can be found, though reaching global optimality is NP-hard. Related work by Hand & Voroninski (2018) establishes global favorability for optimization of noiseless empirical risk function using deep generative priors. This paper introduces an algorithm for denoising with deep generative priors, aiming to quantify denoising performance analytically. The algorithm utilizes a gradient method with a tweak to minimize noise in a d-layer generative neural network. The algorithm proposed in this paper aims to minimize noise in a d-layer generative neural network by using a gradient method with a tweak. The denoising rate of a deep prior based denoiser is determined by the dimension of the latent representation, as shown in numerical experiments. The problem at hand involves estimating a vector y\u02da from a noisy observation y using a generative neural network with specific layer configurations and weights. The goal is to obtain an estimate\u0177 of the original image y\u02da that is close to y\u02da and within the range of the network G. The problem involves estimating a vector y\u02da from a noisy observation y using a generative neural network. To solve this, an estimate of x\u02da, denoted by x, is obtained and y\u02da is estimated as Gpxq. The algorithm introduced in the paper ensures that a gradient method finds a point close to the original parameter x\u02da, with the distance controlled by noise. The algorithm presented in the paper aims to estimate a vector y\u02da from a noisy observation y using a generative neural network. It starts with an initial point x 0 \u2030 0 and iterates by computing the step direction based on the gradient of the function to be minimized. The algorithm checks if the function value decreases at each iteration to ensure convergence. The algorithm iterates by checking if f p\u00b4x i q is smaller than f px i q, negating the sign of x i to avoid convergence to a flat region near the global minimum x\u02da. This tweak is informed by the loss surface, which shows a critical point around\u00b4x\u02da with positive curvature in one direction. The algorithm is summarized as Algorithm 1, requiring weights W i , noisy observation y, and step size \u03b1 \u0105 0 1. The algorithm involves checking if f p\u00b4x i q is smaller than f px i q and negating x i to avoid convergence to a flat region near the global minimum x\u02da. It considers a fully-connected generative network with Gaussian weights and no bias terms, assuming weights W i are independently and identically distributed. The expansivity condition with constant \u0105 0 is required for the network. The expansivity condition with constant \u0105 0 is necessary for a fully-connected generative network with Gaussian weights. Gaussian weights are chosen for theoretical analysis due to their consistency in deep neural networks and the availability of well-developed theories for random matrices. The superiority of non-Gaussian weight distributions in terms of realism and analytical tractability remains unclear. Random nets, like those in the Deep Image Prior, are gaining practical relevance. Theoretical advances on random nets, like those in the Deep Image Prior (2017), are increasingly relevant. The main result states that for a network satisfying certain conditions, Algorithm 1 iterates converge after a bounded number of steps with a given probability. The error term in the bound depends on the noise and can be controlled by choosing a small enough step size. The second term in the bound FORMULA13 controls the effect of noise, guaranteeing denoising rate of \u03c3 2 k{n after sufficiently many iterations. The algorithm based on a generative deep prior reduces noise energy by a factor of k{n, showing rate-optimality with respect to noise power, latent code dimensionality, and signal dimensionality. No attempt was made to establish optimal bounds with respect to scaling. The bounds provided in the theorem are conservative to keep the proof simple. Numerical experiments show broader parameter range for successful denoising than constants suggest. The results can be improved in future research. The Weight Distribution Condition is used to prove the main result. The Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) ensures that weight matrices satisfy the appropriate probability for all i, given the expansivity condition. The WDC is based on the spatial arrangement of network weights within each layer. The WDC provides a deterministic property for neural network weights. The Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) ensures that neuron weights in a layer are distributed like a Gaussian or a uniform random variable on a sphere. This property is important for regularizing inverse problems using deep generative priors, which have shown improvement over sparsity-based approaches in various applications such as imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Imaging shows significant performance improvement over conventional methods in reconstructing an unknown vector from noisy linear measurements using a generative prior. Algorithm 1 with a modified Step 6 is used with a random projection matrix A. The extension of the results with a chosen parameter shows promise for improved outcomes. The extension of Algorithm 1 allows for efficient solving of inverse problems under noise, quantifying its effect. The formula for Mx \u00d8\u0177 involves rotation matrices and zeros, providing a calculation method for the process. The paper presents a specific practical algorithm for minimizing empirical loss in a non-convex program, proving it finds a solution near the global optimizer efficiently.

The paper introduces a practical algorithm for minimizing empirical loss in a non-convex program, demonstrating efficient convergence near the global optimizer. Experimental results show that denoising with deep priors achieves a denoising rate proportional to \u03c3 2 k{n. The algorithm is tested on a two-layer network with varying input neurons and noise levels. The paper presents an algorithm for minimizing empirical loss in a non-convex program, showing efficient convergence near the global optimizer. Experimental results demonstrate that denoising with deep priors achieves a denoising rate proportional to \u03c3 2 k{n. The algorithm is tested on a two-layer network with varying input neurons and noise levels. The results show that with a sufficiently small k, the network can perfectly recover the latent representation and image in the noiseless case. In the noisy case, the MSE is proportional to \u03c3 2 k{n in both domains. The negation trick in step 3-4 of Algorithm 1 is often not necessary for convergence, but it is generally required as there are instances with a local minimum opposite of x\u02da. The theory does not apply when using a prior learned from data, as it assumes weights to be fixed. The numerical results in this section demonstrate that even with a learned prior, the rate predicted by the theory for a random prior is achieved. A fully-connected autoencoder with ReLu activation functions and different numbers of neurons in the encoder and decoder layers is considered. Two autoencoders with k values of 10 and 20 are trained on the MNIST dataset, and denoising is performed using the learned decoder-network G. The theory suggests that for decoders with random weights, the denoising rate is proportional to \u03c3^2k{n. A learned decoder with k=20 has more parameters, resulting in smaller error and MSE at \u03c3=0. However, the denoising rate for k=20 is larger, as shown in the performance examples for different noise levels. This achieves a MSE proportional to \u03c3^2k{n, consistent with the theory for decoders with random weights. The theory suggests that for decoders with random weights, the denoising rate is proportional to \u03c3^2k{n. A learned decoder with k=10 has larger error and MSE at \u03c3=0 compared to k=20. However, the smaller number of parameters in k=10 results in a better denoising rate, as shown by the steeper slope of the MSE as a function of noise variance, \u03c3^2. The text discusses the expansivity condition in Algorithm 1, which guarantees convergence after a certain number of steps with a high probability. The Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) is also mentioned, showing that the expansivity condition ensures the WDC holds. The text discusses the Weight Distribution Condition (WDC) and its relation to the algorithm's goal of minimizing the empirical risk objective. It mentions the dependence of ni on c and K, and the use of a concentration argument similar to previous work by Hand & Voroninski (2018). The text discusses the algorithm's step direction and the proof based on the concentration of \u1e7dx around a specific function h(x). The function h(x) is determined by a function controlling angle distortion by the operator x \u00de \u00d1 W`, x x, and is used to bound the deviation of \u1e7dx. The text discusses the proof based on the concentration of \u1e7dx around a specific function h(x) determined by controlling angle distortion. It utilizes the generalized subdifferential for nondifferentiable points in the cost function. The Clarke generalized directional derivative and generalized subdifferential of a Lipschitz function f from a Hilbert space X to R are defined. The subdifferential is expressed as a convex hull of gradient vectors, and under certain assumptions, it is shown that for any x \u2260 0 and any subgradient v_x, a specific relation holds. The proof concludes by showing the continuity of h x with respect to nonzero x and the upper bound on the norm of the step direction of the algorithm is provided. The proof of Theorem 2 involves ensuring x i is bounded away from zero and showing that if |h(x)| is large, x i is outside a certain set. The logic of the proof is illustrated in Figure 4. The algorithm ensures that iterates stay outside the gray ring around 0, moving towards \u03c1dx\u02da. Once in the dashed ball around \u03c1dx\u02da, the function value is strictly larger. Steps 3-5 guarantee the next iterate is in the dashed ball around x\u02da, leading to progress as f(px i+1) - f(px i) is reduced. The region S\u03b2 is covered by a ball of radius r determined by noise, ensuring descent direction choices outside S\u03b2. The set S \u03b2 is contained in two balls around x\u02da and \u03c1x\u02da, with radius controlled by \u03b2. Lemma 9 states that for \u03b2 \u2264 1/64 * 2^(d/12), the algorithm converges to a ball around x\u02da. Lemma 10 further specifies conditions for convergence to a ball around x\u02da instead of \u03c1dx\u02da. The algorithm converges to a point in S\u03b2 by ensuring the objective is nonincreasing with iteration number. By meeting the assumptions of Lemma 10, it implies that f(px) \u2265 f(py) for x, y in S\u03b2. The mean value theorem is used to show convergence to a point in S\u03b2. The algorithm ensures convergence to a point in S\u03b2 by guaranteeing nonincreasing objective with iteration number. Theorem 8.13 states the existence of a t in the range [0, 1] such that certain conditions are met. The maximum number of iterations for x in S\u03b2 is determined by a specific formula. The proof involves bounding the distance between iterates and a reference point x\u02da. The proof involves bounding the distance between iterates and a reference point x\u02da. The algorithm ensures convergence to a point in S\u03b2 by guaranteeing nonincreasing objective with iteration number. The proof of Lemma 5 is devoted to proving the lemmas used in this section. The proof of Lemma 5 involves bounding the distance between iterates and a reference point x\u02da. It concludes by showing that the number of different matrices \u039b x can be bounded, leading to the proof of Lemma 9. Lemma 12 proves that h x is away from zero outside a neighborhood of x\u02daand\u00b4\u03c1 d x\u02da. It involves establishing properties related to angles and distances, leading to the conclusion that |\u00b4\u03be`cos \u03b8 0 pr\u00b4\u03b6q| \u010f \u03b2M. Lemma 12 proves that h x is away from zero outside a neighborhood of x\u02daand\u00b4\u03c1 d x\u02da. It involves establishing properties related to angles and distances, leading to the conclusion that |\u00b4\u03be`cos \u03b8 0 pr\u00b4\u03b6q| \u010f \u03b2M. For \u03b8 P p0, \u03c0s, we establish various inequalities and cases to determine the relationship between q, g, and d in the context of the problem. In Lemma 12, properties related to angles and distances are established to show that |\u00b4\u03be`cos \u03b8 0 pr\u00b4\u03b6q| \u010f \u03b2M for \u03b8 P p0, \u03c0s. Three cases are considered to determine the relationship between q, g, and d. The small angle case \u03b8 0 \" O 1 p32d 4 \u03b2q and the large angle case \u03b8 0 \" \u03c0`O 1 p8\u03c0d 4 ? \u03b2q are discussed. Various inequalities and formulas are used to analyze the problem."
