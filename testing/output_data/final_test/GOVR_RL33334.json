    "content": "The FDA released guidance on regulating genetically engineered animals for food or drugs, and assessed the safety of meat and milk from cloned animals. Concerns remain about the safety and impacts of animal biotechnology and cloning. Animal biotechnology, including genetic engineering and cloning, is a focus of regulatory discussions in the European Union and the OIE. Biotechnology involves modifying living creatures for human and animal benefit, with a history of agricultural development centered on maximizing desirable traits in plants and animals. Animal biotechnology involves modifying living creatures for human and animal benefit, with a focus on maximizing desirable traits. Selective breeding of animals dates back thousands of years, while artificial insemination of livestock, particularly dairy cattle, gained commercial acceptance in the 1950s. The discovery of the genetic code in the 1950s led to modern biotechnology techniques. One of the first commercial products was bovine somatotropin (bST), a metabolic modifier produced through recombinant DNA technology. bST, used to increase milk output in dairy cattle, was introduced in 1994 and is administered to about half of all U.S. dairy cattle. While bST is used in around 20 countries, it is banned in the European Union. The first U.S. approval of a commercial product from a genetically engineered animal is ATryn, an anticoagulant agent. The FDA approved the commercial production of the drug ATryn from genetically engineered goats in 2009. These goats produce human antithrombin in their milk, which helps prevent blood clotting. Other developments in animal biotechnology include pigs engineered for increased milk output and dairy cattle producing human breast milk proteins through cloning technology. Cloned cattle resistant to mastitis and genetically engineered salmon with enhanced growth characteristics are examples of animal biotechnology advancements. AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. developed AquAdvantage salmon by combining growth hormone genes from a Pacific salmon with anti-freeze genes from an eelpout. This modification allows the salmon to grow at twice the normal rate. Other goals of animal biotechnology research include producing drugs from animal milk, allergen-free milk, and animal organs for human transplant. Researchers at the University of Missouri created transgenic pigs with omega-3 fatty acids in their tissue, which can benefit heart health. Similar research is being done to produce omega-3 fatty acids in cow's milk and chicken eggs. This emerging animal biotechnology raises questions about risks, ethics, and applications. Debate is ongoing among consumers, producers, the biotechnology industry, and regulatory bodies about the costs and benefits of these technologies. Congress may need to address these issues as technologies move towards commercialization. Congress is urged to review and potentially refine federal regulations on animal biotechnology as it moves towards commercialization. The term encompasses centuries of selective breeding, with artificial insemination being a key advancement in modern animal production. Over 70% of U.S.-bred Holstein cows are artificially inseminated, demonstrating widespread acceptance of the technology. Holstein cows, the most widely used milk producers, are artificially inseminated. Estrus synchronization improves AI efficiency by controlling when a female is in heat. Modern animal biotechnology, with recombinant DNA techniques, holds promise for transforming selective breeding. Controversy over the technologies may continue as with plant biotechnology. Animal biotechnology involves various controversial technologies, including assisted reproductive techniques like embryo transfer (ET). In ET, eggs from a superior breeding cow are fertilized, developed into embryos, and implanted into a recipient cow. This technique is mainly used in registered cowherds due to its high costs. Research in animal biotechnology also focuses on developing new technologies. Transgenic animals are created through genetic engineering technology by introducing isolated DNA fragments into embryos to express desired traits. Currently, transgenic animals, primarily mice, are used in human disease research. The FDA has approved the use of transgenic goats to produce an anti-clotting agent in milk. GE dairy cattle have been created to produce human breast milk proteins, but commercialization efforts are still years away. Genetically engineering animals for agricultural purposes can lead to improved feed use, disease resistance, leaner meat, and environmentally friendly animal waste. In vitro fertilization (IVF) involves fertilizing eggs from donor cows and transferring the embryos to recipient cows. The dairy industry prefers heifers while the beef industry prefers bulls. Embryo sexing methods have been developed for cattle. Embryo sexing methods in cattle use a Y-chromosome probe to determine the sex of the embryo. Research is also progressing in sperm sexing technology and cloning, which has sparked public controversy due to differing interpretations of the term. The controversy surrounding cloning involves artificial cloning of higher organisms, such as humans, where genes are manipulated to study their effects. Federal regulations for biotechnology products focus on characteristics rather than production methods. The regulatory framework for biotechnology products focuses on characteristics and unique features, rather than production methods. The current regulatory approach aims to ensure safety using existing statutory authority, but newer biotechnology applications may pose unique challenges. The NRC animal biotechnology report highlighted potential inadequacies in the regulatory regime, particularly in addressing issues specific to animal biotechnologies. The responsibilities of federal agencies in regulating biotechnology products are not clearly defined. The FDA, under the Department of Health and Human Services, primarily regulates food, animal feed ingredients, and human and animal drugs, with a focus on gene-based modifications of animals for production. The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates gene-based modifications of animals as new animal drugs, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Concerns exist about the regulatory structures' ability to handle complexities in animal biotechnology innovations. The FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition oversees the safety and labeling of domestic and imported foods under the FFDCA. The FDA oversees the safety and labeling of domestic and imported foods under the FFDCA. FDA does not review new foods for safety before they enter commerce but has enforcement authority. All food additives, including those introduced through biotechnology, must receive FDA safety approval. FDA also reviewed the approval of GE sugar beets and concluded they posed no dangers to human health. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research regulate the safety and effectiveness of human products. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human drugs and medical products, including those from genetically modified animals. Pre-market review and licensing are required, ensuring purity and potency. FDA's authority to regulate genetically engineered animals falls under the new animal drug provisions of the FFDCA. The final industry guidance released by FDA's CVM closely follows the draft version published in 2008. The FDA regulates genetically modified animals under the new animal drug provisions of the FFDCA. Developers must go through the INAD process before marketing any products derived from GE animals. Food from GE animals must be approved by the FDA before entering the food supply. The FDA regulates genetically modified animals under the new animal drug provisions of the FFDCA. Developers must go through the INAD process before marketing any products derived from GE animals. It is illegal to introduce food from a GE animal into the food supply without FDA approval. The guidance outlines the pre-market approval process and requirements for developers. FDA will assess the direct and indirect toxicity potential of food from GE animals. Food and feed will be deemed safe if the composition is shown to be as safe as non-GE animal products. Labeling requirements for GE-derived foods are the same as for other foods, with oversight from FDA for seafood, dairy products, and whole shell eggs, and USDA for most meat, poultry, and egg products. Food from GE animals does not need to be labeled unless it differs from non-GE counterparts. The FDA announced the approval process for a genetically engineered salmon called AquAdvantage Atlantic Salmon, developed by AquaBounty. The salmon grows twice as fast as traditional Atlantic salmon and contains genes from ocean eelpout and Chinook salmon. FDA is considering public comments and labeling requirements for the GE salmon, which would be the first genetically engineered animal approved for human consumption. Environmental concerns about potential escape into the wild are also being addressed. FDA scientists have deemed the genetically engineered salmon safe for human consumption and not harmful to the environment. The Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) held meetings to discuss the approval process, with AquaBounty claiming the fish grows faster than conventional salmon. The VMAC is reviewing FDA's recommendations and public comments, with no set timeline for a decision. The VMAC will advise officials on approving GE salmon and labeling recommendations. FDA does not require labeling to suggest GE foods are different. California passed a bill for GE salmon labeling. FDA evaluates GE salmon as a new veterinary drug. AquaBounty's data to FDA is confidential. A coalition demands FDA deny approval due to concerns about environmental impact and potential escape of GE salmon. Various environmental organizations are concerned about the potential escape of GE salmon from fish farms and its impact on wild salmon population. Congressional Members have raised concerns about the FDA's approval process for GE salmon, citing inadequate environmental review and consumer right to know. Members expressed concerns about the risks posed by GE salmon to wild fish populations, including Atlantic, Coho, and Chinook salmon. AquaBounty plans to raise the fish in Canada, but there are worries about potential threats to wild Atlantic salmon. Despite assurances of sterility, 5% of the fish could remain fertile and mate with wild populations. A coalition of consumer and environmental groups endorsed Congressional Members' letter opposing GE salmon approval. The Center for Food Safety and allied groups submitted comments opposing federal regulatory standards for biotechnology. In 2011, H.R. 521 was introduced to prevent FDA approval of GE salmon. H.R. 521 was introduced as a companion bill to S. 230 to prevent FDA approval of GE salmon. The bills aim to deem GE fish as unsafe under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. USDA agencies have potential roles in regulating transgenic and cloned animals, but there is a lack of clear policy in this area. APHIS had planned to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on GE animals in 2008. APHIS published a request for information on GE animals in 2008, receiving over 670 comments. FDA issued final guidance for developers of GE animals in January 2009. APHIS has broad authority to regulate animals under the Animal Health Protection Act. The Antitoxins, and Analogous Products Act and the Animal Welfare Act are key regulations governing the safety and treatment of animals, including genetically modified organisms. Other relevant authorities include the Food Safety and Inspection Service, responsible for food safety and labeling, and the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires consideration of environmental impacts by federal agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency, along with other federal agencies, is required to consider the environmental impacts of their actions under various laws such as the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Cloning techniques, like the one used to create \"Dolly\" the sheep in 1997, fall under the purview of these agencies. Cloning in animal agriculture, specifically somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), is not widely adopted due to low efficiency rates. Success rates vary by species, ranging from 0.5% to 5%, with only about 6% of embryos resulting in healthy clones. Despite improvements in cloning technologies, SCNT is not yet ready for widespread commercial use. Cloning technologies are improving, with success rates increasing. International animal biotechnology research focuses on new opportunities in human medicine, agriculture, and animal welfare. The number of live clones worldwide in 2007 was limited, with the FDA asking companies to refrain from marketing cloned animal products until safety assessments are complete. The FDA issued draft risk assessments on the safety of cloned animal products, leading to the release of a final risk assessment in January 2008. Some stakeholders, including Members of Congress, called for a continuation of the moratorium on cloned animal products until more safety studies are completed. Congressional activity reflected these concerns in nonbinding and binding language in late 2007. The FDA released a draft risk assessment in December 2006 on the safety of animal clones and their offspring, highlighting potential risks associated with consuming products from cloned animals. FDA officials emphasized that the assessment focused solely on food safety and animal health, not addressing other social or ethical concerns related to cloning. The final risk assessment by the FDA concluded that meat and milk from clones of adult cattle, pigs, and goats, as well as their offspring, are safe for human consumption. However, data on sheep clones and other species were insufficient for the same conclusion, and FDA recommended against their use for human food. The assessment considered physiological, anatomical, health, and behavioral data, as well as the chemical composition of milk and meat. The FDA's final assessment, peer-reviewed by experts, concluded that food products from cloned cattle, goats, and pigs do not require special measures or labeling as they are deemed no different from conventionally bred animals. Producers can request voluntary labeling, but it must comply with truthfulness and non-misleading requirements. Offspring of cloned animals are also considered suitable for consumption. The FDA's 2006 proposed assessment called for a moratorium on food products from cloned animals and their offspring, which was lifted in 2008. The USDA now encourages a voluntary moratorium on products from cloned animals only. Cloning-related foods will mainly come from sexually reproduced offspring, not clones themselves. USDA aims for a smooth transition into the marketplace for these products. The FDA observed that cloned animals, like prized breeding animals, are too valuable for food production. There are concerns about offspring of clones entering the food supply, with some farmers admitting to selling them for slaughter. However, this would only make up a small fraction of the total livestock slaughtered in the U.S. FDA's risk assessment in January 2008 found that some animals involved in cloning are at greater health risk than conventional animals. The FDA found that cloned animals are at greater health risk than conventional animals, with problems such as late gestational complications in surrogate mothers and increased mortality and morbidity in calf and lamb clones due to large offspring syndrome. Livestock clones tend to have more health problems and death rates at birth, but surviving animals generally grow and develop normally with no reported increased risk of adverse health effects. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released a scientific opinion on the food safety of animals derived from cloning, stating that there is no indication of differences in food safety between products from healthy cattle and pigs. Cloning is not in commercial use in Europe, and there is no specific authorization procedure in the European Union for products from cloned animals. The EFSA concluded that there are differences in food safety between products from healthy cattle and pig clones compared to conventionally-bred animals. Clones have higher death and disease rates, with surrogate dams experiencing more pregnancy issues. Despite some clones being adversely affected, most survive and are healthy. The EFSA report found that most clones surviving the perinatal period are healthy, with no adverse health effects observed in their offspring. The European Commission, Parliament, and member states are using these findings to discuss policies on animal cloning, with disagreement among officials. The European Parliament approved a resolution in 2008 calling for a ban on cloning animals for food due to health, welfare, and ethical concerns. However, EC commissioners indicated in 2009 that a science-based risk assessment should be considered before making a decision. In April 2009, MEPs called for a ban on marketing meat and milk from cloned animals in the EU. The EC proposed including meat and milk from cloned animals under \"novel foods,\" but a ban may be challenging due to lack of food safety risks found by EFSA. Some MEPs suggest using ethical grounds to justify a ban to counter potential WTO challenges. In October 2010, the European Commission proposed a five-year suspension of animal cloning for food production in the EU, with a decision expected in March 2011. Critics, including consumer advocacy and animal rights groups, oppose the use of cloned animals and their offspring for food production. They have petitioned the FDA to impose a moratorium on producing foods from cloned animals and to establish rules for mandatory pre-market review and approval of cloned foods. Concerns include the treatment of surrogate mothers with hormones, compromised immune systems in clone offspring, and potential safety and quality issues in meat and milk from clones. Consumer advocates continue to assert that there are no consumer benefits from cloning, while the FDA argues that cloning could lead to livestock with desired traits and benefits for producers. Opinion polls show that the general public may not be ready for widespread animal cloning, with many expressing discomfort with the practice. According to a survey, 64% of Americans are uncomfortable with animal cloning, and 43% believe that foods from clones are unsafe. Critics argue that products from cloned animals should be labeled for consumer choice. Some have called for a halt on FDA actions on cloning until ethical and social issues are considered. Polls also show resistance to consuming GE salmon without labeling. The NRC animal biotechnology report mentions successful genetic offspring production in dairy cows through embryonic splitting and nuclear transfer. The NRC authors raised few concerns about using cloned animals for food, as they are believed to pose a low food safety risk. Evaluating cloned-animal food composition is recommended to minimize safety concerns. Offspring of cloned animals are considered safe for consumption due to natural matings. Consumer acceptance, social values, and animal welfare may overshadow health concerns. In 2009, the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology published a paper on animal cloning and transgenic research. The report criticizes FDA and USDA for not explaining criteria for evaluating transgenic animals, arguing that a regulatory process consumers trust is needed for transgenic technologies in livestock. Policy concerns have arisen with new biotechnologies in animal agriculture, some more relevant to GE-related technologies. The report criticizes FDA and USDA for lacking criteria to evaluate transgenic animals in livestock. Policy concerns have emerged with new biotechnologies in animal agriculture, particularly regarding environmental impacts and social acceptance. The development of technologies like the \"EnviroPig\" could potentially reduce environmental burdens in animal production. The 2002 NRC animal biotechnology report raised concerns about the environmental impacts of genetically altered animals, particularly the escape of GE salmon into the wild and potential breeding with wild populations. FDA is considering these environmental issues before approving GE salmon and other genetically altered animals to prevent disruptions to ecosystems and the introduction of novel genes into natural populations. The agency will adhere to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements. The FDA will comply with NEPA requirements for genetically altered animals. Environmental risks vary depending on the animal and application. The agency will tap into expertise from other federal and state agencies for environmental assessments and make results public. The IOM-NRC report stated that unexpected compositional changes can occur with genetic modification, but no adverse human health effects from GE foods have been documented. The report highlighted gaps in identifying compositional changes from genetic modification, recommending new safety assessment approaches for new foods. Recent research suggests GMOs may raise food safety concerns, with studies showing antibody production in mice fed transgenic peas expressing insecticide proteins. Recent research has shown that an insecticide protein in transgenic peas can lead to antibody production in mice, indicating allergic reactions. Studies have also demonstrated that genetic modifications in plants can provoke gene expression in human cells. Experts note that assessing the safety of genetically engineered animals follows similar scientific principles as non-engineered animals, but the introduction of new proteins in GE foods raises concerns about allergenicity and toxicity. When introducing new proteins into foods through genetic engineering, potential allergenicity, bioactivity, and toxicity responses should be considered. Concerns arise regarding genetically engineered animals entering the food supply for nonfood products like pharmaceuticals or replacement organs. Criteria for selecting desirable traits in transgenic animals will be based on commercial demand. Despite scientific evidence supporting the safety and benefits of GE and cloned animal products, marketplace and consumer acceptance may be limited due to public knowledge gaps and opposition to biotechnology in the food supply. Many Americans oppose biotechnology in the food supply, particularly research into genetically modified animals and animal cloning. Concerns are driven by ethical and religious beliefs rather than food safety. Consumers believe regulators should consider moral and ethical factors. There is hesitancy towards genetically modifying animals compared to plants, as animals are seen as sentient beings. Cloning farm animals raises concerns about potential human and pet cloning. Some believe modifying animals for medical purposes is more acceptable than for food production. Ethical views on animal biotechnologies vary widely, with some considering genetic engineering fundamentally unethical. Others focus on the risks and benefits to people, animals, and the environment. Labeling of food and pharmaceuticals is seen as important for consumer awareness. Food industry leaders are aware of consumer unease with animal biotechnology and cloning. Food industry leaders are sensitive to consumer unease with animal biotechnology, especially cloning. Many companies are hesitant to sell products from transgenic and cloned animals due to safety concerns and ethical considerations. Some suggest that the FDA should consider these broader concerns in addition to science and safety issues. The NRC animal biotechnology report highlights the need for an ethical framework in regulatory decisions. Segregating and labeling biotechnology products in agriculture could help consumers make informed choices. FDA guidance on GE animals does not require labeling, with opponents arguing that biotechnology products are equivalent to conventional ones in terms of safety standards. In December 2007, U.S. livestock cloning companies announced a voluntary system for tracking cloned animals to facilitate marketing claims. Consumer organizations criticized the initiative for not tracking offspring of cloned animals and being non-mandatory. The debate on biotechnology products and labeling continues. The FDA does not require tracking of offspring from cloned animals, sparking debate on labeling products as not derived from biotechnology. Consumer advocates have pushed for labeling dairy products as \"rBST-free\" due to skepticism around the safety of recombinant bovine somatotropin. FDA allows such labeling if not misleading and adequately substantiated. The FDA allows labeling products as \"rBST-free\" if not misleading and adequately substantiated. States have challenged processors' use of such labels, with notable battles in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Utah, Kansas, and elsewhere. The California Assembly passed a bill in 2011 requiring labeling of GE salmon if approved by the FDA. USDA prohibits labeling products from cloned animals as organic under its National Organic Program. The USDA prohibits labeling products from cloned animals as organic under the National Organic Program regulations. The status of products from clone offspring is unclear, with the USDA preparing rulemaking to address their organic status. Gene transfer and cloning can pose infectious disease hazards and reproductive issues, raising ethical concerns about animal welfare and potential health risks. Techniques like nuclear cell transfer can lead to calving problems due to higher birth weights and longer gestation periods. The report highlights potential calving problems and risks to reproductive health and welfare in animals from genetic modifications and cloning techniques. Some scientists believe animal welfare issues are exaggerated and may diminish as technologies improve. However, closer observation and care may be necessary for animals from certain genetic modifications or cloning procedures. European officials are considering ethical aspects of animal welfare in their cloning policies. The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies released an opinion expressing doubts about the ethical justification of cloning animals for food supply due to suffering and health problems. They emphasized the need for food safety, animal welfare, and traceability if such products were to be allowed in the market. Concerns were raised about genetic uniformity in herds leading to susceptibility to diseases and production losses. Some argue that genetic modification in animals could lead to increased susceptibility to diseases and heavy antibiotic use. Concerns also exist about a few elite producers holding proprietary rights, potentially disadvantaging other farmers. Preserving unaltered germlines in domestic animals is seen as important for maintaining a gene bank in case of genetic defects. The approval of food products from cloned animals in the US could impact exports due to varying foreign regulatory regimes. The international regulatory landscape for biotechnology products varies, with the European Union having restrictions on new biotechnology products. Some countries, including France, have conducted risk assessments on clones that align with the U.S. assessment. The Codex Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force on Foods Derived from Biotechnology is considering projects, with most countries proposing animal biotechnology projects except the United States. The task force agreed to develop guidelines for assessing the safety of foods from r-DNA animals. USDA is considering verification of supply chain management for cloned products. Concerns exist about imports of GE animals and products into the United States. The USDA needs to establish an import control policy for transgenic plants and animals to mitigate risks to the environment and food supply. Members of Congress have proposed bills to regulate agricultural biotechnology products and address ethical issues related to animal biotechnologies. The 112th Congress may need to evaluate the benefits and costs of these evolving technologies and refine government oversight. In the 110th Congress, the Senate-passed version of the 2007-2008 farm bill contained language requiring FDA to postpone final risk assessment and maintain marketing moratorium. However, this language was deleted from the final measure. The bill would have directed the HHS Secretary to conduct a study on the safety of food products from cloned animals and the health effects of milk from cloned animals. The FDA draft assessment on food products from cloned animals would have included an evaluation of public health effects, healthcare costs, consumer behavior, and nutrition impacts. Bills introduced in 2007 aimed to label foods from cloned animals and their offspring, and prohibit the use of the \"organic\" label on such products. Another bill would have required studies on the impacts of food products from cloned animals. In late July 2008, bills were introduced to regulate GMOs, including labeling requirements for foods produced with GE material and new FDA regulations for GE crops. These bills aimed to regulate business dealings between agricultural producers and biotechnology companies. However, they were not enacted and were not reintroduced in subsequent Congresses. Bills introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to prevent FDA approval of GE salmon. Bills introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to prevent FDA approval of GE salmon by amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The House and Senate bills have been referred to respective committees for further review."
