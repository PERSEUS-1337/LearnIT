    "content": "The Act titled \"Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and Nutrition Support Act of 2007\" is abbreviated as such. Congress finds that the spread of HIV/AIDS is worsened by poverty, vulnerability, and inequality. Food insecurity directly impacts HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Addressing underlying factors is crucial for effective HIV/AIDS programs. The World Food Program estimates 6.4 million HIV-affected individuals will need nutritional support by 2008, with the highest infection rates in malnourished regions like sub-Saharan Africa. HIV/AIDS reduces productivity, leading to food insecurity through loss of wages. Food insecurity due to caring for HIV-infected persons can lead to decreased productivity and loss of wages. Adequate nutrition can help infected individuals work longer. People living with HIV/AIDS often cite food insecurity as their top concern. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of addressing malnutrition, especially for those affected by HIV/AIDS, through United States HIV/AIDS programs. It also highlights the need to follow international guidelines for HIV/AIDS food and nutrition activities supported by PEPFAR. The Global AIDS Coordinator is urged to prioritize collaboration with other US government departments and agencies. The United States Government emphasizes integrating food and nutrition support into HIV/AIDS programs, prioritizing malnourished individuals with a BMI of 18.5 or less for support. Programs should include therapeutic feeding, food, and nutrition support with links to livelihood development. The United States Government prioritizes integrating food and nutrition support into HIV/AIDS programs, focusing on malnourished individuals with a BMI of 18.5 or less. Development programs should include therapeutic feeding and livelihood support to prevent the inability of HIV-infected individuals to access food from affecting their treatment.

SEC. 5. Integration of food security and nutrition activities into HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and support activities. Section 301 of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 is amended to integrate food security and nutrition activities into HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and support activities. Congress recognizes the direct impact of food security and nutrition on HIV vulnerability, progression to AIDS, medication regimen effectiveness, and community coping with the epidemic. The Global AIDS Coordinator is required to implement this integration.

The Global AIDS Coordinator is authorized to provide food and nutrition support to HIV-infected individuals and their households for at least 180 days, either directly or through referral to assistance programs. Coordination with relevant government departments is also required. A plan is developed to provide food and nutrition support to HIV-infected individuals, improve coordination between food security programs, and establish linkages between health and agricultural sectors to enhance food security. The plan aims to ensure effective coordination between activities authorized under the Act and other provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, develop validated indicators for nutrition and food security interventions, and support partnerships between US colleges and universities. The Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and Nutrition Support Act of 2007 aims to build capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS and improve nutrition and food security in affected communities. The Global AIDS Coordinator is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of these efforts. The Global HIV/AIDS Food Security and Nutrition Support Act of 2007 requires the Global AIDS Coordinator to submit an annual report to Congress.
