    "content": "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 is outdated in addressing Internet Protocol and broadband networks, leading to uncertainty in the market. The FCC and Copyright Office have struggled to apply the law to new technologies, resulting in litigation and delays in rule implementation. Technological advancements have caused changes in the communications sector not foreseen by the 1996 Act. Technological advancements in the communications sector post-1996 Act have led to new competitive opportunities and market consolidation. Firms are using new technologies to circumvent statutory obligations and prohibitions, challenging traditional business models. The statutory framework imposes obligations and prohibitions on certain networks and service providers, while also providing privileges and rights. Entrants using new technologies may not be subject to the same regulations as incumbents but are also denied certain privileges. Members on both sides of the aisle and industry stakeholders agree that updates are needed in the Communications Act of 1934 and the Copyright Act of 1976 to address current technological and market circumstances. The focus is on fostering innovation, investment, and competition in broadband networks and applications. One challenge is finding the right balance between market forces and regulation, especially with a small number of vertically integrated network providers also offering competing applications. Three key policy issues in updating the statutory framework include accommodating technological change, incentivizing network providers to invest and innovate while ensuring downstream competition, and managing spectrum as an essential communications input. During a time of market uncertainty, Congress will address questions regarding efficient spectrum use and management in the communications sector. Technology-driven market forces are challenging established business models, with incumbents seeing record revenues and profits, and new entrants experiencing rapid revenue gains. The ultimate impact of proposed statutory changes is uncertain, making caution necessary but not a justification for inaction. The communications sector is evolving rapidly due to technology-driven market forces, rendering some statutory provisions ineffective. Consumer behavior has shifted significantly, with a growing reliance on wireless telephones and digital media. Caution is needed in addressing these changes, but it should not be a reason for inaction. The digital transition in the communications sector is impacting U.S. markets and the existing statutory framework. Verizon and Cablevision executives acknowledge the shift towards internet-based video streaming, highlighting the convergence of networks and the changing consumer behavior towards digital media. The digital transition in the communications sector has led to the convergence of networks, changing market structures. True convergence reduces entry costs for firms to extend their network into related markets, allowing only firms with assets affected by technological spillovers to enter. Network providers can enter new service markets by exploiting technological spillovers, like cable operators upgrading their networks for high-speed Internet and voice services. Satellite operators unable to adapt face competition. Entrepreneurs have created a mobile wireless alternative using licensed and unlicensed spectrum, viable for popular consumer and small business applications. The new mobile wireless ecosystem includes cellular broadband networks, small cell networks, and WiFi networks that offload traffic from macro networks to manage growth in mobile data usage. The mobile wireless ecosystem includes cellular broadband networks, small cell networks, and WiFi networks that offload traffic from macro networks. The value of each wireless technology is tied to the others, and digital technologies have revolutionized communication services over broadband networks. Digital service providers utilize existing broadband networks to distribute content without the high upfront costs of building their own network. This digital distribution can lead to cost-saving disintermediation but also poses challenges such as increased piracy and difficulty in obtaining compensation for content. Technological advancements have reduced entry costs and increased competition in content distribution. This has led to market consolidation as distributors merge with content providers to strengthen negotiating power. For example, Comcast acquired NBC Universal to adapt to the changing landscape. Network providers are forming marketing joint ventures to enter new service markets. For instance, cable operators are selling Verizon Wireless services in exchange for marketing the cable companies' video services. Dish Network has attempted to acquire wireless broadband providers. Broadcast television station groups are consolidating to increase leverage in retransmission consent. Sinclair Broadcast Group, Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Gannett, Belo Corporation, Media General/Young Broadcasting, and Tribune Company are acquiring additional stations to increase their reach in U.S. television households. Tribune's proposed purchase of Local TV LLS would leave them with 42 stations, including 14 in the top 20 markets, with plans to seek higher retransmission consent fees. Video distributors are concerned about potential higher programming costs due to these acquisitions. Stations are being acquired by various broadcasting companies to expand their reach in U.S. television households. Video distributors are worried about increased programming costs and have filed a petition to deny the transfer of stations from Belo to Gannett. The motivation for station purchases includes low interest rates and the growth in political advertising revenues. Industry consolidation is seen as necessary. According to analyst Michael Kupinski, industry consolidation is necessary to invest in digital media technologies, move into mobile applications, and develop programming. Broadcaster consolidation is leading to potential mergers in the video distribution market, with Liberty Media seeking Charter to acquire Time Warner Cable. Time Warner Cable is considering mergers with Cablevision Systems Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. Charter's CEO predicts only \"two major players\" will remain in the U.S. cable industry. Dish Network's Charlie Ergen has also suggested industry consolidation. Industry consolidation is leading to potential mergers in the U.S. cable industry, with large companies on both sides of negotiations. This could make it challenging for either party to impose its will, potentially leading to consumer harm in cases of extended blackouts. The cable industry is experiencing industry consolidation, leading to potential mergers. This could create challenges in negotiations between large companies, impacting consumers during blackouts. Independent broadcast television stations may face negotiating disadvantages with cable carriers or satellite operators. Local advertisers may also struggle with rates if stations are part of a large television group. Overall, technological changes have brought new market opportunities and forces, benefiting both incumbents and new entrants, but also posing risks. The communications industry faces changing costs and consumer demands, with some segments experiencing lower growth rates due to new technologies. Despite this, there has been significant private capital investment in U.S. wired and wireless broadband networks since 2009. However, there are indications that network capital expenditures may decrease, with AT&T announcing a $2 billion decrease in capital expenditures over the next two years. SNLFinancial forecasts a long-term decline in cable companies' capital expenditures, from $13.1 billion in 2012 to $11.4 billion in 2016, possibly due to consolidation. The United States dominates in markets like smartphones, with more than 90% using U.S. developed operating systems. Internet venture capital investment in the U.S. has been increasing, with significant funding for digital-media firms in May 2013. In May 2013, digital-media firms received $601.8 million in funding, with the largest investments in online advertising, digital media, online video, mobile software/cloud, and social networking. SNLFinancial is tracking OTT video deployments, including OTT aggregators like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and Apple's iTunes. The OTT segment includes various platforms like Hulu, Amazon, Apple's iTunes, Redbox, Verizon's Redbox Instant, and others. It also encompasses game consoles, stand-alone set-top boxes, Internet-connectable TVs, and TV Everywhere services. This segment is evolving, and more data may be collected to analyze the impact of public policies on its health and viability. The number of online video ads viewed is rapidly increasing, with media spending on OTT video also on the rise. SNLFinancial reported a significant growth in online video ads viewed on desktops and laptops, driven by more sites monetizing their videos. BIA/Kelsey projects a fivefold increase in local online video to $5 billion by 2017. Digital media spending grew by 27% in the first half of 2013, with digital video advertising revenue reaching about $1 billion and expected to continue growing. Traditional broadcast and cable channel advertising also saw growth, albeit at a slower rate. Advertising on traditional broadcast and cable channels continued to grow in the first half of 2013, with broadcast television advertising spending increasing between 5 and 10% and cable television advertising spending growing by 4%. There is a trend of households cutting the cord and relying solely on over-the-air broadcasts and over-the-top video, with 19.3% of television homes having broadcast-only reception. In 2013, 22.4 million homes had broadcast-only reception, with 5.9% cutting the cord at some point. The statutory framework created obligations, prohibitions, and privileges for stakeholders, but new technologies have led to competition that doesn't always fit existing definitions. The existing statutory provisions and regulations may no longer effectively foster competition and public safety in a technologically dynamic sector. The challenge is to create flexible statutory language that can adapt to technological changes without favoring legacy or new technology. This raises three related policy questions in industries with networks and services. Policy makers face the challenge of minimizing artificial competitive advantages or disadvantages in the rapidly evolving technological landscape. They must determine which statutory requirements should apply to new networks as providers transition from legacy to IP networks. Additionally, considerations must be made for network providers who have not yet invested in connecting to the new networks. Policy makers must decide on requirements for migrating providers to support legacy networks and time limits for other network providers and end users to connect to new IP networks. Constantly updating statutes to cover new technology may not be feasible, as it takes time to understand the implications. Existing statutes do not address digital technology, Internet protocol, or broadband. The current statutes are inadequate for regulating digital technology, Internet protocol, broadband networks, and online services. This has led to challenges for the FCC, Copyright Office, and courts in applying outdated provisions to new technologies. Online video distributors face regulatory disparities compared to traditional distributors on various issues such as retransmission consent, copyright licenses, and program access rules. The differences in rights and obligations regarding video programming distributors may distort competition. Various technology-specific definitions and provisions in current statutes may favor certain services over others. For example, the statutory treatment of copyright for sound recordings is more favorable for terrestrial broadcast radio than for satellite or online radio. In June 2013, Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI) represented 600,000 songwriters. In June 2013, BMI filed a lawsuit to set royalty rates for Pandora. Pandora bought a radio station to pay lower rates, leading to ASCAP filing a petition against the license transfer. In a dynamic tech environment, firms may find ways to work around regulatory or copyright restrictions to innovate and compete. The innovating firm may avoid regulations intended to foster public interest objectives, such as copyright licensing for broadcast television signals. Video distributors have incentives to develop technologies like Aereo's mini-antennas to allow households to capture broadcast signals without paying license fees. Aereo uses mini-antennas assigned to individual subscribers to send broadcast television signals over the Internet. Aereo claims it is a technology rental company, not a video distributor, and that the programs received are private performances. Broadcasters sued Aereo for copyright infringement, but a federal court denied an injunction, stating Aereo's system does not result in a public performance. The full court en banc refused to enjoin Aereo from operating while a lower court decides the copyright infringement case. Aereo continues to offer its service in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. In other cases in California and Washington, DC, courts found similar technology infringing copyrights and issued injunctions. Appeals are expected to continue, possibly reaching the Supreme Court due to inconsistent court rulings. Inconsistent court rulings on copyright issues may lead to appeals reaching the Supreme Court. Adverse rulings in AereoKiller/FilmOnX cases could impact Aereo's expansion plans. Broadcasters may seek alternate compensation if they lose copyright revenues, possibly by pushing for statutory changes to make Aereo subject to retransmission consent requirements. Legal uncertainty is affecting programmers and distributors. Legal uncertainty is impacting programmers and distributors, leading Congress to consider legislation. The U.S. Court of Appeals denied a preliminary injunction against Dish Network's Auto-Hop, citing fair use in a copyright case involving Fox Broadcasting Company. The U.S. Court of Appeals denied a preliminary injunction against Dish Network's Auto-Hop, citing fair use in a copyright case involving Fox Broadcasting Company. The case will proceed, and Congress may want to review copyright law in light of new technologies that make products more attractive to consumers by allowing them to skip commercials. Congress faces the challenge of balancing rewarding creators with fostering dissemination and innovative use of works in the digital era. Copyright laws aim to protect intellectual property rights while also promoting the dissemination of knowledge and information in the digital age. It is crucial to establish clear guidelines to balance the rights of copyright holders and encourage innovative uses of copyrighted materials without unnecessary penalties for infringement. The Department of Commerce Internet Policy Task Force released a report on Copyright Policy, Creativity, and Innovation in the Digital Economy, addressing policy issues related to copyright protection and third-party use of materials. Some issues include extending the public performance right for sound recordings and assessing rate-setting standards for the public. The report addresses various copyright policy issues, including proposing to make willful violations of the public performance right a felony. It also suggests modernizing the mechanical license into a blanket license and ensuring consumers can unlock their cell phones. Additionally, it reviews the legal framework for creating remixes and the \"first-sale doctrine\" in the digital environment. The \"first-sale doctrine\" in the digital environment allows the owner of a material object containing a copyrighted work to dispose of it as they wish. However, digital transfers result in reproduction, which is not covered by this doctrine and constitutes copyright infringement. The copyright term has been extended over time to the lifetime of the author plus 70 years, and for corporate authors 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication. Derek Khanna raises concerns about statutory damages in online copyright enforcement and suggests potential issues affecting innovation that may interest Congress. Derek Khanna proposes shortening copyright terms to benefit content producers and promote innovation in an interactive Internet environment. He also advocates for expanding fair use and imposing stricter penalties for false copyright infringement claims to protect legitimate speech. The federal statutory framework for communications includes provisions for network interconnection, reliability, emergency services, consumer protection, universal service, and competition. These regulations apply to telecommunications carriers, providers of telecommunications services. Congress created a separate category called \"information services\" to promote advanced communications services, which are not subject to the same regulations as telecommunications services under Title II of the Communications Act. Telecommunications services involve the transmission of information without altering its form or content, while information services are distinct from this. The FCC classified cable modem Internet access service as an information service with a telecommunications component, outside the purview of Title II. This determination was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2005. Wireline broadband Internet access service is not treated as a telecommunications service, and services like Voice over Internet Protocol are not considered telecommunications services. The regulatory landscape for telecommunications carriers is complex, with different levels of regulation for various types of carriers. Local exchange carriers (LECs) and incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) face additional provisions and regulations compared to other carriers. State regulatory agencies also impose requirements on ILECs. In the broadband transition, network providers are moving from legacy copper networks to fiber and wireless networks, offering various services. These new networks are not as regulated as traditional telecommunications carriers, but some providers are still required to maintain legacy networks and offer voice services. AT&T plans to upgrade all its wireline and wireless facilities to IP, potentially discontinuing service for about one percent of its legacy customers. The FCC is addressing transition issues and considering which legacy regulations should apply to new networks. Congress may be interested in VoIP interconnection issues. The FCC expects carriers to negotiate in good faith for IP-to-IP interconnection. IP network providers rely on peering agreements for traffic exchange, but peering disputes can lead to interruptions in service. Congress may be concerned about customers losing access to telephone service due to these disputes. Interconnection agreements between IP network providers cover various parameters such as pricing, service levels, and quality of service. Congress may need to provide guidance to protect customers in case of disputes. Transition to NG911 will require resolving technical issues for accurate caller location data. The FCC plans trials to determine how VoIP and IP-based networks can interconnect with emergency service networks. Congress may need to review statutory requirements for the E911 to NG911 transition. Some ILECs are replacing legacy wireline networks with fiber or wireless IP networks, affecting capabilities like access to 911 and emergency services. The legacy copper PSTN network has unique features such as its own power source, high reliability, and accommodation for special needs of customers. Wireless or fiber networks lack these capabilities, which may impact small businesses, alarm/security systems, and individuals with disabilities. Congress may need to review these differences when considering the transition to IP-based networks. Congress may need to review the regulatory obligations imposed on telecommunications carriers for IP networks, particularly those stemming from the legacy monopoly era. These obligations, such as ensuring service continuity and serving as the carrier of last resort, may need to be reevaluated for their relevance in the transition to IP-based networks. The FCC's rules require network providers to offer certain services on demand, potentially hindering the migration to IP-based networks. Congress may need to address concerns about maintaining legacy TDM-based networks while transitioning to new technology. There is a need to reevaluate regulatory obligations for telecommunications carriers in the transition to IP networks. As technology advances, the role of states in regulating interstate services is questioned. The transition to IP networks varies among providers and end-users, with late adopters potentially delaying the changeover for financial reasons. Consumers may resist purchasing IP-capable equipment if it is incompatible with legacy systems. The transition to IP networks may be delayed if legacy networks or equipment are incompatible, potentially impacting end users who are slow to adopt new technologies. Congress may need to guide the FCC on balancing rapid IP deployment with protecting users who prefer legacy systems. The U.S. communications sector's statutory framework addresses market structure due to economies of scale and spectrum constraints that can hinder competition and innovation. The Communications Act of 1934 established the FCC to regulate interstate activities of telephone monopolies and broadcasting. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition by removing regulatory barriers. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to foster competition among providers using similar network technologies to offer voice or cable services. It established regulatory regimes for carriers and cable providers, removing barriers to competitive provision of services. The Act promoted intramodal competition by requiring ILECs to make their network elements available to new entrants at cost-based rates. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition among providers using similar network technologies for voice and cable services. New entrants took advantage of unbundling requirements to serve large business customers but struggled to enter the residential voice market. Technological advances led to intermodal competition as cable operators and telephone companies upgraded their networks to offer a range of services. Legacy telephone companies and cable networks are now transitioning to offer video and Internet access services. Legacy telephone and cable companies are migrating their traffic to IP networks, offering information services not subject to previous regulations. Cable companies find the migration easier and cheaper due to upgraded networks, while telephone companies struggle with costly fiber optic deployment for bandwidth. AT&T and Verizon have deployed optical fiber networks, with AT&T using a fiber to the node architecture and Verizon opting for fiber all the way to the customer premise. Verizon's higher upfront costs have been criticized by Wall Street. AT&T has been able to extend its U-verse service to a larger area than Verizon's FiOS service. Both companies have faced challenges in providing universal high bandwidth landline broadband service. Telephone companies are meeting regulatory requirements for PEG access cable television channels while also investing in wireless broadband networks to meet the needs of consumer and small business users. They continue to invest in wireline facilities but are responding to a shift in demand towards mobile services. Verizon has shifted capital investments from wireline to wireless services, with plans to use FiOS fiber-optic network alongside its 4G LTE network. The high cost of FiOS deployment is limiting its expansion. Verizon purchased AWS spectrum from major cable operators in 2011 and announced joint marketing agreements with them. The agreements confirmed that the cable companies would not enter the wireless market and Verizon would not expand its FiOS offering. The spectrum transfers and agreements were approved by the Department of Justice and FCC in 2012. Verizon Wireless purchased spectrum from cable operators in 2011 and formed joint marketing agreements. The agreements allowed cable companies to market Verizon Wireless services under their own brand names immediately. The policy implications of these transactions may depend on consumer perceptions of wireline and wireless services. The joint marketing agreements between Verizon and cable companies may limit spectrum available to independent carriers and Verizon's participation in certain video markets. Congress may need to consider structural and behavioral constraints to limit market power. The 2005 Phoenix Center Convergence Paper discusses concerns about convergence and collusion in the market. The 2005 Phoenix Center Convergence Paper discusses concerns about collusion in concentrated markets. It suggests that reciprocal entry is evidence that collusion is not occurring, but policymakers may need to revisit the issue once market shares stabilize. The Phoenix Center scenario raises concerns about collusion in concentrated markets and suggests that policymakers should revisit the issue. Policy-makers should consider the impact of enter/don't enter/exit decisions of network providers on competition and public policy. Congress may need to ensure that the statutory framework can address market forces and incentives affected by provider decisions. The framework could include structural regulation, such as caps on spectrum allocation. The regulatory framework for network providers includes structural regulation, ex ante non-discrimination rules, ex post adjudication of market power abuses, and reliance on antitrust law. Ex ante rules focus on preventing future discrimination, while ex post adjudication punishes discrimination after the fact. The regulatory framework for network providers includes structural regulation, ex ante non-discrimination rules, and ex post adjudication of market power abuses. The communications sector's dominant cost characteristic is substantial fixed costs and economies of scale. The FCC has taken steps to reduce structural regulation by distinguishing between telecommunications services and information services. Recent decisions by major network providers have sparked interest in structural regulation, particularly in the wireless broadband market where limited spectrum availability is a concern. As carriers transition to newer technologies, they must allocate spectrum accordingly, leading to a concentration of spectrum among major carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless. The FCC has employed spectrum caps and screens since 1994 to prevent dominant carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless from hoarding spectrum. A network non-discrimination regime gives users and applications providers the right to use non-harmful attachments or applications. In December 2010, the FCC adopted the Open Internet Order, which includes rules for broadband Internet access providers such as transparency, no blocking, and no discrimination. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose network management practices and are prohibited from blocking lawful content or applications. The FCC's Open Internet Order prohibits mobile providers from blocking access to lawful websites and competing applications, with no unreasonable discrimination allowed. Fixed broadband providers are also prohibited from unreasonably discriminating in transmitting lawful network traffic. Multiple appeals challenging the FCC's authority to impose these rules have been consolidated for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Verizon Communications remains the challenger seeking review. Proponents of non-discrimination rules argue that network neutrality fosters investment and innovation in broadband technology by eliminating discrimination and promoting fair competition among applications. They believe that explicit non-discrimination rules create predictability and encourage entrepreneurs to invest in broadband applications. Neutrality in network development fosters investment in broadband applications by providing a reliable baseline for designers and consumers. Restrictions on usage harm small developers and limit innovation. A neutral network approach is more likely to yield better results than planned innovation directed by a single entity. Restrictions tend to favor certain applications and hinder fair competition. A regulatory framework ensuring network neutrality prevents distortions in the market for applications. Non-discrimination rules protect consumers and promote innovation by discouraging discrimination and fostering investment. Critics argue that such rules may interfere with broadband providers' business plans. Critics of ex ante non-discrimination rules argue that they lead to delays, litigation, and regulatory costs due to the complexity of communications networks. They also believe that these rules can artificially aid applications providers in negotiations with broadband network providers by allowing them to threaten regulatory complaints. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has proposed an ex post approach for adjudicating alleged abuses of market power in electronic communications networks. This approach would give the FCC authority to address unfair practices, such as interconnection-related issues, on a case-by-case basis. The proposal for ex post adjudication in electronic communications networks aims to address unfair practices, such as interconnection-related issues, on a case-by-case basis. Proponents argue that market inefficiencies are better addressed by markets themselves, rather than regulatory solutions, as regulators may lack the necessary information to make efficient decisions. Ex post adjudication proponents advocate for a new statute to replace vague regulatory standards with the \"unfair competition\" standard. Critics argue it assumes consumer welfare loss from bad regulation is always greater than from poorly performing markets, especially in unique markets like those with network characteristics. Critics argue that in unique markets, there is no clear evidence that under-regulation is less risky than over-regulation. They suggest that ex post regulation may distort business plans and harm consumers more than ex ante rules. Critics also claim that ex post adjudications can drive innovative providers out of the market, denying customers their services. The debate surrounds the need for network access for independent applications providers, with concerns about potential restrictions by broadband network providers. Critics argue that replacing the public interest standard with an antitrust standard overlooks non-economic objectives of U.S. communications policy. Broadband network providers argue against access regulation, citing market incentives to not restrict access. Broadband network providers argue against access regulation, citing market incentives and the availability of multiple broadband networks. They claim usage restrictions are necessary for quality of service and infrastructure investments, and assert compliance with antitrust laws to prevent anticompetitive activities harmful to consumers. Critics question the reliance on antitrust enforcement and argue for broader public policy objectives in the communications sector. Public policy objectives in the communications sector go beyond market competition issues addressed by antitrust law. The 1996 Telecommunications Act includes an \"antitrust savings clause\" to prevent modification of antitrust laws. An antitrust suit was brought against Verizon for breaching its duty to share its network with competitive providers. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in the Trinko case that breaches of FCC and PSC rules by Verizon did not constitute antitrust violations. The Court stated that violations of communications law obligations cannot be enforced through antitrust laws. The case raised questions about the plaintiff's standing, with the majority opinion focusing on the merits of the case. The Trinko case raised questions about standing, with the Supreme Court ruling that breaches of FCC and PSC rules by Verizon did not constitute antitrust violations. It was suggested that AT&T, the service provider, would have been the proper plaintiff instead of Trinko. Congressional reaction to the decision was mixed, with concerns about potential anticompetitive behavior by telecommunications companies. Congressional reaction to the Trinko case included calls for legislation to address the Supreme Court's decision. Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers introduced a bill in 2004, but it did not progress. Chairman Tauzin supported the Court's ruling, emphasizing FCC and state commissions' role in regulating the telecommunications industry. Members of Congress may have misunderstood the \"antitrust savings\" clause in the 1996 Act regarding private right of action under antitrust laws. The Trinko case prompted calls for legislation in response to the Supreme Court's decision. However, current FCC and court interpretations exempt certain network and service providers from Title II provisions, making the Trinko decision potentially irrelevant for them. Congress may need to clarify this distinction. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 established rules for the retransmission of television signals by cable operators to address concerns about local broadcast stations being carried or compensated. Congress created retransmission consent/must-carry rules to promote localism in programming. The retransmission consent/must-carry rules require local commercial broadcast television stations to choose between negotiating retransmission consent agreements with cable systems or having their signal carried without compensation. This election allows broadcasters to ensure compensation for popular programming and ensure carriage for less popular programming. The retransmission consent/must-carry rules were implemented to address cable company negotiating leverage with local broadcast stations. These rules also aim to limit broadcasting consolidation to maintain competition, localism, and diversity of voices in the media industry. Satellite and telephone providers entering the video distribution market are also subject to similar requirements. The FCC has rules on ownership of television and radio stations, cross-ownership of radio/television and newspaper/broadcast in local markets, national broadcast networks ownership, and station activities in the same market. The FCC must review ownership rules every four years to ensure they are in the public interest. Changes in the video market since 1992 have impacted negotiating power, with cable companies losing leverage to broadcasters due to increased competition from Dish Network, DirecTV, AT&T, and Verizon. Cable companies risk losing customers if they cannot reach retransmission consent agreements with broadcasters. The broadcaster's signal is crucial for cable companies to retain customers, especially if the broadcaster offers \"must-have\" programming. In the past, local broadcast stations rarely received cash payments for retransmission consent, instead opting for non-cash compensation from major broadcast networks. In the mid-2000s, broadcasters sought cash compensation for retransmission consent as they emulated the successful cable network business model. This shift was driven by the sensitivity of advertising revenues to the business cycle. In the mid-2000s, broadcasters shifted to cash compensation for retransmission consent, moving away from non-cash forms. This change was resisted by MVPDs. Negotiations were consolidated to cover multiple local markets in a single agreement. Additionally, online and mobile video distribution began to emerge, with MVPDs developing their own websites for retransmitting broadcast signals. Some broadcasters and MVPDs collaborated on \"TV Everywhere\" to extend consumer access through new gateways like tablet and smartphone apps. The traditional retransmission consent negotiations between broadcasters and MVPDs evolved due to the emergence of new online video distributors. This led to additional elements such as timing windows and exclusive/non-exclusive access to programming for screens other than the television screen. The terms, conditions, and rates within retransmission consent agreements increased, potentially causing negotiating impasses unrelated to the local market or station. In recent years, television stations have entered into sharing arrangements with other stations in their local market to jointly sell advertising and produce local news programming. These agreements have led to the proliferation of \"virtual duopolies\" where a single entity can negotiate retransmission consent on behalf of multiple stations, giving them leverage in negotiations. The FCC may not attribute control over one station to another in the same market, even if such control exists and must be reported under accounting practices. Television stations in local markets are forming virtual duopolies to jointly negotiate retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, giving them leverage in negotiations. The number of virtual duopolies is expected to increase with recent television group mergers. This consolidation is leading to larger station groups with increased negotiating power, prompting some cable companies to consider merging for a stronger negotiating position. According to a recent survey, 86% of households subscribe to a multichannel video service, with 42% using over-the-top services like Netflix. Only 1.4% of households discontinued their MVPD service in the past year, indicating no significant increase in cord-cutting. Online video distributors are entering the market, not subject to retransmission consent requirements. Aereo and similar companies use mini-antennas to retransmit broadcast signals to subscribers, claiming it does not infringe copyright. Broadcasters have sued for copyright infringement, but cases are ongoing. In markets without injunctions, these services offer an alternative to blacked-out programming during disputes between MVPDs and broadcasters. This could weaken broadcasters' position in retransmission consent disputes, but may also lead to fewer MVPD subscriptions. Aereo's use of mini-antennas to retransmit broadcast signals has led to copyright infringement lawsuits by broadcasters. Market developments have made broadcaster-distributor negotiations more contentious, resulting in several impasses and blackouts of broadcast television stations and cable networks. This could potentially weaken broadcasters' position in retransmission consent disputes and lead to fewer MVPD subscriptions. Congress is more concerned about broadcast-related blackouts than cable network-related blackouts due to its commitment to localism and diversity of voices. They may review the current statutory framework to address programming blackouts in the new market environment. Blackouts impact consumer protection. Retransmission consent blackouts between 2005 and 2013 resulted in households losing access to paid programming. SNLFinancial identified 35 blackouts lasting 28 days or longer, involving 145 stations in 111 markets. MVPDs face a dilemma in providing credits during blackouts, as it may support broadcasters' claims for higher compensation. Broadcaster negotiating tactics include timing blackouts with major sports events. Agreements during major sports events are crucial for broadcasters. Blackouts can limit local voices, especially if a broadcaster has a dominant position in the market. Suggestions to protect consumers include mandatory arbitration processes, but this could reduce broadcaster leverage. A compromise could be to mandate programming availability for 30 days during negotiations. The arbitration process could be used to resolve disputes between MVPDs and broadcasters. Structural regulations could be implemented to prevent undue negotiating leverage, especially in cases where a single entity owns multiple stations with significant reach. This entity could negotiate with MVPDs at a disadvantage, potentially leading to blackouts. Ownership of local broadcast stations is capped at 39% of U.S. television households. The UHF discount allows entities to reach up to 78% of U.S. television households by giving UHF stations only half-weight. The FCC is considering eliminating this discount, but there are differing opinions on its authority to do so. The digital transition has made UHF stations more advantageous than VHF stations in terms of transmission quality. The UHF discount allows entities to reach up to 78% of U.S. television households by giving UHF stations only half-weight. Congress may instruct the FCC to eliminate the discount to prevent undue negotiating leverage. There are concerns about the impact of allowing a single entity to own two major network-affiliated stations in a local market or have a virtual duopoly through sharing arrangements. The National Association of Broadcasters argue that duopolies can lead to increased investment in local programming and help keep stations on the air. Small cable operators, represented by the American Cable Association, argue that the increase in virtual duopolies puts them at a disadvantage in negotiations. They claim that smaller MVPDs pay higher retransmission consent fees compared to larger MVPDs. The operators suggest modifying the retransmission consent statute to prevent entities from negotiating on behalf of two different networks in the same local market. The Television Consumer Freedom Act (S. 912), introduced by Senator McCain, aims to address complexities in broadcaster/MVPD retransmission consent negotiations. It proposes prohibiting entities from negotiating for more than one station in a local market and incentivizing a la carte programming. MVPDs would be denied access to low-cost compulsory copyright if they don't offer broadcast signals on an a la carte basis. Broadcast stations would not receive compensation for retransmission if they don't offer their signal on an a la carte basis. The Television Consumer Freedom Act proposes prohibiting entities from negotiating for more than one station in a local market and incentivizing a la carte programming. Broadcast stations would not receive compensation for retransmission if they don't offer their signal on an a la carte basis. If an MVPD and a programmer fail to reach agreement, they must disclose the terms of their most recent offer to the FCC. This proposal aims to encourage channel-specific negotiations that are less likely to result in impasses. Consumers facing blackouts may turn to alternatives like Aereo or antennas for free broadcast signals, leading to a potential increase in cord-cutting. This shift to over-the-top alternatives could harm the financial interests of traditional MVPDs. The migration of MVPD customers to over-the-top alternatives may harm broadcasters and MVPDs financially. The increasing complexity of negotiations could lead to blackouts, impacting consumers. Efficient spectrum management is crucial due to the growing demand for wireless services. Spectrum's value lies in technology application and allocation for services. The allocation of spectrum for use is crucial, as different parts of the spectrum require specific equipment. Innovators need incentives to develop equipment for unused spectrum portions. Exclusive licenses or shared spectrum allocation affects technological development paths. Transmitters are regulated for interference, but receivers are not, leading to focused transmitter development efforts. Vendors focus on developing transmitters to meet regulatory requirements, but receivers lack the same attention. Different technologies applied to spectrum have varying characteristics, such as spread spectrum technology used in Wi-Fi for signal security. Cellular network providers' technologies in macro networks can create interference. The U.S. wireless broadband service heavily relies on both exclusive channel assignments and shared spectrum. The FCC employs a hybrid approach to spectrum allocation, utilizing auctions for exclusive rights and setting aside blocks for shared use. This approach aims to prevent favoritism towards a specific technology and promote innovation. The FCC manages spectrum by allowing different users to share blocks of spectrum while protecting broadcasters from interference. Spectrum management involves allocating spectrum, granting exclusive licenses, and setting rules for spectrum usage to prevent electromagnetic interference. Guard bands and white spaces are used as buffers to protect against interference. New technologies like network-centric technologies are changing spectrum management. New network-centric technologies are increasing spectrum productivity by allowing shared use and reducing interference, enabling multiple users to transmit data like traffic on the Internet. This technology enables spectrum sharing and more intensive spectrum utilization, utilizing unused white spaces and guard bands. Some in the wireless sector argue that exclusive spectrum allocation is more efficient than spectrum sharing, as it provides certainty for investment and promotes technological innovation. However, there are benefits to both spectrum sharing and exclusivity, so a combination of both methods may be beneficial for Congress and the FCC to consider. Peter Rysavy has highlighted the potential and challenges of spectrum sharing. Industry observer highlights the potential and challenges of spectrum sharing, noting that while it can lead to more efficient spectrum use, the complexity varies from simple to extremely difficult solutions. Current spectrum sharing solutions address basic issues like geographic sharing, but more complex scenarios, such as sharing between carrier class mobile technology and government systems, will require years of development and testing. Identifying compatible systems, negotiating access, and implementing economically viable solutions are key steps in making spectrum sharing a reality. The process of spectrum sharing involves identifying compatible systems, negotiating access rights, developing standards, modifying networks, and enforcing compliance. This complex process could take up to ten years or longer. The FCC and industry participants will have policy discussions on the pace of spectrum sharing advancement. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) is optimistic about the benefits of spectrum sharing. PCAST report emphasizes the importance of spectrum sharing over clearing and reallocating Federal spectrum due to cost and time constraints. Spectrum sharing is seen as crucial for the future, and Congress should ensure the statutory framework supports it. The traditional command-and-control approach to spectrum management is shifting towards a sharing model. The FCC has been given authority to implement market mechanisms like auctions and secondary spectrum markets to improve spectrum utilization. Spectrum allocation is crucial for efficient use, and Congress is taking steps to support spectrum sharing over clearing and reallocating Federal spectrum. The FCC has the authority to implement market mechanisms like auctions and secondary spectrum markets to improve spectrum utilization. Congress has taken actions to set prices on spectrum and allow its transfer to higher valued uses, increasing incentives for efficient spectrum use. The Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, also known as the Spectrum Act, allows the FCC to conduct incentive auctions for spectrum reallocation. Licensees can voluntarily relinquish broadcast television spectrum in exchange for proceeds from auctioning it to wireless broadband providers. The FCC has implemented spectrum leasing options without requiring approval, as long as the licensee maintains control of the leased spectrum. The FCC has adopted streamlined procedures for spectrum leasing, including a new option called \"private commons\" for peer-to-peer communications. Market mechanisms like auctions and secondary markets are efficient when private spectrum valuation aligns with societal valuation. The private valuation of spectrum is highest for providers with established products generating substantial revenues. Public and private valuation may diverge, requiring non-market allocation mechanisms. Public safety organizations may struggle to compete in spectrum auctions due to limited funds. The Spectrum Act addressed the need for spectrum availability for public safety by setting aside certain spectrum or establishing a system of shared use. Spectrum is crucial for new technologies and services, with some research conducted by firms without spectrum licenses. A public safety trust fund from auction revenues was proposed to address this issue. To foster innovation, setting aside spectrum for experimental, unlicensed use may be beneficial. Incumbent providers may oppose this to protect their business models. However, making spectrum available for experimentation and unlicensed services is essential for the development of new technologies. The wireless broadband ecosystem owes much of its strength to the development of Wi-Fi in unlicensed spectrum. The wireless broadband ecosystem is strong today due to Wi-Fi developing in unlicensed spectrum. The cost structure is characterized by economies of scale, leading to few efficient network providers. Subsidies are available to ensure service availability, and the FCC encourages spectrum license ownership for small businesses. However, many small companies have transferred their licenses to larger ones. Carriers and associations have raised concerns about competing for wireless customers in FCC proceedings. The fixed amount of available spectrum poses challenges for promoting diversity and competition in mobile services. Spectrum caps were introduced to prevent a few providers from controlling bands with superior propagation characteristics, limiting market access for others. The FCC replaced spectrum caps with case-by-case review of mobile spectrum holdings in 2003 to assess transactions involving licenses. A two-part screen is used to identify markets for further competitive analysis based on changes in market concentration and available spectrum for mobile services. Detailed reviews are conducted for highlighted markets to prevent anticompetitive conduct. In 2008, the analysis was extended to spectrum acquired through auctions, and in 2012, the FCC initiated a review of its spectrum screening process. In 2012, the FCC reviewed its spectrum screening process due to the increase in spectrum bands for mobile wireless service. The Department of Justice raised concerns about incumbent carriers controlling preferred spectrum and potentially acquiring spectrum for reasons other than expanding capacity or services. Rules were suggested to allow smaller networks without substantial low-frequency spectrum to have a chance to acquire such spectrum. The FCC proposed rules to allow smaller networks without substantial low-frequency spectrum to acquire such spectrum, aiming to improve competition among carriers and benefit consumers. This intervention in market-based auctions has faced criticism from Verizon and AT&T, who argue it could lead to unfair advantages for rivals. Pricing mechanisms like auctions and secondary markets play a role in efficient spectrum allocation, but clarity on rights is crucial for market participants. Market participants need clarity on their rights regarding interference protection when acquiring spectrum licenses through auctions or secondary markets. Efficient spectrum usage relies on market mechanisms that consider interference-related externalities. The level of interference created by one entity affects others' ability to use the spectrum effectively. Market participants need clarity on their rights regarding interference protection when acquiring spectrum licenses through auctions or secondary markets. Efficient spectrum usage relies on market mechanisms that consider interference-related externalities. Participants have parameters to modify interference impact, develop transmitters and receivers to mitigate interference, but costs are a concern. Collaboration can reduce interference impact for intensive spectrum use, as seen in Wi-Fi and network-centric technologies development. Basic ground rules on rights and responsibilities are necessary for collaborations to begin. Ground rules on rights and responsibilities are crucial for efficient spectrum usage. Licensees must prevent signal interference with adjacent bands. However, there is no rule requiring licensees to address interference caused by poorly tuned receivers picking up signals from both their own band and the adjacent band. As demand for spectrum increases, adjacent frequency channels are being utilized, leading to interference known as \"receiver overload\" or \"desensitization.\" This is more likely to occur with mass-market devices like GPS receivers. Inexpensive GPS devices may lack filters to prevent interference from adjacent channels, leading to pressure to protect GPS receivers from legal transmissions in adjacent channels. This issue arose in 2011 with LightSquared's broadband service causing interference to GPS devices. The FCC did not approve LightSquared's proposal due to interference with GPS devices, leading to unused spectrum. Lack of rules for selective receivers hinders spectrum utilization and may create moral hazard. The absence of receiver ground rules may lead to providers offering inexpensive receivers that do not block out signals from adjacent channels, creating interference issues. The need for ground rules for receivers is widely recognized, but there will be debate on the form these rules should take. Service providers and customers will seek to minimize the impact of any rules on their investments. In its recent spectrum report, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology proposed a receiver management framework that aims to define harmful interference and requirements for new entrants to co-exist with legacy systems. The report also highlighted concerns about the FCC's limited authority to implement receiver rules and suggested Congress may need to clarify this authority. The policy debate on updating the communications statutory framework involves budgetary and fairness considerations, especially regarding grandfather clauses. Spectrum auctions can efficiently allocate resources and generate government revenues, but non-market allocations may be necessary for certain public policy objectives like public safety and innovation. The policy debate on updating the communications statutory framework involves budgetary and fairness considerations, especially regarding grandfather clauses. Research and development opportunities for innovators in unlicensed spectrum and constraints on spectrum acquisition through auctions aim to protect against market foreclosure or support rural service providers. Congress may need to guide the FCC on balancing auction revenues with public policy goals. Changing regulations may harm existing providers or consumers, often addressed by grandfathering old regulations. The use of grandfather clauses in communications statutes and regulations is common, allowing legacy providers or customers to be exempt from proposed changes. This can reduce the public benefits of the proposed changes if certain parties are excluded. For example, media ownership rules often grandfather pre-existing cross ownership combinations. The FCC typically allows pre-existing combinations to be transferred to new entities, making them permanent. Broadcast satellite carriers can retransmit signals of distant television stations to specific subscribers. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology proposed a receiver management framework for spectrum sharing without imposing additional costs on receivers. Congress, the FCC, or the Obama Administration chose to limit policy changes to minimize harm to legacy markets. In considering future statutory changes, the overall public interest may not allow for grandfathering to minimize harm to legacy market participants."
