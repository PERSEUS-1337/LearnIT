The Congress finds that international demand and market speculation have increased the cost of producing circulating coins in the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury requested legislation to authorize changes in coin composition. The United States Mint has studied alternative metals for coins, as mentioned in its 2004 annual report. In 1943, zinc-coated steel pennies were produced by the Mint in response to wartime copper demands. The United States Mint switched to copper-coated zinc pennies in 1982 due to rising copper prices. The Royal Canadian Mint produces a similar coin at a lower cost. By reducing penny production costs to face value, the US could save over $500 million in the next 10 years. Additionally, reducing nickel production costs to face value would save an extra $60 million per year. Commodity metal prices are cyclical. Commodity metal prices are cyclical and can be inflated by speculation, so a solid rising price trend should be established before changing the metal content of a coin. Immediate reduction in the cost of producing 1-cent coins by using steel pennies. The composition of 1-cent and 5-cent coins is amended to primarily use steel for the 1-cent coin, giving it a copper appearance similar to current coins. The composition of 1-cent coins is amended to primarily use steel for a copper appearance similar to current coins, with an exception for numismatic pennies. An alternative composition can be considered by the Secretary within a specified timeframe. The Secretary may add elements to produce 1-cent coins at a cost less than 1 cent while maintaining ease of use and co-circulation with existing coins. The Secretary has the authority to add elements to produce 1-cent coins with the same specifications as before, without needing to comply with certain requirements, as long as the cost reduction can be achieved within 270 days. Any actions taken by the Secretary must be reported to Congress promptly. The Secretary has the authority to change the metallic content of 5-cent coins to a less costly alternative. The Secretary has the authority to change the metallic content of 5-cent coins to primarily steel with a nickel coating, ensuring they can co-circulate and work interchangeably with existing coins and coin handling machines. The Secretary can propose a change in the metallic content of 5-cent coins if it is more cost-effective and functional, considering factors like weight and composition. The Secretary considers factors like impact on suppliers, acceptability of new materials, and consultation with affected merchants when proposing changes to coin weight and composition. The Secretary considers various stakeholders' opinions and interests when determining any changes to the weight and composition of the 5-cent coin, after providing notice and opportunity for comment. The Secretary will engage in a formal rulemaking process, including a hearing and publication of notice, to determine changes to the weight and composition of the 5-cent coin. Additionally, a technical amendment removes the specification that the coin weighs 5 grams. The Secretary has the authority to conduct research and development on circulating coins, including testing and collaboration with various entities. A biennial report to Congress on coin production costs and alternative content analysis is required. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit a biennial report to Congress analyzing production costs and possible new materials for circulating coins. The report should include detailed recommendations for any changes to the metallic content of coins to improve production efficiency. The section includes recommendations for reducing production costs at the United States Mint for circulating coins, without requiring significant changes to coin-handling equipment. Legislative changes may be needed to achieve these goals. The Act requires no changes to coin-handling equipment for new coin specifications. Reports must not recommend changes that would allow the use of lower-value coins from other countries or tokens in place of US circulating coins. The House of Representatives passed the Act on May 8, 2008. Clerk: LORRAINE C. MILLER."
