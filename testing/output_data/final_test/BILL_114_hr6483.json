    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Swine Waste Infrastructure and Natural Environment Act\" or the \"SWINE Act.\" Congress finds that animal agricultural production is vital to the nation's economy and provides income for many families. Animal agricultural facilities, including CAFOs, generate large amounts of waste that can have negative environmental impacts. Traditional waste disposal methods have been shown to contaminate soil, water, and air with nitrogen and ammonia. During severe weather events, animal waste lagoons can overflow, posing risks to surrounding communities. In the Southeastern US, swine production facilities are often located in low-income areas. Collaborative efforts have led to advanced waste management technologies that reduce environmental and social impacts. The widespread adoption of superior waste management systems can reduce negative environmental and social impacts associated with \"lagoon and spray-field\" systems. However, barriers such as cost hinder implementation. Congress recognizes the benefits of converting existing systems to improve environmental and public health, promoting sustainable agriculture and resilience against severe weather events. The approval of new animal agricultural production facilities should be contingent on adopting superior waste management systems to reduce environmental impacts and promote resilience against severe weather events. New animal agricultural production facilities must adopt environmentally sustainable swine waste disposal technologies to reduce environmental impacts and enhance resilience against severe weather events. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a program certifying environmentally sustainable swine waste disposal technologies within 6 months of this Act. Standards will require technologies to eliminate animal discharge into water sources, reduce ammonia emissions, and minimize detectable odor from swine waste. The program certifying environmentally sustainable swine waste disposal technologies must substantially eliminate disease-transmitting vectors, airborne pathogens, nutrient and heavy metal contamination, and be cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness will be determined by considering subsidies and support available under this Act and other programs. The Secretary may consider adoption costs and operation/maintenance costs of a technology, without requiring cost parity with existing swine waste disposal technologies. Consultation with relevant agencies and states is required. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant agencies, certifies swine waste disposal technologies meeting environmental standards. Eligible technologies include stand-alone platforms and multi-part systems exceeding set standards. State permitting and certification requirements for swine farms are outlined in section 4, stating that no State can issue a permit to a concentrated animal feeding operation unless the farm disposes of swine waste using certified technology. Section 5 introduces a new initiative for swine waste management research and extension. The Secretary will make competitive grants for research and extension activities in consultation with advisory boards and task forces. Administration of the grants will follow specific guidelines, including the appointment of task forces to make recommendations for the grants. A task force will be appointed by the Secretary to make recommendations. The task force will include representatives from colleges, universities, the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the swine production industry, and nonprofit organizations focused on environmental and social effects of swine farm operations. Research and extension grants may be provided for environmentally superior swine waste management technologies. Priority will be given to proposals involving multiple entities, regions with high spray field and lagoon operations, reduced water usage, and decreased emissions of ammonia, odor, and pathogens. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits of environmentally friendly swine waste management technologies, including improved swine health, electricity generation, increased nutrient recovery, alternative uses of swine waste for renewable energy production, and enhanced nutrition management for swine. The curr_chunk discusses improvements in water quality, aquatic ecosystems, and efforts to reduce antibiotics in livestock. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. The curr_chunk discusses inserting grants awarded under section 1672A of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 before the semicolon. The curr_chunk discusses the eligibility of environmentally sustainable swine waste disposal technologies under EQIP and the introduction of swine waste disposal credits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The swine waste disposal technology installation credit allows taxpayers to claim 4% of qualified installation costs for certified swine waste disposal technology. Qualified costs are those incurred in the ordinary course of business. Certified technology must meet environmental sustainability standards. Certified sustainable technology under the Swine Waste Infrastructure and Natural Environment Act. \"Swine waste disposal credit under SEC. 45T.\" The swine waste disposal credit under section 45T allows taxpayers to claim a credit of $100 for every 1,000 pounds of swine waste disposed of using certified technology. The maximum credit is limited to the taxpayer's qualified costs for maintaining or operating the technology. The tax code is amended to include swine waste disposal technology credits under sections 45S(a) and 45T(a), allowing taxpayers to claim credits for installation and disposal of swine waste using certified technology. The tax code is amended to include swine waste disposal technology credits under sections 45S and 45T, allowing taxpayers to claim credits for installation and disposal of swine waste using certified technology. The tax code is amended to include swine waste disposal technology credits under sections 45S and 45T, applicable to amounts paid or incurred and swine waste disposed of after December 31, 2017. A \"swine farm\" is defined as a tract of land raising 250 or more porcine species animals."
