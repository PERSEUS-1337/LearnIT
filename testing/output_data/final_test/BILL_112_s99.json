    "content": "The text chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to nuclear reactor fuel and targets, including highly enriched uranium and alternative nuclear reactor fuel. It also outlines the criteria for fuel or target usage in nuclear research or test reactors. The text chunk defines medical isotopes as including molybdenum-99, iodine-131, xenon-133, and other radioactive materials used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The text chunk discusses the requirement for a report on the disposition of exports. The Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must submit a report to Congress within 1 year detailing the current status of past US exports of highly enriched uranium for nuclear research or test reactors, including location, irradiation status, approved use, physical and chemical forms, and storage conditions. The report to Congress must include details on the storage conditions of past US exports of highly enriched uranium to ensure protection against theft and unauthorized access. SEC. 6. DOMESTIC MEDICAL ISOTOPE PRODUCTION. Sec. 112 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to allow the use of highly enriched uranium for medical isotope production in a nuclear reactor only if no alternative target with less than 20% U-235 enrichment is available and the recipient provides necessary assurances. The amendment to Sec. 112 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 allows the use of highly enriched uranium for medical isotope production in a nuclear reactor only if no alternative target with less than 20% U-235 enrichment is available and the Secretary of Energy certifies active support for the development of such an alternative target. The amendment to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 allows the use of highly enriched uranium for medical isotope production in a nuclear reactor under certain conditions. The term 'highly enriched uranium' refers to uranium enriched to 20% or more in the isotope U-235, and 'medical isotope' includes various radioactive materials used for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The amendment allows the use of highly enriched uranium for domestic medical isotope production in a nuclear reactor. The Secretary must report to Congress annually on Department actions to support US production of molybdenum-99 for medical uses without highly enriched uranium. Reports will include details on recipients of Department funding, funding amounts, project milestones, expected impact on molybdenum-99 production, and project evaluations. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the evaluation findings and ultimate use of Department funds for projects under section 3, as well as actions taken to ensure safe disposition of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. SEC. 8. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORT. The Secretary will arrange for a study by the National Academy of Sciences on molybdenum-99 production and usage, to be submitted to Congress within 5 years. The report will detail global facilities producing molybdenum-99 for medical purposes, including their use of highly enriched uranium, and review international production over the past 5 years. The report will assess progress in establishing domestic production of molybdenum-99 for medical uses and eliminating worldwide use of highly enriched uranium in reactor fuel and medical isotope production facilities. The Nuclear Safety Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1980 is repealed. The budgetary effects of this Act will be determined for compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. Passed by the Senate on November 17, 2011."
