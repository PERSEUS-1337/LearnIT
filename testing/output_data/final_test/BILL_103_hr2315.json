The Congress found that the US suspended exports to Yugoslavia in 1991, followed by a UN embargo on weapons. The US believed its policy complied with the UN resolution and took no further action. Another UN resolution in 1992 extended the arms embargo to any new independent states. On February 29 and March 1, 1992, Bosnia-Hercegovina voted for independence from Yugoslavia. The US recognized Bosnia-Hercegovina on April 7, 1992, and it became a full member of the UN on May 22, 1992. The US continued its policy towards independent states emerging from Yugoslavia, including Bosnia-Hercegovina, after Resolution 727. Following the independence referendum, Sarajevo was besieged, and fighting spread in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Government of Serbia intervened in the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina by providing military, financial, and political support to Serbian-allied forces. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe accused Serbia and the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav National Army of aggression against Bosnia-Hercegovina. The United Nations Security Council condemned Serbia for not respecting Bosnia-Hercegovina's territorial integrity in Resolution 757. Serbian-allied forces occupy 70% of Bosnia-Hercegovina, commit human rights violations, and aim for unification with Serbia. This constitutes an armed attack on Bosnia-Hercegovina by Serbia, allowing Bosnia-Hercegovina the right to self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The United Nations Security Council has not taken adequate measures to maintain peace and security in response to the armed attack on Bosnia-Hercegovina by Serbia. Bosnia-Hercegovina lacks the means to counter Serbia's heavy weaponry obtained from the Yugoslav National Army, due to an international arms embargo preventing them from acquiring necessary resources. On December 18, 1992, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 47/121 with the affirmative vote of the United States, urging the United Nations Security Council to exempt Bosnia-Hercegovina from the mandatory arms embargo imposed by Resolution 713. This embargo undermines Bosnia-Hercegovina's right to self-defense under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter allows countries to request and receive military assistance from other nations. The United States imposes an arms embargo on the government of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The President will end the US arms embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina upon receiving a request for self-defense assistance under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The embargo refers to the policy in place since July 10, 1991, denying approval for defense transfers. The US arms embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina will be lifted upon receiving a request for self-defense assistance under Article 51 of the UN Charter, ending the denial for transfers of defense articles and services to the former Yugoslavia. The US arms embargo on Bosnia-Hercegovina will be lifted upon receiving a request for self-defense assistance under Article 51 of the UN Charter. United States military assistance will be provided to Bosnia-Hercegovina. The President should provide military assistance to Bosnia-Hercegovina upon request for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The President is authorized to provide defense articles, services, and training on determined terms and conditions. The President is authorized to provide military assistance to Bosnia-Hercegovina for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The total value of defense articles, services, and training provided should not exceed $200,000,000. The authorization expires at the end of fiscal year 1994, and US Armed Forces members involved in these activities must not engage in combat duties. The President is authorized to provide military assistance to Bosnia-Hercegovina for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The President must report to Congress every 60 days on the defense articles, services, and training provided. Reimbursement for these services is not required except for funds appropriated by Congress. The President is authorized to provide military assistance to Bosnia-Hercegovina for self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Reimbursement for defense articles, services, or training provided is not required except for funds appropriated by Congress."
