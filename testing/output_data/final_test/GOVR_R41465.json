    "content": "Some Members of Congress are interested in past institutional mechanisms used to address federal spending, such as the Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures from 1941 to 1974. Senator Harry F. Byrd initiated this committee through the Revenue Act of 1941, which was recommended by the Senate Finance Committee and chaired by Senator Byrd until 1965. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures was established in 1941 and renamed during the 91st Congress. It was terminated in 1974 by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. The report traces the committee's history, work products, considerations for creating a similar committee, and oversight authority in House and Senate committees. Senator Byrd introduced S.Con.Res. 5 in 1941 to create the joint committee with a broader mandate than just recommending nonessential federal expenditures. The Joint Committee under a concurrent resolution was tasked with investigating and making recommendations on federal fiscal post-war problems, impounding unexpended appropriations for non-essential purposes, and revising the tax system to simplify and equalize the tax burden. Senator Byrd aimed to cut nondefense spending, reduce public debt, and streamline the tax system to allocate maximum resources for national defense. The Joint Committee, established to address post-war economic adjustment and national defense, was tasked with investigating federal expenditures and recommending cuts to nonessential spending. It was authorized to hold hearings, employ experts, and make recommendations to streamline the tax system. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures, comprised of 14 members from Senate and House Committees on Appropriations and Finance, was authorized to utilize federal resources to formulate recommendations on cutting nonessential spending. It had a budget of $10,000 and reported its recommendations to Congress for consideration by the Appropriations Committees. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures was terminated in 1974, with its functions and personnel transferred to the Congressional Budget Office. Its work was not widely publicized but was of excellent professional quality. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures, terminated in 1974, provided a scorekeeping record of congressional action and its impact on the budget. Its work aimed to recommend savings in federal spending and enhance the CBO's role in the budget process. On the eve of World War II, the United States faced a significant debt of $55 billion to its creditors, which quickly expanded to $80 billion due to national defense requirements. The prospect of a national debt reaching $200 billion was concerning, representing 123% of GDP in 1942. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures highlighted areas where government agencies had too much autonomy in spending decisions, not always monitored by Congress. During World War II, the United States faced a high debt of 92% of GDP, prompting calls for immediate action to strengthen federal finances. Newspapers warned of financial struggles as war efforts began, with fears of bankruptcy if the country entered the war. Secretary of the Treasury emphasized the need for a strong fiscal program to combat inflation, leading to considerations of price fixing by President Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Eccles expressed concerns about rising prices and inflation during WWII. Calls for higher taxes and reduced federal spending were made to finance the war and prevent inflation. Members of Congress viewed deficit reduction as crucial for national security, with a focus on cutting nonessential expenditures to redirect funds towards the war effort. Senator Byrd emphasized the importance of economic austerity in wartime, shifting priorities from nonessential to vital spending. During WWII, calls for higher taxes and reduced federal spending were made to finance the war effort and prevent inflation. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures identified potential savings in the federal budget to redirect funds towards the war. However, after the war, there was a lack of urgency to control spending, leading to a decrease in the committee's activity. Senator Byrd's retirement in 1965 further slowed down the committee's output. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures focused on identifying permanent agencies essential to government operations for increased efficiency. They recommended abolishing certain programs like the Office of Education, Works Progress Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps, and National Youth Administration, resulting in potential savings of $1.3 billion. Subsequent reports claimed savings of $1.313 billion in July 1942 and approximately $2 billion by December 1943. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures recommended abolishing certain programs like the Office of Education, Works Progress Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps, and National Youth Administration, resulting in potential savings of $2 billion to-date. Debate in Congress showed limited disagreement on the need for cuts, with concerns raised about the impact on lower-income Americans, farmers, and underprivileged children. Senator La Follette expressed concerns about unforeseen problems with the proposed cuts. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures recommended cuts to various programs, including school lunches for underprivileged children. Senator La Follette emphasized the importance of addressing poverty as a national security issue. The committee's reports in the 1940s and 1950s suggested cuts and modifications in different areas, such as reducing surveys and liquidating Regional Agricultural Credit Corporations. The joint committee recommended liquidating all of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation's holdings by the end of FY1945. They also reported success in reducing the federal workforce and suggested giving the director of the Bureau of the Budget authority to order reductions in establishments subject to the Overtime Pay Act. Additionally, the committee noted Congress's lack of oversight over government corporations and proposed making the comptroller general the auditor and comptroller of every government corporation. They also found that Congress lacked necessary oversight over funds collected and spent by government agencies operating. The joint committee recommended liquidating all of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation's holdings by the end of FY1945 and reducing the federal workforce. They also proposed giving the director of the Bureau of the Budget authority to order reductions in establishments subject to the Overtime Pay Act. Additionally, the committee highlighted Congress's lack of oversight over government corporations and funds collected and spent by government agencies operating internationally. Treasury was suggested to monitor the collection and use of funds, especially from agencies generating revenue independently. The committee expressed concern about unmonitored spending of unexpended balances by agencies, as reflected in reports from 1953 to 1956. Beginning in 1960, the joint committee started monthly reporting on the federal government's stockpiles of various items. This new focus may have caused friction with agency administrators under increased surveillance. In 1962, Senator Byrd raised concerns about lack of access to government data on federal stockpiles. He requested an executive order to declassify more information, following President Kennedy's call for an investigation into the size of the stockpiles. This may have been influenced by the joint committee's interest in oversight. The Senate Armed Services Committee, including Senator Byrd, investigated a 1950s Federal Housing Administration scandal involving developers pocketing excess federal loan money. Senator Byrd also opposed funding for housing programs and the creation of a federal Department for Housing and Urban Development. The joint committee may have been interested in overseeing funds from loan activities. After Senator Byrd's retirement in 1965, the joint committee became less active. During this period, the joint committee, led by Representative George H. Mahon, introduced scorekeeping reports to track the impact of presidential and congressional actions on budget estimates. The reports became a regular feature of the committee's work, although their effect on deficit reduction is unclear. In 1950, Senators Byrd and Humphrey debated the committee's value, with Humphrey proposing to dissolve it due to misleading and incomplete information in its reports. Senator Byrd and Senator Humphrey debated the value of the joint committee in 1950, with Humphrey proposing its dissolution due to misleading and incomplete information in its reports. Byrd defended the committee's work, citing budget reductions attributed to its efforts and questioning the accuracy of Humphrey's claims. Humphrey's objection may have stemmed from Byrd's scrutiny of the Post Office Department, a target of the joint committee's investigations. In April 1953, the Post Office Department stopped reporting personnel data to the joint committee due to inaccuracies, prompting corrective action by the acting postmaster general. Senator Byrd acknowledged the department's past errors but praised the efforts to rectify them. It is unclear if the department's constant scrutiny by the joint committee influenced its actions. The department resumed submitting reports in July 1953. The Post Office Department resumed submitting reports in July 1953, noting a slight increase in personnel. Hearings in 1965 discussed proposals to strengthen the Joint Committee on Non-Essential Federal Expenditures and improve budget-related work with integrated information systems. The Joint Committee on Non-Essential Federal Expenditures received mixed feedback on its budget-related work. Representative George H. Mahon expressed skepticism about improving budget decision making in Congress and suggested early meetings with committee leaders and the Director of the Budget. Senator Byrd highlighted the challenges faced by the Joint Committee on Non-Essential Federal Expenditures due to the busy schedules of its members. He emphasized the importance of Congress reviewing the President's budget as a whole, which was a key purpose of the joint committee's membership. Senator Byrd emphasized the need for more factual information in fiscal legislation and supported budget process reform proposals. The idea of a \"revitalized\" joint committee with professional staff for budget analyses was suggested by congressional scholar Stephen Horn. This report also briefly explains the potential creation of a new committee for budget control. The report discusses the process of creating a new committee in the House or Senate to assist in reducing federal spending. Committees can be standing, select, special, or joint, with the authority to report legislation or conduct studies. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 does not apply to the creation of a committee with legislative authority. House and Senate committees can report various types of legislation with budgetary impact, which are considered within the framework of budget laws and rules. Newly created committees with legislative authority must follow the Budget Act when reporting legislation with budgetary impact. The Budget Act and chamber rules apply to committees with legislative authority when reporting legislation with budgetary impact. Expedited procedures may be created to limit debate and amendment processes for such legislation. The Responsible Fiscal Action Act of 2010 included expedited procedures for considering task force recommendations to improve the federal government's long-term fiscal imbalance. Savings can be achieved through appropriations, legislative, or reconciliation processes, with appropriations bills able to modify or eliminate spending for federal programs. Other spending measures can also change or eliminate programs. Congress can use the reconciliation process to cut spending and make changes to laws with budgetary impact, such as tax laws. Instructions in a budget resolution can direct congressional committees to report legislation to reduce spending by specific amounts. The House and Senate Budget Committees typically combine reported legislation into a reconciliation bill for consideration and agreement. If new committees are created to reduce federal expenditures, they would conduct oversight activities to identify savings. The oversight authority of House and Senate committees can be used to identify savings and support reductions in federal spending. Standing committees are responsible for legislative review, including examining law implementation, efficiency, costs, program effectiveness, and potential changes. Congress included oversight provisions in the Legislative Reorganization Acts of 1946 and 1970 to assist standing committees in appraising laws and developing necessary amendments or related legislation. The 1970 act included oversight provisions for House and Senate committees to monitor law implementation and develop necessary amendments or legislation. Each standing committee shall review and study the application, administration, and execution of laws within its jurisdiction and submit a report on its activities every odd-numbered year. This provision does not apply to certain specific committees. The Senate requires each standing committee to review and study laws within its jurisdiction and submit a report every odd-numbered year. This provision excludes the Committee on Appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations is exempt from certain oversight provisions. Federal statutes support congressional committees in their oversight work, requiring reports from the President, executive departments, and inspectors general to be transmitted to Congress. The Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service provide additional resources for oversight. The House Appropriations Committee conducts year-round oversight and investigations, while House legislative committees have rules for studying and informing themselves. House legislative committees have oversight authority to study and make recommendations on spending matters. Rules include oversight plans, establishment of oversight committees, and coordination by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Special oversight authority is granted to named standing committees. Additional functions are assigned to the Appropriations and Budget Committees. The House legislative committees have oversight authority to study spending matters, with rules including oversight plans, establishment of oversight committees, and coordination by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Special oversight functions are assigned to specific standing committees, including the Appropriations and Budget Committees. These committees have additional responsibilities such as issuing subpoenas, reviewing appropriations for legislation, and submitting \"views and estimates\" to the Budget Committee. The House legislative committees have oversight authority to study spending matters, including requirements for hearings on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement, disclaimers of agency financial statements, and high-risk federal programs. Committees must include oversight findings and cost estimates in reports on legislation, disclose unauthorized appropriations in reports on general appropriations measures, and adhere to a layover rule for printed hearings on appropriation bills. Special rules must specify preclusion of amendments to strike unfunded mandates from measures considered on the floor. The House Rules include restrictions on appropriations bills, disclosure of earmarks, and a pay-go requirement. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has broad authority over government operations and activities, including the ability to conduct investigations without regard to other committees' jurisdiction. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures existed concurrently with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 1974. The Senate Appropriations Committee conducts year-round oversight, and Senate legislative committees can study and make recommendations on spending-related matters. Standing committees have oversight statements based on the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. For example, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee reviews health, education, training, and public welfare matters. The Budget Committee and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs have broad authority to study budget outlays, tax expenditures, agency efficiency, and intergovernmental relationships. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures existed concurrently with predecessor committees until 1974. The oversight provision of the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act appears in Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 8, with only the Appropriations and Budget Committees exempted from the rule. Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 1 empowers each standing committee to act throughout a Congress, issue subpoenas, and conduct investigations. Each committee with legislative authority is exhorted to ensure that federal and District of Columbia programs are designed and activities are carried out annually. The oversight provision of the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act directs Senate committees to review programs not receiving annual appropriations and consider modifications for future funding. Committees must include cost estimates and other information in reports accompanying legislation. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures' impact on budget decisions is unclear based on CRS research. The Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-Essential Federal Expenditures focused on oversight and recommendations, lacking legislative authority. It was closely associated with Senator Byrd and comprised chairs and ranking minority members of other committees. The committee's role was to shine a light on federal programs, leaving follow-through to other committees. Senator Byrd advocated for viewing the federal budget as a whole and exerting congressional control over all components of federal spending. His idea was not widely embraced during his tenure but gained acceptance later. Byrd's legacy includes a desire to recapture congressional authority over budget decisions from the executive branch. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 gave Congress budget authority, with Senator Byrd and Representative Mahon playing key roles. Creating new budget committees faces challenges due to jurisdictional disputes and the need for a unique role to achieve legislative results. Creating a committee with the authority to cut federal spending poses challenges, including potential conflicts with existing committees. Determining what falls under federal spending, such as appropriations, entitlements, and tax expenditures, is crucial. Various committees and legislative processes could be utilized to achieve the goal of cutting spending responsibly and with public support. Examining federal programs based on agreed-upon criteria would be necessary to achieve this objective. Creating more committees to examine federal programs and activities based on agreed-on criteria, such as cost-benefit, effectiveness, duplication, constitutional authority, and potential for corruption. Standing congressional committees have oversight and legislative authority, with chambers able to direct committees and party conferences conditioning chairmanships. Coordination in large legislative purposes can be complex. Establishing a new committee to investigate Federal expenditures is a complex task due to the modern era's expansion of the federal government's role and responsibilities. The committee would consist of members from various Senate and House committees appointed by their respective leaders. The complexity of today's society, economy, and federal programs must be considered when designing such a committee or scaling back federal spending. The committee, appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, will study Federal expenditures to recommend eliminating or reducing nonessential expenses. A majority vote is required for decision-making, and the committee must report its findings and recommendations to the President and Congress promptly. The committee is authorized to hold hearings, employ experts, require witness testimony and documents, utilize government services, and receive funding for expenses. The committee's authority will end when the final report is submitted."
