    "content": "The United States utilizes public diplomacy to engage directly with citizens, community leaders, and opinion makers in foreign countries to influence their attitudes and actions in support of U.S. policies and interests. This approach focuses on building lasting relationships and understanding through the exchange of people and ideas. The United States utilizes public diplomacy to engage with foreign citizens, community leaders, and opinion makers to influence their attitudes and actions in support of U.S. policies and interests. Public diplomacy tools include people-to-people contact, expert speaker programs, art and cultural performances, and the Internet. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. losing its public diplomacy capacity to address international challenges effectively. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. public diplomacy efforts were primarily carried out by the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) and non-military international broadcasting entities like Voice of America. Resources for public diplomacy dwindled post-Cold War, leading to a belief that the ideological fight was over. In 1999, USIA was abolished and its responsibilities were folded into the State Department with reduced resources. Interest in public diplomacy was renewed after the 9/11 attacks and during U.S. combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The need for a strong public diplomacy program was emphasized due to concerns about the declining worldwide perception of the United States. Changes in the world order and advancements in information technology have created a new dynamic for U.S. public diplomacy initiatives. The rapid evolution of international communications and information sharing is driven by the proliferation of global broadcasters using satellite technologies. The proliferation of global and regional broadcasters using satellite technologies, along with the global reach of news websites on the Internet, has diversified the shaping of attitudes of foreign populations. Individual communicators can now influence large numbers of people globally through social networking, challenging traditional media's importance. Online social media networks like weblogs, Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook enable global connections and \"many-to-many\" information exchanges, bypassing traditional \"one-to-many\" sources. The method of information delivery has changed with mobile devices capable of sending large amounts of information. Communication through new media shapes impressions about the United States and its society. U.S. public diplomacy and international broadcasting must compete for attention and credibility in a global communications environment where information spreads quickly. Foreign public perceptions created in this environment can be more important than reality. Foreign public perceptions are crucial and can impact the United States' ability to form alliances, conduct military operations, and pursue foreign policy objectives. Under Secretary of State Judith McHale emphasized the importance of building trust with global populations to garner support for U.S. policies. To improve U.S. public diplomacy, various government agencies and organizations are debating different approaches, defining strategies, and ensuring adequate resources. This is crucial as building trust with global populations is essential for garnering support for U.S. policies and forming alliances. The report is divided into five sections covering the background of U.S. public diplomacy, the abolishment of USIA, the current structure within the Department of State, policy issues and challenges, and proposed legislation for reform. The legislative authorities for U.S. public diplomacy activities are outlined, including the historical context since World War I, the creation of USIA in 1953, and budget information. Four acts establish the foundational authority for public diplomacy: the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, and the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, along with other legislative acts, authorizes six Under Secretaries of State, including one for Public Diplomacy. The Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy is responsible for assisting in the formation and implementation of U.S. public diplomacy policies, international educational and cultural exchange programs, information, and international broadcasting. Responsibilities include preparing an annual strategic plan, program evaluation, and collaboration with USAID and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 authorizes the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy to assist in forming and implementing U.S. public diplomacy policies. This includes international educational and cultural exchange programs, information, and international broadcasting. The Under Secretary collaborates with USAID and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The United States Information and Education Exchange Act of 1948 requires the Secretary of State to integrate public diplomacy into U.S. foreign policy planning and execution, coordinate public diplomacy activities, develop a strategy for PD resources, and ensure information on U.S. assistance is widely disseminated. The Smith-Mundt Act, also known as the United States Information and Education Exchange Act of 1948, aims to promote better understanding of the United States in other countries and increase mutual understanding between people. It authorizes the Secretary of State to disseminate information about the U.S. through various media and information centers abroad. The Smith-Mundt Act prohibits the dissemination of materials developed under its authorities within the United States, but allows access to such information in English at the Department of State for certain groups. The Director of the United States Information Agency is required to make information available to the Archivist of the United States for domestic purposes. The Smith-Mundt Act prohibits the dissemination of materials within the United States but allows access to such information in English at the Department of State for certain groups. The United States Information Agency must provide motion pictures, films, and other material for domestic distribution to the Archivist of the United States 12 years after initial dissemination abroad. Section 502 of the act places limitations on government international information activities to prevent competition with private dissemination and ensure no monopoly in information production. Section 1005 states the Secretary of State must utilize private agencies' services to the maximum extent practicable. The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act, authorizes U.S. exchange programs as a public diplomacy tool to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries through educational and cultural exchanges. It emphasizes utilizing private agencies' services to the maximum extent practicable. The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act, aims to demonstrate educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the U.S. and other nations. It promotes international cooperation for educational and cultural advancement and assists in developing friendly relations between the U.S. and other countries. The President is authorized to take action to strengthen international cooperation, including providing grants for exchanges, participating in international fairs, and exchanging publications. The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act, promotes international cooperation for educational and cultural advancement. It includes provisions for the interchange of books, periodicals, and government publications, technical and scientific material and equipment, as well as the establishment of cultural and technical centers. Additionally, it supports the establishment and operation of schools abroad, American studies in foreign countries, foreign language and area studies training for Americans, and U.S. representation at international educational, scientific, and technical meetings. It also aims to promote respect for religious freedom through interchanges and visits between the United States and other nations. Section 103 and 104 of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act authorize the President to enter into international agreements and delegate his authorities for U.S. sponsored exchanges. Various federal agencies, including the Department of State and USAID, administer exchange programs under this act. Section 112 establishes a Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to oversee programs like the Fulbright Exchange Program and the Hubert H. Humphrey Program. The United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 reorganizes U.S. international broadcasting, creating the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) and the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) to promote freedom and democracy through accurate news and information. The United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 established the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) and the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) to promote freedom and democracy by broadcasting accurate, objective, and balanced news and information about the United States and the world to audiences abroad. The act emphasizes the professional independence and integrity of the broadcasting services and grantees, setting standards for U.S. international broadcasting to include reliable news, a balanced projection of U.S. thought and institutions, and clear presentation of government policies. The Voice of America presents U.S. government views and promotes responsible discussion on policies, supports foreign policy objectives during crises, and serves underserved populations. U.S. government communication efforts with foreign publics have historically increased during times of perceived national security threats, such as during World War I when the Committee on Public Information was established by President Woodrow Wilson to counter German propaganda but also disseminated its own distortions to both domestic and foreign audiences. During World War II, President Roosevelt established the Office of War Information (OWI) to provide news of the war and U.S. policies to American and foreign audiences. The OWI included the Voice of America (VOA) as part of its programs. After the war, President Truman transferred OWI's functions to the Department of State, making VOA the official overseas broadcast arm of the United States. This move was part of efforts to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War. In response to Soviet influence during the Cold War, the U.S. created programs like the Fulbright Act and the Smith-Mundt Act to engage in a non-military battle of ideology. This led to the establishment of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 1953 under President Eisenhower. President Dwight Eisenhower established the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 1953 to conduct international information and exchange programs in support of U.S. foreign policy. USIA's main goals were to explain and advocate U.S. policies in foreign cultures, provide information about U.S. values and institutions, promote international engagement for American citizens, and advise policymakers. The United States Information Agency (USIA) was established in 1953 by President Dwight Eisenhower to conduct international information and exchange programs in support of U.S. foreign policy. USIA's main goals were to explain and advocate U.S. policies in foreign cultures, provide information about U.S. values and institutions, promote international engagement for American citizens, and advise policymakers. USIA was headed by a director, a deputy director, and three associate directors who led its major bureaus: the Bureau of Information, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and the Bureau of Management. USIA's support offices included the Office of Public Liaison, the Office of the General Counsel, and the Office of Research and Media Reaction. The Office of Research and Media Reaction conducted polling activities and provided daily analysis of overseas press opinion on U.S. foreign policy. USIA regional affairs offices supported and coordinated activities in the field, where USIA was known as the U.S. Information Service (USIS). The Bureau of Information within USIA produced and distributed publications in multiple languages supporting U.S. policy objectives, including information on U.S. history, politics, economy, and culture. They utilized new technologies like teletype and the Internet to deliver information to USIS offices in the field, leading to a significant increase in the availability of printed materials and other types of information. Examples of information sent through electronic media included the Washington File, official U.S. public statements, a USIA website, and issue-specific websites like the one covering the Kyoto Climate Change Conference.

They utilized new technologies like teletype and the Internet to deliver information to USIS offices in the field, leading to a significant increase in the availability of printed materials and other types of information. Examples of information sent through electronic media included the Washington File, official U.S. public statements, a USIA website, and issue-specific websites such as the one covering the Kyoto Climate Change Conference. Additionally, the bureau's Speakers Program sent recognized U.S. speakers to foreign countries each year for speaking engagements on various topics. The Information Agency facilitated debates between public diplomacy and political officers on incorporating opposing ideas. USIA-sponsored academics who disagreed with current policy were admired for their courage. The Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs managed educational and cultural exchanges, including the Fulbright Program. Video and telephone conferences were used for timely discussions on current issues. The Bureau of Management provided agency-wide management support and administrative services, including control of its own human resources program. The Bureau also facilitated professional and cultural exchanges, such as the Fulbright Program and the International Visitors Program, to promote academic study, internships, and cultural understanding between the United States and other countries. Additionally, programs for cultural ambassadors were run to share American culture with foreign publics. USIA had control of its own human resources program, budget, and operations. It housed all broadcasting services initially, later transitioning to the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) within USIA. The BBG oversaw the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB). The International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) was overseen by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) and included services like Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The BBG reviewed and evaluated the operations of these radios, determined language services, and funded surrogate radio grantees. In 1999, there were 660 hours of weekly VOA programming in 53 languages, radio and television broadcasting in Spanish to Cuba, and over 500 hours per week of RFE/RL programming in 23 languages to Central Europe, Russia, and Iran. In 1999, the USIA operated 190 USIS posts in 142 countries with 520 foreign service officers and 2,521 locally hired staff. USIS activities were planned on a country-specific basis with the support of six geographic offices. The USIA operated 190 USIS posts in 142 countries with foreign service officers and locally hired staff. USIS foreign service positions at embassies included the public affairs officer (PAO), responsible for managing information and cultural activities, the information officer (IO) who worked with media and drafted policy guidance, and other public diplomacy officers. The USIS officer worked with local editors and reporters to explain U.S. policies and culture, supported American journalists, and advocated U.S. positions while engaging with the host country's society on various issues. The cultural affairs officer administered educational and cultural exchange programs, arranged programs with U.S. speakers, and collaborated with local publishers to translate American publications. Prior to the dissolution of USIA and the consolidation of its functions into the Department of State, the FY1999 appropriations request for USIA was approximately $1.12 billion. The Foreign Affairs Agencies Consolidation Act of 1998 abolished USIA and transferred its functions to the Secretary of State, creating the position of Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy in the Department of State. The end of the Cold War led to the transfer of public diplomacy responsibilities from USIA to the Department of State. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the justification for strong public diplomacy against them disappeared. Many saw USIA as a Cold War relic and struggled to define its mission in the post-Cold War era. USIA was seen as a Cold War relic and had difficulty defining its mission in the post-Cold War era. There were debates about the need for public diplomacy resources and the importance of maintaining a separate organization from the State Department to build long-term relationships with foreign peoples. Public diplomats aim to advocate for the United States on short-term issues and explain U.S. actions to foreign publics positively. Some argue that closer proximity to the State Department would improve coordination between public diplomacy and foreign policy, especially with the rapid spread of news and information globally. The decision to abolish USIA and merge public diplomacy into the State Department was driven by a desire to prioritize quick responses to policy issues over long-term mutual understanding efforts. This was part of a broader effort to streamline government, reduce resources, and address concerns about the national debt and government size. USIA was consolidated with other foreign affairs agencies as part of this reorganization. The Consolidation Act eliminated USIA and ACDA, with USAID surviving in a restructured form. USIA's Bureau of Information Programs and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs were merged into a new State Department Bureau responsible for advocating U.S. policy positions with foreign audiences. State's Bureau of Public Affairs took over running foreign press centers and regional area offices. The Consolidation Act dismantled USIA and integrated its functions into the State Department. It also established the Broadcasting Board of Governors as an independent entity, respecting the professional independence of the International Broadcasting Bureau. The Consolidation Act integrated USIA functions into the State Department and established the Broadcasting Board of Governors as an independent entity. It maintained deniability for U.S. diplomats regarding broadcasts and ensured independence for broadcasters. The Act emphasized consistency with U.S. foreign policy objectives and made the Secretary of State a permanent voting member of the board. Recommendations for reform suggest creating a new agency for public diplomacy. The current structure of public diplomacy organization involves the Department of State led by the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Calls for reform suggest creating a new agency to handle public diplomacy separately from the State Department. Judith McHale became Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs in 2009. The structure includes three bureaus and two offices reporting to the Under Secretary, focusing on educational and cultural exchange and utilizing new technologies. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs aims to foster mutual understanding through exchanges. The Offices of Academic Exchange Programs, Citizen Exchanges, English Language Programs, and International Visitors implement programs for educational and professional exchanges. The Fulbright Program, administered by the Office of Academic Exchange Programs, is a flagship exchange program with a total funding of $262,454,000 for the 2008-2009 academic year. Approximately 7,000 new Fulbright awards were made, including categories for U.S. students, visiting students, U.S. scholars, visiting scholars, and Fulbright teacher program awards. The Office of Private Sector Exchanges oversees 15 categories of citizen exchanges bringing foreign nationals to the United States. The Office of Private Sector Exchanges oversees 15 categories of citizen exchanges bringing foreign nationals to the United States, including Alien Physicians, Au Pairs, Camp Counselors, Government Visitors, International Visitors, Interns, Professors, Research Scholars, Short-Term Scholars, Specialists, Students-Secondary, Students-College/University, Summer Work Travel, Teachers, and Trainees. The office designates sponsoring organizations, ensures compliance with regulations, and resolves issues in exchange programs. Over 1,400 organizations are designated to administer exchanges, with more than 300,000 individuals participating annually and over 1 million alumni worldwide. The Office of Citizen Exchanges implements various programs to promote cross-cultural understanding and collaboration, including the \"Cultural Envoy Program.\" This program sponsors American artists to share their traditions with foreign audiences. The Obama Administration supports these exchanges as they foster engagement and dialogue among citizens worldwide, especially with key influencers like educators, clerics, journalists, women, and youth. The Bureau of Information Programs, IIP, engages key influencers like educators, clerics, journalists, women, and youth to promote American values and culture. It administers programs in multiple languages to improve international receptiveness to the United States. IIP produces publications on U.S. policy, society, and culture, distributed through U.S. embassies and consulates in over 140 countries. The Bureau of Information Programs, IIP, promotes American values and culture through various programs and publications. They translate American literary works into different languages and establish joint publishing agreements with local publishers. Additionally, IIP operates American Corners in partnership with host country institutions to provide U.S. material and host events for the local population. IIP promotes American values and culture through various programs and publications. American Corners, unlike American Centers, are often staffed by the partnered institution's personnel. America.gov provides videos, blogs, timelines, web chats, articles, and news stories in multiple languages. The website covers a wide range of topics, including diversity of religions in America and the experiences of young Chinese American cartoonists. IIP also has a Digital Outreach Team that communicates on popular Arabic, Persian, and Urdu platforms to explain U.S. policies. The Digital Outreach Team members from the Department of State interact on various internet sites to explain U.S. foreign policy and counter misinformation. They post comments, op-ed pieces, and translated videos. The Bureau of Public Affairs informs the American public about U.S. foreign policy and conducts press briefings. The Bureau of Public Affairs manages press briefings for domestic and foreign press corps, arranges town meetings, and prepares historical studies on U.S. diplomacy. R/PPR provides strategic planning for public diplomacy initiatives to meet national security objectives. The Evaluation and Measurement Unit evaluates public diplomacy programs, while R/PSO develops relationships with private sector leaders to promote foreign policy objectives. The public affairs section at U.S. embassies manages informational and cultural programs to explain government policy, counter false conceptions, and promote educational exchanges with foreign countries. Responsibilities are shared by cultural affairs officers and information officers at large embassies, while public affairs officers handle duties at other embassies. These programs aim to empower women leaders, counter violent extremism, and strengthen international education. The public affairs section at U.S. embassies manages informational and cultural programs to explain government policy, counter false conceptions, and promote educational exchanges with foreign countries. The PAO sponsors trips by American cultural ambassadors, brings American speakers to engage on important issues, conducts informal outreach, coordinates embassy communications with the media, issues press releases, and provides analysis on media coverage. The Public Affairs Officer (PAO) manages activities and provides analysis on coverage. PAO and other public diplomacy officers make presentations to various groups. They also handle administrative duties within the embassy, support the ambassador, manage exchange programs, budgets, and personnel. Differences exist between the former USIA and current State Department public diplomacy structures in terms of organization and operations. In USIA, the director had direct authority over geographical area offices, while at the State Department, public diplomacy staff is located in separate offices within regional and functional bureaus. The State Department's public diplomacy offices are located within regional and functional bureaus, separate from R's organizational structure. These offices aim to enhance integration of traditional and public diplomacy on foreign policy issues. Public diplomacy staff in these bureaus fall under the authority of the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs or other under secretaries. Funding for public diplomacy activities is separate within the State Department's operating account. Funding for public diplomacy activities in the State Department is provided through allotments from the budget of the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Unlike USIA, R does not have complete control over public diplomacy funding, as expenditures are dictated by regional and functional bureaus. Public diplomacy assignments and evaluations are handled differently in the State Department compared to USIA. In the State Department, public diplomacy assignments and evaluations are managed differently compared to USIA. The USIA Director oversees all position assignments and evaluations through a dedicated human resources office, focusing on public diplomacy skills. In contrast, the State Department uses its Human Resources Bureau to assign and evaluate Public Diplomacy Officers (PDOs) alongside other Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) from different career cones. Evaluations at the State Department are based on general criteria, not solely on public diplomacy accomplishments. The State Department's evaluation structure for Public Diplomacy Officers (PDOs) differs significantly from the former USIA. Critics argue that PDOs no longer receive the same support from the State Department's regional and functional bureaus since the integration of USIA regional bureaus. The efficient evaluation process by the former USIA's \"area directors\" is no longer in place, impacting the support for PDOs at U.S. posts abroad. The United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 consolidated all U.S. international broadcasting services under the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) within USIA. In 1998, Congress established the BBG as an independent entity within the executive branch, with the Secretary of State providing guidance to the Board. This legislation aimed to balance broadcasting independence with support for foreign policy objectives. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) oversees the operations of the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) and its broadcasting services, including Voice of America (VOA), Worldnet television broadcasts, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia (RFA), and Middle East Broadcasting Network. The BBG appoints members for three-year terms, confirmed by the Senate, and has funding and oversight authority over these broadcasting entities. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) oversees the operations of the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) and its broadcasting services, including Voice of America (VOA), Worldnet television broadcasts, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Free Asia (RFA), and Middle East Broadcasting Network. BBG reviews and evaluates the radios' operations, assesses their quality, effectiveness, and professional integrity, and determines the addition or deletion of language services under the IBB. Funding for public diplomacy is located in annual State Department/Foreign Operations appropriations legislation, which includes funds for public diplomacy within the State Department and separate funding for international broadcasting. Public diplomacy appropriations for FY2008-2009 and the FY2010 request are detailed in Table 3, while appropriations for the BBG for FY2008-2009 and the FY2010 are shown in Table 4. The FY2009 request included appropriations for additional public diplomacy positions in IIP and overseas. Various government agencies, including the Department of Defense and USAID, engage in communications with foreign publics. Other agencies conduct exchanges under the MECEA. The Department of Defense (DOD) has focused on improving communication with foreign publics, shifting towards non-kinetic activities like strategic communication to engage key audiences and create favorable conditions. The Department of Defense (DOD) utilizes strategic communication to engage key audiences and advance United States Government interests. This involves coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with all instruments of national power. Strategic communication activities in DOD are supported by Information Operations (IO), Public Affairs (PA), and Defense Support to Public Diplomacy. The Department of Defense utilizes strategic communication through various support organizations like PSYOP, PA, and VI to interact with and influence foreign publics, governments, and the American people. DOD has increased communication efforts online and in areas of military operations, aiming to better understand foreign societies for effective communication. The Department of Defense established Human Terrain Teams in 2007 to understand local populations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to the 2007 National Strategy for Public Diplomacy, DOD identified specific strategic communication programs for government-to-government, military-to-military, and interactions with foreign publics. The Department of Defense utilizes actions as a key part of strategic communication, highlighting humanitarian assistance activities and the Global Maritime Partnership. Programs to counter terrorist groups and the Trans-regional Web Initiative were also mentioned. The Department of Defense created the Expanded Trans-Regional PSYOP Program (ETRP) to unify communications themes across theatres. They also established Regional Centers for Security Studies in the US and Germany to educate key foreign audiences on security issues. DOD aims to measure the effects of its actions on foreign populations and improve communications through various activities and capabilities. The Department of Defense utilizes various methods, such as network science and Internet tracking, to identify key audiences, issues, and sentiments. They also interact with foreign populations to improve communication and created the office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Support to Public Diplomacy in 2007. Michele A. Flournoy abolished the office providing inaccurate guidance to military commanders and created the Global Strategic Engagement Team (GSET) to oversee strategic communication strategy within the Department of Defense. The GSET, led by Rosa Brooks, is reviewing DOD's approach to strategic coordination and considering formal strategic communication doctrine. Brooks also established a Global Strategic Engagement Coordinating Committee to involve key organizations. The Engagement Coordinating Committee, represented by various organizations supporting DOD's strategic communication efforts, provides policy discussion, oversight, and senior-level review. Ms. Brooks's team is reviewing existing SC capabilities like IO for wider coordination efforts. DOD officials expect the review process to take several months. USAID plays a crucial role in public diplomacy due to its administration of foreign assistance, fostering relationships between the US and other nations. USAID plays a crucial role in public diplomacy by fostering relationships between the US and other nations through outreach programs and communication strategies developed by Development Outreach and Communication Officers. USAID provides specialized training for its Communications Officers and has a field manual for communicating with foreign publics. It coordinates public diplomacy efforts with the State Department through the State-USAID Joint Policy Council and Management Council. The Secretary of State is encouraged to collaborate with USAID and private organizations to ensure assistance is marked \"from the American people.\" State and USAID sponsor most U.S. and foreign participants in exchange programs, while other government agencies handle the rest. Examples of public diplomacy initiatives include exchange programs such as the short-term exchange of scientists program at the National Cancer Institute and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. Congressionally mandated NGOs, like the National Endowment for Democracy and the Asia Foundation, receive funds to support U.S. foreign policy objectives by developing long-term relationships and improving foreign populations' understanding of the United States. The U.S. government utilizes various public diplomacy initiatives, such as exchange programs and funding for NGOs, to improve foreign populations' understanding of the United States. Despite attempts to create government-wide strategies for public diplomacy and strategic communication, none have been successful. The National Security Council established a Strategic Communication Policy Coordinating Committee in 2002 to address this issue. The U.S. government established the Communication Policy Coordinating Committee in 2002 to create a national strategy for strategic communication. However, the committee was disbanded with the onset of the Iraq war. President George W. Bush then created the Office of Global Communications in 2002, which focused on day-to-day public affairs functions and policy messaging guidance. This office was disbanded in 2005. In 2006, a new Policy Coordinating Committee for Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication (PCC) was authorized by National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley to be led by the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. The Policy Coordinating Committee for Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication (PCC) was established in 2006 to coordinate U.S. government communications with foreign publics. It includes representatives from various agencies and is advised by the Global Strategic Engagement Center. The PCC released the National Strategy for Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication in 2007, outlining three strategic objectives. The National Strategy for Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication, released in 2007, outlines three strategic objectives for U.S. government communications with foreign publics. These objectives include offering a positive vision of hope and opportunity, isolating violent extremists, and nurturing common interests and values between Americans and people of different countries. Key target audiences identified are key influencers, vulnerable populations, and mass audiences. Public diplomacy priorities include expanding communication efforts. The National Strategy for Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication, released in 2007, outlines three strategic objectives for U.S. government communications with foreign publics. These objectives include expanding education and exchange programs, modernizing communications, and promoting the \"diplomacy of deeds\" through humanitarian assistance, health, education, and economic development programs. The Strategy emphasizes the importance of interagency coordination and unity of effort in implementing these objectives. The National Strategy for Public Diplomacy and Strategic Communication, released in 2007, aims to increase information sharing among agencies for clear messaging in U.S. government communications to foreign publics. However, criticism has been raised for the lack of clearly defined agency roles and responsibilities, as well as inadequate implementation of agency-specific plans. Despite regular meetings between key officials, deficiencies in coordination persist, leading Congress to mandate improvements. Congress has mandated the creation of a new strategy for public diplomacy and strategic communication in response to deficiencies in coordination. The National Security Council facilitates interagency coordination through the International Crisis Communication Team. In May 2009, President Obama announced the creation of a Global Engagement Directorate (GED) within the NSC to drive comprehensive engagement policies. The NSC holds weekly interagency policy committee meetings concerning public diplomacy and strategic communication issues. Challenges to U.S. public diplomacy efforts include leadership, national strategy, interagency coordination, organizational issues, personnel matters, and outreach activities. The State Department and Congress are addressing issues related to U.S. public diplomacy and strategic communication. Legislation has been proposed to address these issues, and leadership is seen as crucial for improving government effectiveness in communication with foreign publics. President Obama has prioritized communicating with the world. President Obama has prioritized communicating with the world, making major speeches in Europe, Russia, Egypt, and Ghana. He has created a Global Engagement Directorate within the National Security Council to meet national security objectives. However, some believe his leadership lacks reform-minded proposals to improve public diplomacy within the State Department. The lack of agency-level leadership for public diplomacy was a concern during the Obama Administration, with the position of Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs left vacant for the first four months. President Obama later appointed Judith McHale to the position, although some observers noted her lack of experience with the State Department's bureaucracy. Some criticized Under Secretary McHale's lack of experience with traditional public diplomacy activities, which many see as crucial for U.S. public diplomacy. The Obama administration may focus major communications efforts for foreign audiences in the White House and the President himself. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 requires the President to report to Congress on creating a new national strategy for public diplomacy and strategic communication to address core issues for effective communication with foreign publics. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 mandates a new national strategy for public diplomacy and strategic communication to engage effectively with foreign publics. This involves integrating U.S. public diplomacy into the global communications landscape, adopting a more sophisticated approach, and ensuring coordinated implementation across government agencies to align with U.S. foreign policy goals. Discussions on U.S. public diplomacy often revolve around the evolving global communications environment, where personal communication technology and the Internet empower non-state actors like NGOs, corporations, and individuals with enhanced communication capabilities. The Internet has revolutionized communication by enabling individuals to reach a global audience, surpassing traditional media outlets like the BBC or VOA. This shift towards \"many-to-many\" communication allows for two-way interactions among networks of actors, influencing message reception and consumption from various sources. The Internet has transformed communication, allowing individuals to access information from sources they trust. Traditional media's influence has decreased as new actors enter the broadcasting scene, complicating U.S. public diplomacy efforts. The need to enhance traditional public diplomacy activities is evident amidst the challenges posed by the evolving media landscape. The new U.S. national strategy for public diplomacy must integrate traditional outreach methods with modern communication technologies like social media networks. This approach aims to address the challenges posed by the evolving media landscape and enhance in-country, person-to-person public diplomacy efforts. Some observers suggest a sophisticated approach to public diplomacy, emphasizing the importance of open and truthful communication with foreign populations. It is recommended that any covert communications activities by the U.S. government be clearly separated from public diplomacy efforts. The United States should prioritize two-way communication in public diplomacy efforts, fostering understanding and promoting shared values with foreign populations. Integrating these principles into a national strategy could enhance U.S. public diplomacy. The recommendations for U.S. public diplomacy emphasize the need for a more nuanced approach in communicating with foreign publics, considering how they perceive and trust government messages. This includes being delicate in promoting American values and being cautious of potential backlash due to perceived inconsistencies in U.S. policies. The need for a nuanced approach in U.S. public diplomacy is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of avoiding arrogance or dismissiveness in foreign communication to maintain trust. Recommendations include focusing on highlighting the drawbacks of adversaries, utilizing non-U.S. government messengers, and adapting messaging based on cultural and political contexts. Increased resources and training in public diplomacy are needed to enhance traditional capabilities and utilize new communication techniques. A focus on long-term objectives and flexibility in communication strategies is essential for achieving U.S. foreign policy goals. In recent years, U.S. communications with foreign publics have focused on counterterrorism, which is seen as necessary but too narrow. There are concerns that this focus may weaken relationships with publics in other important countries and regions. It is argued that public diplomacy efforts should aim to build lasting trust through deep relationships with foreign publics globally, requiring sufficient resources and personnel in all regions of importance. Efforts to build lasting trust through deep relationships with foreign publics globally, requiring resources and personnel in all regions of importance, could improve U.S. communications effectiveness. Efforts to improve U.S. communications effectiveness globally could involve requiring government agencies to provide communication plans for engaging with foreign publics. Integration of communication issues within existing strategies for national power could lead to better policy consideration of public diplomacy. The Obama Administration created the Global Engagement Directorate (GED) within the National Security Council in May 2009 to coordinate national power elements, including communications, for achieving security goals. The GED may implement a new national strategy for public diplomacy and strategic communication, integrated into other platforms. The Department of State leads public diplomacy in the U.S., with various government agencies also engaging in official public diplomacy activities. Multiple government agencies engage in public diplomacy with foreign publics through various programs and communication methods. The Broadcasting Board of Governors oversees U.S. international broadcasting as a major independent actor in public diplomacy. Coordination and defining roles among these agencies are essential to avoid conflicts and ensure effective communication efforts. Many government agencies lack specific programs for communicating with foreign publics, but their statements and actions can impact foreign populations' attitudes towards the United States. Identifying each agency's influence on foreign publics is crucial for defining and coordinating roles. Terminology differences exist, with the State Department using \"public diplomacy,\" DOD using \"strategic communication,\" and \"engagement\" becoming a common term for U.S. government interactions with foreign populations. The importance of ensuring that various government agencies have the capability to effectively communicate with foreign publics has been recognized. This is especially crucial for agencies like DOD and USAID, which operate in foreign countries and impact foreign populations. Maintaining a strong communications capacity is essential for explaining intentions and policies to foreign audiences. A coordinated communications effort is necessary for government agencies like DOD and USAID operating abroad to effectively engage with foreign publics. The State Department should lead public diplomacy efforts, while other agencies provide specialized information to enhance their projects. Critics argue that DOD's expansion into non-military communications encroaches on the State Department's role in public diplomacy. The State Department's capacity for public diplomacy has degraded due to lack of resources, while DOD's strategic communication spending has increased significantly since 9/11. DOD officials support providing resources to civilian agencies for their responsibilities, stating that public diplomacy is primarily the State Department's role. The DOD continues to \"fill the gap\" in State Department public diplomacy capacity, especially in areas where U.S. armed forces are operating. Communication with foreign publics is crucial in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency efforts, with DOD's role in this increasing, particularly in regions like Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) and other regional combatant commands prioritize strategic communication and public diplomacy activities. DOD spending on non-military communications to foreign publics has significantly increased, reaching nearly $1 billion annually since FY2005. Concerns have been raised about the Department's assumption of new information operations programs within its roles and responsibilities. The United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) and other regional combatant commands prioritize strategic communication and public diplomacy activities. Concerns have been raised about DOD's assumption of new information operations programs, which go beyond traditional military information operations and include propaganda, public relations, and behavioral modification messaging. This has led to criticisms of the military's dual role in communicating with foreign publics. The military engages in communications for military objectives, including deception and efforts to conceal government sponsorship in media. There is a lack of clear distinction between public diplomacy and military communications within the DOD, leading to potential confusion and distrust among foreign audiences. Despite efforts to define agency roles for public diplomacy, there is still a need for better coordination among U.S. government agencies. The Office of Global Communications in the White House did not provide strategic direction as intended, and the Strategic Communication and Public Diplomacy Policy Coordinating Committee has not been successful in fostering interagency coordination. The Global Strategic Engagement Center lacks resources to carry out directives effectively. Improving interagency coordination is recommended. Improving interagency coordination is recommended by creating a robust coordination organization within the National Security Council (NSC) with a Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communication (DNSA) heading a new Strategic Communication Policy Committee. This DNSA would have legal authority to assign agency roles and direct funding for public diplomacy and strategic communication, with a direct relationship to an Associate Director for Strategic Communication in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). There are concerns over adding another stakeholder in an already complicated web of public diplomacy and strategic communication actors. Improving interagency coordination is recommended by creating a robust coordination organization within the National Security Council (NSC) with a Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communication (DNSA) heading a new Strategic Communication Policy Committee. This DNSA would have legal authority to assign agency roles and direct funding for public diplomacy and strategic communication, with a direct relationship to an Associate Director for Strategic Communication in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Critics contend that organizational problems within the Department of State present major stumbling blocks to improving public diplomacy. Critics argue that the State Department's culture of official diplomacy is not entirely compatible with public diplomacy, which involves informal discussions with diverse audiences. This poses challenges to improving the effectiveness of U.S. public diplomacy within overall foreign policy. Public diplomacy focuses on long-term relationships with foreign populations, separate from specific policy objectives. There is a clash between the State Department's bureaucratic communication process and the flexible nature of public diplomacy outreach. Effective public diplomacy officers rely on informal communication with foreign publics, which is hindered by the State Department's clearance process. Some argue that the State Department's cumbersome clearance process hampers the effectiveness of public diplomacy officers' outreach. Suggestions have been made to streamline the clearance process to enable more responsive engagement with foreign populations on important issues. This difference in approach can lead to a lack of importance placed on public diplomacy within certain parts of the State Department and U.S. embassies. Additionally, there is a misconception that public diplomacy is primarily used to appease foreign publics when they react negatively to U.S. government activities. Public diplomacy leaders often face challenges in playing an equal role in foreign policy decisions, resulting in reactive diplomacy. Integrating public diplomacy within the State Department structure is seen as crucial for promoting coordinated U.S. foreign policy efforts and enhancing familiarity with public diplomacy among foreign service officers. Some suggest elevating the head of public diplomacy to a Deputy Secretary position to increase its importance in foreign policy decision-making within the State Department. Other recommendations focus on enhancing the authority of the Under Secretary and her organization to improve public diplomacy efforts. The Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy does not have full control over public diplomacy activities and resources, as they answer to regional Assistant Secretaries and the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Some analysts recommend giving the Under Secretary new authorities in public diplomacy policy and budgets to address these issues. Creation of dedicated Deputy Assistant Secretaries (DAS) for Public Diplomacy within each regional bureau could enhance strategic outreach efforts tailored to specific regions and countries. Junior public diplomacy officers could handle routine duties, allowing DAS to focus on overall direction. Additionally, it is suggested that public affairs officers at U.S. foreign missions oversee a discretionary fund for public diplomacy activities. The creation of regional public diplomacy hubs is recommended to coordinate U.S. public diplomacy efforts in specific regions. These hubs would act as the primary coordination and feedback nexus for public diplomacy, separate from other U.S. mission activities but still within the State Department's purview. Most experts are not in favor of re-creating USIA or setting up a new government agency to separate public diplomacy from the State Department. Senator Sam Brownback proposed a National Center for Strategic Communications in the 110th Congress to centralize public diplomacy and strategic communication efforts, including leadership in interagency coordination and broadcasting. Most experts suggest improving the State Department's organizational structure by removing the public diplomacy function to a new agency. Creating a new agency would be time-consuming and not seen as the best solution, as it would require creating new bureaucracies and management structures. There is a current debate over the public diplomacy roles and responsibilities of various government agencies. The current debate over public diplomacy roles and responsibilities between government agencies, particularly the State Department and DOD, is seen as a hindrance to creating a new agency. Legislation designating a new agency as the lead on public diplomacy may not improve interagency coordination, as existing issues with roles and authorities persist. The Department of State's public diplomacy workforce size, utilization, and fitness are central topics of discussion. The number of personnel specializing in public diplomacy within the Department of State has significantly decreased since the Cold War era. Public Diplomacy Officer (PDO) numbers have consistently dropped, along with overall civil servants and locally engaged staff (LES) assigned to public diplomacy duties. Analysts suggest increasing personnel for public diplomacy assignments by as much as 100% to enhance mutual understanding and shared values with foreign nations. Increasing personnel for public diplomacy assignments is crucial to cultivate mutual understanding and shared values with foreign publics. This includes adding more LES and public diplomacy officers to create a human resources \"float\" for training and recruitment. Analysts recommend actively recruiting individuals with public diplomacy experience to improve outreach efforts. Improving public diplomacy capabilities at entry-level positions may not address the shortage of mid-level officers due to accelerated promotions and retirements. Experts suggest appointing former officers to fill this gap and enhancing public diplomacy training, focusing more on theory and techniques. Calls for increased foreign language training to address language skill deficiencies among officers in public diplomacy posts. Some commentators recommend increased alternative training for public diplomacy officers, including distance learning and on-the-job programs. Concerns exist over the utilization of Public Diplomacy Officers (PDOs), with many observers noting that PDOs often do not spend enough time in public diplomacy positions. Vacancies in public diplomacy positions within the department and at foreign posts have been high, with a significant number of PDOs placed in non-public diplomacy roles. Many PDOs have to wait several rotations before being assigned a public diplomacy position, while public diplomacy positions are often filled by Foreign Service Officers from other cones. Some argue that public diplomacy expertise has been reduced due to public diplomacy positions being filled by FSOs from other cones. Suggestions to address this include early-career public diplomacy postings for PDOs, increasing public diplomacy rotations, and allowing PDOs with specific skills to rotate within their expertise area. Critics also point out that public diplomacy positions are burdened with administrative responsibilities. Some argue that public diplomacy positions are burdened with administrative responsibilities, limiting their ability to focus on outreach and strategic planning. Reports suggest that junior- and mid-level public diplomacy officers are also expected to prioritize administrative tasks over active outreach. The lack of career incentives for public diplomacy activities further reinforces this perception. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Public Diplomacy highlighted in 2008 that employee evaluations for promotions do not prioritize public diplomacy, and some job requirements for public diplomacy officers focus more on administrative duties than substantive outreach. Some observers suggest that public diplomacy officers face challenges in career advancement due to a lack of emphasis on substantive outreach in job requirements. Recommendations include increasing outreach to foreign publics through various communication techniques, including traditional in-person activities and virtual presence on the internet. Educational and cultural exchange programs are seen as highly effective tools for public diplomacy. Exchanges funded by the U.S. government are effective public diplomacy tools, targeting influential audiences in foreign countries to promote mutual understanding. Analysts recommend increasing funding for exchanges to strengthen long-term connections between the United States and other nations. Increased funding for exchanges, up to 100% over current levels, has been noted, particularly involving individuals from Muslim-majority countries and American Muslims. Analysts caution against concentrating increases in just one region. Exchange participation between Americans and foreign nationals from developing countries has also risen. Some observers emphasize the importance of increasing English language education provided by U.S. missions abroad to engage foreign publics and foster goodwill towards the United States. The United States is urged to increase English language instruction through its missions abroad to create stronger connections with foreign publics. This can be achieved without significant new funding by charging fees for classes. It is suggested to establish active language-graduate alumni groups similar to those of foreign exchanges. Increased language education in the United States should involve hiring more official U.S.-mission staff instructors instead of subcontractors to ensure quality. Permanent staff instructors can enhance country, cultural, and native language expertise within the U.S. mission staff. During the Cold War, the U.S. operated \"America Centers\" in foreign cities, offering libraries, English instruction, speaker programs, and American film exhibitions. Many of these centers have closed since the end of the Cold War. After the Cold War, America Centers were considered expendable due to decreased emphasis on public diplomacy. Security concerns for U.S. government facilities abroad increased after bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. Legislation required U.S. missions abroad to be \"co-located\" on one secure campus. America Centers were often not compliant, leading to their closure. U.S. embassy complexes now house Information Resource Centers (IRCs) but offer less to foreign publics. Embassies have been fortified against terrorist attacks. The closure of America Centers post-Cold War has limited access for foreign publics to Information Resource Centers (IRCs) in U.S. embassies. Security measures and appointment requirements have further restricted visits, impacting U.S. outreach efforts. This deficiency has allowed other countries, like Iran, to increase their influence in key regions. The closure of America Centers post-Cold War has limited access for foreign publics to Information Resource Centers in U.S. embassies. Recommendations suggest reestablishing America Centers in downtown areas of large cities in key countries to serve U.S. foreign policy interests. Security is important, but engagement with foreign publics should not be overshadowed. Waivers of co-location requirements may be necessary for freestanding America Centers, with the understanding that closure may be necessary in high-risk security situations. A Senate report on U.S. public diplomacy calls for temporary closure of Centers facing security issues, not abandonment. Resurrecting international information programs that have declined in recent years is also recommended. Certain international information programs, such as translating books into Arabic, have atrophied in recent years. Recommendations include publishing more effective U.S. informational materials online, like new online libraries and English language instruction. Suggestions also involve increasing outreach activities online, enhancing the State Department's Digital Outreach Team, and investing in modern communication technologies. The focus is on reaching targeted audiences with relevant information in the most effective formats. Challenges in effective online information outreach for U.S. foreign policy include building trust, controlling message reception, and integrating international broadcasting with foreign policy goals. The debate surrounds the need for better alignment between U.S. international broadcasting and national interests since the creation of the Broadcasting Board of Governors in 1994. The creation of the Broadcasting Board of Governors in 1994 raised concerns about U.S. international broadcasters potentially conflicting with public diplomacy efforts. Some suggest giving the State Department or a new agency authority over broadcasting could enhance U.S. interests, but others argue for maintaining journalistic integrity and independence from political influences. Some observers criticize the organization of U.S. international broadcasting, citing inefficiencies and redundancies in the current structure. They argue that the duplication of services, lack of coordination among broadcasters, and non-integrated technology infrastructure lead to inefficient resource use. Some critics argue that the lack of an overall strategy for U.S. international broadcasting leads to inefficiencies in resource use, over- or under-programming in certain languages, and outdated programming models. Recommendations include a complete review to streamline the organizational structure and consolidate broadcasters to improve strategy implementation and reduce redundancies. Some critics suggest privatizing U.S. broadcasters to improve credibility and express concerns about the resourcing of VOA, particularly in the Middle East. Alhurra and Radio Sawa have faced criticism for poor management and performance, struggling to compete with established Arab broadcasters like Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Alhurra and Radio Sawa have faced criticism for poor management and performance, struggling to compete with Arab broadcasters like Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Alhurra's credibility has been damaged due to restrictions on open discourse, while Radio Sawa's effectiveness is questioned for its heavy focus on popular music over substantive news. Recommendations include utilizing private and non-profit sector expertise to improve broadcasting capacity and timeliness. The recommendations emphasize the importance of innovation in U.S. public diplomacy, suggesting that the private sector can provide advanced information products and tools to improve government efforts. They also highlight the need for coordination with individual actors and NGOs to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of messages from U.S. sources. The recommendations suggest establishing an independent support organization to enhance public diplomacy expertise through partnerships with the private sector, academia, NGOs, and businesses. This organization would employ communication experts for integrated and coordinated research and planning activities. An independent public diplomacy support organization is recommended to enhance expertise through partnerships with various sectors. It would focus on research, planning, and utilizing new media for U.S. public diplomacy efforts. A national strategy for public diplomacy and strategic communication is proposed, aiming to synthesize best practices and provide program-specific services to government agencies. The organization would partner with private organizations for new diplomacy efforts, evaluate effectiveness, and raise funds for innovative communication initiatives. Supporters believe it will promote early adoption of new techniques, interagency cooperation, and encourage a \"turf-free\" environment. The global opinion of the United States has declined in recent years, with shifts from overwhelming support to dissatisfaction with U.S. actions. Some polls show an increase in the U.S. image, linked to President Obama's favorability. However, critics warn that polling data may not fully explain public opinion. The effectiveness of U.S. outreach to foreign publics cannot be fully explained by polling numbers alone. It is argued that a comprehensive system for evaluating public diplomacy efforts is needed, aligning results with strategic objectives. Challenges exist in gathering and analyzing data on U.S. public diplomacy activities. Some observers criticize U.S. missions abroad for inadequate data collection to evaluate outreach efforts, citing lack of resources and fear of career repercussions for reporting ineffective efforts. The Office of Management and Budget rates public diplomacy efforts as \"not performing\" due to lack of demonstrated results, but rates the evaluation efforts of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Exchange as \"fully performing\" with clear indicators for success. ECA relies on data from exchange participants for evaluation. The Evaluation and Measurement Unit (EMU) in R's Office of Policy, Planning, and Resources was created based on ECA's evaluation system, which focuses on measuring the outcome and impact of exchanges. EMU's research and evaluation approach, including the Public Diplomacy Impact (PDI) project and Mission Activity Tracker (MAT), aims to comprehensively document and measure public diplomacy activities. The State Department aims to document and measure public diplomacy activities globally. Observers suggest translating research into user-friendly guidance for improving public diplomacy at the country level. Testing the effect of programs before full implementation is recommended to avoid unforeseen issues. Evaluating U.S. public diplomacy activities on the Internet and communications by other actors is crucial due to the challenge of assessing individual messages in a vast communication landscape. The U.S. government is advised to invest in social network analysis and automated sentiment analysis for effective Internet messaging in public diplomacy. Current laws restrict the State Department's domestic dissemination of public diplomacy information. Legislative provisions like the Smith-Mundt Act aim to protect American people from State Department influence and prevent government propaganda. Critics argue that these provisions are outdated in today's global communication landscape and call for the removal of restrictions on domestic dissemination. The Smith-Mundt Act aims to protect American people from State Department influence and prevent government propaganda. Critics argue that restrictions on domestic dissemination are outdated in today's global communication landscape. The State Department faces challenges in reaching foreign publics online, which can also be accessed by U.S. citizens domestically. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questioned due to the widespread use of global communication technologies. The State Department must comply with legislative restrictions on its public diplomacy activities, which may hinder its effectiveness. Certain new communication technologies may be limited to avoid unintentional propaganda. The Department of Defense also follows the Smith-Mundt Act's restrictions on domestic information dissemination. The Smith-Mundt Act's restrictions on domestic information dissemination may limit the Department of Defense's communication capabilities with foreign publics. Maintaining these restrictions could help differentiate foreign and domestic messages, ensuring a tailored approach to public diplomacy. Without such limitations, there is a risk of U.S. public diplomacy efforts being overly focused on domestic communication, potentially hindering effective communication with specific foreign populations. The Smith-Mundt Act's restrictions on domestic information dissemination may hinder U.S. outreach to foreign publics by limiting targeted communications. Calls to amend the Act argue for more transparent government communication efforts in foreign countries to build domestic support for foreign affairs. Congress has proposed legislation to address these concerns. The 110th Congress enacted Section 1055 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, requiring the President to submit a report on a federal government strategy for public diplomacy and strategic communication. The report must include a comprehensive interagency strategy, consideration of consolidating government leadership, and improving interagency coordination. A study on creating an independent support organization for public diplomacy and strategic communication to guide the federal government. Roles and responsibilities of the National Security Council, Department of Defense, and Department of State in coordinating efforts. Section 1055 of the National Defense Authorization Act requires reports on strategy implementation and organizational structure within DOD for strategic communication. The 111th Congress has proposed legislation related to public diplomacy, including the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011, which focuses on public diplomacy at the Department of State. Other bills address various aspects of U.S. public diplomacy efforts. The 111th Congress has proposed legislation related to public diplomacy, including provisions on strategy for communications with foreign publics, agency roles, personnel issues, outreach activities, U.S. international broadcasting, research, monitoring, evaluation, and domestic dissemination of information. Defense committee reports for FY2010 also include requirements on DOD's communications with foreign publics. Legislative provisions related to public diplomacy and strategic communication include a coordinated strategy for engagement with Pakistan, an annual counterterrorism strategy report, and a quadrennial review requirement for the Secretary of State. The quadrennial review requires a comprehensive examination of U.S. government foreign affairs activities, including public diplomacy efforts, with recommendations for improvements. Additionally, the President must report to Congress on long-term strategies for national security and foreign affairs, including the relationship of public diplomacy efforts to advancing national security objectives. Division B of H.R. 2410 authorizes the implementation of the Pakistan Enduring Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement (PEACE) Act of 2009. The Pakistan Enduring Assistance and Cooperation Enhancement (PEACE) Act of 2009 authorizes a public diplomacy strategy for Pakistan to counter extremist groups, enhance person-to-person and technical exchanges between U.S. and Pakistani citizens. Reporting requirements mandate the President to report on U.S. government efforts to counter terrorist recruitment and radicalization, and coordinate strategic communication and public diplomacy efforts internationally. The Section 211 of H.R. 2410 would give the Secretary of State primary responsibility for coordinating unified public diplomacy activities and creating an interagency coordination working group chaired by the Secretary of State. Relevant federal agencies would designate representatives for ongoing consultations and coordination concerning public diplomacy. H.R. 2410 : Section 211 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 would require federal agencies involved in public diplomacy to report annually on their public activities to the President, who would then provide the reports to the Secretary of State.

The House Armed Services Committee on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires detailed information on the strategic communication workforce within DOD, including analysis of skills and competencies, gaps filled by contractors, and top-level guidance on recruiting, policy, organization, and management. It also directs DOD to provide information on military public diplomacy activities. The House Appropriations Committee included a section on DOD's Information Operations in its report on the FY2010 DOD appropriations bill, expressing concerns over the budget justification for Information Operations request of $1 billion. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concerns over DOD's non-military communications with foreign publics and questioned the effectiveness of Information Operations programs. They recommended terminating certain programs and reducing funding by $500 million until DOD provides detailed reports on strategies, goals, target audiences, and budget information. The Committee highlighted DOD's extensive spending of $10 billion on strategic communication since 9/11. The Senate Armed Services Committee raised concerns about DOD's non-military communications with foreign publics and questioned the effectiveness of Information Operations programs. They recommended reducing funding by $500 million until DOD provides detailed reports on strategies, goals, target audiences, and budget information. Legislation requires detailed strategic communication budgets for 2011 to clarify objectives and funding levels for public diplomacy activities. H.R. 2311 provides funding for new public diplomacy staff in China, while H.R. 2410 establishes a Public Diplomacy Reserve Corps to address the shortage of mid-level officers.
