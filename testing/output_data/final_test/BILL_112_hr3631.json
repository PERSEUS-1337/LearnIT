    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Urban Area Security Initiative Capability Gains Act of 2011\" or the \"Preserving UASI Capability Gains Act of 2011\". The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for coordinated first responder agencies in major cities to prepare for future terrorist attacks. It also recommended allocating federal resources based on risks and vulnerabilities. The Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) program, established in 2003, provides grant funding to high-threat urban areas for building capabilities. The UASI program provides funding to high-threat urban areas to enhance their capacity to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events. It emphasizes regional readiness and supports the unique needs of these areas. State and local governments have used this funding to provide personnel, plans, equipment, training, and exercises for first responders. A report from 2011 highlighted the impact of the program between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. Between 2003 and 2010, high-threat urban areas received $6.5 billion in UASI funding to enhance preparedness and response capabilities. This funding has enabled at-risk State and local governments to develop critical capabilities aligned with National Homeland Security Priorities, including information sharing, communication interoperability, citizen preparedness, and infrastructure protection. UASI funding has significantly improved explosives detection and critical infrastructure protection. A study found that 51% of known terrorist plots from 1999 to 2009 were thwarted by community members or local law enforcement. In fiscal year 2010, 64 high-threat urban areas received necessary funding for preparedness and response capabilities. In fiscal year 2011, thirty-two high-threat urban areas were provided with UASI funding. Security eliminated thirty-two high-threat, high-density urban areas from the UASI program due to an 18 percent funding reduction in 2011. The urban areas removed include Albany, Austin, Bakersfield, Baton Rouge, Bridgeport, Buffalo, Columbus, El Paso, Hartford, Honolulu, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Louisville, Memphis, Milwaukee, Nashville, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Oxnard, Providence, Richmond, Rochester, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Juan, Syracuse, Toledo, Tucson, and Tulsa. Many high-threat, high-density urban areas in fiscal year 2011 are struggling to maintain their terrorism prevention and disaster response capabilities with limited UASI funding. Some urban areas may require additional Federal assistance to sustain these advancements, leading to significant homeland security implications. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to preserve the security gains of the Urban Area Security Initiative. The Administrator will establish a grant program for high-risk urban areas that lost funding after 2009 or 2010. Applications must detail previous security gains at risk without federal assistance. The Administrator will establish a grant program for high-risk urban areas that lost funding after 2009 or 2010. Applications must detail acquisitions to enhance homeland security capabilities, division of responsibilities and funding distribution among local and tribal governments, point of contact for communication, and necessary information as required by the Administrator. Priority will be given to applications that preserve capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats. The grant program for high-risk urban areas aims to preserve core capabilities, align with national preparedness strategies, support regional catastrophic planning, and prioritize established grant funding priorities. The grant program for high-risk urban areas aims to preserve core capabilities, align with national preparedness strategies, support regional catastrophic planning, and prioritize established grant funding priorities. The competitive grant program has limitations on awards, with no single applicant receiving more than seven percent of the total amount authorized. $58,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2012 to 2014, with a maximum of five percent available for administering the grant program. The Act is amended by increasing section numbers for items related to sections 2004 through 2008 and adding a new section after 2003. The Act is amended by increasing section numbers for items related to sections 2004 through 2008 and adding a new section after 2003. Section 2004 focuses on preserving Urban Area Security Initiative security gains, with conforming amendments to sections 2003(b)(2)(A)(i) and 2005(e) of the Act."
