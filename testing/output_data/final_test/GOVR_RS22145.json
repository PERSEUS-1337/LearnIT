    "content": "Congressional appropriations for the Coast Guard are allocated to broader categories like \"operating expenses\" instead of specific missions. The Coast Guard uses a sophisticated costing model to account for mission-specific funding. Protecting the marine environment from oil and chemical spills is a key mission. The Coast Guard, along with the EPA, is part of the National Response Team and Regional Response Teams. The National Contingency Plan outlines procedures for responding to oil and hazardous substance discharges. The Coast Guard is responsible for preparing for and responding to oil and hazardous substance spills on water and land. They have authority to coordinate spill response efforts and ensure effective removal of spills. Their prevention and preparedness duties cover vessels, transportation facilities, and deepwater ports, based on international agreements and federal regulations like the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and MARPOL 73/78 treaty. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) and MARPOL 73/78 require vessel owners to submit Vessel Response Plans and Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans to the Coast Guard. These plans address spill mitigation procedures, crew training, and required spill mitigation equipment. Approval from the Coast Guard is necessary for ships to operate legally in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard's inspection program is crucial for oil spill prevention efforts, and they represent the U.S. at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to set international environmental and safety standards for vessels. The Coast Guard conducts \"certificate of compliance\" examinations on foreign vessels making port calls in the United States to ensure compliance with environmental, safety, and security standards. Inspecting officers verify vessel and crew compliance with international conventions and U.S. laws regarding pollution prevention. The pollution prevention examination onboard ships covers various waste streams, including oil pollution prevention systems like the oily water separator and sludge containment system. Ships may bypass these systems, leading to illegal actions to avoid expensive disposal of oily sludge ashore. Hazardous waste onboard includes paints, thinners, and cleaning solutions, while non-hazardous waste consists of shipboard garbage and recyclables. Cruise ships generate a large amount of sewage and gray water, along with waste such as food, plastics, and recyclables. The Coast Guard's inspection system ensures compliance with laws and treaties, with rules varying based on vessel size and type. The Alternate Compliance Program allows classification societies to perform inspections. The Coast Guard's Alternate Compliance Program (ACP) allows classification societies to conduct inspections to meet certain Coast Guard requirements. The National Pollution Funds Center (NPFC) manages the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (OSLTF) to finance responses to oil spills and reimburse costs. The OSLTF was funded by a 5-cents-per-barrel fee on oil, which was reinstated in 2006 and increased in 2008. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 increased the tax rate on oil barrels to 8 cents per barrel through 2016, scheduled to increase to 9 cents per barrel in 2017. The Oil Pollution Act requires vessels to show financial responsibility for cleanup costs in case of an oil spill, with the NPFC issuing Certificates of Financial Responsibility to vessel owners. Vessels over 300 gross tons must have a valid COFR to operate in U.S. waters. NPFC also recovers cleanup costs from responsible parties and bills them for ongoing costs and damages from spills in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard works to prevent marine debris by promoting compliance, inspecting vessels, and coordinating with other agencies. They monitor and measure debris amounts in U.S. waters, authorized by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. About 40% of spills are \"mystery\" spills, with costs often going unrecovered, endangering marine life and coral reefs. Less lethal trash from recreational activities also degrades beaches and oceans. The Coast Guard, authorized by the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, plays a role in supporting scientific efforts and operates icebreakers in the Arctic and Antarctic. They also participate in the International Ice Patrol to monitor iceberg danger in the northwest Atlantic. The Ice Patrol, usually active from February to July, is flexible and can start operations based on iceberg conditions. Coast Guard operations comply with environmental laws, focusing on emission requirements, minimizing hazardous waste generation, incorporating pollution prevention into shore facility projects, and conducting environmental audits to address violations."
