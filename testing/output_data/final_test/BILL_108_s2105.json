The \"Coastal Restoration Act of 2004\" promotes shore and beach protection projects to restore and maintain coastal resources for the healthful recreation of the people of the United States. Preference is given to areas with previous investments. The \"Coastal Restoration Act of 2004\" promotes shore and beach protection projects with a focus on areas with previous investments, regional sediment management plans, and the prevention of damage to coastal infrastructure from Federal activities. The Secretary will fund projects that enhance human health, safety, and quality of life. The \"Coastal Restoration Act of 2004\" supports projects for the enhancement of shores, sandy beaches, and coastal infrastructure, including beach restoration and protection of environmental resources. The Federal share of project costs is determined according to existing regulations, with exceptions for projects focused on beach erosion control for recreation purposes. The \"Coastal Restoration Act of 2004\" supports projects for enhancing shores, beaches, and coastal infrastructure. The Federal government covers restoration and protection costs for Federal property, while the remainder is paid by states, municipalities, or private entities. The Chief of Engineers can increase the Federal share for projects benefiting publicly-owned environmental resources. The Chief of Engineers can increase the Federal share for projects that include zones excluding human habitation or recreational beaches, meet conservation criteria, and extend landward to protect natural features. The Secretary recommends projects for Federal participation in the restoration and protection of shores and beaches, promoting national economic development benefits, including recreation, hurricane and storm damage reduction, and environmental restoration. The Secretary identifies projects maximizing net benefits for national purposes and submits a report to Congress. Periodic beach nourishment includes depositing sand fill at suitable intervals to protect shores. Private shores and beaches are eligible for Federal assistance if there is a benefit to a public shore.
