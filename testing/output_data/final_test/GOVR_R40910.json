    "content": "Negotiations under the UNFCCC are ongoing to address climate change cooperatively post-2012. COP-15 in Copenhagen aims to produce a political mandate for a future enforceable agreement on reducing GHG emissions. Key discussions include commitments from major emitting countries and transparency in reporting. Negotiations for a future enforceable agreement on reducing GHG emissions at COP-15 in Copenhagen include discussions on financing for capacity building, GHG reductions, technology cooperation, and adaptation in developing countries. The incoming Obama Administration pledged to reduce U.S. emissions by 14% below 2005 levels by 2020, raising optimism for GHG control legislation before the meeting. The U.S. Congress was expected to pass GHG control legislation before the Copenhagen meeting to guide negotiators. The Obama administration's 14% reduction policy and the passage of the ACES bill raised hopes for a consensus on a comprehensive agreement. The U.S. had not formally offered a GHG target or financial assistance, but President Obama intended to offer a provisional target of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. China and India set domestic goals to reduce carbon intensity by 40%-45% and 20-25% below 2005 levels by 2020, respectively. Some stakeholders question the ambition of these targets, especially from major non-Annex I countries. Smaller nations look to the U.S. and other wealthy countries for leadership on climate change. Many stakeholders, including smaller nations, are frustrated with the lack of strong political agreements on climate change. Recent demonstrations in 4,500 locations across 170 countries have taken place, with more planned during the Copenhagen meeting. It is uncertain if a comprehensive agreement will be reached in Copenhagen beyond 2012 when the Kyoto Protocol's commitments expire. Possible outcomes include a \"framework\" decision among high-level officials or a breakdown of negotiations, with blame potentially falling on the United States. The United States may face blame for a breakdown in climate change negotiations. Legislation to control greenhouse gases has been passed domestically, and international actions on climate change will impact the U.S. Congress will decide on U.S. participation in any agreements, with Senate consent needed for treaty ratification. The U.S. Congress must approve any agreement the President submits, including those from the Copenhagen meeting. The UNFCCC, ratified by 192 countries, aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations. Commitments are not quantified, and there are no sanctions for non-compliance. The objective is to avoid a 2 o Celsius increase in global mean temperature. The UNFCCC aims to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations to avoid a 2 o Celsius increase in global mean temperature. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol established enforceable GHG reductions for Annex I Parties, but the US did not ratify it due to concerns about science uncertainty, high costs, and lack of commitments. The Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period runs from 2008 to 2012, with delays in subsequent commitments due to the US not being a Party to the Protocol and challenges in gaining a mandate for negotiations among all UNFCCC Parties. The negotiations are currently running on two tracks under the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC's \"Bali Action Plan\" of 2007. Wealthier countries agreed to reduce their GHG emissions by 5% on average during the first commitment period. The Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period from 2008 to 2012 saw wealthier countries agreeing to reduce GHG emissions by 5%. Negotiations under the Kyoto Protocol and the 2007 Bali Action Plan aimed to establish a shared long-term vision, GHG mitigation targets, adaptation to climate change, financial assistance, technology cooperation, and enhancing carbon sequestration in forests, leading to the creation of the \"Long-Term Cooperative Agreement.\" One current dispute is whether the two negotiating tracks should result in two accords or converge into a single treaty. The European Union and other Annex I countries do not want to amend the Kyoto Protocol without including U.S. commitments, though the United States is unlikely to agree to join the Kyoto Protocol. Nonetheless, the Annex I countries have all urged that these two tracks converge by Copenhagen into one agreement that includes commitments of all Parties. Most non-Annex I Parties believe certain advantages exist in maintaining the Kyoto Protocol and a separate agreement for them. The G-77 and China argue that non-Annex I Parties should have different GHG commitments under the Bali Action Plan track, resisting any disaggregation. They oppose efforts to include developing countries in quantifiable GHG commitments and have blocked formal discussions on the matter. Some delegations walked out of the Bangkok negotiations in October 2009 after a proposal to merge the negotiations onto one track was made. The UNFCCC agreement includes \"common but differentiated\" responsibilities based on factors like financial and technical capacity and historical responsibility for climate change. Differentiation is mainly between wealthier Annex I countries and less wealthy non-Annex I countries, with GHG reductions specified only for Annex I Parties. Commitments from non-Annex I Parties depend on leadership from Annex II Parties. Changes in circumstances, like the growth of China and other emerging economies, have impacted the UNFCCC agreement. Most countries argue that Annex I countries have not fully met their obligations to reduce GHG emissions and assist developing countries, with the United States being especially criticized. Despite non-Annex I Parties now emitting most GHGs, Annex I Parties are responsible for the majority of the increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations since the Industrial Revolution. Wealthiest countries are urged to cut GHG emissions due to their historic responsibility. The Copenhagen meeting faces uncertainty in reaching agreements on GHG emissions. At the negotiations in Bangkok, progress was made in reducing text on certain topics like adaptation, technology cooperation, and capacity building. Negotiators in Copenhagen face contentious issues regarding substantive commitments. The UNFCCC released a document as the foundation for further negotiations, presenting emerging possibilities of agreement on a shared long-term vision, adaptation, technology cooperation, and capacity-building. The Chair notes the need for better articulation between actions and support on GHG mitigation and adaptation, as well as clarity on the role of market mechanisms in the negotiations under the Bali Action Plan. There are differing views on the legal form of the outcomes, with a proposed deadline of December 15 for delivering a comprehensive set of COP decisions. The Bali Action Plan covers a range of topics including a shared long-term vision, adaptation, technology cooperation, and capacity-building. The Bali Action Plan aimed to negotiate a long-term vision for global cooperation on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Some countries proposed cutting emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C. This target is seen as consistent with stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at 450 ppm. The EU proposes Annex I countries cut GHG emissions by 80%-95% by 2050 to meet the 450 ppm target. President Obama aims for an 80%-83% reduction in US emissions by 2050. In Barcelona negotiations, the US called on China to halve its emissions by 2050. China has not agreed to a global target but pledged a voluntary domestic target. China has not agreed to a global emission target but recently pledged a voluntary domestic target. Mitigation obligations are contentious, including commitments for Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, compliance mechanisms, deforestation emissions, sectoral targets, and financing mechanisms. Parties agreed to the principle of \"common but differentiated\" responsibilities, with Annex I Parties expected to lead in emissions reductions. The Kyoto Protocol did not include the United States or Canada. Negotiations for the Copenhagen agreement focus on when and how additional countries will commit to GHG mitigation, and how to differentiate these commitments. China has pledged a domestic target to reduce GHG emissions but opposes international quantitative commitments. The EU suggests developing countries create low carbon development strategies as a condition for financial assistance. Climate activists and vulnerable Parties call for action on climate change. Climate activists and vulnerable Parties are urging Annex I countries to reduce GHG emissions by 25%-40% below 1990 levels by 2013-2017. The EU aims to cut emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, or 30% with similar commitments from other countries. Japan and Australia have set targets of 25% below 2005 and 2000 levels by 2020 respectively. China has called for developed countries to aim for a 40% reduction below 1990 levels by 2020, positioning itself in negotiations. Canada argues that the proposed targets are too stringent and costly. The EU and non-Annex I countries' proposals are criticized for being too stringent and not considering costs. The United States has indicated that these proposals are not being considered nationally. The Obama Administration has offered to reduce U.S. GHG emissions to around 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Some officials suggest this target is comparable to the EU proposals. Table 1 summarizes GHG reduction targets for 2020, with only the EU's target being enacted into law. Many targets are proposed unilateral commitments by Parties for themselves. Some proposals for GHG reduction targets are conditional on technical issues like land use emissions and flexibility mechanisms. The EU questions the allowance of surplus \"assigned amounts\" for Russia and other former Soviet countries, which they see as undermining environmental integrity. Russia and other countries aim to maintain and increase their surplus of AAUs in a post-2012 agreement, while the US, EU, and other Annex I countries push for a comprehensive framework in Copenhagen. They suggest differentiated emission limits for Annex I Parties, with key issues including the comparability of GHG mitigation commitments. Additionally, Annex I Parties propose differentiated commitments for non-Annex I Parties to reduce their GHG growth trajectories through Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). Financial or technological assistance eligibility would be tied to taking and reporting actions. The Bali Action Plan included ambiguous language regarding mitigation commitments by developing countries, with key phrases emphasizing the consideration of mitigation actions supported by technology, financing, and capacity building. China and other large developing countries resist the idea of enforceable commitments for non-Annex I countries. While some non-Annex I Parties have announced voluntary GHG goals, few are willing to embed them in an international agreement or submit progress for independent review. By mid-2009, some non-Annex I countries, including Brazil, India, and China, opposed differentiation among non-Annex I country Parties and MRV proposals. They argue against erasing the distinction between Annex I and developing countries in the UNFCCC. Low-income countries, with vulnerable populations, are also concerned about accountability for mitigation commitments. Near-term assistance for vulnerable populations in countries affected by climate change is a high priority. Key issues include financial assistance, measuring commitments, and ensuring aid flows effectively. The G-77/China and Africa Groups seek quantified commitments from wealthier countries. Some argue for compensation for climate change impacts, while others focus on actions. Non-Annex I countries are concerned about access to financing, conditions for assistance, vulnerability criteria, and bureaucratic burdens. The United States has proposed an adaptation action framework with the UNFCCC playing a catalytic role. The United States has proposed a framework for adaptation action under the UNFCCC, with countries as key implementers and international institutions providing assistance. Roles would be differentiated among countries, with wealthier nations committing to provide financial and technical support to developing countries. Developing countries are calling for new, additional, adequate, predictable, and sustained financial resources for mitigation, adaptation, and technology transfer through UNFCCC specialized funds. Some proposals at the Copenhagen meeting call for publicly financed resources to support technology transfer through UNFCCC funds. There are discussions on new monitoring mechanisms for financial obligations. Agreement on \"quick start\" funding for 2010 is likely. Deep divisions exist among Parties over the establishment and management of funds under the UNFCCC COP. The establishment and management of funds under the UNFCCC COP involve various sources of funding, including levies on international transport, emissions trading proceeds, assessed contributions from Parties, and voluntary donations. Different proposals suggest creating a World Climate Change Fund or Green Fund, a Global Fund for Climate, and utilizing existing financial institutions like the Global Environment Facility. The establishment and management of funds under the UNFCCC COP involve various sources of funding, including levies on international transport, emissions trading proceeds, assessed contributions from Parties, and voluntary donations. Different proposals suggest creating a World Climate Change Fund or Green Fund, a Global Fund for Climate, and utilizing existing financial institutions like the Global Environment Facility. International institutions and organizations have estimated the costs of adaptation to developing countries, with figures ranging from $4 billion to several hundred billion dollars. The estimated costs for adaptation and mitigation to climate change range from $4 billion to several hundred billion dollars annually by 2030. The United Nations Development Programme estimated an additional $86 billion per year in 2015, while the UNFCCC Secretariat estimated $29 billion per year by 2030. The World Bank updated a study in 2009, estimating adaptation costs from 2010 to 2050 to be $75 billion to $100 billion annually. The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2009 suggests around $200 billion of additional investment in clean energy and efficiency in 2020 for GHG mitigation. The European Council proposes providing 5 to 7 billion euros annually for least developed countries as a \"fast-start\" in the context of a Copenhagen agreement. They estimate that 100 billion euros annually by 2020 will be necessary to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. Some non-Annex I countries call for unrealistic amounts of public financing, up to 1% of GDP on top of other Overseas Development Assistance. Countries differ on the sources of funds for climate change financing. The G-77 and China advocate for public funds from developed nations for mitigation, adaptation, technology cooperation, and capacity building. Annex I nations emphasize private sector finance with public funds as smaller shares. The United States and the EU support public financing for capacity building and adaptation but prefer private sector funding through market incentives like GHG trading mechanisms. European Union leaders propose using a combination of non-Annex I countries' efforts, the international carbon market, and international public finance to meet the net incremental costs of up to 100 billion euros by 2020 in developing countries. They suggest an annual public finance contribution of 22 to 50 billion euros, with a focus on fair burden sharing, managing funds, and applying them to specific mitigation actions and Low Carbon Development Strategies. All Parties except the least developed are expected to contribute based on emission levels and GDP, with the EU committing to its fair share. EU leaders plan to contribute their \"fair share\" of up to 100 billion euros by 2020 for developing countries, with funding coming from various sources like levies on fuels and GHG offsets. Proposals differ on using existing GHG trading mechanisms for private sector investment, with the EU and US advocating for more efficient mechanisms than the current Clean Development Mechanism. Different proposals for new mechanisms have surfaced, including crediting for GHG reductions in Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) below business-as-usual trajectories (Korea); NAMA-based emissions trading (New Zealand); and sectoral crediting and trading (EU). Disagreement continues over appropriate mechanisms to manage publicly provided financing under a new agreement. Assistance passes through bilateral arrangements, which some countries find difficult to verify. Multilaterally, various mechanisms are available to help finance capacity building, technology cooperation, GHG mitigation policy development, and adaptation actions. These include the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Special Climate Change Fund. In 2008, multilateral development banks and stakeholders established the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) under the management of the World Bank. Many sources of funding, including other MDBs, are active, but processes and responsiveness vary. Some countries are concerned about the multitude of funds, administrative costs, and strategic provision of funds. Critics argue that much financing is managed bilaterally or through MDBs like the World Bank, which may not align with recipient countries' priorities. Critics of current financing mechanisms for climate change believe they are not responsive to recipient countries' priorities. They prefer funding to be managed by UNFCCC institutions with equal representation. Annex I Parties promote private sector financing, while non-Annex I countries prefer predictable public sector flows. The negotiating text includes proposals for publicly provided financing mechanisms managed by the COP Trustees, existing international institutions, or the GEF. The UNFCCC's existing financial mechanism, the GEF, may be supplemented by a new fund likely to operate under the World Bank. This fund would have its own governance structure and receive public financing to leverage private and public sector investments in various climate change projects. The issue of the mechanism is not the most challenging in negotiations, as the U.S. delegation proposed a new financing mechanism in October 2009. In October 2009 negotiations, a new financing mechanism was proposed by the U.S. delegation, but specific funding levels were not mentioned. The House passed H.R. 2454 with provisions for international emissions offsets and funding for clean technology, capacity building, and adaptation in developing countries. A similar bill, S. 1733, also includes these provisions. Some Members of Congress and advocates are pushing for increased funding for international adaptation, with calls for $2 billion to $38 billion. A U.S. coalition of religious organizations is urging for at least $3.5 billion annually to help vulnerable populations cope with climate-related disasters. The U.S. is behind on its contributions to the Global Environment Facility, and while the Bush Administration initiated a Clean Technology Fund, Congress has not allocated the requested funds. Treasury is seeking $500 million for FY2010. Treasury requested $500 million for FY2010. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 permitted up to $10 million for the Least Developed Countries Fund under the UNFCCC. The House appropriations bill for FY2010 includes $75 million for the Strategic Climate Fund, $225 million for the Clean Technology Fund, $86.5 million for the GEF, and $180 million for bilateral GHG mitigation programs. The United States faces constraints in offering a quantitative financial pledge for GHG mitigation and climate change adaptation without a legislated means to assure predictable financing. This has frustrated other delegations and may weaken U.S. leverage regarding financial mechanisms. Parties agree to cooperate on advancing and deploying new technologies, with the U.S. and EU emphasizing the role of the private sector in achieving necessary advances. Many non-Annex I countries are involved in these discussions. Many non-Annex I countries prefer public funding managed by a new UNFCCC-directed organization for technology cooperation. Discussions in Bangkok cover various issues like technology action, capacity building, RDD&D, and financing, with divisions among Parties on creating new institutions. Annex I Parties urge enhanced action by all Parties, while the EU opposes new institutions and the US suggests a voluntary fund for all Parties except the least developed. The United States proposes a new voluntary fund for technology cooperation, while G-77 countries and China suggest new institutional arrangements funded by wealthier Parties. Some convergence is seen around uses for RDD&D, capacity building, and policy frameworks. Critical components include global openness to environmentally sound technologies, increased access to technology information, and high-quality technology roadmaps for low-carbon growth. The U.S. delegation introduced a \"hub and corps\" framework for technology cooperation in October 2009. The U.S. delegation proposed a Climate Technology Hub staffed by clean technology experts and a Climate Technology Corps consisting of various experts to assist country-driven programs. The proposal addresses the need for new institutions in technology cooperation and highlights challenges related to intellectual property rights. Options for technology transfer in the negotiating draft include patent sharing, financial support for developing countries, global technology pools, and compulsory licensing for climate change mitigation and adaptation. The negotiating draft includes options for technology transfer such as patent sharing, financial support for developing countries, global technology pools, and compulsory licensing for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Some delegations insist on immediate exclusion and revocation of patents in developing countries on essential technologies for addressing mitigation and adaptation. Deforestation contributes significantly to global carbon dioxide emissions and poses ecological risks, with concerns about addressing forests and improving resource management. Widespread agreement has emerged to address carbon sequestration in forests, with differences over financial assistance through public funding or GHG trading. Disagreements exist over safeguards and sustainable forest management definitions. The U.S. supports integrating REDD into developing country NAMAs and low carbon strategies. The European Union and the U.S. support integrating REDD into developing country NAMAs and low carbon strategies. They emphasize performance-based mechanisms for verified emission reductions and stress the importance of measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for transparency and accountability. The UNFCCC includes commitments for effective MRV provisions, such as national GHG inventories and reporting of national plans. Only Annex I Parties have agreed to annual GHG inventories and periodic national communications. Under the Bali Action Plan, Parties agreed to enhanced national/international action on mitigation of climate change, including measurable, reportable, and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by developed country Parties and nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties supported by technology and financing. MRV is seen as essential for transparency and confidence among Parties. In the context of sustainable development, supported by technology, financing, and capacity-building, Parties agree that \"measurable, reportable, and verifiable\" should apply to GHG actions and commitments by developed countries, NAMAs by developing countries, and technology/financing/capacity building for developing countries. MRV is also part of negotiations for REDD+ in developing countries. Most Parties in developing countries agree that new commitments should align with existing frameworks under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Negotiations towards Copenhagen include proposals for reporting all nationally appropriate mitigation actions, ensuring comparable reporting standards for all Parties, providing financial and technical assistance to countries unable to meet requirements, setting timing for GHG inventory and national communications obligations, implementing results-based mechanisms for resource distribution, and establishing transparency and independent review mechanisms. Rules and procedures for MRV in Parties allow them to participate in GHG trading mechanisms and protect environmental integrity. Linkages between MRV quality and crediting of GHG reductions are important. Some non-Annex I Parties may resist proposals due to the stricter compliance assurance systems. Various initiatives have shown progress in enhancing developing countries' reporting capacities and willingness for independent verification. Efforts to enhance reporting capacities and independent verification in Parties have shown useful results, but limited resources have hindered widespread progress. The U.S. delegation emphasizes the need for MRV requirements for all Parties, including enhanced reporting, expert reviews, and public peer reviews. The U.S. proposal for MRV system includes financial support for countries unable to cover costs. Some non-Annex I Parties feel there is insufficient differentiation among Parties. Some Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are pushing for a stronger compliance and enforcement system."
