The Congress finds that a high-quality public switched network will promote universal service, availability of advanced capabilities, public health, safety, national defense, economic development, and international competitiveness. The Congress recognizes the importance of a nationwide public switched network to enhance the quality of life for all Americans. The increasing technological complexity requires sharing infrastructure and functionality among local exchange carriers, coordinated network planning, and development of standards for interconnection. The importance of a nationwide public switched network is recognized by Congress to enhance the quality of life for all Americans. This includes setting appropriate standards, providing access services to competitive carriers and information service providers, and promoting the development of the network by local exchange carriers. Local exchange carriers must construct infrastructure in specific areas, provide regulated services, offer network access to competitors, and act as suppliers of last resort. The Communications Act of 1934 is being amended. The Communications Act of 1934 is being amended to include provisions for preserving universal service, achieving universal availability of advanced network capabilities, maintaining high standards for quality of advanced network services, and ensuring adequate communication for public health, safety, defense, education, national security, and emergency preparedness. Amendments are made to the Communications Act of 1934, including changes to Section 2 and the addition of new definitions in Section 3 related to local exchange carriers. Amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 include requirements for carriers engaged in interstate and intrastate access and telephone exchange service, equal access provisions, and adherence to the North American Numbering Plan. The term 'Modification of Final Judgment' refers to a specific decree. Title II of the Act is amended to incorporate these changes. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include new sections. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include new sections requiring joint network planning and standards for local exchange carriers within 180 days. Additionally, regulations for infrastructure sharing arrangements among local exchange carriers will be prescribed. The Commission must create regulations within 180 days for local exchange carriers to share infrastructure with those lacking economies of scale or scope. This sharing should promote efficient decision-making without forcing uneconomic choices. The regulations allow local exchange carriers to jointly own and operate network infrastructure, with fair terms determined by the carriers themselves. Sharing infrastructure should not force uneconomic decisions or be considered common carrier services. The regulations prescribe guidelines for local exchange carriers to establish conditions promoting cooperation and determine regulatory rights exclusively. The Act does not enact new economic support for telephone exchange services or prohibit new support mechanisms. SEC. 230 allows local exchange carriers to transport or process signaling and information for another carrier in nearby areas. SEC. 231 clarifies that states retain authority over intrastate communication regulation. SEC. 4 grants antitrust immunity to local exchange carriers. Antitrust laws do not prohibit actions taken by local exchange carriers under specific sections of the Communications Act of 1934. The Act defines \"Federal Antitrust Laws\" as the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Robinson-Patman Act, and Federal Trade Commission Act. The term \"State Antitrust Laws\" refers to laws enacted by States or territories within the United States that are similar to Federal antitrust laws such as the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Robinson-Patman Act, and Federal Trade Commission Act. These laws aim to regulate contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that restrain trade or monopolistic practices. State Antitrust Laws are similar to Federal Acts, regulating contracts, combinations, or conspiracies that restrain trade or monopolistic practices."
