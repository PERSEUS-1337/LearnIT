    "content": "The nomination of a Justice to the Supreme Court involves the executive branch nominating and the legislative branch considering the nominee. This decision is crucial for Presidents and Senators, as it divides the responsibility between the President and the Senate, as outlined in the Constitution. The Senate has historically deferred to the President on Cabinet nominations but shown less deference for Supreme Court nominees. Out of 160 Supreme Court nominations since 1789, 36 were not confirmed, compared to only 15 failed Cabinet confirmations. Senate procedures for Supreme Court nominations vary, with some confirmed easily and others facing extensive debate. The Senate is not strictly bound by past practices and uses appropriate procedures for each case. No Senate rules require a final vote on a nomination. The Senate has historically shown less deference for Supreme Court nominees compared to Cabinet nominations. Out of 160 Supreme Court nominations, 36 were not confirmed. Senate procedures for Supreme Court nominations vary, with some confirmed easily and others facing extensive debate. No Senate rules require a final vote on a nomination. This report examines how the Senate has handled the 160 Supreme Court nominations sent by the President, treating each nomination as a separate case. This report focuses on the actions taken by the Senate during the consideration of Supreme Court nominees, how these actions have evolved over time, and their impact on the confirmation process. It specifically looks at 148 nominations that underwent formal proceedings on the Senate floor, excluding discussions on other aspects like the President's choice, Senate state, nominee's views, and public sentiment. The information is sourced from the Executive Journals of the Senate. The report focuses on the Senate's actions regarding Supreme Court nominees, tracking the evolution of these actions over time and their impact on the confirmation process. It examines 148 nominations that underwent formal proceedings on the Senate floor, sourced from the Executive Journals of the Senate. The discussion outlines changing patterns of consideration since 1789, highlighting the Senate's procedural rules and practices. Key characteristics of floor action on nominations are addressed, including dispositions made, length of consideration, and notable proceedings. The Senate's consideration of Supreme Court nominations has evolved over time, with no specific method mandated by the Constitution. The process typically involves stages such as committee referral, floor debate, and a final vote. The Senate has varied in its approach to nomination procedures, not feeling bound to follow past practices. The Senate's consideration of Supreme Court nominations has evolved over time, with no specific method mandated by the Constitution. The process typically involves stages such as committee referral, floor debate, and a final vote. The Senate has varied in its approach to nomination procedures, not feeling bound to follow past practices. The Senate has reserved the right to consider each nomination in its own way, with confirmation proceedings becoming longer and more formal over time. For example, former President William Howard Taft was confirmed as Chief Justice on the same day his nomination was received. The Senate's consideration of Supreme Court nominations has evolved over time, with confirmation proceedings becoming longer and more formal. While early nominations were confirmed quickly, modern norms involve weeks or months of review by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate historically did not refer nominations to committee, but now it is the norm. The study of 160 nominations shows five patterns of floor consideration over time, with some nominees being referred to select committees. The Senate's consideration of nominations has evolved over time, with confirmation proceedings becoming longer and more formal. In 1811, Wolcott's nomination was referred to a select committee, but was defeated. The Senate has always considered nominations in executive session, with closed doors and secret proceedings. The first Senate rules in 1789 did not include provisions for nominations, but in 1806 a new rule was adopted for handling nominations. During the early period of Senate nominations, there was no fixed date for consideration, and the message from the President served as the method of organizing nominations. Most confirmations were done by voice vote, with only two rejections by roll call. Floor consideration typically lasted one day per nomination, with a few exceptions. The first six members of the Supreme Court were nominated by President George Washington in 1789. The nominations were quickly confirmed by the Senate without much debate or investigation into their backgrounds. In 1789, the first six members of the Supreme Court were nominated by President George Washington and quickly confirmed by the Senate. John Jay was confirmed as Chief Justice, with five others as Associate Justices. In 1828, President John Quincy Adams nominated John Crittenden to replace a deceased Justice, but opposition from Andrew Jackson's supporters prevented his confirmation. The Senate debated John Crittenden's nomination for nine days, with opponents offering a resolution to delay the confirmation until the Judiciary Committee's report on amending the Judicial System was finalized. This report could potentially abolish the seat to which Crittenden was nominated. Supporters argued that the President had a duty to fill vacant slots regardless. The Senate debated John Crittenden's nomination for nine days, with opponents wanting to delay confirmation until the Judiciary Committee's report on amending the Judicial System was finalized. Supporters argued that the President had a duty to fill vacant slots regardless. The Senate rejected an amendment declaring the duty of the Senate to confirm or reject nominations as imperative, voting to adopt a resolution declaring it \"not expedient\" to act on the Crittenden nomination. This marked a shift in the Senate's approach to considering Supreme Court nominations. The Senate's approach to considering Supreme Court nominations changed in 1835 when nominations began to be routinely referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Confirmations were typically done by voice vote, with some Senators moving to table nominations they opposed. The motion to table did not have the same effect as rejection at that time. The Senate's approach to Supreme Court nominations changed in 1835, with nominations being referred to the Judiciary Committee. The motion to table nominations was used to postpone action, not reject them. For example, Roger B. Taney's nomination was initially tabled but later confirmed. Robert C. Grier's nomination in 1846 followed a similar pattern, with immediate consideration and confirmation by voice vote. During John Tyler's presidency, his strained relations with the Whig party led to difficulties in confirming his Supreme Court nominations. Tyler tried nine times to secure Senate confirmation, succeeding only once with Samuel Nelson in 1845. He nominated four other men over a year but faced challenges due to his expulsion from the Whig party. During John Tyler's presidency, his strained relations with the Whig party led to difficulties in confirming his Supreme Court nominations. Tyler tried nine times to secure Senate confirmation, succeeding only once with Samuel Nelson in 1845. He sent the names of Edward King, John C. Spencer, and Reuben H. Walworth multiple times to the Senate, facing disdain and rejection. The standoff between Tyler and the Senate intensified, leading to multiple changes in nominations. Tyler's nomination of Walworth as Associate Justice was tabled by the Senate, prompting him to express concern about the backlog of business in the second district. During John Tyler's presidency, his strained relations with the Whig party led to difficulties in confirming his Supreme Court nominations. Tyler tried nine times to secure Senate confirmation, succeeding only once with Samuel Nelson in 1845. He sent the names of Edward King, John C. Spencer, and Reuben H. Walworth multiple times to the Senate, facing disdain and rejection. Tyler withdrew Walworth's nomination due to Senate's reluctance, and nominated John C. Spencer as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in place of Smith Thompson, deceased. The Senate confirmed several other appointments, but a dispute arose over the nominations. The Senate confirmed several appointments, including a dispute over receiving a message from the President regarding a Supreme Court nomination. President Fillmore withdrew John C. Spencer's nomination and renominated Reuben H. Walworth. Confirmation for Supreme Court nominations was no longer automatic, as seen with George E. Badger's nomination in 1853. President Fillmore, a Whig, faced opposition from the Democrat-controlled Senate when trying to nominate George E. Badger to the Supreme Court. Despite efforts to confirm the nomination, the Senate voted to postpone consideration until the new President took office on March 4. In 1868, the Senate adopted a new rule for dealing with nominations by the President, requiring them to be referred to committees and the final decision to be made by the Senate. Nominations not approved or rejected during the session must be resubmitted by the President in the following session. The Senate adopted a rule in 1868 for handling nominations by the President, requiring them to be referred to committees and decided upon by the Senate. If the Senate adjourns for more than thirty days, pending nominations are returned to the President and cannot be acted upon unless resubmitted. This rule codified the practice of referring nominations to committee since 1835, with a one-day layover before Senate action unless waived by unanimous consent. The Senate, despite a rule requiring nominations to be decided upon by the Senate, often decided otherwise. Out of 41 nominations, 18 were considered by unanimous consent on the same day they were reported, while 9 others were considered within two days. The remaining 10 nominations saw floor action more than two days later, with some significantly delayed. The Senate Judiciary Committee began issuing reports characterizing their support for nominations, a change from past practice. The Senate Judiciary Committee began characterizing their support for nominations, a change from past practice. Roll call votes on confirmation became more common, with 16 out of 41 nominations decided this way. The nomination of William B. Woods exemplifies the consideration patterns at the time. President Hayes nominated Woods, a former Union general, for Associate Justice, despite being born and educated in the North. The Senate confirmed the nomination of Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar for the Supreme Court by a vote of 39-8. Hoar, who was serving as Attorney General, had alienated the Senate during the implementation of a law authorizing new circuit court judges in 1869. Republicans controlled the Senate by a large margin at the time. Hoar, as Attorney General, recommended names for new federal judgeships without consulting Senators. His nomination for the Supreme Court was met with opposition in the Senate, with a motion to adjourn failing by a vote of 23-31. The nomination for the Supreme Court faced opposition in the Senate, with motions to adjourn and table the nomination both failing. Supporters eventually agreed to table the nomination, delaying further consideration. Senator Henry Wilson described the difficult fight, with efforts to prevent a vote lasting for hours. Former House Member J.D. Cox also discussed meeting with senators about the nomination. In 1870, the Senate rejected Hoar's nomination for the Supreme Court by a vote of 24-33 after a long and contentious struggle. The Senate later implemented a system called the Call of the Calendar to consider nominations in the order they were reported by committee. The Senate implemented the Call of the Calendar system to consider nominations in the order they were reported by committee. This system allowed the Senate to work through nominations until reaching the Supreme Court nomination, with the option to pass over nominations experiencing difficulty. Nominations could also be considered out of order by unanimous consent. These practices formalized the process used from 1868 to 1922 for Supreme Court nominations. During this period, the Senate reached a milestone in the nomination process by considering nominations in the order they were reported. Several nominations were deemed out of order by unanimous consent, including Edward T. Sanford in 1923 and Byron White and Arthur J. Goldberg in 1962. A significant change was the shift towards public debate on nominations, with the Senate deciding in 1929 to conduct its executive business in open session due to leaks to the press. The disclosure of the roll call vote on the nomination of Roy O. West to be Secretary of the Interior by the United Press prompted this rules change. The Senate Rules Committee investigated a leak regarding the nomination of former Senator Irvine Lenroot to the Customs Court of Appeals. Reporter Paul Mallon refused to reveal his source, leading to a rules change allowing debates to be open unless a majority voted to close them. The case of Judge Parker was one of the first nominations debated in open session, as President Hoover nominated John J. Parker to the Supreme Court. President Hoover nominated John J. Parker to the Supreme Court in 1930 to replace Edward T. Sanford. Republicans controlled the Senate with a majority, but opposition arose due to Parker's support for \"yellow dog\" labor contracts and controversial remarks on race issues during his 1920 campaign for Governor of North Carolina. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People opposed John J. Parker's nomination to the Supreme Court due to his controversial remarks on race issues. The Judiciary Committee rejected his offer to discuss the issues and voted to report his nomination unfavorably. The Senate debated the nomination for eight days, with indications of contention on the floor. The Senate debated John J. Parker's nomination to the Supreme Court for eight days, with floor leaders calling for quorum multiple times. Opponents objected to starting the debate before the senior Senator from North Carolina returned. Allegations of judgeships being offered as rewards for votes were also raised. The Senate debated John J. Parker's nomination to the Supreme Court for eight days, with allegations of judgeships being offered as rewards for votes. The final vote on Parker's confirmation was 39-41 against. The nomination of William O. Douglas also faced controversy. President Roosevelt nominated Douglas to be an Associate Justice on March 20, 1939. Roosevelt nominated Douglas to be an Associate Justice on March 20, 1939, to replace retiring Justice Louis D. Brandeis. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary referred the nomination to a subcommittee, which unanimously reported it favorably to the full Senate. Opposition arose due to allegations of an improper relationship with the New York Stock Exchange leaders. The nomination was passed over twice for fuller debate. The nomination of Douglas for Associate Justice faced opposition due to allegations of improper relationship with NYSE leaders. Senator Frazier's absence led to live quorum calls during debate. The vote to confirm Douglas was 62-4, with 30 Senators not voting. Senate practices now rely heavily on unanimous consent agreements for floor consideration, including Supreme Court nominations. Since 1968, unanimous consent agreements have been used for Senate consideration of Supreme Court nominations, allowing for structured debate and final confirmation votes. Majority leaders can request consent to move to executive session for nomination consideration, as seen with Potter Stewart in 1959 and Harry A. Blackmun in 1970. Since 1968, Senate has used unanimous consent agreements for Supreme Court nominations, allowing structured debate and confirmation votes. The Senate began using roll call votes for confirmation decisions and nominations now receive longer floor consideration. The cloture motion, allowing a super-majority to limit consideration time, was introduced in 1917 and applied to nominations in 1949. It has been used to impose limits on only four Supreme Court nominations. The Senate has used cloture motion to impose limits on only four Supreme Court nominations, including the failed attempts on the nominations of Abe Fortas and William H. Rehnquist. The successful use of cloture was seen in the consideration of the 1986 elevation of Rehnquist to Chief Justice and the 2005 nomination of Samuel Alito as an Associate Justice. During the nomination process of William H. Rehnquist to the Supreme Court, opponents raised concerns about his commitment to civil rights and civil liberties. The Judiciary Committee voted 12-4 to recommend his nomination, which was debated on the Senate floor for five days. A cloture motion to limit debate failed, and a motion to postpone consideration was defeated. Rehnquist was ultimately confirmed by a vote of 68-26. President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States after the death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. The nomination was debated for five days in the Committee on the Judiciary and the full Senate, with three unanimous consent agreements being reached during the process. The nomination of John Roberts for Chief Justice of the United States was debated for five days in the Senate. Roberts was confirmed by a vote of 78-22, with structured time for consideration through unanimous consent agreements. The study focuses on the Senate's handling of Supreme Court nominations, including the type of vote, time spent on consideration, and procedural actions taken. These elements provide insight into the procedural context of nominations. The Senate's consideration of nominations can indicate the level of controversy or opposition. Out of 160 nominations, 124 were confirmed, while 36 were not. This includes 11 rejections and 25 without a final vote, some of which never received floor consideration. Out of 160 nominations, 124 were confirmed, with 73 confirmed by voice vote and 51 by roll call. The closest confirmation votes include Matthews (1881-2) by 24-23, Thomas (1991) by 52-48, Lamar (1888) by 32-28, and Clifford (1857) by 26-23. The Senate rejected 11 Supreme Court nominations, making up the remaining 8% of final votes. The Senate rejected 11 Supreme Court nominations, accounting for 8% of final votes. These rejections occurred on roll calls throughout American history, with the earliest in 1795 and the most recent in 1987. Robert Bork's nomination in 1987 was rejected by the widest margin (42-58), while the closest rejection was in 1930 by 39-41. Only one nomination has been resubmitted after rejection, without success. 25 nominations did not receive a final vote. The Senate has not always proceeded to a final vote on every Supreme Court nomination. Out of 25 nominations, 13 had initiated floor action but never completed it, while 12 never reached the floor at all. Nearly 93% of all nominations received some floor action, with 84% proceeding to a final vote. The Senate has not always proceeded to a final vote on every Supreme Court nomination. Out of 25 nominations, 13 had initiated floor action but never completed it, while 12 never reached the floor at all. The circumstances for the lack of floor action varied, with some nominations being submitted late in a session, withdrawn before consideration, or becoming moot due to changes in the Court's size. This suggests that the Senate has not shown a tendency to leave nominations without a final vote out of reluctance to act. Out of 25 Supreme Court nominations, 13 had initiated floor action but never completed it, while 12 never reached the floor at all. Only two of the 12 nominations continued to be available to the Senate without receiving floor action. The Senate confirmed four out of the five nominations that were later resubmitted, rejecting only one. Some withdrawals occurred for reasons unrelated to Senate sentiment about the nomination. Some Supreme Court nominations were withdrawn for various reasons unrelated to Senate sentiment about the nomination. Paterson (1793-1) was withdrawn due to constitutional ineligibility, Roberts (2005-1) was withdrawn to be nominated as Chief Justice, Thornberry's (1968) nomination was withdrawn due to a vacancy elimination, and Micou's (1853) nomination was not resubmitted by a lame duck President. The lame duck President did not resubmit Micou's nomination, and the Senate's inaction on other nominations reflected opposition. Stanbery's vacancy was abolished in 1866, Hornblower's renomination was rejected in 1893, and Spencer's nomination was withdrawn in 1844. Cushing and Miers withdrew their nominations in response to opposition. Thirteen nominations received floor action but no final vote, including Read in 1845. The Senate laid aside 12 nominations due to unfavorable procedural motions, indicating lack of support for confirmation. Six nominations were subsequently withdrawn by the President. This suggests the Senate's willingness to consider but not proceed to a final vote on Supreme Court nominations in the face of opposition. The Senate has rarely used \"up-or-down\" votes for Supreme Court nominations. Only 13 instances occurred, with most in the 1800s. The Senate confirmed over three-quarters of nominations and more than nine out of ten on which it voted. The Senate has confirmed almost half of all Supreme Court nominations without roll call votes. Roll call votes have been more common since 1967, but they do not always indicate extensive opposition. In some cases, roll call votes have registered fewer than four \"no\" votes. Half of all roll call votes on Supreme Court nominations throughout history have involved fewer than 10 votes in opposition. 26 of the 51 roll calls by which nominations were confirmed revealed \"significant\" opposition. Just 37 of the Senate's 135 votes on confirmation indicated the presence of \"significant\" opposition. Incorporating nominations that received no final vote into this approach provides a unified account of different outcomes on these nominations. The discussion on Supreme Court nominations reveals that while floor action without a final vote usually indicates opposition, the absence of floor action does not necessarily imply opposition. The analysis classifies 50 nominations as facing \"significant\" opposition, suggesting that about two-thirds of the 148 Supreme Court nominations encountered significant opposition. Just about two-thirds of the 148 Supreme Court nominations faced scattered opposition on the Senate floor. The length of consideration for these nominations varied, with the number of calendar days of Senate floor action recorded. Each day with formal procedural action was counted, even if the nomination was not formally under consideration. The Senate recorded the number of calendar days of floor action for Supreme Court nominations, even if the nomination was not formally under consideration. This included days with procedural actions like motions to proceed or debates on postponing action. Individual speeches without formal consideration were not counted. The Senate records the number of calendar days of floor action for Supreme Court nominations, even if not formally under consideration. This includes actions like referring nominations to committee and reaching unanimous consent agreements in advance. Individual speeches without formal consideration are not counted to avoid overstating the length of consideration. The Senate historically spends a single day on floor action for over two-thirds of all nominations. Only 10% of nominations remain on the floor for more than three days, with longer consideration likely due to opposition and extended debate. The Senate historically spends a single day on floor action for over two-thirds of all nominations, with longer consideration likely due to opposition and extended debate. The length of floor action may indicate the intensity of opposition to a nomination, with important nominations receiving more sustained consideration. There is also a trend towards longer consideration in more recent times. The trend towards longer consideration for Supreme Court nominations in recent times suggests potential increases in controversy or changes in Senate procedures. Extended consideration does not always indicate strong opposition, as it may occur for various reasons and not necessarily reflect determined opposition efforts to prolong proceedings. Senate floor proceedings on Supreme Court nominations, like other matters, differ in disposition, time consumed, and procedural actions. Procedural actions for the 148 nominations that reached the floor are listed in Table 4, showing the various forms and frequency of these actions. Senate floor proceedings on Supreme Court nominations vary in the procedures used, with no single procedure being dominant. Instead, proceedings are categorized based on whether any optional procedural actions occurred beyond what was required. Most nominations historically involved procedurally simple actions, with 47% of nominations not involving any optional procedural actions. Senate floor proceedings on Supreme Court nominations vary in procedures used, with 47% of nominations considered \"procedurally complex\" involving optional actions, such as procedural roll call votes. The Senate floor proceedings on Supreme Court nominations involve optional procedures to expedite consideration. However, 61% of nominations were not subject to any optional procedures for delay or opposition. The Senate floor (61%) had no optional procedures for delaying or terminating consideration. This percentage is similar to nominations facing no significant opposition (62%) and those receiving action in a single day (68%). Absence of procedural complexity does not necessarily indicate lack of opposition. Procedural complexity or roll calls may suggest opposition. The occurrence of optional procedural actions in nominations reaching the floor but failing to reach a final vote on confirmation suggests potential opposition. Optional procedural actions can have varying effects depending on the procedural context and whether they align with routine practice at the time. The Senate's procedural context and historical trends in floor consideration show changes in normal practice and the significance of optional procedural actions. These actions can affect nominations and occur during consideration, with distinctive patterns appearing in different periods. Each section is defined by its own periodization. The Senate's consideration of nominations is governed by procedures specific to executive sessions, separate from legislative actions. Historically, nominations were typically taken up automatically during executive business, with a requirement for nominations to be available for floor action at least one day prior. The Senate's consideration of nominations historically required them to be available for floor action at least one day prior. Nominations were usually taken up during executive business, but sometimes they were expedited by unanimous consent or roll call votes. This process was formalized as a Call of the Calendar after 1922. During 1844-1874, Senate faced complications with nominations like Badger in 1853 and Black in 1861. Special orders were used to bring nominations to the floor, with unanimous consent becoming a common practice for Supreme Court nominations until 1930. Special orders were used in earlier times to overcome difficulties in bringing nominations to the floor. These orders delayed consideration until after the normal point, and attempts to call up nominations on the same day were sometimes prevented by objection. Some nominations were passed over for consideration upon demand of a Senator. The practice continued from 1968 onwards. Since 1968, the Call of the Calendar of nominations for Supreme Court nominees has fallen out of use. Instead, floor action on these nominations typically begins with a unanimous consent request. This agreement may allow for immediate consideration or set a future date for discussion. Some agreements also include provisions for executive session, limited debate, or a specific time for a final vote. These consent agreements have become a standard procedure for Senate consideration of nominations. The Senate's consideration of Supreme Court nominations typically starts with a unanimous consent request, which may include provisions for limited debate or a specific time for a final vote. Unlike legislative business, nominations cannot be amended, but most procedural mechanisms are available for both types of matters. Optional procedures during Supreme Court nominations include motions to temporarily postpone. The Senate's consideration of Supreme Court nominations involved motions to postpone temporarily, commit with instructions, and lay on the table. These motions were uncommon before 1835, with motions to postpone used since 1795, motions to commit since 1811, and motions to table since 1826. These motions were sometimes used when the Senate was about to consider a nomination. Additionally, similar actions were proposed by resolution at times. The Senate often used motions to postpone, commit, or table Supreme Court nominations, with these actions being proposed by resolution as well. These motions were typically adopted by voice vote, temporarily delaying further action on the nomination. The only exception to this pattern occurred in 1828. During the decade between 1835 and 1845, only five out of 16 Supreme Court nominations were considered without optional procedures. The motions to postpone, commit, and table were used, with some being adopted by voice vote and others by roll call, indicating varied outcomes. During the decade between 1835 and 1845, optional procedures like motions to postpone, commit, and table were used for Supreme Court nominations. These motions were adopted by voice vote or roll call, leading to varied outcomes. The Senate's actions sometimes resulted in termination of consideration before a final vote could occur. In the decades after 1845, the Senate's use of optional procedural actions on Supreme Court nominations decreased, with a majority of nominations not facing any further actions after being called up. The motions to postpone, commit, and table continued to be utilized during this period, except during the Civil War when opposition was minimal. In the post-1845 era, the Senate's use of procedural actions on Supreme Court nominations decreased. The motions to postpone, commit, and table were still used, with the motion to recommit replacing the motion to commit. In 1870, a resolution to table two Supreme Court nominations until a circuit court reorganization was the last attempt to table such a nomination in the Senate. The Senate never used the motion to table on Supreme Court nominations as a final negative disposition. Starting in 1853, motions to adjourn were used to delay consideration of Supreme Court nominations. In the post-1845 era, the Senate's procedural actions on Supreme Court nominations decreased. Motions to postpone, commit, and table were still used, with the motion to recommit replacing the motion to commit. Starting in 1853, motions to adjourn were used to delay consideration of Supreme Court nominations, but were ultimately unsuccessful in terminating consideration. The motions to postpone, recommit, and table were occasionally used to delay Supreme Court nominations. Only in 1873 did a recommittal terminate consideration, with one subsequent instance in 1968. Such terminations occurred mainly from 1828 to 1873, with only one exception. After 1890, optional procedural actions during consideration of nominations declined, with only 14 out of 50 nominations seeing such actions on the Senate floor. There was a shift towards using live quorum calls and unanimous consent agreements instead of motions requiring a Senate vote. During the period of Supreme Court nominations, optional procedural actions declined, with motions to recommit or postpone becoming rare after 1930. Only routine motions to adjourn or recess were offered, with only four nominations seeing such actions since 1930. Since 1930, optional procedural actions during Supreme Court nominations have decreased, with motions to recommit or postpone becoming rare. Live quorum calls were used more frequently starting in 1925, with at least 10 calls each for the Hughes and Parker nominations in 1930. These calls could cause delays, but only once did it result in a quorum failure during the Parker nomination. After 1930, live quorum calls occurred on seven more nominations. After 1930, live quorum calls occurred on seven more nominations, most recently in 1971, but no more than three times on any single nomination. Unanimous consent agreements only included those ensuring the Senate could reach a final vote on a nomination, often setting a time for the vote or a limit on debate. Such agreements were rare, with only four occurring between 1889 and 1967. Since 1968, consent agreements have become the standard way to regulate consideration of Supreme Court nominations, appearing in 17 out of 21 nominations that reached the floor. Many of these agreements were collegial arrangements rather than solutions to difficulties in consideration. Overall, 16 out of 21 nominations since 1968 involved no optional procedural actions other than the consent agreement. The motion for cloture, allowing a super-majority to limit consideration time for Supreme Court nominations, started being used around the same time as consent agreements became routine. Cloture was first used in 1968 on the Fortas nomination for Chief Justice, marking the only instance since 1873 where Senate terminated floor action on a Supreme Court nomination without a vote. Subsequently, cloture was also moved on the two Rehnquist nominations. The Senate invoked cloture for the first time on a Supreme Court nomination in 1986 for Chief Justice Rehnquist. Cloture was also invoked on the nomination of Alito in 2006. Optional procedures were sometimes used to manage business flow or delay consideration. Optional procedural actions may have been used to delay consideration or hinder final decisions. If these actions led to termination before a vote, it could be speculated that they were done intentionally. Similar actions on other nominations may have had similar intentions, even if they did not achieve the desired outcome. Drawing definitive conclusions about the purpose of these actions would require knowledge of the Senators' intentions. Examining the political and historical context is necessary to infer specific instances of intentional procedural actions. The discussion explores the potential use of optional procedural actions to delay or prevent final decisions on nominations. While the presence of these actions may indicate contention, it does not definitively prove intentional obstruction. Examining the political and historical context is crucial to understanding the motivations behind such actions. The absence of controversy is evident in the procedural actions used for delay. The three indicators examined do not always identify the same nominations as controversial, but there is overlap among them. A more reliable measure of controversy could be derived from considering all indicators together, although this is not covered in the report. Table A-1 provides details on opposition, consideration length, and procedural actions for each Supreme Court nomination. The table provides details on each Supreme Court nomination submitted by the President from 1789 through 2005, including the nominee's name, year of submission, floor consideration status, final vote tally, and extent of opposition. Nominations that received no floor consideration or were withdrawn by the President are noted. The table provides information on Supreme Court nominations from 1789 to 2005, including nominee details, floor consideration status, final vote tally, and extent of opposition. The \"Extent of Opposition\" column is left blank for nominations with no final vote, marked as \"unfinished\" or \"rejected,\" or confirmed with more than 10 \"nay\" votes. The \"Optional Procedural Actions\" column is blank for nominations with no floor action, while actions are noted as \"n,\" \"op,\" or \"opr\" for those with procedural actions. Table A-2 details committee actions on nominations, shedding light on opposition intensity. Table A-2 provides details on committee actions for Supreme Court nominations before initial floor consideration. It includes nominee names, submission years, and highlights cases where no committee action occurred before floor consideration. The table also indicates the days from receipt to committee report, form of reporting, days of open committee hearings, and floor disposition for confirmed or rejected nominations. The curr_chunk discusses the details of committee actions for Supreme Court nominations, with a focus on the form of reporting for each nomination referred to the committee. The normal form of favorable committee action was \"reported\" from 1835 to 1865, and \"reported favorably\" thereafter. The information in Table A-1 provides more detailed floor disposition information."
