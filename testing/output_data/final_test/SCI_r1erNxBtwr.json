The focus is on the effectiveness of graph convolutional filters, with questions about the best filter for all graph data, the influence of graph properties on filter choice, and how to design adaptive filters. A novel assessment tool is proposed to evaluate filter effectiveness, revealing that no single filter is universally optimal and that different graph properties impact filter design. Different graph properties impact the optimal design choice for graph convolutional filters. The Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AFGNN) is developed to adaptively learn task-specific filters by leveraging graph filter assessment as regularization. This model combines base filters and performs well on graph tasks, as demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective tools for representation learning on graph data, showing great effectiveness in various downstream applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful in various applications like node classification, graph classification, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. The key to their effectiveness lies in the design of proper graph convolutional filters, which help nodes aggregate information from neighbors for better task-specific representations. Many GNN architectures have been proposed with their own filter designs, emphasizing the importance of filter design in GNN performance. In this paper, the focus is on addressing fundamental questions about Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) filters for semi-supervised node classification. A Graph Filter Discriminant (GFD) Score metric is proposed to measure the power of a graph convolutional filter in discriminating node representations. Analysis of existing GNN filters shows that no single design can achieve optimal performance. The study found that different graph data requires different graph convolutional filters for optimal performance. They propose the Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AF-GNN) which can adaptively learn the proper model for a given graph. The Graph Filter Discriminant Score (GFD) is used as an extra loss term to guide the network in learning a data-specific filter. The Adaptive Filter can better capture graph topology and separate features on various datasets. The main contributions include proposing the Graph Filter Discriminant Score tool to analyze graph convolutional filters' effectiveness. They introduce the Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network that can learn a suitable filter for a specific graph using the GFD Score as guidance. The model outperforms existing GNNs on real-world and benchmark datasets in Semi-Supervised Node Classification tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the need for both node features and graph structure to be correlated with node labels for semi-supervised node classification. Different GNN filters are tested on graphs with varying properties to analyze performance. The graphical model used to generate graph data is described to understand the relationship between graph filters and graph data properties. The generation of Y, X|Y, and A|Y in simulated data is described to support the analysis of the relationship between graph filters and graph data properties. Nodes are assigned class labels, node features are sampled based on labels, and the graph is generated following a class-aware approach. Generating graph structure conditioned on class labels using the stochastic block model (SBM) involves generating edges based on Bernoulli distributions determined by the classes of nodes. The parameters p and q control the connectivity and density gap of the graph, respectively. Degree Corrected SBM (DCSBM) is a variation of SBM that introduces a parameter \u03b3 to control the power-law coefficient of degree distribution among nodes. Graph Convolutional Filters play a crucial role in improving GNN performance by involving a three-step process: graph convolutional operation, linear transformation, and non-linear transformation. The key step is the graph convolutional operation, which is essential for designing a powerful GNN. The effectiveness of graph filters for GNNs is analyzed. Different types of filters, such as those used in GCN and with pre-defined exponents, are discussed. Some studies propose sampling to speed up GNN training. Learnable graph convolutional filters are also considered. Learnable graph convolutional filters, like those proposed by Xu et al. (2019) and Chiang et al. (2019), augment self-loop skip connections. Graph Attention Networks assign attention weights to nodes in a neighborhood, acting as flexible learnable filters. A novel assessment tool, the Graph Filter Discriminant Score metric, evaluates the effectiveness of graph convolutional filters using Fisher score. The Graph Filter Discriminant Score metric evaluates the graph convolutional filter's ability to separate nodes in different classes using the Fisher Score, which assesses linear separability between classes in non-graph data. It calculates the ratio of inter-class distance to inner-class distance under the best linear projection. The Fisher Score is used to evaluate the separability of nodes in different classes before and after applying a graph convolutional filter in GNNs. The Fisher Difference measures the change in separability after applying the filter. The GFD Score is a weighted sum of Fisher Differences for each class pair, indicating the effectiveness of a filter in increasing node feature separability. Graph convolution can make non-linearly separable data linearly separable with the right filter choice. The GFD Score evaluates a graph filter's effectiveness in increasing node feature separability. Proper graph convolutional filters can linearly separate data, even if sampled from the same distribution. This shows that a filter correlated with the graph structure can empower GNNs with non-linearity without non-linear activation. The SGC model also supports this idea by removing non-linear activations in the GCN architecture. The GFD metric can help assess existing filters and determine their effectiveness on a given graph. After evaluating existing filters, we aim to determine if there is a universal best filter for all graphs or if the properties of graph data influence filter performance. Most current GNNs use filters based on a normalized adjacency matrix, with varying orders. We focus on analyzing this filter family, considering the normalization strategy and filter order. The GFD Score can be applied to any filter on any graph to evaluate its effectiveness in increasing node feature separability. The study focuses on analyzing the roles of different components in graph data, specifically the feature distribution and structure generated by Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The analysis aims to determine if there is an optimal choice of filter for different graph data, and if not, identify the factors influencing the choice of component. Synthetic graphs are generated using SBM and DCSBM for structure and multivariate Gaussian distributions for features. The study focuses on generating synthetic graphs with different structure properties using Gaussian distributions. It considers hyper-parameters like power law coefficient, label ratio, density, and density gap. These properties are essential for real-world graphs and help in analyzing different filters' normalization strategies. The study analyzes different normalization strategies for graph filters on synthetic graphs with varying structure properties. It explores row normalization, column normalization, and symmetric normalization, showing that no single strategy is optimal for all graphs. Each strategy affects how weights are assigned to neighboring nodes, with row normalization keeping node representations in the same range, while column and symmetric normalization may give larger representations to higher-degree nodes. The study examines various normalization strategies for graph filters on synthetic graphs, including row normalization, column normalization, and symmetric normalization. It is found that the choice of optimal normalization strategy can be influenced by graph properties, with the power law coefficient \u03b3 playing a significant role. When the power-law coefficient decreases, row normalization tends to perform better due to its ability to maintain node representations within the same range. Column normalization is effective in keeping node representations in the same range, preventing nodes with similar degrees from clustering together. The label ratio also plays a role, with imbalanced class sizes favoring column normalization. Higher-order filters allow nodes to gather information from further neighbors, enhancing feature propagation. Higher-order filters can enhance feature propagation by allowing nodes to gather information from further neighbors. The choice of filter order depends on factors like graph density and density gap between classes. Increasing density or density gap favors higher-order filters for better performance. The Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AFGNN) helps nodes in the same class obtain smoother representations by selecting effective filters based on GDF Scores. This model addresses the challenge of mixing node representations across classes, making node classification more difficult. The Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AFGNN) selects optimal filters for graph convolutional filters, including the identity matrix as a skip-connection. AFGNN adapts to any given graph by learning a filter through a linear combination of filter bases. This adaptive approach outperforms fixed filters like GCN and SGC, showing that no single filter can perform optimally for all graphs. AFGNN, an adaptive filter graph neural network, outperforms fixed filters like GCN and SGC by learning optimal filters through a linear combination of filter bases. It is computationally cheaper than GAT and achieves similar or better performance on benchmarks. To prevent overfitting, the model includes the GFD Score as a loss term in training. The AFGNN model uses weights \u03c8 (l) to prevent overfitting by incorporating the GFD Score as a loss term during training. Different choices of weight \u03bb categorize the model into AFGNN 0, AFGNN 1, and AFGNN \u221e, each with varying training processes. The model is trained iteratively by optimizing base filters with GFD loss first, then optimizing linear transformation parameters with classification loss.

AFGNN \u221e model consistently outperforms baseline models on Pubmed, SmallGap, and SmallRatio datasets. The AFGNN model outperforms GAT on Cora and Citeseer, despite GAT having a longer training time and higher memory cost. AFGNN with GFD loss shows improved performance compared to AFGNN without it. AFGNN \u221e performs better than AFGNN 1, indicating the effectiveness of the GFD Score. The method can learn the best filter combination from the base filter family. The proposed AFGNN model with GFD loss outperforms GAT on Cora and Citeseer datasets. It can learn the best filter combination from the base filter family, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 5. The GFD loss helps find an appropriate filter for a given dataset, improving GNN design. In our paper, we introduce the Graph Filter Discriminant Score (GFD Score) as a tool for evaluating graph convolutional filters. We find that no single fixed filter works optimally on all graphs, leading us to develop the Adaptive Filter Graph Neural Network (AFGNN) model. By combining a family of filters, AFGNN can learn a task-specific powerful filter. We also propose adding the negative GFD Score to the objective function to guide the model in learning more effective filters. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing GNNs on various graphs. Graph Convolutional Filters (Velickovic et al., 2018) F(G) = Q, where Q is a parametric attention function of X and A. Table 3 summarizes the graph filters for existing GNNs. The proof shows that the linear transformation part in our classifier and GNN helps find the best w for maximum separation. Examples in Figure 6 demonstrate that there is no best normalization strategy for all graphs, with row normalization being better in some cases. In this example, row normalization is shown to be beneficial for graphs with power law degree distribution, preventing misclassification of high-degree hubs. Column normalization is demonstrated to be better in another case. The curr_chunk discusses a case where column normalization is more beneficial than other strategies, using a graph with 2 classes of nodes. The features for the classes follow a specific distribution, illustrating the advantage of column normalization in considering degree information. Additionally, Figure 7 shows examples where different orders do not have a universal best choice, with row normalization being fixed and order varied.

It also explores the influence of powerlaw coefficient on normalization choices.

The process of node classification using a one-layer AFGNN is described in a flowchart. Feature dimensionality is reduced using t-SNE. Benchmark datasets like Cora are used for evaluation. The curr_chunk provides statistics on benchmark datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) used for node classification, including number of nodes, edges, classes, feature dimensions, data split strategy, class ratio variance, density gap, and density. Degree distribution is shown in Figure 10, indicating power law distribution. Parameters like number of epochs, learning rate, and weight decay are tuned for convergence performance. The curr_chunk discusses the time and memory cost comparison between the AFGNN and GAT models on benchmark datasets. AFGNN is shown to have lower time and memory costs compared to GAT on datasets like Cora and Citeseer. AFGNN outperforms GAT in terms of time and memory cost. A real-world dataset with imbalanced classes is used to demonstrate potential challenges in real-world scenarios. The dataset, derived from the Open Academic Graph, includes classes with a significant disparity in paper numbers. AFGNN \u221e model shows superior performance on this dataset based on experiment results."
