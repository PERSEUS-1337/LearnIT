The \"Supporting Colorectal Examination and Education Now Act of 2015\" or the \"SCREEN Act of 2015\" includes provisions such as maintaining Medicare reimbursement rates for colonoscopy procedures, eliminating cost-sharing for certain colorectal cancer screenings, and implementing a Medicare demonstration project for pre-operative visits and hepatitis C screening. Colorectal cancer is a significant health concern in the United States, with high mortality rates among older individuals. Screening colonoscopies are crucial for early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. Removing precancerous polyps through colonoscopy can reduce the number of colorectal cancer deaths. Colonoscopy can reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 53 percent. One in three adults aged 50-75 are not up to date with screening. Organizations aim to screen 80 percent of eligible Americans by 2018. Hepatitis C causes liver inflammation and serious health issues, leading to liver transplants in the US. Hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver transplants in the US, with a high percentage of infected adults born between 1945 and 1965. Many infected individuals are unaware of their condition, prompting recommendations for one-time screening for this age group. Offering screening during colonoscopies may help increase screening rates for Hepatitis C in this population. Maintaining calendar year 2015 Medicare reimbursement rates for colonoscopy procedures for providers participating in colorectal cancer screening quality improvement registry. The Social Security Act is amended to maintain 2015 reimbursement rates for qualifying cancer screening tests by qualifying providers in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The term 'qualifying cancer screening test' refers to an optical screening colonoscopy. A 'qualifying provider' for such tests is eligible for payment under specific sections and participates in recognized quality programs. The qualifying provider must participate in a nationally recognized quality improvement registry and demonstrate that tests were provided in accordance with accepted quality measures. Eliminating Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing for certain colorectal cancer screenings and follow-up diagnostic screenings covered under Medicare. Waiver of Cost-Sharing and Application of Deductible for colorectal cancer screening tests covered under Medicare. The amendments made by this section apply to colorectal cancer screening tests covered under Medicare, regardless of the billed code, for tests and procedures performed on or after January 1, 2016. Medicare will conduct a demonstration project to assess the benefits of pre-operative visits before screening colonoscopies and hepatitis C screenings. Medicare will conduct a demonstration project to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-operative visits before screening colonoscopies and hepatitis C screenings under title XVIII. The demonstration project aims to ease patient concerns, ensure quality examinations, and increase awareness of colorectal cancer risk factors before colonoscopies. The demonstration project aims to increase HCV screening rates among Medicare beneficiaries by educating individuals about the importance of screening during the pre-operative visit. The pre-operative visit will fulfill the referral requirement for screening under title XVIII, allowing patients to be screened for colorectal cancer and HCV simultaneously. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders providing the pre-operative visit under this model. The model described in this subparagraph focuses on the implementation and payment for services furnished under the model. SEC. 6. BUDGET NEUTRALITY. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reduce the conversion factor for physician fee schedule and HOPD to lower expenditures for items and services furnished each year starting from 2016.

The Secretary determines the net offset amount for the year, based on gross additional expenditures and offsetting reductions under the Social Security Act.
