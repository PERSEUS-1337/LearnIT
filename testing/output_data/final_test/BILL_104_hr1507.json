    "content": "The Fair Pay Act of 1995, also known as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, includes findings related to pay equity. The Congress finds wage differentials based on sex, race, and national origin depress wages, hinder labor utilization, cause disputes, burden commerce, and constitute unfair competition. Discrimination in hiring and promotion is also noted. Discrimination in hiring and promotion has contributed to a segregated work force, with many women and people of color working in occupations dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and national origin. Studies have shown wage differentials between white and non-white workers, with a significant portion potentially attributed to discrimination. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in compensation based on race, color, religion, national origin, and sex. The Supreme Court's decision in County of Washington v. Gunther extended this prohibition to jobs that may not be considered \"equal work\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Lower court decisions have highlighted the need for further clarification of existing legislation to effectively implement the Court's ruling. Artificial barriers to eliminating discrimination in compensation based on sex, race, and national origin persist despite legislation from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would have positive effects on the economy, reduce low wages for women and people of color, and promote stable families by ensuring fair pay for working family members. SEC. 3. EQUAL PAY FOR EQUIVALENT JOBS. Amendment to Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 206) prohibits wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin. Employers cannot pay employees of one group less than those of another for equivalent work, except under specific systems. Labor organizations representing employees are also bound by this provision. Labor organizations cannot cause employers to discriminate against employees based on sex, race, or national origin. Any withheld amounts owed to employees due to discrimination are considered unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation. The term \"labor organization\" refers to any organization dealing with employers on labor-related matters. The term \"equivalent jobs\" refers to jobs with similar requirements in terms of skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Section 13(a) is amended to include references to sections 6(d) and 6(g). SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS. Section 15(a) (29 U.S.C. 215(a)) is amended to include protections against discrimination for individuals who oppose unlawful acts, make charges, testify, assist, or participate in investigations. It also prohibits discrimination against employees who inquire about, disclose, or discuss wages. The employee exercised, enjoyed, aided, or encouraged any right granted or protected by section 6(g). SEC. 5. REMEDIES.\n\nAmends Section 16 (29 U.S.C. 216) to allow expert fees in actions for violation of section 6(g) and permits class actions. Also updates subsection (b) regarding employee rights. Section 11(c) (29 U.S.C. 211(c)) is amended to require employers subject to section 6(g) to preserve records documenting wage calculations and file annual reports with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Employers subject to section 6(g) must file annual reports with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission containing wage or salary rates by classification, position, sex, race, and national origin of employees. The reports will be public information and may be published by the Commission. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can use information obtained under subparagraph (B) for statistical and research purposes. They can compile and publish studies, reports, and surveys based on the data. Regulations allow for inspection of filed reports and provide copies for a fee. Rules and regulations dictate the format and content of required reports. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission can establish rules and regulations for reports required under subparagraph (B) to prevent evasion. They may simplify reports for small employers to reduce burden. SEC. 7. RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; REPORT TO CONGRESS. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will provide information and assistance to address wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin in equivalent jobs. Research, education, and technical assistance programs will be conducted to eliminate such discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will take steps to correct conditions leading to section 6(g) by publishing findings, sponsoring educational programs, and providing technical assistance to promote compliance. The annual report to Congress will include an evaluation of these efforts. The annual report to Congress will include an evaluation of the implementation of section 6(g). The amendments made by this Act will take effect one year after its enactment."
