    "content": "The \"Equal Surety Bond Opportunity Act of 1993\" may be cited as the Act. Additional requirements for approval of sureties are outlined in the Act. A company must maintain full compliance with section 9310 of title 31, United States Code to be approved as a surety by the Secretary of the Treasury. Additionally, a signed statement of compliance with section 9310 is required under penalty of perjury by the president and secretary of the corporation for providing any surety bond. The amendments to title 31, United States Code require full compliance with section 9310 for approval of applications, a signed statement of compliance with quarterly reports, and enforcement authority for the Secretary of the Treasury. Section 9305(d) of title 31, United States Code is amended to allow reauthorization of a surety corporation after a 1-year period following revocation for noncompliance with section 9310. Section 9305(e) of title 31, United States Code is amended to include a new paragraph stating that a corporation must not pay a final judgment for noncompliance with section 9310. Additionally, a technical amendment is made to section 9304(a)(3) by adding reference to section 9310. SEC. 9310 of Chapter 93 of title 31, United States Code, provides information for bond applicants and prohibits discrimination. SEC. 9310 of Chapter 93 of title 31, United States Code, outlines the procedure for sureties to notify applicants of adverse actions taken on bond applications within 10 days, or within 20 days if no bond was issued in the past 12 months. Applicants are entitled to a statement of reasons for the adverse action. The surety must provide a statement of reasons for adverse actions taken on bond applications. This can be done by giving a written notification disclosing the applicant's right to a statement of reasons within 30 days of a written request. The surety must provide a specific statement of reasons for adverse actions on bond applications, which can be given orally with the option for written confirmation upon request. In cases where a surety is requested by a third party to issue a bond to an applicant, the notification and statement of reasons can be made directly by the surety or indirectly through the third party, as long as the surety's identity is disclosed to the applicant. For sureties that accept few applications, oral statements or notifications can suffice. It is unlawful for any surety to discriminate against any applicant in any aspect of a surety bond transaction. It is unlawful for any surety to discriminate against an applicant in a surety bond transaction based on various factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, disability, or age. Discrimination is also prohibited if the applicant has previously obtained a bond through certain authorized programs or organizations. The surety is allowed to inquire about marital status, age, and applicant's location for specific purposes related to bondability without constituting discrimination. The surety can inquire about the applicant's bonding history, but cannot assign a negative value based on where the applicant previously obtained a bond. The surety can refuse to issue a bond for certain programs or special needs without violating discrimination laws. Adverse action definition in title 31, United States Code is amended. The definition of \"adverse action\" in title 31, United States Code is amended to include specific instances such as denial of a bond or changes in bonding arrangements. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. In section 9308 of title 31, United States Code, amendments are made regarding the liability of surety corporations to the United States, jurisdiction in civil actions, and the effect of penalties on contracts. Additionally, a new subsection is added regarding the liability of surety corporations for discriminatory actions and the damages that may be incurred by the applicant. The new subsection in section 9308 of title 31, United States Code, addresses the liability of surety corporations for discriminatory actions and the damages that may be incurred by the applicant, including costs and attorney's fees in successful actions. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue proposed regulations within 270 days of the Act's enactment, with final regulations taking effect within 1 year. The amendments in the Act will be effective either when the final regulations are in place or after 1 year from the Act's enactment."
