The caucus aims to enhance STEM education at all levels by facilitating discussions among Congress, the science, education, and business communities. The report by the National Academies highlighted the importance of improving performance and participation in STEM fields for national prosperity and power. The Congressional STEM Competition, introduced by Representative Candice Miller, is modeled after the Congressional Art Competition but with different funding rules. The regulations governing the Congressional STEM Competition were adopted by the Committee on House Administration on November 20, 2013. The rules for the House Student App Challenge were issued on January 8, 2014, defining participation criteria and entry guidelines. The House Student App Challenge is a Congressional STEM Competition promoting innovation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 137 Members registered for the competition by January 31, 2014. The competition ends on April 30, 2014, with district winners submitted to the House by May 30, 2014. Any high school student in a participating district, including homeschoolers, can compete. Participants must be 13 years old as of February 1, 2014, and teams are limited to four students. Teams of up to four students, with two residing in the congressional district, can participate in the House Student App Challenge. Registration is open on Challenge.gov from February 1 to April 30, 2014. Students must submit a three-minute demonstration video of their app on ChallengePost.com, emphasizing the app's scope and quality in a concise manner. The Congressional STEM Competition requires participants to submit a two-minute description of their app's scope and quality, followed by a one-minute explanation of the app's creation process and lessons learned. Submissions must be in English and the app's source code must be available for inspection. Congressional office coordinators are advised to engage with teachers for participation, organize STEM events, and promote the competition on various platforms. Congressional staff will select advisors and judges for the competition. The staff selects experts as advisors and judges for the Congressional STEM Competition. They also determine winning criteria and oversee judging progress. Staff plays an active role in post-submission phases, arranging final judging events and notifying the winner to the Committee on House Administration. A STEM District Tool Kit-Local Roles aids congressional staff in conducting the competition. HouseNet offers resources for students and teachers, including programming guides and code writing courses. The app challenge rules suggest that apps be scored based on creativity, design, coding skills, and impact. Judges may determine winners based on a demonstration video of the app. Entries can be conceptual and do not require a working program. Members can choose judges who do not have to be from their district. The app challenge rules state that contestants will be notified for judging from May 1 to May 30, 2014. Winners may be recognized in a district awards ceremony, with one overall district winner featured on House.gov and Challenge.gov. Members can use MRA funds for the competition, with prizes including certificates, folders, and frames. Individual Members may hold awards ceremonies in their district. The House Student App Challenge co-chairs are Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Representative Anna Eshoo (D-CA). They are also co-chairs of the Congressional Internet Caucus. The Academic Competition Resolution of 2013 emphasizes the importance of STEM fields in civilization's development. STEM fields are crucial for the development of civilization and the United States. They are essential for a qualified workforce and a growing economy. However, there are concerns about proficiency in math and science among eighth graders, limited availability of computer science courses in high schools, and a low percentage of bachelor's degrees in STEM fields. Efforts to promote STEM fields are crucial for the United States to lead in innovation and research. Encouraging students to pursue careers in STEM will strengthen collaboration between education systems and industries. Congressional recognition of students' work in STEM projects will inspire them to continue in STEM studies and research. The House of Representatives is establishing a new competition to encourage students to participate in STEM studies and research. The competition will evolve over time to challenge students in specialized areas of science, technology, engineering, and math. Initially, students will be challenged to develop apps for mobile, tablet, and computer platforms. The competition under this resolution will be carried out according to regulations set by the Committee on House Administration. These regulations will allow Members to consult with experts in STEM fields for selecting judges and evaluating submissions."
