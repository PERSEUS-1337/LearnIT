    "content": "The report discusses cotton's unique treatment in the 2014 farm bill and the legislative efforts to reintegrate it into major farm revenue support programs. It also examines the new seed cotton program and potential issues related to its establishment as a program crop, influenced by WTO rules and a dispute with Brazil over U.S. cotton support programs. In 2004, a WTO panel ruled against the United States in a case brought by Brazil regarding U.S. cotton support programs. Despite efforts to comply with the ruling, the U.S. failed to fully do so, leading to Brazil being granted authority to retaliate against U.S. goods and services in 2009. As a result, the U.S. removed upland cotton from eligibility for certain farm revenue support programs in the 2014 farm bill. In 2014, the U.S. removed upland cotton from PLC and ARC programs in the farm bill. A MOU with Brazil in October 2014 resolved the issue, with Brazil agreeing not to retaliate until 2018 if the U.S. limited cotton payments to authorized programs like STAX and MAL. Upland cotton producers were then eligible for transition payments and a county-based revenue insurance policy. The 2014 farm bill introduced new support programs for cotton producers, including the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs. These programs provide support through reference prices or historical revenue guarantees based on past crop prices and yields. Payments are decoupled from current plantings and are made on historical program acres. The 2014 farm bill introduced new support programs for cotton producers, including the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs. Payments are made on historical program acres for select covered commodities, excluding cotton. Cotton base acres were renamed \"generic base\" to remain eligible for program payments if other covered crops were planted on them, incentivizing producers to plant different crops. Producers of upland cotton can plant other eligible covered crops on generic base acres instead. They are still eligible for support under the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) Program, which provides a floor price and interim financing. The 2014 farm bill changed the loan rate for upland cotton to the average of the adjusted world price for the previous two years. The 2014 farm bill established the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) Program for upland cotton producers, providing payments of $0.45-$0.52 per pound. Cotton producers received $700 million in MAL payments in 2014 and 2015. Additionally, the bill introduced the Cotton Transition Assistance Program (CTAP) and Cotton Ginning Cost Share (CGCS) payments to support producers during the transition period. The CGCS program provided cost-share payments for cotton producers' ginning costs based on their cotton plantings. In 2018, the program offered reduced payment terms at 20% of average regional ginning costs. The EAAU program provides payments to domestic users for upland cotton use at $0.03 per pound, resulting in CCC outlays of about $49 million per year. The USDA offers cotton storage subsidies to producers under the MAL program. STAX is a revenue insurance product with low participation due to decreasing revenue guarantees each year. Participation in STAX has been low and declined each year (29.3% in 2015, 25.3% in 2016, 23.3% in 2017) due to economic decline in the U.S. farm economy. ARC and PLC programs paid out $20 billion to eligible crops from 2014-2016, but cotton producers indirectly benefited. Net indemnity payments under STAX were small in 2015 and 2016, turning negative in 2017. The National Cotton Council (NCC) sought economic relief for the cotton sector due to lower revenues and high production costs. Concerns arose about resources being redirected to other crops. In response to exclusion from PLC program eligibility, the sector pushed for cottonseed to be considered a \"covered commodity\" instead of cotton lint. The NCC proposed treating cotton lint and cottonseed separately for ARC and PLC programs, designating cottonseed as an \"other oilseed.\" The National Cotton Council proposed designating cottonseed as an \"other oilseed\" to be eligible for ARC and PLC programs under the farm bill. Former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack argued that Congress needed to amend the bill to allow upland cotton producers to participate in these programs. Since FY2012, annual appropriations acts have prohibited USDA from providing emergency assistance through the CCC. Cotton's proponents sought a solution through an act of Congress with budgetary implications. A proposal emerged in spring 2017 to include cottonseed in the ARC and PLC programs with specific policy parameters. House negotiators identified two potential options. House negotiators identified two potential budget offsets for the cottonseed proposal: declaring producers participating in the cottonseed ARC or PLC program ineligible for STAX and reallocating generic acres back to cottonseed base. Over $1 billion in ARC and PLC payments had been made to crops on generic base in the first three years of the 2014 farm bill, providing a substantial budget offset. The cottonseed proposal would not receive funding until FY2018 to reduce its budgetary cost. However, it became linked to proposed changes to the dairy Margin Protection Program. The FY2017 appropriations bill did not include funding for the cottonseed or Margin Protection Program proposals. Instead, USDA was directed to prepare a report on cotton growers' needs and consider providing assistance to dairy producers. The cottonseed proposal was revised with a lower PLC reference price and included in the Senate committee-reported Agriculture appropriations bill for FY2018. The Senate bill included provisions for cottonseed producers to designate generic base acres as cottonseed base acres and determine program yields for PLC payments. The joint provisions allowed for $1 billion in new spending over 10 years without budget offsets. In December 2017, cotton and dairy proposals were included in an emergency appropriations bill (H.R. 4667) for hurricane and wildfire victims. The House-passed supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4667, included provisions for assistance to victims of hurricanes and wildfires in 2017. The bill also reshaped the cotton proposal into a \"seed cotton\" program, making cotton eligible for PLC and ARC programs. The BBA (P.L. 115-123) passed by Congress on February 9, 2018, included the seed cotton and dairy provisions from H.R. 4667, amending the 2014 farm bill statutes. This change has long-term policy implications for farm programs. Section 60101(a) designates seed cotton as a covered commodity eligible for PLC and ARC from 2018. Producers must decide on base acre allocation, updating cotton program yields, and ARC or PLC participation by December 7, 2018. Generic base reallocation formula applies based on planting history. The owner of a farm with a history of planting covered commodities during the 2009-2016 crop years must allocate generic base acres between seed cotton and other program crops. This allocation is based on either 80% of their generic base or the average upland cotton plantings during 2009-2012. Residual generic base acres are no longer eligible for program payments. The seed cotton program yield is set at 2.4 times the historical upland. The seed cotton program yield is set at 2.4 times the historical upland cotton program yield. Producers can update their yield based on 90% of the average yield on planted acres for the 2008 through 2012 crop years. For the 2018 crop year, producers can elect ARC or PLC for seed cotton, with PLC being the automatic choice if no election is made. The ARC/PLC enrollment period for the 2018 crop year ends on December 7, 2018. Seed cotton PLC reference price is set at 36.7 cents per pound. The seed cotton PLC reference price is set at 36.7 cents per pound. Payments are triggered under the PLC program if the effective price is less than the reference price. Producer's payment is calculated as the difference between the PLC reference price and the effective price, multiplied by the seed cotton program yield and 85% of the seed cotton base. The new seed cotton provisions under the 2014 farm bill allow for Upland cotton production to be eligible for the MAL program with a floating loan rate between 45 and 52 cents per pound. Seed cotton is deemed to have a MAL rate of 25 cents per pound for calculating maximum potential payments. Enrolling seed cotton base acres in ARC or PLC makes farms ineligible for STAX. CBO estimated seed cotton payments under ARC and PLC at $1.270 billion over five years and $2.961 billion over 10 years. The net costs of the seed cotton provision in the BBA would be reduced to $61 million over 10 years. The net costs of the seed cotton provision in the BBA would be reduced to $61 million over 10 years by budget offsets, including reallocation of generic base and repealing STAX program eligibility for cotton producers enrolling in ARC or PLC. Future policy debates may focus on budget costs, program payment acre realignment, and potential WTO disputes. Projections for PLC payments on seed cotton base are sensitive to market price changes. The cost of seed cotton payments under the ARC and PLC programs is estimated to be $2.015 billion over five years, up 59% from the previous estimate. Reallocation of generic base to seed cotton could make historical upland cotton base acres ineligible for revenue support payments, potentially incentivizing reallocating generic base to seed cotton. Upland cotton producers may reallocate 80% of generic base to seed cotton, resulting in approximately 14.1 million acres of national seed cotton base. This could lead to 3.56 million acres of residual generic base ineligible for farm revenue support payments, impacting the budgetary offset in the CBO score for the BBA. The United States agreed to limit cotton support payments to programs authorized by the 2014 farm bill in a MOU with Brazil. However, new U.S. cotton support programs have been implemented since then, raising concerns about potential violations of the MOU. Brazil may choose to respond under WTO rules or engage in informal consultations as per the Peace Clause of the MOU. Brazil may argue that the new cotton support programs implemented after the MOU was signed do not fall under the agreement, potentially leading to a dispute with the United States. Alternatively, Brazil could choose to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products or wait for the MOU to expire in September 2018 to avoid the issue of violation. After the MOU's expiration on September 30, 2018, there is uncertainty about how Brazil may proceed with charges against U.S. cotton programs. It is unclear if Brazil could extend its retaliation authority or would need to start a new WTO dispute settlement case. The BBA's seed cotton provisions have replaced coupled payments with decoupled payments, potentially making U.S. farm programs more WTO-compliant. The interpretation of CGCS repeat payments, linked to previous year's plantings but separated by a year of non-payments, is also ambiguous. Several economists have raised concerns about linking cotton program payments to market prices, as the seed cotton reference price may not align with historical and projected market conditions. Large government payments could distort market signals and lead to overproduction, potentially impacting developing countries. However, these policy concerns may not necessarily indicate a violation of the MOU or WTO rules. Brazil may face delays in proving US violation of MOU to WTO panel, potentially until late 2020 due to seed cotton program implementation timeline. PLC seed cotton payments triggered would not be paid out until after October 1, 2019, with USDA reporting in December 2019 or January 2020 at the earliest."
