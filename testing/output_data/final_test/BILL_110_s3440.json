Modification of customer service initiative. Congress acknowledges that safety is the top priority for the Federal Aviation Administration, as directed by section 40101 of title 49, United States Code. Despite Congress's emphasis on safety, the Administration's vision statement includes a focus on customer service and public accountability. The Federal Aviation Administration's customer service initiative in 2003 required aviation inspectors to treat air carriers as customers. This emphasis on customer satisfaction has led to concerns that the Administration prioritizes regulated entities over safety enforcement. The Federal Aviation Administration will modify its customer service initiative to prioritize safety over customer satisfaction. Air carriers and regulated entities will no longer have the right to select inspectors, ensuring a focus on regulating safety for individuals traveling on aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration will prioritize safety over customer satisfaction in its operations, ensuring that safety is given a higher priority than the dissatisfaction of air carriers or other regulated entities with Administration employees. Post-employment restrictions for flight standards inspectors are outlined in Section 4. Post-employment restrictions for flight standards inspectors are detailed in Section 44711 of title 49, United States Code, prohibiting certain employment negotiations with FAA employees within a 2-year period of oversight responsibilities. The amendment prohibits individuals from acting as agents for certificate holders in communications with the Administration, with exceptions for existing employees at the time of enactment. SEC. 5. ASSIGNMENT OF PRINCIPAL SUPERVISORY INSPECTORS. An individual serving as a principal supervisory inspector of the Administration may oversee the operations of a single air carrier for a maximum of 5 years. A transitional provision allows current inspectors to continue overseeing a carrier until the end of the 5-year period or 2 years after the enactment of the Act. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must issue an order within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement this section. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Administrator to carry out these requirements. SEC. 6. IMPROVED VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE REPORTING SYSTEM. The Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program established by the Federal Aviation Administration will be modified to ensure air carriers implement solutions for disclosed violations. A process for reviewing and approving voluntary self-disclosures from air carriers will be established by the Administrator. Disclosures from air carriers are reviewed and approved by a supervisor after an initial paper review by an inspector. SEC. 7. NATIONAL REVIEW TEAM. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration establishes a National Review Team of inspectors to audit air carrier operations and maintenance practices. The team is supervised by the Associate Administrator for Aviation Safety and is prohibited from auditing carriers previously overseen by its members.

A team of employees submits a report on the review results to key officials.
