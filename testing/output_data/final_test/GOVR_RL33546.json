Despite concerns about fragility, the monarchy remains resilient due to social cohesion, support from Western powers and Gulf Arab monarchies, and a strong internal security apparatus. However, Jordanians are growing restless over economic conditions, corruption, and lack of political reform. In 2018, real GDP growth was 2.8% with unemployment at 18.5%, higher among young workers. Publicized allegations of high-level corruption add to the discontent. Weekly protests in Amman have been ongoing, but not as large as the 2018 protests over tax hikes. Jordanians are using social media to express dissatisfaction, with high rates of social media usage in the country. Despite loyalty to the monarchy, there are pockets of dissent, amplified through social media. King Abdullah II has implemented a multifaceted approach to address public discontent. Jordan's King Abdullah II has been making public appearances without security detail to increase visibility and interaction with the population. The government televised the trial of those accused in a corruption scandal and withdrew controversial amendments to the cybercrime law. Addressing public discontent, Jordan may be stoking tensions with Israel in support of the Palestinian cause. Jordan renewed a provision in its 1994 peace treaty with Israel, allowing Israel access to Baqoura and Al Ghumar. The King's decision boosted the government amid economic pressure. The Islamic Waqf Council overseeing Jerusalem's Temple Mount was expanded to include Palestinian Authority officials, defying an Israeli ban on Muslim worship at Bab al Rahma building. In response to Israeli ban on Muslim worship at Bab al Rahma building, Jordan arrested worshippers and activists, temporarily banned council leaders from Temple Mount. King Abdullah II declared Jerusalem a red line, stating Jordanians stand with him. Jordan faces economic challenges with high public debt and limited financial options. Jordan's government struggles to fund public sector job programs due to budget constraints. King Abdullah II secured financial support from the UK and Gulf countries, while also relying on aid from the US and other sources. Jordan's strategic location between powerful neighbors has made it vulnerable but also given it an important regional role. Jordan, created after World War I, serves as a buffer between powerful neighbors. Palestinian refugees and annexation of the West Bank have shaped its demographics. The monarchy is supported by East Bank Jordanians, while those of Palestinian origin gravitate towards the private sector. Jordan is a hereditary constitutional monarchy under the Hashemite family, with King Abdullah II ruling since 1999. Educated in Britain and the US, he previously served as commander of Jordan's Special Operations Forces. The king appoints a prime minister and all judges, with governments lasting around 15 months on average before being dissolved by royal decree. Prince Hussein bin Abdullah is the designated crown prince.

The constitution prohibits insulting the king, with penalties of one to three years in prison. Jordan's judiciary is independent, with civil, special, and religious courts, including state security courts for certain criminal cases. The legislative branch's independence is limited by the monarch's authority and electoral laws favoring progovernment majorities through gerrymandering. Parliamentary elections often result in large progovernment majorities. Jordan's economy heavily relies on external aid, tourism, expatriate worker remittances, and the service sector. The country faces challenges such as poverty, corruption, slow economic growth, and high unemployment rates. The government is the largest employer, providing public sector jobs and subsidized food and fuel as part of the social contract with citizens, which has become strained in recent years. In recent years, Jordan's economy has faced challenges due to increased borrowing for fuel subsidies, the 2008 global financial crisis, unrest in the region in 2011, and a decrease in tourist activity and foreign investment. Economic growth has been uneven, with higher growth in urban areas like Amman and stagnation in rural areas. Amman is considered the most expensive Arab city. Jordan's economy faces challenges with high living costs in Amman, youth unemployment, and unsustainable agriculture due to water shortages. The government struggles to provide economic opportunities for young Jordanians, leading to public resistance against spending cuts. IMF has provided financial assistance to Jordan to address these issues. In 2016, Jordan and the IMF agreed on a $723 million EFF deal to improve the business environment, reduce budget expenditures, and reform the tax code. In 2017, Jordan implemented a VAT on common goods to raise revenue as part of IMF-mandated reforms. To comply further, a new tax bill was drafted to increase personal income taxes, expand the tax base, raise corporate taxes on banks, and reclassify tax evasion as a felony. Demonstrations erupted in May 2018 as the bill neared passage following an IMF review of Jordan's economic reform plan. Jordan faced widespread protests following the government's economic reform plan, including a general strike against a tax bill and price hikes on fuel and electricity. King Abdullah II froze the price increases but protests continued, leading to Prime Minister Hani Mulki's resignation. Education Minister Omar Razzaz was appointed as the new prime minister, sparking further demonstrations calling for political reform. Large-scale demonstrations in Jordan led to the government withdrawing a tax bill for revision. Kuwait, UAE, and Saudi Arabia pledged $2.5 billion in aid, including a $1 billion deposit at the Central Bank of Jordan. The IMF supported the decision, emphasizing that fiscal reforms should not jeopardize political stability.

The Gulf Cooperation Council countries pledged $2.5 billion in aid, including $1 billion in central bank deposits. King Abdullah II sought financial assistance from the Gulf during times of crisis, with precedents in 2012. The Jordanian government proposed a new draft tax bill in fall 2018, which included raising personal and family exemptions for the poorest citizens. The Gulf monarchies fulfilled their pledge by providing financial support to Jordan, including direct budgetary support and funds for school construction. Parliament approved final modifications to the law in December 2018, adjusting personal income tax rates to protect the poorest taxpayers. In February 2019, the United Kingdom hosted The London Initiative 2019, where donors pledged $2.6 billion to Jordan. The World Bank also intended to provide $1.9 billion in loans to Jordan. The influx of Syrian refugees has strained Jordan's government and local economies, especially in northern governorates. Jordan has one of the highest per capita refugee rates in the world. Jordan has one of the highest per capita refugee rates in the world, with 670,238 registered Syrian refugees as of March 2019. Most refugees live in urban areas or in camps like Azraq, Zaatari, and Mrajeeb al Fhood. Additionally, 41,000 refugees are stranded in Rukban, where access is sporadic due to security concerns. The United States is accused of using refugees as \"human shields\" to protect their garrison at At Tanf in Syria. The US denies this and supports freedom of movement for the displaced persons at Rukban camp. Discussions are ongoing with Syria, Russia, the US, and Jordan to clarify the process. The United Nations emphasizes the importance of a carefully planned approach for movements of displaced people in Rukban, ensuring respect for protection standards. Jordan faces water scarcity due to population growth. The UN advocates for humanitarian assistance in Rukban. Jordan's water scarcity over the last 60 years is due to population growth, decreased river flow, declining rainfall, and overuse of groundwater. The influx of Syrian refugees has increased water demand, leading to tensions over scarcity. Jordan has pursued water cooperative projects with neighboring countries to secure new water sources. The Memorandum of Understanding on the Red-Dead Sea Conveyance Project was a commitment to a water swap between Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority to address declining water levels in the Dead Sea. Half of the water pumped from the Red Sea would be desalinated in Jordan and used in southern Jordan and the Negev Desert. The other half would be channeled to the Dead Sea. The exact allocations of swapped water were left to future negotiations. In 2017, U.S. officials focused on finalizing the terms of the 2013 MOU for the Red-Dead Sea Conveyance Project. The Israeli government agreed to sell the Palestinian Authority 32 million cubic meters of fresh water. However, in 2018, some Israeli officials expressed doubts about the project and considered pulling out of the deal. The U.S. supported the project and expected Israel to fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Israel is expected to fulfill its obligations under the Red-Dead agreement or find an alternative acceptable to Israel and Jordan. The Israeli cabinet is anticipated to approve the Red Sea-Dead Sea project with both countries pledging $40 million annually for 25 years. The US has shown support for the project, allocating $100 million in Economic Support Funds for Jordan's water sector. President Trump has recognized Jordan as a key US partner in countering threats. President Trump has acknowledged Jordan as a key U.S. partner in countering the Islamic State, with annual aid nearly quadrupling in the last 15 years. Jordan hosts U.S. troops to support Defeat-ISIS operations. The Trump Administration's changes to policies on Israel and the Palestinians have put Jordan in a difficult political position, as King Abdullah II seeks to maintain strong relations with the United States. Jordan's King Abdullah II navigates balancing U.S. relations and Palestinian rights by advocating for a two-state solution.
