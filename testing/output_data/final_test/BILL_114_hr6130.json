    "content": "The \"Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016\" acknowledges the Nazis' confiscation of art during World War II and aims to recover stolen artworks. Despite post-war efforts to return the art, many pieces remain unreunited with their owners, some of which have been found in the United States. In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era conference in Washington, DC, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. Congress also enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act in the same year, expressing the need for governments to facilitate the return of confiscated art to rightful owners. In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, where the Terezin Declaration was issued, reaffirming principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art and urging just and fair solutions for restitution. Victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs face legal obstacles in the United States to recover Nazi-confiscated art due to State statutes of limitations. These limitations often bar claims within a limited number of years, sometimes even before World War II ended, making it challenging for victims and their heirs. Federal legislation is needed to address the legal obstacles faced by victims and heirs seeking recovery of Nazi-confiscated art in the United States. The existing State statutes of limitations make it difficult for claimants to piece together their cases from a fragmented historical record, leading to costly and time-consuming processes. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated a California law that extended the statute of limitations for Holocaust-era artwork claims, citing it as unconstitutional. The Court ruled that a Federal law is necessary to adjudicate claims to Nazi-confiscated art in accordance with U.S. policy. Congress recommends resolving claims through private means like mediation panels with experts in provenance research for fair resolutions. The Act aims to ensure fair resolutions for claims to Nazi-confiscated art and other property, aligning with U.S. policy principles. It defines terms like \"actual discovery\" and \"artwork or other property\" to guide the adjudication process efficiently. The Act defines various types of art and property eligible for claims, including pictures, sculptures, books, and archives, from the period between 1933 and 1945. It also clarifies terms like \"knowledge\" and \"Nazi persecution\" for the adjudication process. The Act clarifies the definition of \"Nazi persecution\" as any persecution based on Nazi ideology during the covered period. It also establishes a 6-year statute of limitations for civil claims to recover artwork or property lost due to Nazi persecution. The Act establishes a 6-year statute of limitations for civil claims to recover artwork or property lost due to Nazi persecution. Actual discovery of the identity and location of the artwork or property in a group of similar items is deemed to occur when there are sufficient facts to believe it is the lost item. Preexisting claims are deemed discovered on the date of the Act if the claimant had prior knowledge of the elements required. The Act establishes a 6-year statute of limitations for civil claims related to artwork or property lost due to Nazi persecution. It applies to pending claims on the date of enactment or those filed between the enactment date and December 31, 2026. The claimant must have knowledge of the required elements for the claim to proceed. The Act sets a 6-year statute of limitations for civil claims regarding artwork or property lost to Nazi persecution, applicable to claims filed between enactment and December 31, 2026. Exceptions apply if the claimant had knowledge of the claim elements after January 1, 1999, and at least 6 years have passed without the claim being barred by a statute of limitations. The Act does not create new civil claims under Federal or State law and will expire on January 1, 2027. The Act applies to civil claims for artwork or property lost to Nazi persecution until January 1, 2027. Claims filed after that date will be subject to Federal or State statutes of limitations.
