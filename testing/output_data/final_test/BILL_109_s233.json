    "content": "The \"Caring for Children Act\" may be cited as the official title. Title I focuses on child care training through distance learning, including grants for developing a child care training infrastructure. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to eligible entities to develop distance learning child care training technology infrastructures and model training courses for child care providers. Grants will be prioritized for regions with the fewest training opportunities. Eligible entities must develop and maintain the infrastructure and establish partnerships. The grant recipients are required to develop partnerships with various organizations to share resources for distance learning child care training programs. They must also create a mechanism for participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the infrastructure and training offered. To be eligible for a grant, an entity must submit an application detailing partnership organizations, infrastructure capacity for distance learning programs, expected participation numbers, and any additional required information. No fees are allowed for grant recipients. No entity receiving a grant under this section may collect fees from an individual for participation in a distance learning program that exceed the pro rata share of the amount expended by the entity. Child care providers are not required to subscribe to or complete a distance learning program funded under this section. Authorization of appropriations for child care grant program is set at $50,000,000 annually from 2006 to 2010. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to award grants to States for employer-operated child care programs. States must submit an application to receive a grant, with the amount determined based on the State's population. The funds must be used as specified. A State awarded a grant must use the funds to assist small businesses in establishing and operating child care programs. Assistance may include technical support, startup costs, provider training, scholarships for low-income earners, sick child care, and contracts with local resources. To be eligible for assistance from a State under this section, a small business must submit an application containing required information. States prioritize applicants forming consortia to provide child care in areas where it is not readily available. A consortium of 2 or more entities, including businesses, nonprofits, local governments, can receive grant funds up to $250,000. States must ensure non-Federal contributions equal to the costs incurred by the entity receiving assistance to be eligible for a grant under this section. Private entities receiving assistance under the grant must contribute a certain percentage of costs in the first, second, and third fiscal years. Child care providers must comply with state and local licensing requirements to be eligible for assistance. The provider must comply with state and local licensing requirements and health and safety standards. States can only retain up to 3% of funds for administration. States are responsible for administering grants and monitoring recipients, requiring annual audits for fund usage. If misuse of funds is found, repayment is necessary. The State must notify the Secretary of any misuse of assistance received under a grant, and the Secretary may request repayment plus interest. An appeals process for repayments will be provided by the Secretary. After 2 years of awarding grants, the Secretary will conduct a study. The Secretary will conduct a study to determine the capacity of entities to meet child care needs, partnerships formed at the local level for child care programs, and the demographics of individuals using funded programs. A report must be submitted to Congress within 28 months of awarding grants. The Secretary will conduct a 4-year study to determine the number of child care facilities funded through grants and their effectiveness in meeting child care needs. A report must be submitted to Congress within 52 months of awarding grants. The Secretary will conduct a study on small businesses with 2-50 employees and submit a report to Congress. $50 million is authorized for fiscal years 2006-2010, with $2.5 million for evaluations and administration. The program established under subsection (a) will terminate on September 30, 2011, with not more than $2,500,000 allocated for evaluations and administration."
