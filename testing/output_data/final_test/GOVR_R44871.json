    "content": "Scientific research shows an increase in harmful algal blooms (HABs) globally, impacting human health, ecosystems, and economies. Examples include a major HAB in Lake Erie in 2014, leading to a water crisis in Toledo, Ohio, and a massive HAB in Lake Okeechobee in 2016, affecting tourism and marine life. The U.S. EPA reported 266 notices for freshwater HABs in 2016, prompting action from various government entities. The report explores gaps in scientific understanding and regulatory approaches to address harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater systems. It focuses on the conditions contributing to HAB occurrence, steps taken by Congress, federal agencies like the EPA, and partners to mitigate HABs, and current knowledge gaps. The report excludes marine or coastal HABs and issues related to HABs in drinking water supplies. Algal communities are natural components of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Algal blooms can occur in freshwater ecosystems due to environmental conditions like increased temperatures and nutrient concentrations. These blooms can produce toxins harmful to human and aquatic health, even without visible signs. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are common culprits of harmful algal blooms in freshwater bodies. Cyanobacteria in freshwater bodies can cause harmful algal blooms, posing threats to human and aquatic health. These blooms can produce toxins called cyanotoxins, which can have severe effects on the liver, nervous system, respiratory system, skin, and more. Exposure to cyanotoxins can occur through tainted drinking water, contaminated fish, recreational activities in affected waters, or inhalation of toxins. The toxins can contaminate fish, disrupt recreational activities, and lead to economic and environmental damages. Golden algae, specifically Prymnesium parvum, are emerging as a problematic freshwater harmful algal bloom (HAB) species, causing large fish kills worldwide. These blooms have been particularly prevalent in Texas since 2000, thriving in brackish water like rivers and reservoirs. The toxins produced by golden algae target gill-breathing organisms such as fish, clams, and mussels, but there is currently no evidence that these toxins pose a direct threat to humans, mammals, or birds. Golden algal toxins do not directly threaten humans, mammals, or birds. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can impact water quality and ecosystem health by blocking sunlight, depleting oxygen, and creating dead zones where life cannot survive. This can lead to economic losses and environmental damage. EPA has documented over 166 dead zones nationwide, including in the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Various factors can influence the occurrence and prevalence of HABs. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in freshwater are influenced by factors like nutrient concentrations, water temperature, light availability, pH, and water circulation. Nutrient enrichment, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to excessive plant and algal growth, causing oxygen depletion, reduced transparency, changes in the biological community, and aesthetic degradation of water. This process, known as eutrophication, is exacerbated by anthropogenic activities introducing nutrients into water bodies. Activities from various sources contribute nutrients to waterbodies, including municipal and industrial wastewater, CAFOs, urban stormwater runoff, failing septic systems, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, fertilized cropland runoff, and manure runoff. Climate change factors like increased temperatures and rainfall intensity may promote HAB formation in warmer waters. Swings between flooding and drought can also enhance HAB formation by prolonging nutrient presence in water bodies. Scientists agree that harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing in frequency and distribution, leading to economic losses and impacting various resources. Factors such as better detection methods and increased reporting contribute to this trend. HABs, including cyanobacterial HABs, have been observed in all 50 states, with some crossing state lines. EPA's national assessment of lakes confirms the rising trend in HABs. In 2012, EPA found an increase in microcystin detection in 39% of lakes compared to 2007. There was also an 8.3% increase in lakes in the \"most disturbed condition\" category due to cyanobacterial cells. Phosphorus concentrations increased across all lakes, while the percentage of lakes with low nutrients and high oxygen levels decreased by 18.2%. The study found that nutrient pollution is a widespread problem in lakes, with approximately 35% having excessive levels of total nitrogen and 40% having excessive levels of total phosphorus. Congress has passed legislation to address harmful algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia, including the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act in 1998. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (HABHRCA) was reauthorized by Congress in 2004 and 2014, expanding its focus to include assessments of HABs in freshwater. In 2015, legislation was passed in response to public safety concerns from a HAB event in Toledo, Ohio, addressing algal toxins in drinking water. NOAA and EPA were identified as lead federal agencies for marine and freshwater aspects of the program. The Drinking Water Protection Act amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to address algal toxins in public water supplies. Congress also required EPA to designate a Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator under the WIIN Act for projects in the Great Lakes. HAB-specific legislation has been enacted since 1998, along with the Clean Water Act authorizing EPA to address water quality concerns related to HABs. Water quality standards are used by states to determine which waters need to be cleaned up and how much effluent may be discharged. The EPA Administrator is required to publish water quality criteria reflecting the latest scientific knowledge on the effects of pollutants on human health and the environment. States can develop standards more stringent than EPA regulations. In developing water quality standards, states must adopt criteria to protect designated use, including numerical criteria based on EPA recommendations or other methods. Section 303(d) of the CWA requires states to identify impaired waters and establish Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to restore water quality. TMDLs assess pollution sources and reductions needed for water quality standards attainment. The Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) process aims to protect U.S. waters and achieve water quality standards by addressing pollution sources, including point sources like sewage treatment plants and nonpoint sources like urban and agricultural runoff. The Clean Water Act tasks the EPA with leading efforts to meet water quality agreements, including goals related to Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Multiple federal agencies are involved in HAB-related activities such as research, monitoring algal toxins, forecasting HABs, and improving water quality through community outreach. In response to concerns about federal agencies' activities and expenditures on harmful algal blooms (HABs), Congress directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to inventory funds and recommend ways to improve coordination and reduce duplication of efforts. The 2016 GAO report detailed 17 agencies' HAB-related activities, expenditures, and statutory authorities between FY2013 and FY2015. The report discusses federal agencies involved in addressing harmful algal blooms (HABs) and highlights EPA's role as the leader in freshwater HAB issues. The Interagency Working Group on HABs and Hypoxia was established to promote a national strategy, coordinate existing programs, and develop a research plan and action strategy. The task force includes various federal agencies and organizations as required by the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (HABHRCA). The Interagency Working Group on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (IWG-HABHRCA) is responsible for maintaining a national program to address HABs and hypoxia. NOAA and EPA lead the program, with NOAA focusing on marine aspects and EPA on freshwater aspects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also involved. EPA's efforts include coordinating multiple entities, developing regulations, conducting research, providing financial assistance, and educating the public. EPA leads several working groups and task forces, including the IWG-HABHRCA. EPA conducts research on harmful algal blooms (HABs) and their toxins, focusing on water quality, human and ecological health effects, monitoring methods, and drinking water treatment. The agency also provides research grants through the STAR program for freshwater HAB prediction, prevention, control, and mitigation. Financial assistance is given to states, tribes, and others to address water pollution. EPA co-chairs various working groups and task forces related to HABs, including the IWG-HABHRCA, Inland HAB Discussion Group, Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, and Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. EPA provides financial assistance to address water pollution, including nonpoint source pollution through grants under CWA Section 319 and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. Regulatory efforts and guidelines are in place to address harmful algal blooms (HABs) and nutrient loads. Guidelines for cyanotoxins in recreational waters have been developed by EPA, WHO, and many states. In December 2016, EPA issued draft recreational water quality criteria for microcystins and cylindrospermopsin, suggesting concentrations of 4 \u00b5g/L for microcystin and 8 \u00b5g/L for cylindrospermopsin to protect human health in recreational waters. States and various entities provided comments on the criteria for informing swimming advisory decisions. Environmental groups generally supported EPA's criteria for use in swimming advisories and water quality standards, while some states and other groups had concerns about the proposed concentrations of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin. Many commenters, including states, treatment works, and agricultural groups, expressed implementation concerns. Some groups raised concerns that the criteria for water quality standards may regulate response organisms instead of pollutants. EPA clarified that permits are more likely to address specific pollutants like nutrients rather than cyanobacteria toxins in discharges. Several commenters expressed concerns about the potential for pollutants in discharges to exceed cyanotoxin standards. They suggested further exploration of nutrient levels triggering blooms and toxin release before establishing water quality criteria. Implementation issues with monitoring and sampling were also raised, with some states lacking the capacity to sample for EPA-specified toxin levels. Variability of harmful algal blooms within bodies of water was highlighted as a challenge. The variability of harmful algal blooms within bodies of water can complicate sampling and analysis for determining water impairment. WHO proposed guideline values for protection from health effects associated with cyanobacteria blooms, categorizing them into low, moderate, and high probability levels. Differentiation between irritative symptoms and exposure to known cyanotoxins is necessary. EPA documents show WHO guideline levels for microcystin. According to EPA documents, approximately 30 states have implemented cyanobacterial HAB guidelines for recreational waterways as of November 2015. 21 of these states have established numeric guidelines for microcystin or cylindrospermopsin, with varying levels and associated actions. California has the strictest concentrations for both cyanotoxins. Some states have adopted the WHO value of 20 \u00b5g/L for microcystin, while only seven states have adopted quantitative guidelines for cylindrospermopsin. Seven states have adopted quantitative guidelines for cylindrospermopsin and added waters affected by algal blooms and algal toxins to their impaired water lists. According to EPA data, 24 states have listed waters impaired for algal blooms, while California and New Hampshire have listed waters impaired for algal toxins. California has one impaired water for algal toxins without a TMDL, while New Hampshire has 66 impaired waters with one TMDL targeting total phosphorus loading to meet water quality criteria. Scientists and policymakers recognize the need to reduce nutrient inputs to aquatic systems to limit eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a serious water quality issue in the United States, with more progress needed to protect water quality and public health. EPA states that without greater progress, population growth will lead to increased nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. 45 states have identified nutrient-related pollution as a priority for their CWA Section 303(d) programs. In 2016, EPA issued a memorandum urging states and stakeholders to intensify efforts to reduce nutrient pollution, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus contributing to harmful algal blooms. EPA outlined key elements of its plans, including prioritizing watersheds, setting load reduction goals, developing numeric nutrient criteria, reducing point and nonpoint sources of pollution, and providing financial and technical assistance. EPA has supported developing numeric criteria for nutrients for almost two decades, providing technical assistance to states. 23 states have adopted numeric criteria for nitrogen and phosphorus in their water quality standards. EPA outlined barriers to implementation in 2013 and offered actions to help states address them. The EPA has supported the development of numeric criteria for nutrients for almost two decades, assisting 23 states in adopting criteria for nitrogen and phosphorus in their water quality standards. Barriers to implementation include difficulties in reducing nonpoint source loads and implementing water-quality-based limits. EPA can regulate point sources but not nonpoint sources, influencing nonpoint activities through grants and funding like CWA Section 319. States may request farmers to use alternative methods to prevent fertilizers from reaching streams and provide funds for on-farm pollution management. The EPA proposed actions to address barriers to numeric nutrient criteria, including collaborating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture for conservation practices, implementing the Section 319 grant program, and working with animal growers to reduce nutrient pollution. The voluntary nature of controlling nonpoint sources is a challenge in developing TMDLs to address nutrient pollution. Farming and forestry groups are concerned about how their activities will be addressed. Farming and forestry groups are concerned about their activities being addressed in TMDLs and CWA regulation. EPA supports watershed-based efforts through various grant programs. The President's FY2019 budget proposes to eliminate or reduce funding for EPA programs, including those targeting specific geographic locations like the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes. The majority of funds from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) go to infrastructure projects for publicly owned treatment works, with only a small portion allocated to nonpoint source pollution projects. EPA's emphasis on addressing nonpoint source pollution may be impacted by the budget cuts. The FY2019 budget aims to support agency goals by reducing nutrient pollution to decrease harmful algal blooms (HABs). Funding for grants and programs within EPA accounts will address nonpoint source pollution. Congress directed NOAA to develop a research plan to tackle marine and freshwater HABs and hypoxia. The February 2016 task force report discusses key challenges in managing harmful algal blooms (HABs) and hypoxia, highlighting gaps in research and knowledge. Federal agencies and research efforts identify areas needing further research. Congressional interest focuses on funding research and coordinating federal efforts to address HABs. The Senate passed S. 1057 in the 115th Congress to reauthorize HABHRCA and involve the Army Corps of Engineers in the task force. NOAA or EPA administrators can declare HAB or hypoxia events. The Senate passed S. 129 to reauthorize the National Sea Grant Program for HAB research. H.R. 4417 and H.R. 4306 have been introduced in the House for funding and research on harmful algal blooms. H.R. 1893 in the 115th Congress would require NOAA to create a database on algal blooms in the Great Lakes. H.R. 3661 aims to address algal blooms in the Great Lakes and other surface fresh waters by awarding prizes for innovative solutions. H.R. 2137 focuses on addressing concerns related to a harmful algal bloom outbreak in Lake Okeechobee, FL in 2016, caused by releases of water from the lake during a HAB formation. H.R. 2137 addresses harmful algal blooms in Lake Okeechobee, FL in 2016, causing beach closures and economic impacts. The bill aims to classify algal blooms as emergencies under the Stafford Act. H.R. 6645 reauthorizes HABHRCA and requires an assessment and action plan for the Everglades region. Recent HAB events emphasize the need for research to prevent, predict, and suppress HABs. Congress has passed legislation to fund research and improve collaboration among federal agencies involved in HAB-related activities. Many observers believe further action is necessary to address harmful algal blooms (HABs) and nutrient pollution. They advocate for increased research funding and regulation of nonpoint source pollution. Controlling nonpoint sources of excess nutrients that contribute to harmful algal bloom (HAB) formation is challenging due to their diffuse and pervasive nature. Scientists agree that addressing nonpoint source nutrient pollution is crucial to correcting overenriched waters and HAB events. Collaborative, voluntary watershed-level efforts are suggested as a way to tackle this issue, with the need for continued financial assistance. Addressing nonpoint sources is essential as controlling point sources alone is not sufficient to combat HABs. Challenges associated with HABs are likely to persist due to the difficulty in controlling the nutrients that contribute to their formation. Challenges and issues associated with harmful algal blooms (HABs) are likely to remain of interest to Congress due to the difficulty in controlling the nutrients that contribute to their formation."
