    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Trails System Willing Seller Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that progress in developing national scenic and historic trails is slower than expected, with nine trails lacking federal authority for land acquisition outside federally administered areas. Acquisition authority is needed to complete these trails as intended. The Congress finds that acquisition authority for national scenic and historic trails should be extended to the Secretary of the Federal department administering these trails. The Congress believes the Secretary of the Federal department overseeing national scenic or historic trails should work with states, local officials, and private individuals to develop the trails. The Secretary should also have the authority to purchase lands from willing sellers to complete the trails. The Congress intends that lands for the National Trails System should only be acquired by the Federal Government from willing sellers. Limited acquisition authority is specified for the Oregon and Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trails. The Congress intends that lands for the National Trails System should only be acquired by the Federal Government from willing sellers. Limited acquisition authority is specified for the Oregon and Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trails. No lands or interests outside federally administered areas can be acquired for the Continental Divide and Lewis and Clark National Scenic Trails without the owner's consent. The Federal Government can only acquire lands for national trails with the owner's consent, as specified for the Iditarod, North Country, Continental Divide, and Lewis and Clark trails. The Federal Government can acquire lands for national trails only with the owner's consent, as specified for various national scenic and historic trails. The National Trails System Act allows willing sellers to utilize remedies if the Federal Government fails to make payment for land or interest in land for designated national scenic or historic trails. Amendments are made to provide protection for sellers in such situations. Passed the House of Representatives on March 13, 2001."
