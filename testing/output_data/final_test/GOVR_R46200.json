While there was a brief period of accelerated growth from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018, it has since slowed down to an average of 2.1% over the next four quarters. The current economic expansion, which began in June 2009, has seen modest growth. Growth averaged 2.1% over the past four quarters, showing a noticeable slowdown. Private forecasters expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and through 2020. The slowdown has been widespread, with only the Southwest, Rocky Mountains, and New England regions unaffected. Despite the recent slowdown, economic growth has not been negative or close to zero since the fourth quarter of 2015. The recent economic slowdown has not led to a recession or cessation of growth. Despite the noticeable slowdown in economic growth, employers have not significantly reduced hiring, with monthly job growth remaining relatively stable. The current economic expansion, which began in June 2009, has seen modest growth averaging 2.1% over the past four quarters. The recent economic slowdown has not led to a recession or cessation of growth. Despite the slowdown, employers have not significantly reduced hiring, with monthly job growth remaining stable. The analysis compares faster-growth and slower-growth periods to identify the concentration of the growth slowdown in fixed business investment spending. The recent economic slowdown has not caused a recession or halted growth. Employers have maintained stable hiring despite the slowdown. The focus of the growth slowdown has been on fixed business investment spending, particularly in structures and equipment, as well as exports. Investment in structures, including office buildings and infrastructure, has declined significantly. Equipment spending, especially in transportation, has also slowed. Other components of GDP, like personal consumption and residential investment, have not contributed to the slowdown. In the recent period, new house construction decreased by about 1%, while government purchases saw a slight increase, boosting growth. Import growth was lower, contributing to overall growth. Economists believe that the economy cannot grow faster than its potential growth rate over longer periods, with the business cycle playing a key role in short-term growth fluctuations. The business cycle consists of recessions followed by expansions, with average growth expected to align with the potential growth rate over a normal cycle length. The current economic expansion is the longest in U.S. history, limiting potential for sustained growth above the potential growth rate. Debates focus on trend growth rate and structural policy changes. Growth can fluctuate due to cyclical or structural reasons, with cyclical contributions mainly demand-driven. The government can influence spending through fiscal and monetary policy, leading to cyclical effects on growth. Structural contributions to trend growth are supply-driven, dependent on labor force, capital stock, and productivity growth. Average growth has been low due to slower growth in these factors compared to the 1950-2007 average. Labor force growth has been hindered by declining participation and an aging workforce. The labor force has been affected by declining participation and an aging workforce. The growth of investment and productivity has slowed down, with average productivity growth declining by more than half. The recent faster-growth period may not be sustainable in the long term. The CBO expects some improvement in productivity growth over the next 10 years, but overall trend growth will continue to be held back by low growth in the labor force and capital stock. Various factors such as fiscal stimulus, regulatory relief, and higher consumer and business confidence have been suggested as reasons for the growth acceleration since 2017, but the exact timing and reasons for the subsequent slowdown are not always clear. The factors contributing to the growth deceleration since 2018 include fading fiscal stimulus, monetary policy tightening, trade policy uncertainty, and a slowdown in global growth. Other factors like the FY2018 government shutdown, rise in oil prices, Boeing production issues, and GM-UAW strike have also played a role in slower growth. Fiscal stimulus can boost aggregate demand in the short run through higher government spending or lower taxes that are deficit financed. The effect on growth is temporary, especially when the economy is close to full employment. Certain tax cuts can alter incentives to work, save, and invest, affecting potential output. Policy changes in tax and spending enlarged the deficit in FY2018 compared to the current-law baseline. The tax cuts in the 2017 act began in 2018, with effects peaking in FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased discretionary spending, providing fiscal stimulus. Discretionary spending remained steady at 6.2% of GDP in FY2017 and FY2018. The legislative changes in tax and spending in FY2018 enlarged the deficit compared to the current-law baseline. Discretionary spending remained steady at 6.2% of GDP in both FY2017 and FY2018. Mandatory spending fell due to slower growth in health programs and automatic stabilizers. CBO projected that tax cuts would boost GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points in FY2018 and FY2019. The tax cuts in FY2019 did not increase growth from the previous year. The federal budget deficit rose to 4.5% of GDP in FY2019, indicating limited fiscal stimulus. The increase in the deficit was partly due to rising mandatory spending and net interest payments. The federal budget deficit rose to 4.5% of GDP in FY2019, driven by increased mandatory spending and interest payments, not policy changes. The deficit increase was also due to lower revenues as a percentage of GDP, mainly attributed to the tax cuts under P.L. 115-97. Fiscal stimulus was minimal, with a slight boost in discretionary spending. Overall, fiscal policy in FY2019 did not significantly impact growth. The Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy from December 2016 to December 2018, reducing monetary stimulus provided to the economy. This led to decreased demand for interest-sensitive goods and services, impacting business investment and consumer durables. The effects of this tightening were not fully felt until after the last rate increase in December 2018. In 2019, the Fed changed course. In 2019, the Fed reduced interest rates three times between August and October in response to slower growth and recession fears. This shift marked a more stimulative course, with rates lower than inflation again. The Trump Administration focused on regulatory relief for businesses through legislation and rulemaking, including an executive order requiring agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one proposed. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) publishes annual regulatory reform reports detailing regulatory actions that either increase costs (classified as regulatory actions) or reduce costs (classified as deregulatory actions) since FY2017. These reports do not cover independent agencies like financial regulators, leading to an undercount of total actions. Agencies have implemented 393 deregulatory actions and 52 significant regulatory actions since FY2017, resulting in a net benefit of $50.9 billion according to agency estimates. Quantifying the impact of regulations on economic growth is challenging due to varying estimates. The impact of regulations on economic growth is difficult to quantify due to varying estimates and the possibility of interactive effects. Regulatory changes can have costs and benefits that may not directly affect the production of goods and services, such as effects on health, safety, and the environment. Deregulatory actions have continued at a similar pace during slower growth periods, suggesting limits on overall growth. Industry-specific deregulatory actions can impact output growth within that industry, but individual industries make up a small share of the economy. Regulatory changes may have one-off effects on GDP growth, boosting output temporarily. The stock market's performance, with the S&P 500 index rising by 38% between November 4, 2016, and January 26, 2018, could have contributed to faster growth through higher equity prices. The rise in stock values can lead to increased investment spending and consumption, contributing to economic growth. Household net worth relative to income is higher post-financial crises, potentially leading to a wealth effect. The exact impact of this effect is uncertain due to unclear causation. The stock market's performance has been volatile, with significant fluctuations since January 2018. Consumer confidence increased before economic growth accelerated in 2016, remaining high through 2018. Business confidence was high in 2018 but more volatile in 2017 and the first half of 2019. Business confidence was high in 2018 but volatile in 2017 and the first half of 2019. Greater business confidence may lead to increased hiring and investment spending. The direction of causation between confidence and economic growth is unclear. The Administration has proposed tariffs and import restrictions on major trading partners since 2017, leading to retaliatory trade restrictions. The trade restrictions, often called a trade war, have impacted the joint economic effects of U.S. imports and foreign retaliatory restrictions on U.S. exports. These restrictions disrupt production of goods and services, affecting GDP through export and import changes. While negatively impacting GDP through export and import declines, they also have positive effects on GDP through import-competing goods in the short term. Export and import growth have declined to close to zero due to overall growth slowdown. Export growth dropped from 3.0% to 0.2% from Q3 2017 to Q3 2019, and import growth fell from 5.0% to 0.9% over the same periods. Trade restrictions have a direct negative effect on growth through exports and imports, as well as an indirect effect on real income, financial conditions, and business investment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has quantified trade policy uncertainty, finding it was higher in 2019 than ever before. The trade dispute with China has negatively impacted growth, with estimates suggesting a reduction of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points each quarter from Q2 2018 to Q4 2019. The trade dispute with China has negatively impacted growth, reducing GDP by 0.3% by 2020. The IMF found trade policy uncertainty was higher in 2019 than ever before, with estimates suggesting a reduction of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points each quarter from Q2 2018 to Q4 2019. The OECD estimates trade restrictions will reduce GDP growth by 0.5% by 2021 if unchanged. The trade policy uncertainty's effects on business confidence and investment have likely increased over time. Announcements of trade policy changes began in a higher-growth period, phased in and ratcheted up over time. Confidence depends on how individuals believe trade disputes will be resolved. One source of uncertainty was removed with the signing of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (H.R. 5430), while uncertainties with China remain, albeit arguably diminished by the Phase 1 bilateral agreement signed on January 15, 2020. Global growth fell from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.6% in 2018 to a projected 3.0% in 2019, its slowest rate since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The IMF attributes half of the slowdown to economic crises in various countries, including important U.S. trading partners like the eurozone and China. Trade policy uncertainty likely contributed to the slowdown, especially for countries heavily reliant on exports like China. The slowdown in global growth, attributed to economic crises in various countries, including important U.S. trading partners like the eurozone and China, was further exacerbated by trade policy uncertainty. This uncertainty led to a reduction in demand for U.S. exports, resulting in a significant decline in U.S. export growth. Additionally, higher U.S. interest rates compared to major trading partners, along with a strengthening dollar exchange rate, further impacted the global economic landscape. In the flexible exchange rate era, the dollar's real value against a broad trade-weighted index reached its highest level since 2003 in December 2016 and has remained relatively high since then. Trade policy uncertainty may explain the dollar's appreciation, with trade restrictions on U.S. imports boosting the dollar's value, while retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports could offset some of the upward pressure. If tariffs reduce growth in importing countries relative to the U.S., this could further reduce the demand for their currency relative to the dollar. The dollar's value is traditionally high as a safe haven currency, attracting investors during uncertainty. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive globally and imports cheaper. Despite the potential for a weaker dollar to boost growth through higher exports, this did not happen due to weaker growth in major trading partners. The consensus forecast is for the economy to continue growing moderately in the coming quarters. The current economic expansion, the longest in U.S. history, may face a potential slowdown leading to a recession. A return to trend growth could reduce the risk of a recession by preventing the economy from overheating. External shocks, like energy price spikes, can trigger recessions, but a growing economy may be more resilient to such shocks. The current economic expansion, the longest in U.S. history, may face a potential slowdown leading to a recession. Growth at the trend rate could prevent the economy from overheating and reduce the risk of a recession. Fiscal and monetary stimulus have helped prevent growth from slowing further in 2018, but additional stimulus to increase growth above trend could be counterproductive. It is unusual for fiscal and monetary policy to still be easy when the economy has returned to full employment. The current economic expansion, the longest in U.S. history, may face a potential slowdown leading to a recession. Fiscal and monetary policy have remained stimulative throughout the expansion, leaving policymakers with limited tools to counteract a future downturn. The Fed's conventional tool of cutting short-term rates may be quickly exhausted, requiring unconventional measures like large-scale asset purchases. The high federal debt as a share of GDP may limit policymakers' ability to provide sufficient fiscal stimulus to counteract a recession. Foreign holders of the debt may also be reluctant to finance additional stimulus. The limited fiscal and monetary headroom has led to competing schools of thought on how to address the issue. One school argues for tightening policies now to gain headroom for the next recession, while the other believes in using aggressive stimulus to avert a deep recession. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cited the latter strategy as a reason for reducing interest rates in 2019. The long-term growth rate is influenced by various factors such as growth in the labor force, changes in the quality of the labor force, growth in the capital stock, and productivity growth. Policies in education, infrastructure, health, trade, and technology all play a role in shaping these factors."
