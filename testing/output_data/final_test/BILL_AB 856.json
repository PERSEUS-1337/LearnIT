    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1708.8 of the Civil Code in California is amended to hold individuals liable for invading someone's privacy by trespassing on their land or airspace to capture visual images or recordings of private activities in an offensive manner. A person can be held liable for invading privacy by attempting to capture visual images or recordings of private activities in an offensive manner, even without physical trespass, if the use of a device is involved. Assault or false imprisonment with the intent to capture such images is also subject to certain provisions. A person who invades privacy by capturing visual images or recordings of private activities in an offensive manner may be liable for damages up to three times the amount caused by the violation. They could also face punitive damages and disgorgement of any proceeds obtained. Additionally, a civil fine ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 may be imposed. A person who directs, solicits, induces, or causes another person to violate privacy laws may be liable for damages, punitive damages, and a civil fine ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. The unauthorized use of any visual image, sound recording, or physical impression taken in violation of privacy laws is not considered a violation unless the person knowingly transmits, publishes, or sells it with compensation. (2) \"Actual knowledge\" means awareness, understanding, and recognition obtained before acquiring the visual image, sound recording, or physical impression taken in violation of privacy laws. The plaintiff must prove actual knowledge with clear and convincing evidence. (3) Any person publicly transmitting, publishing, or selling a visual image, sound recording, or physical impression previously done by another is exempt from liability. If a person's first public transmission, publication, broadcast, or sale of a visual image, sound recording, or physical impression taken in violation of privacy laws does not constitute a violation, subsequent actions in any form or medium are also not a violation. This section only applies to images captured in California after January 1, 2010, and does not apply to images taken outside of California. (6) This section does not affect the ability to file a special motion to strike under specific sections of the Code of Civil Procedure. (7) It does not limit the plaintiff's other legal rights or remedies, such as the publication of private facts. This section allows law enforcement and government employees to capture visual images, sound recordings, or physical impressions of individuals with articulable suspicion during investigations or surveillance related to suspected illegal activity, misconduct, fraudulent conduct, violations of law or regulations, or public officials' misconduct affecting public welfare, health, or safety. In actions under this section, the court can grant equitable relief like injunctions against violations. Rights and remedies here are additional to other legal options. It's not a defense that no image was captured. \"For a commercial purpose\" means an act done with the expectation of financial gain. \"Private, personal, and familial activity\" includes various activities. The court can grant equitable relief like injunctions against violations in actions involving intimate details of the plaintiff's personal life, interactions with family, activities on residential property, and other private affairs under circumstances of reasonable privacy expectations. Private, personal, and familial activity does not include criminal activity but includes victims of crime. Civil fines can be recovered in court by county counsel or city attorney, with fines allocated to prosecuting agency and Arts and Entertainment Fund. Funds in the Arts and Entertainment Fund can be used by the California Arts Council to issue grants under the Dixon-Zenovich-Maddy California Arts Act of 1975. The rights and remedies in this section are additional to other legal rights. The provisions of this section are separable, with invalidity of one part not affecting the rest."
