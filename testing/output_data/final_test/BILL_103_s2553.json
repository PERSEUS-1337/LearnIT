    "content": "The Act titled \"Cooperative Planning Assistance Act of 1994\" provides assistance for habitat acquisition. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to allow the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with entities for habitat acquisition to support conservation plans. The Secretary can pay interest on loans, bonds, or debt instruments approved before entering into a cooperative agreement with an entity for habitat acquisition. Before entering into a cooperative agreement, the entity must demonstrate the ability to repay the debt incurred for habitat acquisition approved by the Secretary. Repayment must be timely and from a source other than the entity's general tax revenue. The Secretary may consider factors such as the number of species in the conservation plan, the amount of preserved habitat, and the entity's commitment history when deciding on a cooperative agreement under this subsection. The Secretary may consider diverse interests, funds expended, likelihood of success, and other relevant factors in approving a cooperative agreement to conserve habitat. Conditions during cooperative agreements include the payment of interest by the Secretary and the obligation for the entity to pay the principal debt. If the entity defaults on principal payment for 2 years, the Secretary's interest payment obligation ends, and the entity must repay all interest received. Upon full debt payment, the habitat can be conveyed to the United States at the Secretary's request. The habitat purchased with funds from a debt instrument under a cooperative agreement can be conveyed to the United States at the Secretary's request after full debt payment. The habitat can be transferred to the Secretary after full debt payment, with the property dedicated to species protection and wilderness preservation."
