    "content": "The gross federal debt consists of debt held by the public and debt held in government accounts. Federal government borrowing increases due to budget deficits and investments of surpluses in Treasury securities. Debt held by the public covers budget deficits, while debt held in government accounts is issued to trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Trust fund surpluses must be invested in Treasury securities by law. Government account surpluses, including trust fund surpluses, must be invested in special non-marketable federal government securities. Treasury pays interest on these securities, which are held in the form of federal debt. When a trust fund invests in U.S. Treasury securities, it effectively lends money to the government, reducing the need for public borrowing or publicly held debt. The revenues from these securities go into the General Fund of the Treasury. The General Fund of the Treasury receives securities that are indistinguishable from other cash and can be used for government spending. The statutory debt limit, established in 1917, changed the Treasury's borrowing process and holds Congress and the President accountable for further borrowing. Congress can adjust or suspend the debt limit as needed. The federal government may face challenges reaching the debt limit due to budget deficits and surpluses in government accounts. Treasury's ability to finance federal activities can be disrupted when the debt nears its legal limit, hindering cash flow management and bill payments. The debt limit may also prevent the government from issuing new debt to invest trust fund surpluses. Treasury is caught between legal obligations to pay bills and invest trust fund surpluses, and the debt limit that restricts issuing new debt for cash flow needs. The federal government faces challenges reaching the debt limit due to budget deficits and surpluses. Treasury's ability to finance activities can be disrupted when debt nears its legal limit, hindering cash flow management. Seasonal fluctuations may require Treasury to sell debt even with a balanced budget. Treasury issues tax refunds in February and March but collects more revenue in April. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt responsibilities when facing a nearly binding debt ceiling. The Treasury has implemented various measures since 1985 to manage cash and debt responsibilities, including suspending sales of nonmarketable debt, trimming auctions of marketable securities, and exchanging Treasury securities for non-Treasury securities. If the debt limit is at risk of being exceeded, a \"debt issuance suspension period\" may be declared, giving Treasury the authority to suspend investments in certain funds. The Treasury has the authority to suspend investments in various funds and redeem securities held by certain funds during debt issuance suspension periods. These periods have occurred multiple times in the past, with the most recent suspension starting in March 2015 and still ongoing. Treasury has not faced a situation where it couldn't meet its obligations as a result. During past debt limit impasses, Treasury took extraordinary actions to avoid default, such as delaying debt auctions and internal transactions with the Federal Financing Bank. Treasury has not yet been unable to pay its obligations due to reaching the debt limit. During the 1985 debt limit crisis, Treasury disinvested trust funds by redeeming securities early to borrow cash from the public. This allowed them to pay obligations, including Social Security benefits. The debt limit was temporarily increased in November 1985 and permanently increased in December 1985. Congress authorized Treasury to alter its investment and redemption practices as a result. During a debt limit crisis, Treasury used nontraditional financing methods to pay Social Security benefits, including not reinvesting maturing Treasury securities. In 1996, Treasury announced it had insufficient cash to pay benefits due to inability to issue new debt. Congress authorized Treasury to issue securities to the public to ensure benefits could be paid. In March 1996, Congress authorized Treasury to issue securities to pay benefits without counting against the debt limit. In 1996, Congress passed a law to increase the debt limit and prevent the use of Social Security and Medicare funds for debt management. In 2002 and 2003, Treasury took actions to avoid reaching the debt limit by using trust fund assets and suspending the sale of securities to certain trust funds. The debt limit was permanently increased in 2002 and 2003. Treasury utilized trust fund assets and suspended the sale of securities to certain trust funds. In 2009, Treasury used the Supplementary Financing Program to manage the debt limit without declaring a debt issuance suspension period. Treasury withdrew most funds from the Fed to create room under the debt ceiling in 2009. The debt limit was raised in 2010, and Treasury increased balances at the Fed back to $200 billion. The SFP was reduced to $0 in 2011 to avoid reaching the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Geithner notified Congress of actions to delay reaching the debt limit in 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner utilized extraordinary measures to extend Treasury's ability to meet commitments through August 2, 2011, including suspending the issuance of SLGS Treasury securities. Between May 16, 2011, and August 2, 2011, Treasury redeemed securities of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund to create additional room under the debt ceiling. The Treasury suspended investments in certain funds, including the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefit Fund, to extend Treasury's ability to meet commitments until the debt limit was increased in 2011. The debt limit was permanently increased multiple times as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011. On December 26, 2012, Secretary Geithner informed Congress that the debt limit would be reached on December 31, 2012. Extraordinary measures were used to extend the limit until early 2013. A debt issuance suspension period was declared on December 31, 2012, and investments in certain funds were suspended. Treasury also prematurely redeemed securities to manage the debt limit. On February 4, 2013, the debt limit was suspended through May 18, 2013. On May 19, 2013, the debt limit was reinstated and raised to $16,699 billion. SLGS Treasury securities issuance was suspended on May 15, 2013. A debt issuance suspension period was declared on May 20, 2013. Treasury prematurely redeemed securities of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund and did not invest receipts of certain funds. Investments in the Government Securities Investment Fund (G-Fund) of the Federal Thrift Savings Plan were suspended on May 31, 2013. On October 1, 2013, Treasury estimated that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by October 17, 2013. The debt limit was then suspended through February 7, 2014. Secretary Lew sent a letter to Congress on February 7, 2014, stating that Treasury would begin utilizing extraordinary measures to finance government operations. These measures provided additional headroom under the debt limit until February 27, 2014. On February 10, 2014, the debt limit was reinstated and raised to $17,212 billion. A debt issuance suspension period was declared on February 10, 2014. On February 10, 2014, a suspension period was declared, and Treasury redeemed securities of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund. Investments in the Government Securities Investment Fund (G-Fund) of the Federal Thrift Savings Plan were also suspended. The debt limit was then suspended for a third time through March 15, 2015. Treasury utilized extraordinary measures to finance government operations after the debt limit suspension period ended on March 16, 2015. The debt limit was reinstated and raised to $18,113 billion to accommodate borrowing during the suspension period. The Treasury Secretary took extraordinary measures to avoid disruptions in federal payments by redeeming securities and suspending investments in various trust funds. The Congressional Budget Office estimated these measures would be exhausted around October or November 2015. Despite additional costs incurred, benefits and other outlays were largely paid on schedule, and trust funds were replenished once the crises ended. If the federal government were to reach the debt limit and exhaust alternative strategies, it would rely solely on incoming revenues to finance obligations. In such a scenario, newly incurred federal obligations would exceed incoming revenues, leading to a deficit. CRS cannot predict specific actions, but it can outline potential outcomes in such a situation. In a scenario where the federal government is unable to issue debt and relies on incoming receipts to pay obligations, there would be a need to prioritize payments to avoid default on certain federal obligations. This situation could lead to delays in payment of bills and obligations. The Treasury can prioritize payments to avoid default on federal obligations by paying interest on debt first. Treasury officials claim they lack legal authority to establish payment priorities, but GAO stated in 1985 that Treasury is free to pay obligations in any order that serves the interests of the United States. It is unclear what the priorities would be if Treasury were to prioritize payments. The Treasury and GAO offer different interpretations of silence in statute regarding payment prioritization. GAO believes Treasury has discretion to prioritize payments, while Treasury sees it as a legal barrier. Treasury stated in 2011 that prioritizing payments would be \"unworkable\" and a failure to uphold U.S. commitments. The Treasury believes prioritizing payments would be unworkable and a failure to uphold U.S. commitments. Treasury's systems are automated to pay bills in the order they come due, as it has been the policy of Congress and every president for 224 years to pay all bills. Treasury Secretary Lew stated that it is not feasible to selectively pay some bills over others due to the design of the payment systems. The Treasury's policy has always been to pay all bills and prioritizing payments is deemed unworkable. In a response to questions, Treasury mentioned that if the debt limit was reached and not raised, the Federal Reserve could continue making debt payments but not other obligations, posing risks to financial markets. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 prohibits discretionary policy impoundments, such as withholding funds for projects not favored by the President or agency officials. Deferral actions temporarily delay the expenditure of budget authority for specific reasons outlined in the statute. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 prohibits discretionary policy impoundments, such as withholding funds for projects not favored by the President or agency official. Funds may be deferred only for certain reasons specified in 2 U.S.C. 684(b) (e.g., contingencies). Prioritization during a debt limit impasse could lead to deferring spending on certain programs, raising concerns about the balance of power between Congress and the President over spending priorities. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 prohibits discretionary policy impoundments, allowing funds to be deferred only for specific reasons. OMB may use statutory authority to delay expenditures and establish priorities for liquidating obligations, akin to a line-item veto. If the debt limit is reached and not increased, federal spending would be affected. Treasury has sufficient financial resources to pay all obligations, but OMB's apportionment authority could delay some payments. The Impoundment Control Act allows the President to defer or rescind budget authority granted by Congress. If the debt limit is not raised, federal spending could be affected. Treasury may not be able to pay all obligations on time, leading to delays in payments to vendors, contractors, beneficiaries, and others. This could result in a backlog of unpaid bills until the government collects more revenue or cash. Delayed federal payments can result in interest penalties under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. This can impact federal programs and trust funds by causing a loss of interest and potentially accelerating insolvency dates. P.L. 104-121 was passed by Congress to address these issues. Congress passed P.L. 104-121 to prevent federal officials from using the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds for debt management purposes. Treasury is allowed to delay investment in certain funds and redeem assets prematurely, but must replenish them after a debt limit impasse. Other trust funds could be affected by delayed investment or early redemption without similar actions to restore them. The Congressional Budget Office highlighted this issue in 1995. The Congressional Budget Office explained the consequences of reaching the debt limit, stating that it would not lead to a government shutdown like not passing appropriations bills would. While employees would not be sent home and checks would still be issued, there could be delays in honoring checks and disruptions in government services if the Treasury is low on cash. If the debt limit is reached and Treasury exhausts its financing options, agencies may continue to obligate funds but may not be able to liquidate all obligations due to a cash shortage. If Congress and the President do not enact appropriations for an agency, it will not have budget authority for obligations, leading to a shutdown of non-excepted activities. Failure to increase the debt limit could have economic and financial consequences, including adverse effects on the economy, public welfare, and the government's ability to market future securities. A government default, even for a short time, could have significant adverse effects on the economy. A government default, even for a short time, would have adverse effects on the economy and public welfare. It would prevent the government from honoring obligations such as salaries, social security benefits, and contractual services. The full faith and credit of the U.S. government would be threatened, impacting domestic money markets. If the debt limit is reached, the repercussions on financial markets and the economy are uncertain. If the government were to default, it would have significant economic effects, impacting GDP and causing disruptions in financial markets. Failure to make timely payments would affect individuals and organizations, potentially leading to increased interest costs and loss of faith from creditors. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee warned of potential consequences of a Treasury default on its obligations, including a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, increased borrowing costs, damage to the economic recovery, and disruptions to financial markets. They also cautioned that a prolonged delay in raising the debt limit could have negative consequences on the market before an actual default occurs. The debt limit impasse, known as \"brinkmanship,\" can have financial and economic consequences even if the limit is eventually raised. While it does not directly affect government financing, it could indirectly impact GDP and financial conditions by altering behavior. Observing past impasses in 2011 and 2013, there were no financial disruptions or recessions, but noticeable effects on economic growth were seen. The debt limit impasse in 2011 had discernible effects on economic growth, with a noticeable slowdown in the third quarter. The Treasury Department's report linked the impasse to a decline in consumer confidence, small business optimism, and the S&P 500 stock index, as well as an increase in market volatility. This impasse also led to the first downgrade of federal debt by Standard & Poor's. The debt limit impasse in 2011 led to the first downgrade of federal debt by Standard & Poor's, citing weakened American policymaking and political institutions. Consumer confidence fell in October 2013, possibly due to the government shutdown, but remained higher than during the financial crisis. The S&P 500 stock index fell by less than 3% during the shutdown but recovered its value afterward. During the 2011 and 2013 debt limit impasses, Treasury yields showed unusual patterns, with short-term Treasury securities and credit default swaps on U.S. Treasuries experiencing significant price movements. Investors regained confidence in the debt limit being raised, leading to the recovery of the S&P 500 stock index after a slight drop during the shutdown. During the 2011 and 2013 debt limit impasses, Treasury yields showed unusual patterns, with short-term Treasury securities and credit default swaps on U.S. Treasuries experiencing significant price movements. The debt limit in a timely fashion could cause short-term interruptions in repaying maturing debt, and the unusual pattern disappeared as soon as the debt limit was raised. The yield on 4-week bills implied that the risk was relatively low, and the broader economic consequences of this anomaly were likely limited. The main effect was to raise the borrowing costs of the Treasury on securities sold during the period of elevated yields. In the 2011 debt limit impasse, GAO estimated that the debt limit impasse increased Treasury borrowing costs by $1.3 billion. Credit default swaps for which federal debt is the reference entity rose significantly. During the 2011 and 2013 debt limit impasses, Treasury yields showed unusual patterns, with short-term Treasury securities and credit default swaps on U.S. Treasuries experiencing significant price movements. In 2011, CDS prices for five-year Treasury securities rose above 60 basis points, reaching a peak on October 10, 2013, at 40 basis points. The effects of the debt limit impasse and government shutdown are difficult to separate. Various viewpoints exist on how to address debt limit issues. The debt subject to limit will continue to rise as long as the budget remains in. The Obama Administration and Treasury Secretary Geithner emphasized the serious consequences of not raising the debt limit, stating it would harm the American economy and livelihoods. President Obama insisted on raising the debt limit without negotiation, emphasizing the importance of the country's financial well-being and credit. Speaker of the House John A. Boehner's stance on the issue was not mentioned. Speaker of the House John A. Boehner insists on spending cuts or reforms greater than the debt limit increase. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid calls for a balanced approach with spending cuts and revenue measures from millionaires. Economists express concern about federal debt levels, but warn of consequences if the debt limit is not raised. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urges Congress to lower the nation's debt and warns of default if the limit is not raised. Economists, including Mark Zandi and Donald Marron, warn of catastrophic consequences if the debt limit is not raised. They emphasize the importance of addressing the nation's fiscal challenges to avoid default on its debt. The United States must address its fiscal challenges to avoid default on its debt. Questions arise on what constitutes a legal default, with proponents of prioritization suggesting it applies only to failing to pay interest on debt obligations to third parties. Opponents argue default includes failing to meet any obligation authorized by law, such as funding appropriated programs or paying federal salaries. No general statutory definition of default exists. The term \"default\" is defined as the failure to make a payment when due, without distinguishing between types of government obligations. Financial markets' perceptions of default and the potential impacts of not raising the debt limit are relevant. Prioritizing debt payments over other obligations may not be significant to financial markets. The effects of prioritization in the event of an impasse are unpredictable. In the event of an impasse and reaching the debt limit, prioritization legislation would prioritize certain payments. However, issues may arise regarding how to prioritize among obligations not explicitly subject to prioritization. Legislation like the Full Faith and Credit Act (H.R. 807) would require Treasury to prioritize debt payments and provide weekly reports if the debt limit is reached. On May 9, 2013, the House approved legislation related to the debt limit. A similar measure was included in proposed legislation for FY2014 appropriations but was not ultimately enacted into law. The debt limit was reset to $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015, with estimates projecting it to reach $18,473 billion by the end of FY2015. If extraordinary measures are exhausted, Treasury will need further legislative action to issue federal debt. The debt limit was reset to $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015, with estimates projecting it to reach $18,473 billion by the end of FY2015. If extraordinary measures are exhausted, Treasury will need further legislative action to issue federal debt. Without such action, federal spending would have to be decreased or federal revenues increased to cover what cannot be borrowed. Despite recent declines in the budget deficit, projections show an increase in the debt subject to limit over the next 10 years, reaching $26,242 billion by the end of FY2025 under President Obama's FY2016 budget. The budget deficit is projected to decline between FY2015 and FY2017, but the debt subject to limit is expected to increase from $19,048 billion to $20,905 billion by the end of FY2025. This means the debt limit would have to increase by $1,857 billion if the policies in the House-passed budget resolution were enacted. The debt limit may need to increase by $1,857 billion over the FY2016 to FY2025 period to accommodate proposed policies. The level of debt and future increases in the debt limit will be determined by borrowing requirements, which could change based on spending and revenue proposals. Congress's frequency of reconsidering statutory debt limit legislation impacts the level at which the debt limit is set. Temporary increases in the debt limit have been used in the past to allow for more time to consider permanent increases. The debt limit may need to increase by $1,857 billion over the FY2016 to FY2025 period to accommodate proposed policies. Temporary increases in the debt limit have been used in the past to allow for more time to consider permanent increases. Congress may need to enact legislation to lower the level of debt subject to limit if a temporary increase were to expire. The debt limit legislation often faces complications and delays in Congress due to policy disagreements. Many lawmakers believe that raising the debt limit should be accompanied by deficit reduction measures. The Congressional Budget Office notes that setting a debt limit alone is not effective in controlling deficits, as borrowing decisions are made through other legislative actions. By the time an increase in the debt ceiling is needed, it is too late to avoid paying pending bills without serious consequences. An increase in the debt limit would be necessary if the federal budget is in deficit and intragovernmental debt is rising. If the budget is balanced or in surplus and intragovernmental debt is falling, an increase in the debt limit would not be required. Increases in the statutory debt limit would be needed if the budget remains in deficit, even if future deficit levels are lower. If intragovernmental debt is declining due to trust funds redeeming Treasury securities to pay benefits, Treasury would need to provide cash from the General Fund or issue additional debt to the public. This would not require an increase in the debt limit, as the decline in intragovernmental debt would be offset by an increase in debt held by the public. If the federal budget is in surplus, surplus cash could finance the redemption of trust fund securities. In September 1985, the Treasury Department informed Congress that it had reached the statutory debt limit, leading to extraordinary measures being taken to meet the government's cash requirements. Treasury used internal transactions involving the Federal Financing Bank and delayed public auctions of government debt. Additionally, new short-term government securities to various trust funds were either delayed or not issued. During a period of reaching the debt limit in 1985, the Treasury took steps to avoid exceeding it by disinvesting trust funds and redeeming securities early. This allowed for borrowing cash from the public to meet obligations, including Social Security benefits. The debt limit was temporarily increased in November and permanently increased in December of that year. In 1985, the debt limit was temporarily increased in November and permanently increased in December from $1.824 billion to $2.079 billion. The Treasury managed the Social Security Trust Funds during the debt limit impasse by disinvesting trust funds and redeeming securities early to borrow cash from the public. The General Accounting Office found that some actions by the Secretary may have violated the Social Security Act but were deemed reasonable given the circumstances. In November 1985, excess funds were used to finance government operations after the debt limit crisis. Congress authorized the Treasury Secretary to declare a debt issuance suspension period, allowing departure from normal trust fund investment practices. Funds raised during this period can only be used to prevent the public debt from exceeding the limit. After the period ends, Treasury must make the trust funds whole by issuing securities and crediting any lost interest. In 1995-1996, Treasury used non-traditional financing methods and declared a debt issuance suspension period due to insufficient cash to pay Social Security benefits in March 1996. Congress responded by passing P.L. 104-103. In response to Treasury's cash shortage to pay Social Security benefits in March 1996, Congress passed P.L. 104-103, allowing Treasury to issue securities temporarily. About $29 billion of securities were issued on February 23, 1996, not counting against the debt limit until March 15, 1996. P.L. 104-115 extended the exemption until March 30, 1996, and the debt limit was permanently increased to $5,500 billion on March 29, 1996 (P.L. 104-121). The Secretary of the Treasury and federal officials are prohibited from using Social Security and Medicare funds for debt management. They must not delay incoming receipts to the Trust Funds or sell securities unless necessary for benefit payments. These restrictions apply to various Trust Funds. In 2011, Treasury took actions to avoid reaching the debt limit. In 2011, Treasury took actions to avoid reaching the debt limit by utilizing extraordinary measures, including declaring a debt issuance suspension period. Treasury Secretary Geithner notified Congress that these actions could delay reaching the debt limit by several weeks. If the debt limit was not raised, payment of obligations and benefits would be affected. Geithner stated that the debt limit would be reached by May 16, 2011, but extraordinary measures would extend Treasury's ability to meet commitments through July 8, 2011. Treasury utilized extraordinary measures to delay reaching the debt limit in 2011. Secretary Geithner warned that not raising the debt limit would have catastrophic economic consequences. The debt limit was expected to be reached by May 16, 2011, but measures extended Treasury's ability to meet commitments until August 2, 2011. Treasury suspended issuance of SLGS Treasury securities and utilized extraordinary measures to delay reaching the debt limit in 2011. Investments in various funds were suspended, including the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefit Fund. Treasury also suspended investments in the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the G-Fund of the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. The debt limit for the Federal Thrift Savings Plan was permanently increased in 2011 through the Budget Control Act. Secretary Geithner projected reaching the debt limit by December 31, 2012, with extraordinary measures providing temporary relief until early 2013. During the 2011 debt limit debate, the Obama Administration and Congress had differing views on the consequences of not raising the debt limit. Treasury Secretary Geithner warned of serious repercussions, including discontinued federal payments and catastrophic damage to the economy. Chairman Goolsbee stated that a default would lead to a worse financial crisis than in 2008. Secretary Geithner warned that a default on the debt limit would cause a worse financial crisis than in 2008, with far-reaching negative consequences on Treasuries and the dollar's role in the international financial system. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wolin stated that prioritizing payments on the national debt would not prevent default and would bring the same economic consequences. President Obama aimed to address the federal government's fiscal position with a focus on medium- and long-term fiscal issues. Legislative proposals related to the potential debt limit crisis began emerging in early 2011, with policymakers expressing contrasting perspectives on addressing medium- and long-term fiscal challenges. Senator Jim DeMint proposed tying a debt limit increase to a balanced-budget amendment, while Senator Pat Toomey and Representative Tom McClintock introduced legislation prioritizing payment of debt held by the public in a crisis. Legislative proposals in 2011 aimed to address the debt limit crisis, with some prioritizing payment of debt held by the public and Social Security benefits in case of reaching the limit. Senator Toomey emphasized maintaining financial market stability, while Representative Stutzman included military expenditures in the priority list. The Social Security Trust Funds must be invested in US obligations, which count towards the federal debt limit. Social Security revenues are immediately credited to the Trust Funds in the form of Treasury securities. The Social Security Trust Funds invest in US obligations, known as certificates of indebtedness (CIs). These CIs mature on June 30 and any surplus is converted to long-term Treasury securities. Interest income is credited semi-annually in the form of special-issue obligations. Treasury pays Social Security benefits by redeeming Treasury securities held by the trust funds. The Social Security program is projected to run a cash deficit through the 75-year forecast period, with tax revenues projected to be less than benefit payments and administration costs. To manage cash flows, Treasury redeems long-term government securities held by the trust funds, while Social Security invests in non-marketable, short-term and long-term government securities to maximize interest earnings. In June of each year, Social Security invests in long-term government securities with excess funds from maturing trust fund securities. In 2011 and 2012, general revenues were used due to a temporary reduction in the Social Security payroll tax. Trust Funds amounts equal to the reduction in payroll tax revenues were transferred from the General Fund as specified in P.L. 111-312. Congress passed H.R. 3765 and P.L. 112-78 to extend the payroll tax reduction and general revenue transfers through February 2012. Subsequently, H.R. 3630, signed into law as P.L. 112-96, further extended the payroll tax reduction and general revenue transfers through the end of calendar year 2012. Depending on future debt limit crises and Treasury decisions, Social Security may be impacted. Depending on future debt limit crises and Treasury decisions, Social Security Trust Fund investment management procedures and benefit payments could be affected. Treasury obligations cannot be issued to the Trust Funds if it would exceed the debt limit, potentially accelerating depletion of the Trust Funds and moving up the expected insolvency date. Treasury may need to issue new public debt to pay benefits, but may be unable to do so in certain circumstances. If Treasury is unable to issue new public debt due to the debt limit, Social Security benefit payments may be delayed or at risk."
