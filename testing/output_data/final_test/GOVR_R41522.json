Repsol, a Spain-based company, plans to start drilling in early 2012. Other government-owned national oil companies are also considering offshore drilling in Cuban waters. This development raises concerns for U.S. policy on oil spill risks and cooperation with Cuba in case of a major spill, especially after the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. The heightened concerns about oil spill risks in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have raised the potential for U.S.-Cuban engagement regarding a potential oil spill in Cuban waters. However, addressing these concerns is complicated by longstanding U.S. policy to isolate communist Cuba. This report examines Cuba's oil sector, including current production and consumption levels, offshore development projects, and the outlook for Cuba's offshore oil production. Considerations for the United States include oil spill risks, environmental dangers, disaster coordination with Cuba, and the debate over broader U.S. involvement in Cuba's offshore oil development. Cuba has proven oil reserves of 0.1 billion barrels and natural gas reserves of 2.5 trillion cubic feet, located on shore or near shore. The USGS estimates the offshore North Cuba Basin could hold an additional 4.6 billion barrels of crude oil resources and 0.9 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. Legislative initiatives have been proposed to address Cuba's offshore oil development. Cuba has potential offshore oil resources in the North Cuba Foreland Basin, estimated at 5 to 9 billion barrels. The country currently produces 51 thousand barrels of oil per day from onshore fields, mostly heavy, sour crude. Cuban officials terminated a lease with Canadian companies for near-shore assets in 2009. Cuba's domestic oil consumption decreased to 165 Kb/d in 2009 from 225 Kb/d two decades ago. Cuba's oil production decreased to 51 Kb/d from 225 Kb/d two decades ago. Most of the oil is used for power generation, with net imports of 114 Kb/d from Venezuela. Cuba compensates Venezuela with medical and education services. Cuba has 300 Kb/d of crude refining capability, with limited complex capacity. Cuba has limited capacity to process heavy sour crudes it produces, with a significant amount of oil burned directly for power generation. Roughly 60% of imports are refined products, with the rest being crude oil. Venezuela's PdVSA is helping Cuba's Cupet expand and upgrade refining capacity, including the Cienfuegos refinery and planned renovations at the Hermanos Diaz refinery and a new refinery at the port of Matanzas. Expansion efforts may increase Cuba's processing capabilities. Repsol YPF, a Spanish oil company, is set to drill an offshore exploratory well in Cuba's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in early 2012. The project, known as the Jag\u00fcey prospect, is located about 55 to 60 miles south of Key West, Florida. This venture is part of Repsol's efforts in offshore exploration in Cuba, with previous drilling in 2004 yielding petroleum resources deemed commercially insufficient. Repsol leads a consortium with Norway's NOC, Statoil, and India's NOC, ONGC, with a 40% stake in the project. Repsol, Statoil, and ONGC form a consortium with rights to six exploration blocks off Cuba's northern shore. Repsol awaits the arrival of offshore oil rig Scarabeo-9 for exploratory drilling. The rig, built in China, is expected to arrive in Cuba in late December 2011 or early January 2012. Repsol's offshore oil rig Scarabeo-9 is set to arrive in Cuba in late December 2011 or early January 2012. The rig will drill one exploratory well for Repsol and potentially additional wells for other companies with Cuban offshore exploration licenses. Cuban officials plan for a total of five wells to be drilled, with other foreign state-owned companies also conducting seismic surveys and preparing for exploratory drilling. Several state-owned companies, including Brazil, Russia, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Venezuela, have made loans to Cuba for infrastructure and energy development. ONGC and Petronas have contracts for blocks in Cuba, with ONGC potentially moving towards exploratory drilling. Petronas has partnered with Gazprom for drilling in 2012, while PetroVietnam holds contracts for offshore blocks. Zarubezhneft may partner with PetroVietnam for onshore blocks. PdVSA is also involved in Cuba's energy sector. Several state-owned companies, including Brazil, Russia, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Venezuela, have made loans to Cuba for infrastructure and energy development. ONGC and Petronas have contracts for blocks in Cuba, with ONGC potentially moving towards exploratory drilling. Petrobras, Brazil's NOC, had signed an agreement in 2008 for offshore block N37, off Cuba's northern coast, but decided to relinquish its contract in March 2011 to focus on oil prospects in Brazil. CNPC is in negotiations for Cuban offshore blocks and is helping Cuba refurbish its Cienfuegos refinery. Repsol and others are conducting exploratory drilling in the region. Repsol and other companies are conducting exploratory drilling in Cuba to assess oil prospects. If oil is found, production could be delayed due to various factors, including U.S. sanctions. Analysts believe that any increase in Cuban oil production will be small compared to the global market. Cuba may eventually become an oil exporter, but production growth will be slow. Some analysts speculate that Cuba could potentially produce enough oil to become an exporter, but uncertainties remain regarding production start date and rate. Cuba would need to offset current oil imports before becoming a net exporter, and domestic demand may increase with economic growth. Cuba is likely to trade more oil as refining capacity grows, but the net trade balance may not shift significantly. Lower import needs could reduce dependence on Venezuelan imports. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico raised concerns about potential oil spills in Cuban waters affecting Florida's coastal areas. Repsol's drilling plans in Cuba are close to Key West, Florida, posing a risk of environmental impacts in the U.S. The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement enforces safety regulations on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, including oil spill response. Several statutes like the Clean Water Act and Oil Pollution Act govern oil spill prevention and response. Cuban officials are developing regulations to prevent offshore drilling accidents and have pledged to follow international safety standards. They are willing to cooperate with the United States on safety measures, but regulations may not always prevent oil spills, as seen in the Gulf of Mexico. The largest cause of oil spills is blowouts at offshore platforms, as seen in the Deepwater Horizon and Ixtoc oil spills. It is hard to predict the likelihood of a spill, but measures are being taken to prevent them, such as building rigs to Norwegian standards. Repsol, Statoil, Petronas, ONGC, and PetroVietnam have offshore experience in Cuba. PdVSA lacks offshore experience. Cuban officials are implementing safety practices from the UK and US. Oil spills in Cuban waters could reach US waters via the Florida Straits. Oil spills in Cuban waters could potentially impact U.S. waters and coastal areas in southern and southeastern Florida. The environmental impact would depend on various factors such as the size and location of the spill, ocean conditions, wind direction, temperature, type of oil spilled, and cleanup efforts. It is difficult to predict the exact impact due to the many variables involved. Weathering of the oil spill over time would also affect its dispersal and how much reaches the U.S. coast. The nature and impact of an oil spill depend on factors like weathering, oil viscosity, evaporation rate, and cleanup efforts. Various processes like oxidation, biodegradation, and interaction with sediments contribute to the changing character of the spill over time. The extent of cleanup activities can influence the persistence of the spill in the environment. A faster and more expansive cleanup effort may limit damage to the environment. If significant quantities of oil reach U.S. waters, risks to marine and coastal resources of Southern Florida, including the vulnerable Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, could be of particular concern. The region provides recreational, commercial, and ecological benefits to local communities and the nation. The densely populated areas of Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach are also at risk. The Florida Keys and adjacent areas have diverse marine systems, including the extensive living coral reef. These ecosystems provide habitats for many marine animals, protect against erosion and flooding, and are at risk from oil spills, which can have long-lasting impacts on organisms and populations. Exposure to oil spills can harm organisms and ecosystems, especially vulnerable habitats like coral reefs and mangrove swamps. Chronic exposure from continuous oil releases can impact marine life, birds, and mammals. Southern Florida's natural resources are closely tied to its economy, supporting tourism and fishing industries. The Deepwater Horizon spill highlighted the devastating effects of oil spills. The Deepwater Horizon spill in 2008 cost around $65 billion and showed the negative impact of oil spills on the tourism industry. There is increased interest in oil spill preparedness and coordination between Cuba and the United States. The Obama Administration is preparing for potential oil spills in Cuban waters that could affect the United States. Some groups advocate for U.S.-Cuban engagement on the issue, while others suggest preventing Cuba from offshore oil exploration. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) have been working with various agencies to enhance area contingency plans for potential oil spills along the U.S. coasts. The Coast Guard's Seventh District in Miami has been developing an International Offshore Drilling Response Plan since March 2011, including hosting a table-top exercise in November 2011. U.S. agencies have engaged with Repsol to gather information on their drilling and oil spill response plans. Repsol has offered U.S. agencies the opportunity to inspect the Scarabeo-9 oil rig before it enters Cuban waters. The company assures adherence to U.S. regulations and industry standards for exploratory drilling in Cuban waters. Analysts suggest formal U.S.-Cuban cooperation to minimize potential oil spill damage, as both countries lack a bilateral agreement on oil spills. Some analysts urge the Administration to amend regulations to allow transfer of equipment and personnel for oil spill response in Cuba. Foreign oil companies in Cuba need full access to technology and personnel to prevent spills. U.S. embargo forces drillers to use second-hand equipment. U.S. oil spill mitigation companies can be licensed to provide support in Cuba. The United States expects foreign oil companies in Cuba to have safeguards and contingency plans for oil spills. Clean Caribbean & Americas assists with spill response, storing equipment in Fort Lauderdale. For Tier 1 spills, companies maintain their own capabilities; for Tier 2 spills, near shore operators and the Cuban government provide equipment. Clean Caribbean & Americas assists with spill response for Tier 2 spills, where near shore oil operators and the Cuban government supply equipment. For larger Tier 3 spills, international assistance is required, with CCA moving equipment into Cuba. This arrangement has developed over the past 30 years, with drills and exercises involving Cuban and U.S. agencies to enhance preparedness. CCA's President, Paul Schuler, mentioned joint development of Repsol's oil spill contingency plan with Oil Spill Response Ltd, which has no restrictions on sending equipment and personnel to Cuba. According to Schuler, the Scarabeo-9 will have Tier 1 equipment on site for rapid response, while ORSL is sending equipment to Cuba for Tier 2 spill reinforcement. In the event of a Tier 3 spill, CCA and OSRL would mobilize resources if needed. Schuler encouraged loosening the licensing process for more U.S. companies to provide resources. CCA is currently the only U.S. company licensed to export oil spill response equipment to Cuba. In 2010, the IADC was granted a license to travel to Cuba for discussions on safety and environmental hazards. The Cubans are willing to collaborate with U.S. industry for safer drilling. In 2011, IADC sponsored a conference in Trinidad and Tobago focusing on improving oil industry environmental practices, including a panel on Cuba's offshore drilling. Wild Well Control, a Houston-based company, received a U.S. license in 2011 to provide specialists for blowouts in Cuba waters and is seeking approval for firefighting equipment and well capping technology. The Department of Commerce is reviewing applications for oil spill containment and cleanup equipment. Helix Energy Solutions Group applied for U.S. licenses to export a capping stack to Cuban waters. U.S. cooperation with Mexico on oil spills could be a model for disaster preparedness with Cuba. The Mexus Plan, a joint contingency plan between the U.S. and Mexico, outlines procedures for responding to pollution incidents in the border zone. It involves coordination between federal and state agencies, forming joint response teams, and logistics planning. The U.S. Coast Guard leads the response team. This cooperation model could be used for engaging with Cuba on oil spill contingency planning. Cooperation between the U.S. and Cuba on oil spill preparedness would involve negotiating an agreement and developing a joint contingency plan. The U.S. Coast Guard would likely lead coordination efforts, building on existing cooperation with Cuba on migration and drug trafficking issues. Regular meetings and exercises would help maintain the joint plan, following the Mexus Plan model used with Mexico. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill recommended this collaboration due to Mexico's drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Cuba's interest in offshore drilling. Negotiating with Mexico and Cuba for common drilling standards and spill response protocols is in U.S. national interest. Bahamas should also be included in cooperation efforts due to its potential for deepwater drilling. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses this issue. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress, S. 405 (Nelson), requires the Secretary of the Interior to develop oil spill response plans for spills in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including a joint contingency plan with Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas. This is in line with multilateral agreements signed by Cuba and the United States to prepare for and cooperate on oil spills, such as the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation (OPRC). The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation requires parties to establish measures for dealing with pollution incidents. The IMO plays a central role in providing information services, education, and training. Both Cuba and the United States are parties to the Cartagena Convention, which includes a Protocol Concerning Co-operation in Combating Oil Spills in the Wider Caribbean Region. The Cartagena Agreement and the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness emphasize the need for bilateral or multilateral arrangements to combat oil spills. Parties are obligated to assist each other in response to incidents. The IMO's Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Information and Training Center in Cura\u00e7ao supports the Cartagena Agreement's protocol on oil spill cooperation in the Caribbean. The Cartagena Agreement and OPRC emphasize the importance of bilateral or multilateral arrangements to combat oil spills. The IMO's regional center in Curacao supports this protocol by providing technical services, training, and information sharing. Recommendations were made for Cuba to improve its oil spill response, including developing a training plan and increasing cooperation with the IMO's regional training center in Cura\u00e7ao. US officials will participate in a regional seminar focusing on pollution related to offshore oil exploration. The IMO-sponsored seminar focuses on pollution related to offshore oil exploration. Officials from Cuba, the Bahamas, Mexico, and Jamaica will participate in the seminar titled \"Regional OPRC Seminar on National Plans for Marine Pollution Preparedness and Response Related to Offshore Units and Regional Cooperation.\" BSEE Director Bromwich stated that the seminar will allow countries to learn about each other's emergency well control and oil spill response plans. The US has imposed economic sanctions on Cuba since the 1960s, prohibiting most financial transactions, including US investment in Cuba's offshore energy sector. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) prohibit U.S. investment in Cuba's offshore energy sector. The CACR, issued in 1963, impose economic sanctions against Cuba, including restrictions on financial transactions. The Cuban embargo, codified by the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, remains in force today. The executive branch cannot lift the embargo until certain democratic conditions are met. The CACR allows for modifications to the embargo restrictions by the executive branch. The executive branch can modify embargo restrictions, but cannot suspend or terminate them without a transition government in Cuba. Some groups want U.S. oil companies involved in Cuba's offshore oil development. Legislative initiatives were introduced in Congress to authorize such activities. U.S. involvement in Cuba's energy sector is seen as preventing foreign competitors from dominating the market. Several reasons for U.S. involvement in Cuba's offshore development include reducing Cuba's dependence on Venezuela for oil imports, increasing U.S. influence in the country, utilizing U.S. expertise for safe development, and ensuring higher transparency standards. However, some policy groups and Members of Congress oppose engagement with Cuba, including U.S. investment in offshore energy development. The legislative initiative H.R. 5620 aimed to impose visa restrictions and economic sanctions on foreign companies involved in Cuba's offshore energy development due to concerns about economic and environmental threats to the United States. Critics argue that supporting Cuba's oil development could prolong the communist regime by providing economic benefits and reducing pressure for market-oriented reforms. Some oppose U.S. involvement in Cuba's energy development, citing the time it will take to develop offshore oil. The Cuban government is using potential oil profits to break the U.S. economic embargo. Boundary issues exist in the Straits of Florida and eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as in the undelineated eastern gap area claimed by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. The 1977 maritime boundary agreement between Cuba and the United States aimed to establish a limit for fisheries and continental shelf activities. Despite being submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification in 1979, it has not been ratified due to political relations between the two countries. The 1977 maritime boundary agreement between Cuba and the United States has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Despite objections, diplomatic notes have extended the provisional application of the agreement every two years. The most recent exchange of notes was in May 2010, with an effective date of January 5, 2010. The agreement falls under the President's authority to establish boundaries, pending Senate consideration. Some Members of Congress have called for rescinding the provisional application, citing concerns about Cuba's offshore oil activities. The 1977 maritime boundary agreement between Cuba and the United States has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Despite objections, diplomatic notes have extended the provisional application of the agreement every two years. According to then-National Security Adviser James Jones in late September 2010, withdrawal from the agreement would have no discernible effect on the Cuban government and could create further boundary claim disputes for the United States. The eastern gap in the Gulf of Mexico could potentially hold large amounts of oil, but there is little hard data to confirm this. The demarcation of the area is open for negotiations among the three countries, but will likely await an improvement in relations between Cuba and the United States. In 2000, a treaty was signed between the United States and Mexico for a western gap in the Gulf of Mexico. Cuba, Mexico, and the United States are involved in negotiations regarding the eastern gap. Legislative initiatives in Congress focused on U.S. investment in Cuba's offshore energy development and imposing sanctions on those aiding Cuba's offshore petroleum resources. In the 112th Congress, legislative initiatives introduced different approaches to Cuba's offshore oil development, including sanctions on companies involved in Cuba's offshore oil development and requirements for companies conducting hydrocarbon operations off the coast of Cuba. In the 112th Congress, legislative initiatives introduced different approaches to Cuba's offshore oil development, including sanctions on companies involved in Cuba's offshore oil development and requirements for companies conducting hydrocarbon operations off the coast of Cuba. In the 111th Congress, there were contrasting policy approaches towards Cuba's offshore oil reserves, with one approach allowing U.S. involvement in Cuba's oil sector and another imposing sanctions on foreign entities assisting in Cuba's petroleum development. Bills such as S. 774, H.R. 1918, and S. 1517 aimed to authorize U.S. companies to work with Cuba for oil exploration and extraction. In the 111th Congress, legislative initiatives proposed different approaches to Cuba's offshore oil development. H.R. 1918 sought to amend the TSRA to allow travel for hydrocarbon activities and importation of resources from Cuba. Other bills aimed to lift economic sanctions on Cuba, enabling U.S. investment in the energy sector. In contrast, H.R. 5620 would have imposed sanctions on foreign nationals aiding Cuba's petroleum development. The bill proposed in the 112th Congress aimed to exclude certain aliens who invested in Cuba's offshore petroleum resources from the United States. Sanctions would be imposed if investments of $1 million or more contributed to Cuba's oil development. The President would have to propose sanctions if such investments were made. Interest in Cuba's offshore oil development has continued in the 112th Congress with foreign oil companies moving forward with exploratory drilling. Five legislative initiatives have been introduced, including H.R. 372 (Buchanan), which aims to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to deny oil and gas leases to persons engaging with sanctioned foreign countries like Cuba. The legislation is intended to deter companies from involvement in Cuba's oil development, potentially impacting U.S. companies as well. The Gulf Stream Protection Act of 2011, introduced by Bill Nelson, would require companies conducting oil or gas operations off the coasts of Cuba to submit an oil response plan and demonstrate sufficient resources to respond to a worst-case scenario if they want to lease drilling rights in the United States. The bill also mandates the Secretary of the Interior to conduct an oil spill risk analysis and planning process for development. The Secretary of the Interior is required to carry out an oil spill risk analysis and planning process for non-domestic oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico. Recommendations for a joint contingency plan with Mexico, Cuba, and the Bahamas are to be included. H.R. 2047, the Caribbean Coral Reef Protection Act of 2011, imposes visa restrictions and economic sanctions on companies aiding Cuba's offshore petroleum development. The bills H.R. 3393 and S. 1836 aim to enhance Cuba's ability to develop offshore oil resources and clarify the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 regarding foreign oil spills beyond the U.S. exclusive economic zone. H.R. 3393 proposes increased liability limits for spills involving countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, while S. 1836 suggests no changes to liability limits. H.R. 3393 and S. 1836 propose amendments to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 regarding foreign oil spills. S. 1836 removes the liability cap for incidents involving foreign offshore units, while H.R. 3393 subjects owners of foreign offshore oil units to civil penalties for discharges reaching U.S. waters. Two congressional oversight hearings in the 112th Congress discussed Cuba's offshore oil development in relation to the United States. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee held hearings on Outer Continental Oil Spill Response Capabilities and North American offshore energy, respectively. Witnesses included officials from the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of the Interior, Florida International University, and Clean Caribbean & Americas. Concern over Cuba's offshore oil development is likely to continue, especially if exploratory drilling begins as anticipated in early 2012. An oil spill in Cuban waters could potentially affect U.S. waters and coastal areas in Florida, threatening marine and coastal resources. The U.S. government has licensed companies to provide oil spill prevention and containment support to those operating in Cuba and is reviewing additional licenses. U.S. officials have engaged with Repsol and will inspect the oil rig before it enters Cuban waters. Policymakers may need to consider U.S.-Cuban government engagement to enhance preparedness and response in case of an oil spill. Government engagement is necessary for preparedness and response in case of a major spill related to Cuba's offshore development, with legislative initiatives in the 112th Congress reflecting different approaches."
