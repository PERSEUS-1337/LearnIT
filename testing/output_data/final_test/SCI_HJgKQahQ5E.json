    "content": "Goal recognition is inferring the correct goal of an agent executing a plan, using goal hypotheses, a domain model, and plan samples. Recent advancements in operator-counting heuristics from classical planning problems have improved goal recognition algorithms. Our approach uses operator-counting constraints to infer goals efficiently for autonomous agents, especially in complex environments with multiple agents. Accurately identifying goals and plans is crucial for explaining observed behavior. Goal recognition involves inferring goals from observations, initial state, goal state, and agent behavior model. Recent approaches to goal recognition in autonomous agents leverage data structures and heuristics from classical planning domains to improve efficiency and accuracy. These methods use planning landmarks to recognize goals in various domains with different levels of observability and noise. However, dealing with noise explicitly remains a challenge, as the approach relies on the necessity of landmarks in valid plans for accurate goal recognition. Goal recognition in the presence of noisy observation is addressed by leveraging operator-counting heuristics for efficient and accurate recognition. Three increasingly accurate approaches are developed, showing effectiveness in differentiating goal hypotheses. The text discusses the effectiveness of operator-counting heuristics for goal recognition in noisy settings, emphasizing their superiority in accuracy and handling noise. It also introduces a broad class of operator-counting constraints for finer noise handling and reviews the background of the approaches used in the paper. The curr_chunk discusses n-ary predicate symbols, facts, states, and operators in the context of logical values and inference. It defines operators as triples with descriptions, preconditions, and effects. The curr_chunk explains the planning domain and instance definitions, including the domain knowledge, initial state, goal state, and plans for achieving the goal state. A plan is a sequence of actions that transforms a state into a goal state. An optimal plan is the shortest one possible. Goal recognition involves identifying the correct goal of an agent based on a sequence of observations. A goal recognition problem involves identifying the correct hidden goal of an agent based on an observation sequence of executed actions. Solutions to this problem are nonempty subsets of possible goals consistent with the observations. Recent work on linear programming has produced efficient heuristics for optimal-cost planning. Efficient heuristics for optimal-cost planning rely on constraints from different sources of information that every plan must satisfy. The constraints include operator-counting constraints with variables for each operator in the plan. Three types of constraints used for goal recognition approaches are landmarks, state-equations, and post-hoc optimization. Planning landmarks are necessary conditions for all valid plans towards a goal and are used in admissible heuristics and goal recognition algorithms. Disjunctive action landmarks are sets of actions where at least one must be true for any plan, providing operator-counting constraints. Net change constraints generalize state equation heuristics and relate planning instances with Petri nets representing state variable transitions induced by actions. Post-hoc optimization constraints use heuristics to rule out unnecessary operators from plans based on state variable transitions. For example, Pattern Database (PDBs) heuristics create projections of planning tasks into subsets of state variables, categorizing operators as contributing or non-contributing to state changes. Post-hoc optimization constraints use heuristics to eliminate unnecessary operators from plans based on state variable transitions. Operator-counting heuristics are developed for goal recognition, ranging from basic operator counts to accounting for noise in heuristic values. The heuristic values generated by landmarks, post-hoc optimization, and net change constraints provide important information for goal recognition. These values indicate the optimal distance between the initial state and candidate goals, as well as possible operators in a valid plan. This information can be used to account for observations by computing the overlap between goals and observations. Algorithm 1 utilizes operator counts to recognize goals by comparing them with observed actions. It ranks goal hypotheses based on the overlap between operator counts and observations. This technique is similar to the Goal Completion heuristic of BID2 but has some limitations. The initial approach to goal recognition using observation-constrained operator counts has shortcomings. The overlap computation loses the ordering of landmarks used by the Goal Completion heuristic. Operator-counting heuristics are fast but may not correspond to the plan that generated the observations. The initial approach to goal recognition using observation-constrained operator counts has shortcomings related to the overlap computation and operator-counting heuristics. To address this, additional constraints are introduced into the LP to compute operator counts, forcing the heuristic to consider operator counts that include every observation. This Observation Constraint Enforcement approach minimizes the cost of operator counts for plans that align with all observations. Enforcement approach in Algorithm 2 involves generating constraints for operator-counting heuristic to ensure operator counts for each observation are greater than one. The goal hypotheses chosen minimize operator count heuristic distance from initial state. However, this approach may overestimate plan length by considering all observations as valid operators. The LP minimization in goal recognition may overestimate plan length due to noise, hindering actual goal selection. This overestimation dominates the operator counting heuristic, as shown in Proposition 1. Proposition 1 states that the overconstrained heuristic h C dominates the operator-counting heuristic h in estimating plan length, ensuring that the solution to C h C is not larger than the solution to C h. This is because h C considers all observations, including noise, while h only estimates the total cost of an optimal plan. The approach involves computing the difference between h C and h to determine the correct goal hypothesis. This is formalized in Algorithm 3, where h \u03b4 is calculated using two LP computations. The algorithm then returns goal hypotheses that minimize h \u03b4. The effectiveness of the approaches was evaluated by implementing them on a large dataset introduced by BID2. The study implemented goal recognition algorithms on a large dataset introduced by BID2, using PYTHON 2.7 and a customized version of the FAST-DOWNWARD planning system. Experiments were conducted on a 24 core Intel Xeon CPU with 48GB of RAM, showing results for partially observable and noisy fragments of the dataset. Our h \u03b4 approach shows competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing methods in various domains, with consistently lower spread of resulting goals. The computational cost is often smaller than other approaches, regardless of observability levels and noise. Our technique shows consistent accuracy across domains, with lower spread of goals. The h \u03b4 approach incurs overhead in the FAST-DOWNWARD pre-processing step. Results for noisy observations demonstrate higher accuracy and lower spread. In the KITCHEN domain, our approaches consistently underperform, regardless of observability levels. Our work focuses on goal and plan recognition in various domains. We found that more observations lead to worse performance in a specific domain, especially under noisy conditions. This issue seems to be inherent to the domain itself rather than the algorithm's ability to handle noise. Our approach is compared to traditional goal recognition models, with higher accuracy achieved in our settings. Recent research on goal recognition has focused on dealing with partial observability and noisy observations. Three key contributions include BID1's approach using a planning graph to estimate goal probabilities, BID3's approach explicitly handling noisy data, and our approach achieving higher accuracy in goal recognition compared to traditional models. The approach discussed involves a probabilistic interpretation and addresses noisy observations by compiling the recognition problem into a planning problem. BID2 also develops heuristic goal recognition approaches using landmark information, which is conceptually similar to the approach discussed. The novel class goal recognition technique is based on operator-counting heuristics from classical planning. The approach discussed involves using ILP constraints to estimate operators in optimal plans for goal recognition. The techniques show high accuracy and low false positive rates at a moderate computational cost. The operator-counting constraints can be used to explain recognized goals. Future work may focus on refining constraints for improved accuracy and exploring probabilistic approaches using operator-counting.
