    "content": "Consumer finance is crucial for Americans seeking economic advancement and wealth building. Safe and affordable financial services help households avoid financial hardship and achieve financial security. Most households rely on credit, with mortgage debt being the largest type of household debt. Student loans are the second-largest type of debt. Consumer finance markets, including mortgage lending, student loans, auto loans, credit cards, payday loans, and checking accounts, are discussed in detail in this report. The focus is on consumer and household perspectives, as well as consumer protection policy issues. The report also covers the consumer credit reporting system and debt collection market structures. The report provides an overview of U.S. household finances, consumer finance markets, and policy issues. It explains how consumer financial decisions impact households' financial well-being and discusses the consumer credit reporting system and debt collection market. The curr_chunk provides an overview of consumer financial markets, policy interventions, and the role of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. It explains the components of a household's balance sheet, including assets (liquid and illiquid wealth) and debts, to calculate net worth. The curr_chunk explains key components of a household's financial balance sheet, including assets, debts, net worth, income, consumption, savings, and borrowing. It highlights the importance of managing these factors to increase wealth and reduce debts over time. The curr_chunk emphasizes the significance of all components of a household balance sheet in understanding financial experiences over time. It illustrates how lower income or lack of savings can lead to difficulties during financial shocks. Household income and net worth in the United States are unevenly distributed, with disparities between the bottom 20% and top 10% of households. The distribution of household income and net worth in the United States varies significantly, with the top 10% having high income and net worth levels. This disparity is influenced by factors like age, household size, and financial decisions. The report focuses on household borrowing, particularly on consumer financial products like mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans, which enable households to borrow and make payments to build assets or withstand financial shocks. Households can use credit for investments like mortgages for assets that appreciate over time or student loans for education to increase future income. Credit can also help with consumption smoothing by allowing households to use future income now, such as recent graduates using credit cards before starting new jobs. Additionally, credit can be used for financial emergencies like car repairs or medical expenses. Consumer financial markets are unique and governed by various laws. Consumers often act similarly when making financial decisions, while firms aim to attract consumers and make profits. Government interventions and regulations are based on similar factors across markets. Mainstream economic theory suggests that competitive free markets lead to efficient distributions of goods and services. Each market moves towards an efficient price to maximize value for society. The theory suggests that markets move towards an efficient price where supply and demand are balanced. If consumers demand credit products, lenders will provide them until it's no longer excessively profitable. Policy interventions may not improve financial decisions made by consumers. Policymakers are hesitant to disrupt free markets, believing market forces lead to efficient outcomes. The life-cycle model assumes households typically act in a certain way. The life-cycle model in economics assumes households aim to maintain stable consumption levels and lifestyles over time by saving and investing during their careers. Wealth typically increases as households age, but income and wealth inequality persist even when accounting for age. While the model generally aligns with household data in the United States, there are instances where it does not accurately reflect household behavior. The NBER working paper on behavioral household finance highlights three key facts about U.S. household balance sheets: close correlation between income and consumption, low levels of liquid wealth and high credit card borrowing, and wealth primarily in illiquid assets like home equity. These patterns challenge the traditional life-cycle model and underscore the importance of affordable credit and robust financial markets for many U.S. households. Many U.S. households rely on affordable credit and strong consumer financial markets for short-term needs and long-term wealth building. Market failures can occur when there is imperfect information and behavioral biases, leading to reduced economic efficiency and consumer welfare. Government intervention may be necessary to correct these failures and maximize social welfare. Market failures in consumer credit markets are often due to imperfect information, where one party has more accurate information than the other. This can lead to inefficient outcomes, such as consumers choosing suboptimal mortgage loans due to hidden or confusing costs. Information asymmetry can hinder consumers from finding the best loan terms for their personal situations. The mortgage market may not lead to efficient outcomes, potentially costing consumers more and dissuading some from entering. Information asymmetries can make it hard for lenders to estimate default risk. The credit reporting industry aims to provide more accurate consumer information for efficient credit markets. Behavioral research suggests humans have predictable biases in decision-making. Research suggests that the human brain has evolved to make judgments using mental shortcuts, known as heuristics. These heuristics can sometimes lead to financial decisions that make the decisionmaker worse off. In consumer finance markets, biases such as Choice Architecture play a significant role in influencing consumer decision-making. For example, how financial decisions are framed can impact choices, as seen in studies where subjects were anchored by an initial number when making subsequent guesses. The first stage subconsciously influenced subjects' guesses in the second stage. Decision-making biases like defaults, loss aversion, present bias, and scarcity impact consumer choices. Loss aversion leads people to respond more strongly to potential losses than gains. Present bias causes individuals to value immediate rewards over future benefits. Self-control and procrastination can hinder long-term financial planning. Consumers' financial decisions can be influenced by biases like self-control, procrastination, scarcity mindset, and cognitive limitations. These factors can lead to flawed decision-making, such as focusing on immediate needs over long-term goals and struggling with maintaining self-control throughout the day. Additionally, mental accounting biases, like allocating money into different mental accounts, can impact budgeting decisions. ( Mental accounting ) - Households use mental accounts to allocate money for different purposes, leading to biased consumption decisions. Despite money being fungible, spending in one category is often treated as separate from others. This simplifies budgeting but can result in overspending due to neglecting unusual expenses. These biases are important as firms can exploit them to attract consumers through choice architecture. Choice architecture biases in consumer finance can be exploited by firms to attract consumers by emphasizing certain terms in marketing materials. Product features are designed to take advantage of people's present bias, scarcity mindset, and mental accounting mistakes. Government policy interventions aim to address market failures like information asymmetry and behavioral biases. Standardized consumer disclosures are a common intervention to provide consumers with more information about costs and terms before taking out a financial product. Standardized consumer disclosures, mandated by laws like the Truth in Lending Act and Truth in Savings Act, aim to reduce asymmetric information market failures and address choice architecture biases in consumer finance. These disclosures provide consumers with information about costs and terms before taking out a financial product, helping them make informed decisions and shop for the best terms. Laws also protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in the financial market. Consumer protection laws prohibit unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts in financial markets, including discrimination in credit transactions based on borrower characteristics. Laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act aim to prevent intentional or disparate impact discrimination. The effects of new laws on market efficiency are crucial considerations. Consumer financial markets are impacted by new policies, which can have unintended effects if all potential impacts are not considered. Policy formulations should consider the effects on consumer decision-making, household well-being, and how these effects may vary across the population. For example, a new disclosure policy may improve consumer comprehension but not decision-making, affecting only a subset of consumers susceptible to deceptive practices. New policy formulation should consider the cost for firms, market competitiveness, consumer prices, and financial product availability. Compliance with regulations may increase costs for firms, leading to higher prices and reduced choice for consumers. This can result in consumers seeking credit products outside of the market or limiting their access to credit. The 2008 financial crisis was partly caused by lenders relaxing underwriting standards. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to enforce consumer financial laws, promote fair markets, and provide financial education. It consolidated consumer finance responsibilities and granted new authorities to the CFPB, including regulating providers of various financial products and services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has authority over a wide range of financial products and services, such as deposit taking, mortgages, credit cards, and loan servicing. Its powers include rulemaking, supervision of financial institutions, and enforcement of consumer protection laws. The CFPB can prescribe regulations for 19 federal consumer protection laws and has broad jurisdiction, although there are exceptions and limitations under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under Dodd-Frank has the authority to regulate a wide range of consumer financial services. The CFPB can issue rules to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in the financial industry. The CFPB's regulatory power varies based on factors like institution size and charter status. The CFPB is led by a director appointed by the President for a five-year term and operates independently within the Federal Reserve System. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can overturn CFPB rules with a two-thirds vote. The Financial Stability Oversight Council can overturn a CFPB rule with a two-thirds vote. The CFPB is funded through the Fed's earnings, with a funding cap of $663 million for FY2018. The CFPB regulates various consumer debt markets, including mortgage lending, student loans, automobile loans, credit cards, payday loans, and checking accounts. Each section discusses market developments and policy issues affecting efficiency. A mortgage loan is a loan collateralized by a house and its land, typically used by consumers to purchase or refinance a home. These loans are usually first liens, with fixed interest rates and installment payments over 15 or 30 years. Market developments and policy issues affecting efficiency in the mortgage lending market are discussed, focusing on consumer protection. Households purchasing a new home typically need to make a down payment, usually less than 20% of the home's value, to secure a mortgage loan. If the down payment is insufficient, additional insurance may be required. Consumers can also opt for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a second lien mortgage for various purposes, such as home renovations. Homeownership is a significant way for households to build wealth over time, with mortgage loans being the largest consumer credit market in the US. Despite the benefits like tax deductions, fluctuating home prices can make it a risky investment, especially for short-term homeowners. The 2008 financial crisis was caused by a housing price bubble, leading to reforms in the mortgage market through Dodd-Frank. This aimed to strengthen underwriting standards and improve mortgage disclosure forms. Lenders tightened standards post-crisis, making it harder for some borrowers to qualify for loans. During the mortgage market recovery, concerns arise about balancing prudent underwriting with credit access for borrowers. Risky mortgage features like teaser rates have decreased, but underwriting regulations may favor certain borrowers. Consumers often do not shop for better mortgage rates despite market price differences. The CFPB highlights the importance of shopping for advantageous mortgage interest rates to save thousands of dollars. House price affordability is a policy issue, especially in high-cost metropolitan areas where prices have risen rapidly. The national homeownership rate has declined, raising concerns among policymakers. Student loans help students and families pay for postsecondary education expenses. Student loans help students and families pay for postsecondary education expenses. Student loan debt has more than doubled in the past decade, making it the second-largest category of consumer debt after mortgage debt. The average amount of student loan debt for a bachelor's degree recipient is $28,500. Most student loans are originated and owned by the federal government, with limited underwriting of creditworthiness. The Department of Education manages federal student loan programs, while Congress sets interest rates and loan terms annually. The CFPB regulates private student loan lending and servicing, and debates continue on its role in federal student loan industry oversight. Consumer groups push for more CFPB enforcement in federal loan servicing. Some concerns in the student loan market include managing debt after graduation, non-dischargeability in bankruptcy, and efforts to make repayment terms more flexible. This includes options for income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs, especially for borrowers in public service occupations. In recent years, student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been developed and expanded, particularly for borrowers in public service occupations. Issues with payment processing, billing, customer service, and borrower communication have been uncovered, making it challenging for borrowers to understand their options and qualify for forgiveness or repayment programs. Questions have also been raised about student loan availability and whether loans should be limited to certain educational programs that lead to quality employment. Limited information on program quality and student employment outcomes after graduation further complicates decision-making for students. Limited information on program quality and student employment outcomes after graduation can make it difficult for students to make good financial decisions for their future careers. Questions also exist about the impact of student loan access on tuition prices and the larger economy. Researchers debate the effects of student loan debt on future macroeconomic performance, including career choice, family formation, home ownership, and retirement savings. Auto loans allow consumers to finance the cost of a new or used car through fixed monthly payments for a set time period. Auto loans involve fixed monthly payments for a set period, typically three to seven years, with a down payment required. The loans are secured by the vehicle, allowing lenders to repossess the car if payments are not made. In 2018, 113 million Americans had auto loans totaling $1.3 trillion, with longer loan terms becoming more common due to rising vehicle costs. Most auto loans are arranged at the dealership through indirect auto financing. Indirect auto financing involves the auto dealer forwarding borrower information to lenders for potential financing offers. Dealers are compensated through a markup on the interest rate, capped by lenders to prevent defaults. Consumers can negotiate the interest rate with dealers or go directly to lenders to avoid markup costs. In indirect auto financing, the auto dealer may negotiate a higher interest rate with the consumer to profit from the lender's markup arrangement. The dealer may choose the lender that offers the largest markup, rather than the best terms for the consumer. This practice is less common in other consumer credit markets like mortgages. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversees compliance for auto lenders, but not for auto dealers' typical activities. Information asymmetry in the indirect auto finance market can lead to higher prices for consumers, who may not be aware they can negotiate loan terms. This lack of awareness, combined with dealers' discretion on markups, can make the auto loan market uncompetitive. Congress took actions in 2010 to restrict practices like mortgage brokers steering customers to more expensive loans due to kickbacks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau does not have authority over auto dealers predominantly engaged in selling and servicing vehicles. The CFPB issued guidance to indirect auto lenders on complying with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, leading to enforcement actions against several companies for ECOA violations in the indirect auto lending market. The CFPB took enforcement actions against Bank and Ally Financial for ECOA violations in indirect auto lending markets, alleging disparate impacts on race and ethnicity due to markups by dealers. Using a proxy methodology, the CFPB estimated these impacts based on geography and surname information. The institutions paid penalties and agreed to limit markups to address the alleged disparities. The CFPB's indirect auto lender guidance and enforcement actions sparked debate over alleged disparities in auto lending markups. Despite Congress rescinding the guidance in 2018, concerns persist about discrimination in this area. Retail payment services offer consumers cashless payment options for various transactions, including bill payments and online shopping. Retail payment services, including debit, prepaid, and credit cards, are crucial for daily purchases, especially with the growth of online shopping. Debit and prepaid cards are linked to funded accounts for transactions, while credit cards offer unsecured revolving credit. In 2017, around 170 million U.S. adults had credit cards, providing convenience for payment transactions. Credit cards offer convenience for payment transactions, with users categorized as transactors who pay in full each month or revolvers who make minimum payments and incur interest. On average, credit card interest rates were over 17% in 2016. Consumers can switch between transacting and revolving, but tend to exhibit consistent payment behavior. Credit cards are valued for their flexibility in borrowing and repayment amounts, allowing for adjustments based on individual needs. Credit cards provide quick and easy borrowing options for households facing financial shocks, allowing for consumption smoothing. However, they can lead to overspending and debt due to consumer biases. Research shows that persistent credit card debt holders often lack liquid savings and are present biased. The information disclosed in credit card statements may influence consumer behavior. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) established new disclosure requirements for credit cards, including information on how long it will take to pay off debt with minimum payments. This disclosure aims to counter consumer biases influenced by minimum payment cues in credit card statements. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 introduced new disclosure requirements for credit cards, including details on paying off debt with minimum payments. However, research suggests that these changes did not significantly impact consumer payment behavior, especially since online portals, a popular payment method, are not mandated to include these disclosures. In times of financial shocks, consumers may turn to short-term, small-dollar loans for assistance. Short-term, small-dollar loans, often less than $1,000, are provided by banks, credit unions, and nonbank institutions as alternative financial products. These loans are commonly used by consumers with low credit scores or no credit history. In 2017, 19.7% of American households lacked access to mainstream credit, with 6.9% using credit alternative financial services, such as payday loans. These households are typically lower-income, younger, and from racial or ethnic minorities. Payday loans are short-term advances that allow consumers to access cash before their next paycheck, with minimal underwriting requirements. Consumers often roll over or renew these loans, leading to extended debt periods and high fees. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to oversee payday lenders at the federal level in 2010. The CFPB oversees payday lenders at the federal level but cannot impose interest rate limits. 17 states and DC restrict interest rates on payday loans. Policy debates focus on balancing credit access with consumer protection. Academic research on payday loans' impact on consumer well-being is mixed. Short-term credit can help in emergencies. Payday loans offer flexibility but can lead to long-term debt for some consumers. The CFPB finalized a rule in 2017 covering payday and small-dollar loans, stating it is unfair for lenders to offer loans without assessing consumers' ability to repay. A proposed rule in 2019 under a new director aims to rescind mandatory underwriting provisions from the 2017 rule. The 2019 proposed rule aims to rescind mandatory underwriting provisions from the 2017 rule on payday and small-dollar loans. Prudential regulators are exploring ways to encourage banks to offer small-dollar credit products to consumers as an alternative to payday loans. Checking accounts are essential for money management, allowing consumers to deposit money, make payments, and access a debit card for transactions. These accounts are typically provided by banks or credit unions and offer government insurance on deposits. However, the availability of free or low-cost checking accounts has decreased, leading to an increase in associated fees like overdraft and nonsufficient fund fees. Overdraft fees occur when consumers transact below their account balance, with the bank covering the negative balance for a fee. According to the CFPB, half of all consumers experience negative balance episodes, which are usually short-lived. Overdraft services can help consumers pay bills on time, but overdraft fees can be costly, especially for those who overspend due to tight budgets. CFPB research shows that a small number of checking account holders incur most overdraft fees, with frequent overdrafters being more credit constrained. In 2009, the CARD Act required consumers to opt in for overdraft coverage of ATM withdrawals and nonrecurring debit card transactions. Consumer advocates have raised concerns about the transparency of overdraft programs and the lack of sufficient disclosures to consumers. They question how financial institution practices influence the opt-in decision, as opt-in rates vary widely among banks. Overdrafts can occur due to time lapses in the payments system, leading some consumers to overdraft their accounts without realizing funds are unavailable. Some argue that a faster payment system or financial planning products could help consumers avoid overdrafts. Overdraft fees can result in account closures, leaving households without access to banking services. In 2017, 6.5% of households were unbanked, with reasons including insufficient funds and distrust of banks. Additionally, 18.7% of households were underbanked, obtaining financial services outside of traditional banks. Some argue that improving banking accessibility could benefit the unbanked and underbanked population, but it may be costly for banks to serve these customers with low-balance accounts. Alternative financial providers may offer less expensive products and better customer service, such as general-purpose prepaid cards as an alternative to traditional checking accounts. Policymakers and observers will likely continue exploring ways to make banking more accessible to a larger portion of the population. General-purpose prepaid cards are an alternative to traditional checking accounts and can be obtained through various channels. These cards can be used in payment networks like Visa or MasterCard and allow for direct deposit of payroll checks. However, funds on prepaid cards are not always federally insured. Almost half of unbanked households use prepaid cards. Additionally, the consumer credit reporting system and debt collection market support the pricing of credit offers and resolution of defaults in consumer credit markets. Consumer protection laws are crucial in markets where consumers cannot choose their financial institution, such as credit reporting and debt collection. These markets accounted for 63% of complaints received by the CFPB in 2018. The consumer data industry collects and predicts consumers' financial performance based on their payment history. The consumer data industry, regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) since 1970, involves credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion that collect and use consumer payment information to predict future behaviors. Negative credit reports can impact access to financial products. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) ensures fair and equitable treatment of consumer information, including confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization. It establishes permissible uses of credit reports and consumer protection provisions, such as free disclosure of information used in adverse actions and the right to one free credit report annually for consumers. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) gives consumers the right to dispute inaccurate information in their credit reports. CRAs must investigate and correct errors within 30 days. Negative information can stay on credit reports for 7-10 years. The CFPB supervises CRAs with $7 million or more in annual receipts for compliance with consumer protection laws. The CFPB has addressed concerns about inaccurate consumer data in credit reports, which can impact access to credit and increase costs. They have encouraged credit bureaus and financial institutions to improve data accuracy, dispute handling, and furnisher reporting. Credit bureaus and financial firms have developed programs to monitor data accuracy in response to the CFPB's efforts. The CFPB has encouraged credit bureaus to improve dispute resolution processes and provide more consumer-friendly information. Consumers often struggle to understand their rights and how to advocate for themselves in credit reporting disputes. The CFPB offers financial education resources to help consumers navigate consumer reporting rights, while credit bureaus provide information on disputing inaccurate data. Debates continue on the effectiveness of these efforts in protecting consumer rights. Data protection and security are crucial in consumer data reporting, especially after the Equifax cybersecurity breach in 2017. Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs) must comply with Section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) to ensure the security and confidentiality of consumer information. The effectiveness of efforts to protect consumer rights remains a topic of debate. The FTC enforces Section 501(b) of the GLBA to protect consumer information from unauthorized access. Debt collectors play a role in recouping losses for lenders when consumers default on debts. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) of 1977 regulates the debt collection market to prevent abusive practices. Debt collection revenue in 2018 was mainly from unpaid loans, with medical, telecom, and retail debt also contributing. Consumers with lower incomes and nonprime credit scores are more likely to experience debt collection. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is the primary federal statute regulating the debt collection market to eliminate abusive practices by debt collectors. It prohibits certain conduct, requires disclosure of information to consumers, and grants consumers the right to dispute debts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has authority to write regulations implementing the FDCPA and enforce it, including over nonbank firms with significant consumer debt collection activities. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) regulates consumer debt collection activities, requiring debt collectors to send validation notices to consumers before contacting them to collect debts. Debt collectors may negotiate payment amounts and schedules with consumers but are not obligated to report debt information to credit bureaus. Most debt collectors choose not to report to credit bureaus due to cost and legal concerns. Debt collectors may choose not to report data to credit bureaus to avoid costs and legal issues. If a consumer does not pay a debt, the debt owner can seize collateral or garnish wages. Filing a claim can be costly and lead to default judgments if consumers do not appear in court. Consumers struggling with debt may seek relief through the federal bankruptcy process. The bankruptcy process allows consumers to discharge debts and start fresh, but it can result in lower credit scores and limited access to credit. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) was enacted in 2005 to address high consumer bankruptcy filings, introducing a means test to determine eligibility for relief. States also have limits on debt repayment obligations. Concerns about debt collection include errors in debt attribution and amounts, consumers' inability to advocate for themselves, and exposure to abusive practices. A CFPB survey found that over half of consumers contacted about a debt reported errors, with higher-income and older individuals more likely to dispute debts. Verification issues arise because debt collectors may not have full debt files from lenders, leading to basic information being conveyed unless a dispute occurs, reducing costs for collectors. The CFPB has identified concerns with debt collection, including errors in debt attribution and amounts, consumers' inability to advocate for themselves, and exposure to abusive practices. Recent consumer complaints to the CFPB highlight issues with debt validation notices and verification of debts. In response, the CFPB proposed a rule to clarify information debt collectors should disclose to consumers. The CFPB proposed a rule to clarify information debt collectors should disclose to consumers under FCRA, aiming for transparent and competitive markets. Government policy can correct market failures but may have unintended consequences, making it challenging to predict the effects of new laws or regulations on market efficiency."
