    "content": "The \"Restore our Neighborhoods Act of 2012\" is also known as the Qualified Urban Demolition Bonds section of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term 'qualified urban demolition bond' refers to a bond issued for qualified projects by a qualified issuer, with 100% of proceeds used for post-enactment expenditures, in registered form, not exceeding 30 years in term, issued within a 5-year period. Beginning on the enactment date, the maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by a State under subsection (a) shall not exceed the national qualified urban demolition bond limitation amount of $4,000,000,000 allocated among States by the Secretary. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated by a State under subsection (a) shall not exceed $4,000,000,000 allocated among States by the Secretary. $2,000,000,000 is to be allocated among qualified States based on a formula, and another $2,000,000,000 is to be equally distributed among all States. The limitation amount allocated to a State under paragraph (3) shall be allocated by the State to qualified issuers within such State based on the 2010 decennial census data. If the national qualified urban demolition bond limitation amount exceeds the allocated amount after a 2-year period, reallocation of unused issuance limitation will occur. The demolition bond limitation amount may be reallocated among qualified States to ensure issuance of qualified urban demolition bonds within a 5-year period. A qualified project includes demolition costs for approved projects but excludes operation or maintenance costs. The applicable credit rate is determined differently than under section 54A(b)(3). The applicable credit rate for an issue is based on the average market yield on long-term corporate debt obligations. Special rules require that 100% of project proceeds be spent on qualified projects within a 5-year period. The qualified issuer must spend at least 10 percent of the proceeds on projects within 12 months of the issuance date. If less than 100 percent of the project proceeds are spent within 5 years, nonqualified bonds must be redeemed. The qualified issuer must pay back the credits received for a qualified urban demolition bond if it ceases to comply with the requirements. This includes the aggregate of credits received and interest on the amount for each calendar year until the bond is redeemed by the land bank. A qualified issuer for a qualified urban demolition bond must repay the credits received if it fails to meet the requirements. The term 'qualified issuer' refers to a State-authorized land bank or the State itself in the absence of such banks. A State-authorized land bank is a government unit tasked with reclaiming vacant land and conducting large-scale demolition projects under State law. The text discusses the requirements for a qualified State to participate in expedited tax foreclosure of vacant properties, including ranking in the top 20 for nonseasonal vacancies between 2000 and 2010. The State must meet specific criteria to participate in expedited tax foreclosure of vacant properties, including ranking in the top 25 for unemployment rate, top 25 for loans in foreclosure, and top 20 for population growth change between the 2000 and 2010 census. Transferability of credits allowed by this section is not limited by any law. The tax code is amended to include qualified urban demolition bonds as eligible for certain tax benefits. The tax code is amended to include qualified urban demolition bonds for tax benefits, effective for bonds issued after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, neighborhood stabilization program funds can now be used for demolition activities. NSP2 and NSP3 Funds can now be used for demolition activities by qualified States or local governments, despite previous limitations. Qualified States or local governments can now use NSP2 and NSP3 funds for demolition activities at their discretion, as per the Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Qualified States or local governments can use NSP2 and NSP3 funds for demolition activities at their discretion. The term 'qualified State' is defined in section 54G(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
