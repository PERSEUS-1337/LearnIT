Both the Director and Deputy Director are prohibited from engaging in other business activities or holding office in organizations that have contracts with the Center without approval. Congressional Requests can be made to the Technical Assessment Board by any member of Congress for an investigation and report on scientific and technical matters. Requests are prioritized based on bipartisan and bicameral support, with formal calls for requests sent to all members of Congress by the Board chairman. The Director, with approval from the Technical Assessment Board, determines final priority for fulfilling requests within each category. Advisory panels may be established to support technical assessment reports without being subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Reports requested are subject to peer review by independent experts for rigorous vetting and recommendations before delivery. The Center assesses reports for scientific method, accuracy, results, and conclusions. Peer reviewers' comments are given for improvement before final review by the Director and approval by the Technical Assessment Board. Reports are then delivered to the requesting committee or member of Congress. Public release is prompt, with a 2-week delay possible upon request. Appropriations are authorized for the Comptroller General to carry out these tasks. The Comptroller General is authorized $30,000,000 annually from 2005 to 2007 for this section."
