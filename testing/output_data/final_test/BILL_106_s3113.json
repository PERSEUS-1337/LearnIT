In 1776, Governors Island fortifications helped George Washington's army escape British attack. New York ceded control of the island to the Federal Government in 1800 for defense. During the War of 1812, Castle Williams and Southwest Battery deterred British from attacking NYC. In 1901, fill from Lexington Avenue Subway excavation was used. Governors Island's history includes significant roles in the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. In 1966, the Army relocated operations, and the United States Coast Guard took over for the next 30 years. The Coast Guard ceased operations at Governors Island in 1997, leaving 225 buildings unoccupied and exposed to New York Harbor's elements. Castle Williams is named after Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, who built the fort, and Fort Jay is named after John Jay.
