    "content": "Gambling is now legal in all states except Hawaii and Utah, heavily regulated and taxed. Congress has historically influenced the industry through various laws, including those on antiracketeering, Indian gambling, and sports betting. The industry has evolved with advancements in technology, with online gambling becoming legal in over 85 countries, although some major markets like China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States still restrict it. Online gambling is prohibited in South Korea and the United States, with only Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey allowing intrastate Internet gambling. It is also legal in the U.S. Virgin Islands but has not yet launched. Several states explicitly outlaw online gambling, while many popular sites are licensed in the EU, accounting for 40% of the global market. Global revenue from online, television, and mobile gambling is around $50 billion, projected to exceed $65 billion by 2021. Americans gambled $2.1 billion on foreign websites in 2016, with 4% of U.S. adults gambling online in 2014. The debate over federal legislation on Internet gambling in the US has intensified, with 4% of US adults gambling online in 2014. While some casino operators are concerned about the impact of online gambling on traditional casinos, others see it as a potential new revenue source. This division within the industry has led to little progress on bills regarding Internet gambling at the federal level. The US government has taken action against Internet gambling through 1960s statutes like the Wire Act, making it a federal crime to use telecommunications for illegal gambling. Jay Cohen, involved in World Sports Exchange, was arrested in 1998 for violating the Wire Act. In 2003, the DOJ warned media outlets about advertising gambling websites violating the Wire Act. Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo paid $31.5 million in 2007 to settle DOJ claims. In 2007, Yahoo paid $31.5 million to settle DOJ claims of promoting illegal gambling. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) passed in 2006 prohibits banks from processing payments to online gambling companies. UIGEA allows states and tribes to permit Internet gambling with certain safeguards. On April 15, 2011, the U.S. Attorney indicted the founders of major Internet poker websites for disguising illegal payments. The companies violated UIGEA, the Wire Act, and other laws by taking bets from U.S. players. In September 2011, a civil suit was filed against Full Tilt Poker for defrauding bettors. Civil complaints against PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker were dismissed in July 2012 after settlements with DOJ and the purchase of Full Tilt by PokerStars. In 2011, the DOJ settled claims with payments of $731 million and PokerStars acquired Full Tilt. Fulltiltpoker.com reopened in Europe, but Americans, except in New Jersey, cannot gamble on these sites. PokerStars obtained licenses in New Jersey in 2015 to offer real money games. The DOJ's view on Internet gambling shifted in 2011, stating the Wire Act applies only to sports betting. States can now allow online gambling if not sports-related. Several states and tribes have utilized this memo to permit online betting on horse races and lotteries. Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have authorized various forms of online gambling. Several states, including Delaware and New Jersey, have authorized various forms of Internet gambling, such as poker, slots, and table games, excluding sports wagering. Regulations ensure that gamblers are within state borders and of legal age. UIGEA regulations have made it easier for legal gambling operators to receive payments electronically. Companies are exploring increased involvement in online gambling, including those not traditionally in the gambling industry. Social gaming on social networking sites is also of interest. Social gaming on social networking sites like Facebook and Google+ allows for online gaming in the United States without cash prizes. Internet sweepstakes caf\u00e9s, estimated to generate $10-15 billion annually nationwide, have been outlawed in Ohio, Florida, Mississippi, and California. Daily fantasy sports (DFS) is another form of online gambling where players can win cash jackpots based on real-life player performance. DFS operators reported $86 million in revenue in 2014. States are using a patchwork approach to regulate DFS, with Nevada requiring operators to comply with regulations. Many states have varying regulations on Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS). Nevada requires operators to obtain a license, while some states like Kansas allow DFS companies to operate without regulation. On the other hand, states like Washington prohibit online fantasy sports wagering. The legalization of online gambling could impact traditional forms of gambling, potentially affecting casinos that heavily rely on slot machines and day trippers. The gambling industry and casino hotels employed around 400,000 people nationwide in 2015, with most jobs located in Nevada, New Jersey, Louisiana, or Mississippi. Employment in this sector fell by 7% between 2005 and 2015. The average annual wage for gambling industry employees was $31,814, while casino hotel workers earned an average of $36,983. Lotteries are the most widespread form of gambling in the United States, regulated by state governments and run in 44 states and the District of Columbia. Lotteries in the United States are widespread, with games now available in 44 states and the District of Columbia. State offerings have evolved from basic games to include scratch-off tickets, lotto games, and video lottery terminals. States transfer a portion of lottery revenues to their treasuries, and some states participate in multi-state games like Powerball through lottery associations. In 2010, the Lottery Association and Mega Millions consortium agreed to cross-sell tickets, leading to mega-games with million-dollar jackpots. Powerball set a record with a $1.6 billion jackpot in 2016. Lottery revenues reached $31.4 billion in FY2015, with a 3% increase from FY2014. States have experimented with strategies like online sales to boost revenue. Illinois privatized its lottery management in 2011 but faced challenges, canceling its contract with Northstar Lottery Group in 2015. Illinois terminated its contract with Northstar Lottery Group due to revenue target failures. Northstar will manage the Illinois Lottery until January 1, 2017, or until a new private company is chosen. Online lottery sales in Illinois totaled $10 million in FY2016. Several states, including Georgia, Michigan, and Kentucky, sell lottery tickets online. Minnesota suspended online lottery sales in 2015. In 2015, there were 450 commercial casinos and 55 racinos in the US. Additionally, there are over 400 card rooms. Commercial casinos operate in 18 states, while boat or barge casinos are permitted in six states. Racinos are present in 13 states. The industry reported $38.3 billion in gross revenues in 2015, but some casinos in Atlantic City and Mississippi have closed since 2014. Since 2014, three casinos, including Harrah's in Tunica, MS, have closed. The number of commercial casinos in Colorado decreased from 40 in 2013 to 36 in 2015. Slot machines now generate 70% of revenue in commercial casinos, up from 40% in the 1970s. Nevada has the largest number of commercial casinos, with over 270 locations grossing more than $1 million in gambling revenue. Slot machines account for over 60% of gambling revenues in Nevada. Other states like South Dakota and Iowa earn over 90% of their revenues from slot machines. Commercial casinos are major revenue generators in various locations such as Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Detroit, and others. These casinos offer high-end amenities and entertainment, with Las Vegas relying heavily on hotel rooms, food, and entertainment for revenue. States regulate commercial casinos, mandating background checks for employees and specifying payouts to players. Gambling revenue on the Las Vegas Strip accounted for 35% of total revenue in 2015, down from 59% in 1984. Many large casino companies, including Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts International, Wynn Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands Corporation, are publicly traded on U.S. stock exchanges, subject to Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements. The National Indian Gaming Commission reported that 244 federally recognized tribes operated gambling facilities in 29 states in 2016, generating $29.9 billion in revenue in FY2015. Indian gambling revenues have steadily increased since the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (P.L. 100-497) was passed in 1988, leading to the growth of Indian gambling establishments. Some tribes own major casinos like Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. The largest tribal casinos account for 40% of tribal gambling revenues. Some tribes are exploring online gambling opportunities. The Tribal Internet Gaming Alliance includes various tribes interested in online gaming. The Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Tribe and the Bad River Band Chippewa Tribe formed a group in 2013 to influence federal Internet gambling policy. Some Indian tribes are concerned about the impact of daily fantasy sports on their existing casino revenue. The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe launched a DFS platform, Grandfantasysports.com, available in 11 states. Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, allowing tribal regulation of Class I social gaming and Class II gambling. Class II and Class III gaming on tribal lands are subject to tribal, federal, and state regulations. Tribes must be located in a state that permits such gambling to offer these types of games. Federal courts have interpreted this provision to allow tribes to conduct any type of gambling permitted in the state, without state limits or conditions. The Secretary of the Interior has authority to approve tribe-state compacts for casino gambling. There is controversy over reservation shopping for casino locations. NIGC oversees class II gaming and tribal gaming ordinances. IGRA places limits on tribal revenue use from Indian gambling for education, health care, and other activities. Some Indian tribes operate casinos and share proceeds with states. Tribes are not taxed on income from commercial activities but pay employment and wagering taxes. Some tribes struggle with debt, like the Mashantucket Pequot Nation which restructured $2 billion debt in 2013. Foxwoods casino remains financially unstable with $1.7 billion in loans. The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority refinanced $1.64 billion of debt in 2012 and announced layoffs at Mohegan Sun. The tribe's constitution complicates matters for lenders as it limits their ability to seek protection under federal bankruptcy laws. Creditors may face challenges in seeking liquidation of assets under these circumstances. The Gaming Disputes Court may not have the same powers as a federal bankruptcy court, limiting the ability to seek liquidation of assets or take certain actions under federal bankruptcy laws. A dispute between Wells Fargo Bank and the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians could impact gaming financing, with Wells Fargo suing the tribe over missed payments on a $50 million tribal bond for a casino operation in Mississippi. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in 2010 found a bond deal invalid due to lack of review by the National Indian Gaming Commission. The dispute continued after a remand in 2011 by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, with potential for more appeals. Pari-mutuel betting, legal in 43 states, involves player-banked betting with pooled prizes, commonly seen in dog and horse racing, jai alai, and other ranked sporting events. The industry has expanded to include Internet and off-track wagering. In 2000, Congress approved legislation amending the definition of \"interstate off-track wager\" in the Interstate Horseracing Act. A bill introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to clarify that the Wire Act and other laws do not apply to the Interstate Horseracing Act. Despite legal uncertainty, interstate pari-mutuel betting with remote devices is growing through advance deposit wagering (ADW) using accounts with companies like Twinspires, Xpressbet, or TV Games Network. Online wagering on horse races has seen a significant increase, with licensed companies reporting a rise to $2.9 billion in 2015 from $962 million in 2005. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 prohibited state governments from engaging in sports gambling, with exceptions for Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana. Currently, Nevada is the only state to permit wagers on a full complement of sporting events and leagues. In 2015, casino-goers in Nevada wagered about $4.2 billion on sporting events, up from $3.4 billion in 2012. Delaware enacted a law in 2009 to create a state sports lottery, but the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state was limited to offering narrow betting. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, effectively ending Delaware's effort to expand sports betting. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, effectively ending Delaware's effort to expand sports betting. New Jersey's sports wagering law conflicts with PASPA and could not be implemented. Two bills related to sports gambling have been introduced in Congress. Americans spent around $150 billion on illegal sports betting in 2015. Federal Internet gambling legislation could impact different sectors of the gambling industry, with concerns raised by state lottery officials and commercial casinos. If the US passes federal online gambling laws and all states opt in, a $15-16 billion market is predicted by 2021. Interest groups and gambling companies are divided on remote gambling. Interest groups and gambling companies are divided over remote gambling. The Poker Players Alliance, Caesars Entertainment, and MGM support federal regulation to avoid state-by-state laws. The Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection was formed in 2014. On the opposing side are groups like the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, NASPL, and NCSL, advocating for states' rights to legalize and tax online gambling. NCLGS established 10 policy standards for Internet gambling legislation in 2015. The National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) has conditions for legalizing interstate Internet gambling, including no taxation on tribal revenues, allowing tribal operations in the market, and preserving state-tribal compacts. Some Indian tribes oppose federal gambling regulations, but larger tribes see online gambling as a business opportunity. The National Governors Association also emphasizes state involvement in online gambling legislation. The National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) is concerned about potential proposals that could disadvantage tribal operations in the market. Federal Internet gambling legislation may lead to revenue and employment declines in certain locations. Enforcement of Internet gambling laws presents logistical challenges, including monitoring websites to prevent underage gambling and verifying the location of gamblers. The implementation of UIGEA rules requires financial firms to verify the legal operating authority of online gambling businesses and ensure compliance with age and location verification requirements. Concerns have been raised by the Department of Justice, Department of State, and state attorneys general regarding the potential for fraud and money laundering in online gambling. Joseph S. Campbell of the FBI has warned about the potential for criminal activity in Internet poker, facilitated by tools like TOR networks and Virtual Private Networks. The Oregon Racing Commission has addressed regulatory issues by requiring ADW firms to be licensed and audited, regardless of their physical location. Firms must provide financial information, maintain a segregated account, pay a security fee, and demonstrate an operational presence in Oregon. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that about 1% of the population are pathological gamblers and another 3% are problem gamblers, affecting 6 to 8 million Americans. Adolescents and males are at higher risk of a gambling disorder. NCPG released standards for responsible Internet gambling in 2012. Nearly 40 states offer publicly funded gambling addiction services, with about 15 states funding full-time employees for the issue. Spending varies among states, with Delaware allocating about $1.42 per capita. Opponents of expanding Internet gambling fear an increase in problem gambling, especially among young people. John Kindt, a Professor at the University of Illinois, warns that online gambling could lead to exponential growth in problem gambling rates. By approving the largest expansion of gambling in history, the Committee has taken steps to open casinos in every home, dorm room, library, iPod, Blackberry, iPad, and computer in America. Internet gambling's effects on problem gambling are still unclear, but experts classify it as an addictive disorder. Studies show that those who gamble online and experience problems are often involved in other forms of gambling as well. The study on gambling in Australia found that online gamblers were not more likely to be problem gamblers. Iowa's Department of Public Health studied the health effects of legalizing Internet poker, noting that it may contribute to problem gambling. Some groups oppose all forms of gambling for moral reasons. Gambling is a significant source of revenue for states, representing 2.0% to 2.5% of state own-source general revenues. State gambling revenues have increased from $20.7 billion in FY2005 to $27.7 billion in FY2015, with more casinos, racinos, and lottery products entering the market. However, revenues from casinos have been stagnant since 2013, with 9 out of 17 states experiencing declines in FY2015. Revenue from lotteries has been slowly rising, but changing consumer behavior, especially among younger generations, has led to a softening in the growth of gambling revenues. Gambling taxes are crucial for certain states, with Nevada relying on them for about 20% of its general fund revenue in 2015. In 2015, gambling taxes accounted for 20% of the state's general fund revenue, compared to 30% from sales and use taxes. Pennsylvania collected more commercial casino tax revenue ($1.4 billion) than Nevada ($907 million) due to higher tax rates. Federal licensing of Internet gambling could bring additional revenue to the government. The proposed Internet Gambling Regulation Act would increase federal revenue by $283 million over 10 years. The legislation would authorize the Treasury Secretary to regulate Internet wagering, with oversight by state gaming authorities. Another bill, the Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act, could generate an additional $42 billion over 10 years through a 2% license fee on customer deposits for online wagering. Some states have already legalized online gambling. In recent years, some states have legalized online gambling while others have considered legislation or made it illegal. Nevada was the first state to regulate online gambling in 2001, awarding licenses for online poker only. Online poker revenue in 2014 was $16.5 million, with only 2 out of 271 casinos offering online poker. Ultimate Poker, the first licensed online poker room, ceased operations in November 2014. Nevada also became the first state to require gambling licenses for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) in October 2015. In October 2015, Nevada required gambling licenses for DFS operators. Delaware authorized full online casino-style gambling in June 2012, launching full-scale online gambling in November 2013. The state's tax revenue from Internet gambling fell short of forecasts, totaling $1.8 million in FY2015. In February 2014, Nevada and Delaware signed the Multi-State Internet Gaming Agreement. Delaware's online casino and poker offerings are operated by 888 Holdings. New Jersey's online gambling regulations took effect in October 2013, allowing licensed casinos to offer games over the Internet. New Jersey's virtual casinos generated $149 million in gross gambling revenues in 2015, up from $123 million in 2014. Several states have debated bills to authorize online gambling, with some legalizing online daily fantasy sports (DFS) betting in 2016. New York issued temporary permits to fantasy sports operators like DraftKings and FanDuel. Congressional committees have held hearings on Internet gambling, including a 2015 hearing on the Restoration of America's Wire Act. The Restoration of America's Wire Act (RAWA) aims to amend the Wire Act to ban all forms of Internet gambling in the US, excluding certain exemptions like online interstate horse race wagers and fantasy sports competitions. The bill does not make online games illegal but prohibits using the communications network for activities like poker or bingo. The Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling supports this legislation. The Committee on Indian Affairs discussed the impact of Internet gambling on tribes. S. 3376 would ban financial institutions from processing online gambling transactions and aims to reverse the 2011 DOJ memo on the Wire Act. Another bill, H.R. 2888, would allow states or tribes to license online poker sites with regulations to prevent minors from playing and stop money laundering. The bill aims to prohibit the use of credit cards on poker websites and give preference to certain established gambling businesses for licenses. Government-supported gambling has been part of America's history since colonial times, with lotteries used to raise funds for public works projects and universities. Public opinion turned against legal lotteries due to scandals and graft, leading to their halt by the time of the Civil War. During the Civil War, legal lotteries were halted. Gambling moved west with the Gold Rush. Louisiana created a special lottery during Reconstruction. Congress passed laws in 1876 and 1890 to ban lottery advertising and ticket sales by mail. By 1910, legal gambling in the U.S. was limited. State-sanctioned gambling resurged during the Great Depression for charity and government funding. Bingo games were legalized in the 1930s, and Nevada legalized casino gambling in 1931. Illegal gambling also increased, leading to a Congressional investigation in 1950. In 1951, the Johnson Act was passed to regulate gambling machines in interstate commerce. Congressional investigations from 1955 to 1960 led to laws combating gambling and racketeering. New Hampshire reinstated a lottery in 1964, and New Jersey allowed casinos in Atlantic City in 1976. Indian gambling began in Florida in 1979, and in 1987, the Supreme Court upheld tribes' rights to offer unregulated gambling on sovereign lands. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed in 1988 to regulate Indian gambling through compacts negotiated between states and tribes. Gambling regulation evolved with the Johnson Act in 1951, leading to laws against gambling and racketeering. States and tribes negotiated compacts for Indian gambling, upheld by the Supreme Court in 1987. Congress passed laws like PASPA in 1992 and UIGEA in 2006 to regulate sports and internet gambling."
