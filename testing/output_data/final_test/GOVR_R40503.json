    "content": "Drug compounding is the process where a pharmacist mixes drug ingredients to create a medication for an individual patient based on a prescription. It is used for medications not commercially available, like lower dosages for children or dye-free options for patients with allergies. Compounding is regulated at the state level and the FDA ensures drugs are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA regulates the introduction of new drugs into interstate commerce, requiring approval for drugs not recognized as safe and effective. Compounded drugs were not explicitly addressed until the FDA Modernization Act of 1997. Pharmacists historically compounded drugs without FDA approval for about 50 years. The FDA historically did not regulate compounded drugs, as they are traditionally made in small amounts for individual patients. However, in the early 1990s, the FDA became concerned about large-scale bulk compounding by some pharmacists, leading to the issuance of a Compliance Policy Guide in 1992. In 1992, the FDA issued a Compliance Policy Guide addressing its authority to regulate compounding. The FDA stated that retail pharmacies are not exempt from new drug, adulteration, or misbranding provisions of the FFDCA. The guidance allowed for traditional compounding but warned of enforcement actions for activities resembling manufacturing. The FDA's enforcement discretion against compounding pharmacies is determined by factors such as soliciting business for specific drug products, using commercial scale equipment, and compounding generic copies of FDA-approved drugs. Section 503A of the FFDCA exempts compounded drugs from certain requirements, clarifying the FDA's role in regulating drug compounding. FFDCA requirements for drug compounding include the need for a valid prescription, compliance with US Pharmacopoeia standards or FDA-approved ingredients, meeting manufacturing criteria, and not compounding drugs that have been withdrawn from the market. Compounded drugs must not be essentially copies of commercially available products. Section 503A of the FFDCA provides exemptions for compounded drugs. Section 503A of the FFDCA exempts compounded drug products from certain requirements if based on a valid prescription and not solicited. Restrictions on advertising and promotion of compounded drugs were challenged as a violation of free speech in a legal case. The district court found that the speech provisions of Section 503A violated pharmacies' First Amendment rights. The court also determined that other provisions of Section 503A could be severed without affecting the law's operation. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling on the speech provisions but partially reversed the decision. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the compounding provisions of Section 503A were not severable from the rest of the section, as they were essential in balancing the preservation of compounded drugs with preventing drug manufacturing. Congress intended to exempt compounding pharmacists from FDA requirements in exchange for a ban on promoting specific compounded drugs. The court dismissed the applicability of the existing severability clause in the FDA. The Supreme Court affirmed lower court rulings that speech restrictions in Sections 503A(a) and (c) were unconstitutional. The government did not seek review on the severability issue, so the Court did not address it. The FDA issued a Compliance Policy Guide in 2002 after the Supreme Court affirmed that speech restrictions in Sections 503A(a) and (c) were unconstitutional. The guide provided guidance to the compounding industry on factors for enforcement discretion regarding pharmacy compounding. The FDA issued a Compliance Policy Guide in 2002 to provide guidance on factors for enforcement discretion regarding pharmacy compounding. The FDA expressed concerns about pharmacies manufacturing large quantities of drug products without prescriptions, stating that enforcement action would be considered for significant violations of drug regulations. The FDA outlined nine acts that could lead to enforcement action for pharmacy compounding, including compounding drugs without valid prescriptions, using unapproved ingredients, and compounding drugs for third parties. The FDA outlined enforcement actions for pharmacy compounding, including compounding drugs for third parties, using unapproved ingredients, and failing to comply with state laws. In 2004, licensed pharmacies challenged FDA's authority in Medical Center Pharmacy v. Ashcroft. In a case against the FDA ( Medical Center Pharmacy v. Mukasey ), plaintiffs sought a declaration that drugs compounded by licensed pharmacists were not \"new drugs\" under the FFDCA. The court ruled that compounded drugs were exempt from new-drug requirements, citing impracticability of the approval process and FDA's 2002 Compliance Policy Guide. The court ruled that compounded drugs are subject to new-drug approval requirements but are granted a limited exemption if compounded in accordance with Section 503A. This is based on the definition of \"new drug\" in the FFDCA, where compounded drugs are considered new due to mixing approved drugs to create unapproved concoctions. The court ruled that compounded drugs are subject to new-drug approval requirements, even though pharmacies argued it would hinder traditional compounding practices. The court acknowledged the concerns but stated that these issues can be reconciled. The court ruled that compounded drugs are subject to new-drug approval requirements, but pharmacists could still compound drugs as the FDA has enforcement discretion for minor violations. The Fifth Circuit pointed to FDAMA as evidence that Congress intended the new-drug provision to apply to pharmacy-compounded drugs. The court evaluated the validity of FDAMA in justifying compounded drugs as new drugs under the FFDCA. It found that the severability clause applied to Section 503A, stating that the remaining requirements were sufficient to protect access to compounded drugs while preventing large-scale drug manufacturing by pharmacies. The court disagreed with the Ninth Circuit on the legislative history of FDAMA and its speech provisions in Section 503A. The FDA will enforce non-advertising provisions of Section 503A in the Fifth Circuit and for plaintiffs in the Medical Center case, while continuing the 2002 Compliance Policy Guide elsewhere. The current situation presents a scenario of non-uniform enforcement of compounded drugs in the United States. The Fifth Circuit exempts compounded drugs from certain provisions of the FFDCA, while the Ninth Circuit and the FDA subject them to these provisions with discretion in enforcement. Uncertainty remains about the FDA's authority to regulate compounded drugs as new drugs, and courts may still evaluate this issue. The FDA's authority to regulate compounded drugs under the FFDCA remains uncertain, with different circuits applying varying levels of enforcement. The FDA's 2002 Compliance Policy Guide has been criticized for lacking clarity on when enforcement actions will be taken, while the agency argues it provides flexibility for public health concerns. The issue may only be settled by Congress or a Supreme Court case in the future. The FDA's authority to regulate compounded drugs is outlined in a guidance document, which differs from agency rules as it is not legally binding. Congress has specific requirements for FDA guidance documents, stating they do not create rights for individuals. Guidance documents do not establish enforceable rights or responsibilities for the public or the FDA. The FDA's 2002 Compliance Policy Guide does not legally bind the public or the FDA. Courts may not defer to the FDA's position on enforcement discretion or whether compounded drugs are \"new drugs.\" The Fifth Circuit in Medical Center Pharmacy evaluated the FDA's interpretation that compounded drugs are new drugs under a deferential standard. Future court rulings on the severability of non-speech provisions in Section 503A are uncertain. The courts' rulings on the severability of non-speech provisions in Section 503A are uncertain, as it is difficult to predict how a court would rule based on Supreme Court severability precedent. The presence of a severability clause in a statute creates a presumption that Congress did not intend the validity of the statute to depend on the validity of the constitutionally offensive provision. Center Pharmacy relied on legislative history of FDAMA to determine if solicitation and advertising provisions were integral. Courts did not find explicit references to unconstitutional provisions of Section 503A. The Ninth Circuit and Fifth Circuit differed on the application of the severability clause in the FFDCA to Section 503A."
