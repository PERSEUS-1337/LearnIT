    "content": "The Election Assistance Commission released a report on the impact of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The Supreme Court ruled that the Act preempts Arizona's law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. The House Committee discussed the Voter Registration Efficiency Act to address issues like voter registration in multiple states. Efforts to establish a national voter registration system began in the 1970s, following the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The proposal for a national postcard voter registration system was considered by both the Senate and the House in the 93rd Congress, with the Senate passing the bill in 1973. In 1973, the Senate passed a bill for a national postcard voter registration system (S. 352) but the House refused to take up the bill in 1974. In 1975, the House passed a modified version of the measure (H.R. 11552) without mass mailing postcards. Efforts for a national voter registration standard in 1977 (H.R. 5400) faced opposition from local election officials. Efforts for election-day voter registration initially had strong support but faced opposition from local election officials, causing support to decline. The Senate bill on voter registration (S. 1072) was reported out of committee but never came up for a vote. Despite various proposals between 1983 and 1988 to reform voter registration, including a national system based on postcard or election-day registration, no measures reached the floor of either the Senate or the House. In 1984, Congress passed the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act, establishing national requirements for accessible polling places and registration facilities. The act also provided aids for handicapped and elderly individuals in federal elections, eliminating notarization for absentee ballots. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) was signed into law on August 28, 1986. It required the creation of an official postcard form for voter registration and absentee ballot application, allowed absentee voting for uniformed services voters and overseas voters in federal elections, and permitted the use of federal write-in absentee ballots for overseas voters in general elections for federal office. This act, along with previous legislation, established national voter registration and election standards, increasing federal involvement in state elections. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) and subsequent legislation increased federal involvement in state electoral activities. Voter turnout in the 1988 presidential election was low, prompting efforts to reform voter registration procedures. The introduction of the first \"motor-voter\" bill aimed to eliminate barriers to voting and encourage voter participation. The \"motor-voter\" bill was introduced in the 101st Congress by Representatives Swift and Annunzio, later reintroduced by Representative Foley as H.R. 2190. It received bipartisan support in the House but was not brought up in the Senate. In the 102nd Congress, S. 250, the National Voter Registration Act of 1991, was introduced by Senators Ford and Hatfield and passed in the Senate. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) received bipartisan support and was passed in the Senate and House but vetoed by President George H. W. Bush. It was reintroduced in the 103rd Congress as H.R. 2 and S. 460, passing in the House and Senate with amendments. President Clinton signed the NVRA into law on May 20, 1993, requiring states to implement voter registration for federal elections. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the \"motor-voter\" law, mandated states to establish procedures for eligible citizens to register to vote for federal elections. Certain states were exempt from the act if they had no voter registration requirement or allowed registration at polling places on election day. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 exempted New Hampshire and Idaho from the requirement to establish election-day voter registration. An amendment in P.L. 104-99 changed the cut-off date for state election-day registration to August 4, 1994. Proponents argued that the law required other agencies to provide voter registration forms and materials, with state election officials determining the adequacy of applications. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 included the \"motor-voter\" provision, which allowed driver's license applications to also serve as voter registration for federal elections. The voter registration form included in the driver's license application required minimal information to prevent duplicate registrations and verify eligibility. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 required voter registration forms to include eligibility requirements, an attestation of meeting those requirements, penalties for false information, and confidentiality assurances. Proponents considered the \"motor-voter\" provision the most important, with mail and agency registration options provided for those without driver's licenses. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 mandated states to accept mail registration forms developed by the FEC, with necessary identifying information. Mail registration forms were to be distributed by governmental and private entities, including nongovernmental voter registration programs. First-time voters registering by mail might have to vote in person if they had not previously voted in that jurisdiction. Under the NVRA, state agencies and offices providing public assistance and services to persons with disabilities were designated as voter registration agencies. Other offices like public libraries, schools, and government offices were also designated as voter registration agencies. These agencies were required to distribute mail registration application forms to service applicants and provide assistance in completing the forms if requested. They were not allowed to influence or discourage applicants from registering to vote. The NVRA designated agencies to distribute voter registration forms and prohibited them from influencing or discouraging applicants. U.S. armed forces recruitment offices were also designated as voter registration agencies. In 1998, H.R. 6 required institutions of higher learning in NVRA-covered states to distribute mail voter registration forms. The NVRA required institutions of higher learning in covered states to distribute voter registration forms to students enrolled in degree or certified programs. Registered voters could only be removed from the list under specific circumstances, and states had to maintain voter registration rolls in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The NVRA required states to maintain voter registration rolls in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. States could use the U.S. Postal Service's program for address changes and remove voters who had moved or failed to respond to notices and vote in two federal elections. The law did not provide funding for these requirements, but states could use reduced postal rates for voter registration mailings. The NVRA required states to maintain voter registration rolls in compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The FEC was to develop a mail registration form and provide reports to Congress every two years on the impact of the act. Both the attorney general and aggrieved citizens could seek relief under the act, with violations of voter registration procedures being a federal offense. The act went into effect on January 1, 1995, or later for states needing to amend their constitutions. The NVRA aimed to increase voter registration by allowing eligible citizens to easily register to vote. Proponents argued that this would lead to higher voter turnout, as many eligible citizens were not registered. They pointed out that states with \"motor-voter\" registration had higher turnout rates. The NVRA could potentially increase voter registration rates to 90% of the voting-age population. Opponents argued that increasing voter registration rates to 90% may not significantly boost voter turnout, citing studies showing turnout is influenced by various factors. They highlighted similar turnout in North Dakota and South Dakota in 1992 despite different registration systems. They believed voter registration reforms would only result in minor turnout increases. Opponents of the NVRA argued that increasing voter registration rates may not significantly boost voter turnout, citing studies showing turnout is influenced by various factors. They believed voter registration reforms would only result in minor turnout increases. Critics described the NVRA as legislation in search of a purpose, with one calling it \"auto-fraudo.\" Proponents viewed the NVRA as necessary to prevent discriminatory procedures that disproportionately affected minorities, the poor, the elderly, and the disabled. They argued that voter registration procedures should not be used to test citizens' determination to vote. Opponents of the NVRA argued against federal legislation mandating uniform voter registration procedures, stating that many states already had efficient systems in place. They believed voter registration administration should remain within the states' jurisdiction. Opponents of the NVRA argued against federal legislation mandating uniform voter registration procedures, stating that many states already had efficient systems in place. They believed voter registration administration should remain within the states' jurisdiction. The NVRA was seen as imposing expensive and burdensome procedures on states, with estimated costs ranging from $87.55 million to $250 million per year. Proponents argued that states with \"motor-voter\" systems had lower costs, suggesting a range of $0.03 to $0.33 per new registrant. The costs of implementing the NVRA were estimated to be between $0.03 and $0.33 per new registrant. Proponents argued that these costs were lower than opponents' estimates, which were based on adding a larger number of new registrants. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the program would cost states between $20 million and $25 million annually for the first five years. Differences in cost estimates were attributed to the costs of implementing NVRA policies and running elections. The costs of implementing the NVRA were estimated to be between $0.03 and $0.33 per new registrant. Costs associated with running elections in states might increase due to the number of registered voters. The impact of the NVRA on running elections could be significant if the percentage of registered voters increased, but this large increase has not yet occurred. The NVRA has been in effect for 18 years, but there are few cost estimates available. The FEC dismissed the idea of a cost estimate, citing the difficulty in determining added costs. The report suggests that developing cost estimates is challenging due to the nature of the budgeting process at the local level. The NVRA has been in effect for 18 years, with few cost estimates available. The report highlights the challenges in estimating election costs and the differential impact on states. Increased mailing costs under NVRA would be a significant burden for local election officials. Postage costs have become a major item in every registrar's budget. The U.S. PIRG study in 2009 estimated that the cost of voter registration and error-correction programs for the 2008 election was $33,467,910 in 100 counties across 36 states. Expenditures varied based on county population size, with costs ranging from $86,977 to $1,079,610 per county. These estimates were considered conservative and highlighted the significant impact on registrar budgets. The U.S. PIRG study in 2009 estimated the cost of voter registration and error-correction programs for the 2008 election in 100 counties across 36 states. Costs varied based on county population size, with estimates ranging from $86,977 to $1,079,610 per county. Registrars spent at least 50% of their time on registration issues, with costs averaging $73,000 for small counties, $212,000 for medium-sized counties, and $938,000 for larger counties during the 2008 election cycle. Critics argued that the NVRA made it easier to register to vote but did not provide states with enough resources to keep registration lists up-to-date, potentially leading to election fraud. Opponents of the NVRA argued that it made it easy for ineligible persons, including noncitizens, to register to vote through the driver's license application process. They believed that the act would lead to improper voter registration of noncitizens. Proponents, on the other hand, stated that the NVRA strengthened efforts to prevent fraud by making election fraud a federal offense. They pointed out that states with mail registration systems also required an attestation of citizenship or eligibility and a signature under penalty of perjury, similar to the NVRA. Overall, proponents believed that the NVRA provided sufficient protection against election fraud. The NVRA, P.L. 103-31, was argued by proponents to provide protection against election fraud. No systematic evidence supports an increase in voter registration fraud due to NVRA implementation. The FEC and EAC have not identified this as a problem raised by states. No federal agency is responsible for NVRA implementation, with limited legal authority given to the FEC and EAC. The Department of Justice can sue states for non-implementation or violations but cannot mandate state compliance. The FEC released final rules for the design and content of the NVRA mail registration form on June 23, 1994. The form required eight data items including full name, address, birthdate, telephone number, voter ID number, party preference, and race. The NVRA mail registration form required specific data items such as full name, address, birthdate, telephone number, voter ID number, party preference, and race. Additional information included eligibility requirements, attestation of meeting state requirements, signature, warning about penalties for false information, and confidentiality statements. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 mandated new additions to the form. The NVRA mail registration form was updated to include questions about citizenship and age eligibility, instructions to stop filling out the form if not eligible, and requirements for including identification when mailing the form for first-time registrants. This was in compliance with the NVRA (P.L. 103-31) and the FEC's responsibility to produce biennial reports. The FEC (later the EAC) produced biennial reports assessing the impact of the NVRA on elections, with no specific instructions on content. Surveys were conducted to gather necessary information, resulting in 10 detailed reports on voter registration activity in states. The Federal Election Commission released its second report on the impact of the NVRA, based on responses from 43 states and DC. Voter registration in NVRA-covered states increased by 3.9 percentage points in 1996 compared to 1992, totaling over 12 million people. Almost 41.5 million registration applications were processed during the 22 months the act was in effect. During the 22 months of the NVRA being in effect, almost 41.5 million registration applications were processed nationwide. Two-thirds of the applications were new transactions, while the remaining one-third represented changes of names and/or addresses. A total of 8.7 million names were deleted from the registration lists, and voter turnout declined by five percentage points compared to 1992. The mail registration provisions caused few problems for states and accounted for nearly one-third of all voter registration applications. The motor vehicle provisions were the easiest to implement and yielded the highest volume of registration applications. The FEC's report recommended states to require applicants to provide at least the last four digits of their Social Security number, develop a statewide computerized voter registration database, and link their system with other public agencies. The FEC's third report released in 1999 found that voter registration increased by 7.7 percentage points in states covered by the NVRA, with 35.4 million registration applications processed nationwide. 17.6 million were new transactions, 15.5 million were changes of names/addresses, 9.0 million names were deleted, and 14.6 million were declared \"inactive.\" The 1997-1998 FEC report noted that voter registration activity increased by 7.7 percentage points in NVRA-covered states, with 35.4 million registration applications processed. 17.6 million were new transactions, 15.5 million were changes of names/addresses, and 9.0 million names were deleted. Additionally, voter turnout declined by 2.4 percentage points compared to 1994. The mail registration provisions of the NVRA caused few problems and accounted for a quarter of all voter registration applications during this period. Motor vehicle provisions were the easiest to implement, resulting in the highest volume of registration applications. State voter registration agencies accounted for 8.2% of voter registration applications. The FEC reiterated three recommendations from previous reports. The fourth FEC report, covering 1999-2000, showed a 1.1 percentage point increase in voter registration in NVRA-covered states. 45.7 million registration applications were processed, with 22.5 million being new transactions. 13.0 million names were deleted from registration lists, and 18.3 million were declared \"inactive.\" The report reiterated previous recommendations. The FEC report for 1999-2000 showed a 1.1 percentage point increase in voter registration in NVRA-covered states. 45.7 million registration applications were processed, with 22.5 million being new transactions. 13.0 million names were deleted from registration lists, and 18.3 million were declared \"inactive.\" The mail registration provisions of the NVRA caused relatively few problems for the states and accounted for nearly one-third of all voter registration applications. Voter registration via motor vehicle offices yielded the highest volume of applications. However, there were issues with timely forwarding of completed voter registration applications from motor vehicle offices during the recent election cycle. Voter registration at state agencies accounted for 7.6% of applications. The FEC made three recommendations and added four more based on the report findings. The report for the 2000 election added four recommendations based on experiences from that election: ongoing training for motor vehicle and agency personnel on NVRA duties, prompt electronic transmission of voter registration information, provision for casting provisional ballots on election day, and mailing notices to removed voters. The fifth report of the FEC, released in 2003, found that voter registration declined by 1.8 percentage points in states covered by the NVRA. A total of 37.5 million registration applications were processed, with 15.0 million names deleted and 20.6 million declared \"inactive.\" The FEC report in 2003 found that 37.5 million registration applications were processed, with 15.0 million names deleted and 20.6 million declared \"inactive.\" The NVRA caused few problems for states, accounting for 27.6% of all voter registration applications. Motor vehicle offices had the highest volume of registration applications at 42.8%. Voter registration at state agencies made up 5.8% of applications. Core recommendations included amending election laws. The NVRA report in 1999-2000 made core recommendations for states to amend election laws, develop statewide voter registration databases, and create a new class of mail for official election materials. Additional recommendations included implementing training programs for motor vehicle and agency personnel, transmitting voter registration information electronically, and establishing procedures for provisional voting. The 2001-2002 NVRA Report reiterated recommendations for states to improve fail-safe procedures, implement provisional voting procedures, and mail notices to those removed from voter registration lists. Most FEC recommendations were included in the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The sixth report by the EAC in 2003-2004 emphasized training programs for state motor vehicle and agency personnel. The 2003-2004 NVRA Report, released on June 30, 2005, showed a 1.7 percentage point increase in voter registration for states covered by NVRA provisions. A total of 49.6 million registration applications were processed, with 26 million being new transactions. 7.3% were duplicate registrations, 5.2% were rejected or invalid, and 15.2 million represented changes of names and/or addresses. 12.6 million names were deleted from registration lists. The EAC report highlighted that nearly 12.6 million names were removed from registration lists, with another 10.7 million declared \"inactive.\" Different methods of registration yielded varying percentages, with mail registration accounting for 32.4%, motor vehicle offices for 32.8%, in-person applications for 25.4%, and state voter registration agencies for almost 11%. The recommendations in the report aligned more closely with HAVA provisions for statewide voter registration databases by January 1, 2006. The EAC report emphasized the importance of electronic transmission of voter registration information, list maintenance through coordination with state and federal databases, and the development of statewide voter registration databases. The report covered the period 2005-2006 and was based on survey responses from all states, the District of Columbia, and four territories. The EAC report for the period 2005-2006 found voter registration increased by 2.1 percentage points to 76.3% of the voting-age population. A total of 36.3 million registration applications were processed, with 17.3 million new transactions and 2.2 million duplications. Additionally, 10.9 million transactions were changes of names and addresses, while 13 million names were deleted and 9 million declared \"inactive.\" Mail registration accounted for 22.8% of all applications. The EAC report for 2005-2006 showed a 2.1 percentage point increase in voter registration to 76.3% of the voting-age population. A total of 36.3 million registration applications were processed, with mail registration accounting for 22.8% of all applications. Motor vehicle offices received the highest volume of registration applications at 45.7%, while in-person applications accounted for 19.8%. Designated state voter registration agencies contributed over 11% of all applications. The report included recommendations to improve electronic reporting and list maintenance systems. The 2005-2006 EAC report recommended states standardize information for NVRA reporting, establish data collection systems, and provide training for voter registration agencies. The 2007-2008 report, released in 2009, was based on survey responses from states, DC, and territories. The 2007-2008 EAC report found that voter registration increased by 4.2 percentage points in states covered by the NVRA provisions. Over 60 million registration applications were processed, with 24.6 million representing new voters. About 20 million forms requested changes to name, address, or party, while 3.6 million were duplicates and 1.7 million were rejected. Over 12 million names were removed from registration lists due to various reasons such as death, felony conviction, and moving jurisdictions. Mail registration accounted for 28.8% of applications, while motor vehicle offices processed the highest volume of applications at 30.1%. In-person or office registrations made up 14.9% of applications, with 6% coming from state voter registration agencies. The EAC's eighth report included recommendations for states to improve electronic reporting systems, support coordinated data collection efforts, share best practices, use technology to ease workload, and encourage internet applications for voter registration. The EAC's ninth report, released in June 2011, recommended states to encourage voter registration updates and work towards a common understanding of election terms. Voter registration increased by 3.2 percentage points in states covered by the NVRA during the period of the report. During the 2009-2010 election cycle, 45.5 million registration applications were processed, with 30% being new voters. Over 18 million forms requested changes to name, address, or party affiliation. 2.9 million applications were duplicates and 1.4 million were rejected. 9.4% of applications were duplicates or invalid. 14 million registrants were removed for various reasons. During the 2009-2010 election cycle, 45.5 million voter registration applications were processed. Mail registration accounted for 20.9% of forms, while state motor vehicle agencies yielded 37.1% of applications. In-person registrations made up 14.5%, and 6% came from other state voter registration agencies. Internet applications constituted 1.7% of all applications. The EAC's ninth report contained no recommendations due to a lack of commissioners to vote on them. The 10th report, covering 2011-2012, found a 3.0 percentage point decline in voter registration for states under NVRA provisions. 62.5 million registration applications were processed, with nearly 23.8 million representing new voters. Nearly 27.5 million registration forms requested changes, with 3.7 million duplicates and 5.0 million rejected. 13.9% of applications were duplicates or invalid. 13.7 million registrants were deleted for various reasons. The 2011-2012 EAC report highlighted that mail registration accounted for 23.3% of voter registration forms, with state motor vehicle agencies receiving the highest volume of applications. In-person registrations made up 16.4% of applications, while over 6% came from other state voter registration agencies. Twenty-one states allowed online voter registration, making up 5.3% of all applications. The EAC's 10th report did not include official recommendations. The 2011-2012 EAC report did not contain official recommendations due to a lack of commissioners to vote on them. Instead, it offered observations on improving electronic reporting systems and engaging state agencies on NVRA issues. As of May 1994, 23 states had complied with the NVRA according to the Department of Justice. The Justice Department filed suits against California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina for not implementing the NVRA by January 1, 1995. Pennsylvania agreed to implement NVRA, while California and Illinois complied after court rulings. Montana was notified of its NVRA implementation failures and agreed to make corrections. Montana, Georgia, Texas, and Louisiana faced challenges in implementing NVRA procedures, but all eventually reached compliance. The Justice Department filed suits against New York, Indiana, and Missouri for NVRA violations related to voter registration agencies and list maintenance. Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas were among the states involved in these cases. During the period, private persons or organizations filed 86 cases related to NVRA enforcement. The Justice Department brought few suits against states, possibly due to perceived adequate enforcement, lack of resources, or policy decisions. Criticism has been directed at the lack of enforcement of agency-based voter registration provisions under the Bush Administration. The lack of state efforts in promoting agency-based voter registration under the NVRA has been highlighted. Despite a drop in applications in state voter registration agencies from 2007-2008, there was consistent application levels in 2003-2006. Criticism has been directed at the U.S. Department of Justice for failing to investigate non-compliance with public agency requirements. In early April 2009, Senator Charles Schumer urged Attorney General Eric Holder to enforce NVRA provisions in states not complying. Most states cooperated, aiming for NVRA implementation by January 1, 1995, but some states challenged or avoided the law. In an effort to avoid implementing the costly provisions of the NVRA, Idaho and New Hampshire passed legislation in 1994 adopting election-day voter registration retroactively to March 11, 1993. Congress later amended the NVRA date to August 4, 1994. Mississippi allowed NVRA implementation for federal elections only. The Supreme Court ruled that Mississippi violated the Voting Rights Act by implementing a dual voter registration system for state and local elections without seeking pre-clearance from the Justice Department. After the Supreme Court ruling, Mississippi was required to submit its dual registration system for approval by the Justice Department. A federal panel ordered Mississippi to allow NVRA-registered voters to participate in elections until a compliant law was enacted in 2000. Suggestions were made to amend the NVRA for easier administration and to prevent fraud, including requiring Social Security numbers on voter registration applications. The suggested changes to the NVRA include requiring a Social Security number on voter registration applications, changing the citizenship attestation to a yes or no question, eliminating second mailings to identified movers, and reducing the costs of mandated mailings. Election officials formed a task force to negotiate for these changes and work with the U.S. Postal Service. The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) conducted a survey of 43 states covered by the NVRA, showing gains in voter registration in every state. Most states reported that drivers' license bureaus were effective in registering voters, while transmittal difficulties were a common problem. Some states praised the NVRA for helping maintain accurate registration lists. Based on the most recent NVRA Report, voter registration increased significantly between the pre-NVRA 1992 presidential election and the 2012 presidential election. The implementation of the NVRA led to a notable rise in voter registration, with proponents hoping for increased voter participation as well. Comparing post-NVRA voter turnout to the 1992 presidential election might be misleading due to a third-party candidate. Voter turnout in NVRA covered states has varied between less than 47.6% in 1996 to over 56% in 2008. It is unclear if NVRA has impacted presidential election turnout, with a steady increase since 1996 but only 2008 exceeding 1992 turnout. The NVRA has been in effect for 18 years, with mixed evidence on its impact on voter turnout. The bill was not supported by most Republicans in the 103rd Congress, and a similar bill was vetoed by President Bush in 1992. There has been criticism of the NVRA as an \"unfunded mandate\" by several prominent Republican governors. Voter turnout in midterm elections has not shown much fluctuation since 1986. The NVRA, considered an \"unfunded mandate\" by Republican governors, faced repeal attempts despite Democratic opposition in the Senate and a veto threat from President Clinton. Bills in the 112th Congress aimed to establish same-day voter registration and allow for online voter registration. Legislation in the 112th Congress focused on voter registration, including proposals for online updates, automatic registration, voter ID cards, prevention of interference, and penalties for voter registration fraud. The Voter Empowerment Act of 2012 was also introduced. The Voter Empowerment Act of 2012 (H.R. 5799/S. 3608) proposed states accept voter registration from citizens 16 years and older, extended NVRA provisions to territories, and established a pilot program for disabled persons to register and vote from their residencies. In the 113th Congress, legislation was introduced to simplify voter registration processes, designate local facilities as voter registration agencies, and establish a \"National Month of Voter Registration.\" Many proposed bills mirrored those from the previous Congress, including the Voter Empowerment Act, FAST Voting Act, Same Day Registration Act, and VOTE Act. The Voter Registration Efficiency Act (H.R. 2115) aims to reduce duplicate voter registrations by requiring individuals to indicate their voting residence when registering. It is similar to the Interstate Cross-Check program in Arizona, which found 45,000 duplicate registrations in 2012. The 113th Congress is considering new legislative proposals related to voter registration, including the Students Voicing Opinions in Today's Elections (VOTE) Act (H.R. 653) and amendments to the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) to allow states to require proof of citizenship. Additionally, there is a call to strengthen the nation's electoral system. The NVRA has been in effect for over 20 years, with many initial issues resolved by the courts. The NVRA has been in effect for 18 years, with states largely complying with its provisions. Some issues remain at the local level and with training of officials for voter registration services. There are calls for voter registration reform, including universal voter registration. Calls for reform of the voter registration system in the United States include suggestions for minor changes to the NVRA, such as implementing automatic registration unless individuals choose to opt-out. The Congress is yet to decide on how to respond to these reform proposals. Calls for reform of the voter registration system in the United States include proposals such as requiring proof of citizenship and photographic identification to register and vote, repealing mail voter registration provisions, changing purge rules to make it easier to remove ineligible voters, and making failsafe voting optional. Additionally, legislation was introduced to require collaboration between the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Social Security Administration. The House Oversight Committee held hearings on various bills related to voter registration reform, including H.R. 1428, which aimed to establish a program for verifying the citizenship status of voters. H.R. 1428 was defeated in a House vote, leading to the introduction of H.R. 3485 by Representative Thomas to establish a pilot project in five states for a similar program. H.R. 3485, a revision of H.R. 1428, was reported out of the House Oversight Committee but was defeated in a House vote. A revised version, H.R. 3581, was introduced but also failed to pass. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998, H.R. 6, included an amendment requiring institutions of higher learning to distribute voter registration forms to students, which was modified in conference to require a good faith effort in states covered by the NVRA. The legislation required institutions of higher learning to distribute voter registration forms to students enrolled in degree or certified programs. It passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Clinton in October 1998. In the 106th Congress, bills were introduced to repeal the NVRA and address campaign issues. In the 105th Congress, Senator Warner introduced legislation (S. 1107) for campaign finance reform, which included amendments to the NVRA such as requiring Social Security numbers for voter registration and proof of citizenship at motor vehicle offices. In September 1999, Representative Luther introduced a bill (H.R. 2864) to allow same-day voter registration at polling places. No action was taken on these bills. In the 107th Congress, bills were introduced to reform the election administration process in response to the events of the 2000 Presidential election. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) was passed to address voter registration by creating the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and transferring responsibilities from the FEC to the EAC. The NVRA mandated the implementation of a centralized statewide voter registration list, required the use of driver's license or social security numbers on voter registration applications, and established procedures for list maintenance. In the 108th and 109th Congress, various bills were introduced to amend the NVRA, including requirements for proof of citizenship, standardizing treatment of ex-felons' voting rights, same-day registration, and pre-registration for voting. None of the bills progressed beyond committee assignment. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to require same-day or election-day voter registration, proof of citizenship, photo identification for voting registration, removal from registration lists for failure to vote, confidentiality of domestic violence victims' information on voter registration databases, and delaying the implementation of state voter registration database requirements.
