The Congress finds that digitizing information enables electronic commerce and communication, facilitated by miniaturization, distributed computing, and reduced transmission costs. The growth of the Internet and computer networks shows the potential for electronic commerce and communication to revolutionize business conduct. However, the full potential of the Internet for business is hindered by its insecurity regarding confidential information. Encryption of information is crucial for protecting confidential business and personal data from unauthorized access. It promotes economic growth by providing strong and flexible encryption capabilities to businesses and individuals in the United States. The communications and electronics businesses are at the forefront of the technology revolution, offering computer users worldwide strong encryption products. US businesses face competition from foreign companies with similar or stronger encryption offerings. Regulatory efforts have hindered further development and marketing of encryption products by US businesses. The government has promulgated standards and guidelines for encryption solutions that were not developed in the private sector and lack widespread commercial support. Outdated Federal controls have restricted US businesses from exporting strong encryption products. The Secretary of Commerce has tried to compel businesses to include specific features in products sold globally to cater to government needs. The Secretary of Commerce has proposed that US businesses sell encryption products with key escrow encryption, allowing the Federal Government access to decrypt information. This approach aims to regulate encryption and was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 1994. The Federal Government proposed a flawed and controversial encryption standard known as the \"clipper chip\" for key escrow encryption. They ignored the lack of commercial demand for government access to information and the availability of alternative encryption options. The Act aims to promote electronic commerce by encouraging US businesses to develop encryption products and prohibiting the Federal Government from implementing regulations that discourage encryption use. The Act aims to promote electronic commerce by encouraging US businesses to develop encryption products that protect confidentiality, ensure authenticity, and integrity of information. It restricts the Department of Commerce from imposing government-designed encryption standards and promotes the ability of US businesses to sell strong encryption software and hardware worldwide. The Act promotes electronic commerce by encouraging US businesses to develop encryption products that protect information integrity. It restricts government regulation of encryption sales and prohibits mandatory key escrow systems. It also sets conditions for selling encryption products internationally. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, \"as is\" refers to computer software that is not specifically designed for individual users, but may include software customized by users. \"Computing device\" is defined as a device used for computing purposes. The term \"computing device\" refers to a device with microprocessor-based central processing units capable of processing data. \"Computer hardware\" includes various components like systems, equipment, and integrated circuits. \"Decryption\" involves unscrambling communications using mathematical formulas, codes, or algorithms, while a \"decryption key\" is the information used to decrypt encrypted communications. The term \"designed for installation by the user or purchaser\" refers to computer software intended for user installation with supplied instructions. The term \"encryption\" refers to the scrambling of communications to preserve confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. A \"general license\" is a broad authorization for certain activities. A \"general license\" is a broad authorization that does not require a written application or prior authorization from the Secretary for certain types of exports. \"Generally available\" computer software, including encryption-capable software, is widely distributed online or for sale without restrictions. The term \"Internet\" refers to the international computer network of interconnected data networks, while the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce. The term \"State\" includes the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. territory or possession. SEC. 4. RESTRICTION OF DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ENCRYPTION ACTIVITIES: The Secretary of Commerce is restricted from imposing government encryption systems on businesses or entities other than Federal computer systems, and from restricting the export of computer hardware and software with encryption capabilities. SEC. 5. PROMOTION OF COMMERCIAL ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS. Prohibition on Restrictions on Sale or Distribution in Interstate Commerce: The Federal Government and States cannot restrict the sale of products with encryption capabilities in interstate commerce. This applies regardless of the encryption algorithm, key length, or implementation technique used. Additionally, there is a prohibition on mandatory key escrow requirements by the Federal Government or States. The Secretary has exclusive authority to control exports of computer hardware, software, and technology with encryption capabilities, except those designed for military use. Only a general license may be required for certain items. A general license may be required for the export or reexport of computer software, including encryption capabilities, that is generally available or in the public domain. The Secretary authorizes the export of computer software and hardware with encryption capabilities under a general license for nonmilitary end-uses in any foreign country. The Secretary permits exports of computer software and hardware for nonmilitary end-uses in foreign countries, except when there is evidence of diversion to military or terrorist purposes. The Act prohibits the unauthorized reexport of equipment for illegal interception of cable and satellite television signals. It does not affect laws preventing the distribution of descramblers."
