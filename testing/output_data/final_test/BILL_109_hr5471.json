    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Soledad Canyon Mine Leases Adjustment Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that Transit Mixed Concrete Corporation holds two valid Federal leases for sand and gravel extraction in Soledad Canyon, California, which contain approximately 56 million tons of resources. Mining under the leases would harm the environment and cause transportation issues for Santa Clarita. Cancelling the leases and issuing new ones is in the best interest of California and the Federal Government. TMC should be offered new leases in other areas of California with similar economic value, while receiving credit for development costs. A fair, environmentally friendly solution with minimal impact on transportation is needed. The Act aims to cancel leases CA-20139 and CA-22901, provide new leasing opportunities in Soledad Canyon, help TMC recover expenses, and assist the Bureau of Land Management in evaluating costs incurred by TMC. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"TMC\" refers to the Transit Mixed Concrete Corporation. \"Historical production levels\" mean production of 300,000 tons of aggregate produced for sale per calendar year. The Secretary will cancel Bureau of Land Management leases CA-20139 and CA-22901. In exchange for the economic value invested in these leases, the Secretary will provide TMC with other financial and mineral production opportunities. The economic value invested includes all amounts paid to the United States for the leases as bonus bids or prepayments, along with interest on these amounts. TMC will be reimbursed by the Secretary for amounts expended on securing and bringing leases into production, including engineering and legal costs. TMC must submit an itemized list of expenses within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will reimburse TMC for expenses related to securing and bringing leases into production. TMC must provide a detailed list of expenses within 90 days of the Act's enactment. If the Secretary disapproves the list, arbitration may be requested to determine the economic value invested. Financial and mineral production opportunities for TMC may take various forms. The Secretary will reimburse TMC for expenses related to securing and bringing leases into production. If agreement is not reached within 24 months, the issue will be referred to the United States Court of Federal Claims for resolution. Opportunities for TMC may involve interests in mineral or surface estate in Federal lands in California. The issue will be referred to the United States Court of Federal Claims for resolution, where the court will determine the economic value invested and order the Secretary to provide financial and mineral production opportunities. SEC. 5. LIMITATIONS ON FUTURE LEASING FOR SAND AND GRAVEL IN SOLEDAD CANYON AREA OF CALIFORNIA. The Secretary is restricted from issuing leases for sand and gravel mining in Soledad Canyon exceeding historical production levels. Consultation with relevant parties and consideration of environmental and transportation concerns are required before issuing any mining leases in the area."
