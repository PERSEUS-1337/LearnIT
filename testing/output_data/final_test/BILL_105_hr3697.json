The amendment to Section 903(b) of the Social Security Act establishes a solvency target for states. If a state fails to meet this target by December 31, 2001, the funds allocated for the succeeding fiscal year will be transferred to states that meet the requirements. Transfers will be based on each state's share of funds under subsection (a)(2), adjusted to exclude wages from non-compliant states. The solvency target for states is based on the average high cost multiple, representing the number of years a state could pay unemployment compensation. The reserve ratio is used to determine this target. The reserve ratio and benefit cost rate are key factors in determining a state's solvency target for unemployment compensation. The reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the balance in the State account by total covered wages, while the benefit cost rate is determined by dividing unemployment compensation paid by total covered wages. Wages and compensation paid by employers under section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are excluded from these calculations. Substantial progress towards achieving the solvency target by December 31, 2001, is defined for states. The solvency target for unemployment compensation is achieved when a State reduces the difference between 1.0 and its average high cost multiple by at least 5 percent. The Secretary can adjust the solvency target for States experiencing significant increases in unemployment. States must include this target in their annual plan for grant administration. The Secretary may request information from States on how they plan to achieve the solvency target for unemployment compensation grants. Amendments to the Social Security Act outline the distribution of excess amounts in the employment security administration account for Fiscal Year 2003. The excess amount in the employment security administration account exceeding $2,600,000,000 will be retained. SEC. 6 amends the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act by extending self-employment assistance. SEC. 7 addresses the treatment of short-time compensation programs. SEC. 7 addresses the treatment of short-time compensation programs, defining it as a voluntary program where employers reduce work hours instead of layoffs, allowing eligible employees to receive pro rata unemployment compensation. Employees receiving short-time compensation benefits are not required to meet work search requirements but must be available for their normal workweek. They can participate in approved training programs and may continue to receive health and retirement benefits as if their workweek had not been reduced. The State agency may also require employers to maintain benefits for employees in the program. The employer must submit a written plan for implementing the requirements of the program, as determined by the Secretary of Labor. Amendments are made to allow withdrawal of funds for short-time compensation programs. Amendments allow withdrawal of funds for short-time compensation programs under specific criteria defined by the Secretary of Labor. The provisions of the Act will take effect on the date of enactment, with extended benefit amendments coming into effect two years after enactment, or earlier with appropriate State law provisions."
