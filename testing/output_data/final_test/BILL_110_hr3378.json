    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"College Affordability for Working Students Act\". The Congress finds that approximately 2,660,000 students attend institutions on a less than half-time basis, with the average age of college students rising. Less than half-time enrollment allows students to balance school, work, and family demands. Job security in a global economy requires education beyond high school, as only 30 percent of American workers have a college degree. Students attending school less than half-time are not eligible for Federal subsidized student loans. Less than half-time students have limited and underutilized financial aid options. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION LOAN PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. Part G of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section for a Demonstration Loan Program. The Secretary is authorized to provide guaranteed and direct loans to less-than-half-time students for up to 6 terms in accordance with specific requirements. Terms and conditions for Federal Stafford loans and Federal Direct Stafford loans apply to guaranteed and direct loans made under this program. The Secretary will enter into participation agreements with eligible parties. The Secretary can provide guaranteed and direct loans to less-than-half-time students for up to 6 terms. Participation agreements can be made with eligible institutions or lenders, with a limit of 100 institutions or consortia. Terms and conditions will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary can require terms and conditions in agreements with eligible institutions for identifying part-time students seeking financial assistance and determining their education expenses. Agreements with both institutions and lenders must comply with Secretary's requirements for student loan information. The Secretary establishes terms for agreements with institutions and lenders regarding student loan information and financial liability. Procedures for withdrawal or termination from the program are also outlined. The loan under this section must be repaid according to a plan chosen by the borrower starting 6 months after they stop being enrolled. Repayment can be deferred while the borrower is enrolled as a student, even less than half-time, with no principal installments and interest covered by the Secretary for loans from eligible lenders. The Secretary can waive certain requirements for institutions in the program, allowing them to use the same cost of attendance definition for less-than-half-time students as for at least half-time students. The Secretary will evaluate the program annually. The lender in the demonstration program must meet participation agreement requirements, including program quality assurance. Evaluation criteria include student participation numbers, progress towards certificates or degrees, and comparison of persistence/completion rates with a similar student group. Obstacles to lender participation will also be assessed. The Secretary will report on evaluations of the demonstration program and propose statutory changes to improve student persistence and completion. The Secretary will oversee compliance of institutions and lenders in the demonstration program, provide technical assistance, and have necessary funds for fiscal years 2008 and beyond."
