The Secretary of Commerce will establish an early-stage business investment and incubation grant program to support early-stage businesses in targeted industries. Grants will be made to covered business incubators with limitations on the grant amounts based on non-federal capital availability. The grant program for covered business incubators has an aggregate amount limitation of $5,000,000. Grants are committed for a 5-year period and can be used for making investments in early-stage businesses in targeted industries. The grant program for covered business incubators has a $5,000,000 aggregate amount limitation over a 5-year period. The program supports early-stage businesses in targeted industries by providing training, counseling, purchased services, conducting due diligence activities, and meeting operational expenses. Limitations include not using more than 20% of the grant for purchased services and not exceeding 6% for due diligence activities. The covered business incubator grant program allows for a percentage of the grant to be used for due diligence activities and operational expenses. The grant recipient must specify how the funds will be allocated for different activities when applying for the grant. As a condition of receiving a grant under the covered business incubator program, the incubator must designate a fund manager and establish an investment committee to review proposals and advise on grant fund usage. The covered business incubator must assign a collaborator to each early-stage business assisted with grant funds. The Federal share of costs for activities cannot exceed 75 percent. Monitoring and evaluation of activities are required. The Secretary will assess the effectiveness of covered business incubators that receive grants under the program. Incubators must provide data on activities, jobs created, taxes paid, and other relevant information for evaluation. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for the program includes $250,000,000 for the first fiscal year after enactment, with additional funding as needed in subsequent years.
