    "content": "The \"Knife Owners' Protection Act of 2014\" allows for the interstate transport of knives. The term \"transport\" in this section includes various activities related to an individual's journey but excludes the transport of a knife with the intent to commit a serious offense. An individual not prohibited by Federal law may transport a knife between states if it is not easily accessible in a vehicle or is locked in a container. An individual may transport a knife in a locked container when using means of transport other than a motor vehicle. Temporary lodging allows for accessibility of the knife. Emergency knives for escape in a motor vehicle do not need to be secured in a locked container. An individual can transport a knife in a locked container, glove compartment, or console, without risk of arrest or detention, except if there is probable cause of non-compliance. This provision can be used as a defense in legal proceedings. In any civil or criminal action, an individual can assert a claim or defense under this section, with the burden of proof on the State or political subdivision in criminal cases. Any individual who violates the rights provided in this section can be held liable in a legal proceeding, with the court able to award attorney's fees. In any civil or criminal action, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party, defined as a party who receives a favorable resolution through a court decision, settlement, withdrawal of charges, or change of law. This section does not apply to States, political subdivisions, or their employees. Rule of Construction: This section does not limit the right to possess, carry, or transport a knife under State law."
