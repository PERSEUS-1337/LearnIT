    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Public Telecommunications Infrastructure Act of 1994\". It includes findings related to telecommunications. Congress finds that the US Government has consistently supported the development of public telecommunications services through various acts. It is in the public interest for all citizens to have access to these services through available technologies. New telecommunications technologies will enhance the ability of schools, libraries, local governments, public broadcast institutions, and nonprofit organizations to deliver and receive noncommercial governmental, educational, informational, cultural, civic, and charitable services throughout the United States. It is in the public interest that these entities be granted access to capacity on telecommunications networks for the purpose of disseminating and receiving noncommercial services. Telecommunications networks should provide free access to entities for affordable public access to governmental, educational, informational, cultural, civic, and charitable services. Telecommunications services are becoming increasingly important in Americans' lives, but current networks lack the necessary capacity and open access for diverse communications. Private telecommunications carriers may control access to networks with limited capacity and open architecture, potentially excluding those with fewer financial resources such as small town residents, minorities, and noncommercial organizations like schools and libraries. Without government intervention, these \"gatekeepers\" could restrict access to voice, video, and data communications. The Government has a compelling interest in providing broad access to telecommunications networks for a diversity of voices, viewpoints, and cultural perspectives, including those most likely to be excluded by private carriers. This benefits all members of the public who use these networks for information dissemination. The Government's interest in broad access to telecommunications networks for diverse voices and perspectives extends to improving democratic self-governance and local government services. Telecommunications networks utilize public rights-of-way and spectrum frequencies, and Congress asserts Federal jurisdiction to ensure access for educational and informational purposes. The Government asserts Federal jurisdiction over rights-of-way to require telecommunications networks to reserve capacity for public use. This reserved capacity should be accompanied by funding to provide noncommercial services for the public. SEC. 714 of the Communications Act of 1934 amends Title VII to address public rights-of-way. SEC. 714 of the Communications Act of 1934 amends Title VII to define key terms related to telecommunications networks and public rights-of-way. The term 'telecommunications network' refers to facilities transmitting telecommunications for the public, offering a choice of services. 'Public right-of-way' includes any government-controlled space used for telecommunications transmission. Within 365 days of enactment, the Commission must create regulations for owners of telecommunications networks to reserve capacity for public use. This reserved capacity is considered public property and owners have no control or liability over its content. The Commission shall presume a reservation of 20 percent of a telecommunications network's capacity for public use, but may require a lower amount based on technology and access barriers. Temporary reductions in reserved capacity may be allowed if unused. The Commission may temporarily reduce reserved public capacity of a telecommunications network if unused. Eligible entities can request to use the reduced capacity, and the Commission must provide sufficient capacity within 30 days. The quality of reserved capacity should be equivalent to the best available capacity of the network in all aspects. The Commission has the authority to reduce or eliminate obligations on a telecommunications network if it has sufficient open architecture and capacity. This does not affect the power of franchising authorities to collect franchise fees. Eligible entities can request to use reduced capacity within 30 days, with quality equivalent to the network's best available capacity. Entities eligible for access to public capacity reserved under this section include state, local, and tribal governments, accredited educational institutions, public telecommunications entities, public and nonprofit libraries, and nonprofit organizations described under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Terms and conditions of access for these eligible entities are outlined. Entities eligible for access to public capacity reserved under this section include state, local, and tribal governments, accredited educational institutions, public telecommunications entities, public and nonprofit libraries, and nonprofit organizations described under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The eligible entities have access to public capacity at no charge for specific purposes and the Commission will determine allocation mechanisms for redistribution among them. The Commission will establish a Public Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund within a year to provide economic support for eligible entities to utilize reserved telecommunications network capacity for noncommercial purposes. Regulations will be established to finance the Public Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund through contributions from owners and operators of telecommunication networks, a designated portion of a universal service fund, and other sources. Regulations will determine mechanisms for allocating funds to governments and specify that contributions to the Public Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund must start within 365 days of promulgation. The Commission will establish guidelines for distributing funds to eligible entities for providing noncommercial services, and require governments to create public advisory commissions representing these entities. The Commission will distribute funds to eligible entities in accordance with established guidelines to ensure a broad cross-section of recipients."
