    "content": "The United States distinguishes between temporary migration and settlement migration under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Foreign nationals can be admitted temporarily as nonimmigrants or permanently as immigrants (LPRs). Nonimmigrants are admitted for a specific period and purpose, including tourists, students, diplomats, and workers. U.S. immigration policy assumes all aliens are coming to live permanently, so nonimmigrants must prove otherwise. Nonimmigrants must demonstrate temporary stay and specific purpose to enter the US. The burden of proof lies with the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and visa type. Changing nonimmigrant categories requires filing a change of status application with USCIS. Leaving the US while the change is pending may result in the presumption of relinquishment. The report discusses policy tensions surrounding temporary admissions and nonimmigrant categories based on visa purpose. It covers periods of admission, grounds for inadmissibility, and circumstances for working in the US. Trends in temporary migration, changes in visas issued, and admissions are analyzed. Data on nonimmigrants establishing residence in the US is also included. Detailed tables on key admissions requirements for nonimmigrant visa types are provided. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, there was a surge in interest in nonimmigrant visas. Various legislative acts were passed to tighten procedures and oversight of aliens temporarily admitted to the United States, focusing on specific visa categories such as temporary workers and foreign students. Legislative revisions to temporary visa categories, including provisions for temporary workers and foreign students, have been implemented incrementally. Various laws in the 111th Congress addressed aspects of temporary admissions, such as more rigorous labor market rules for employers receiving TARP funding. Temporary migration is seen as important to the U.S. economy and cultural life, with a consensus on the need for more effective management. In 2009, the United States had a positive $21.9 billion trade surplus in travel and tourism spending because foreign visitors spent more in the United States than U.S. tourists spent abroad. International students contribute nearly $20 billion to the U.S. economy through their expenditures on tuition and living expenses. Expanding temporary worker programs would boost economic output and create new middle-class job opportunities for native-born Americans. Foreign visitors to the United States bring energy, ideas, and fresh perspectives. U.S. employers need the \"best and the brightest\" to boost economic output and create new job opportunities for native-born Americans. The ability to hire foreign temporary workers is crucial for economic growth and national security. Expedited processing of nonimmigrant visas can lead to missed opportunities for intercepting threats. Expedited processing of nonimmigrant visas can result in missed opportunities to intercept threats. Estimates show that hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their visas annually, leading to approximately 3.3 million to 6.2 million unauthorized aliens. Long-term temporary residents may weaken support for public investments among citizens due to their tenuous ties to the United States. The diversity of temporary migration categories contributes to the validity of these arguments. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, with 87 specific types currently issued. These visas are defined in the INA and include B-2 tourists, E-2 treaty investors, F-1 foreign students, H-1B professional workers, J-1 cultural exchange participants, and S-4 terrorist informants. A visas are for ambassadors and consuls, while official representatives of international organizations enter on other visas. Nonimmigrant visas cover various categories such as business visitors (B-1), foreign media workers (I), and tourists (B-2). Business visitors must receive their salary from abroad and not from a U.S. source. Tourists are encouraged to visit for pleasure, benefiting the U.S. economy. Tourists are the largest nonimmigrant class of admission to the United States, with many entering through the Visa Waiver Program. In FY2009, 16.2 million people entered under the VWP, constituting a significant percentage of all temporary visitors. The border crossing card (BCC) is issued to Mexican citizens for short-term entry for business or tourism. Mexican citizens can obtain a laser visa for business or tourism in the United States, valid for at least 10 years. The visa allows multiple entries and is a combined BCC/B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant visa. BCC holders are limited to visits within border zones of 25-75 miles in certain states. L visas are for intracompany transferees with executive or managerial roles, allowing multinational firms to transfer personnel to the US for 5-7 years. To be eligible for the L-1 visa, the foreign national must have worked for the multinational firm abroad for six months prior to transferring to a U.S. location. Spouses of L-1 nonimmigrants (L-2 nonimmigrants) can also work in the U.S. E-1 treaty traders or E-2 treaty investors must be citizens of a treaty country and show substantial trade or investment in the U.S. The E visa can be renewed indefinitely. The E visa, unlike most nonimmigrant visas, can be renewed indefinitely and requires a treaty between the U.S. and the foreign national's country. The E-3 visa is for Australian citizens and is issued for two years for specialty occupation work. Other temporary work visas include the H-1B for professional workers, H-1C for nurses, TN visas for Canadian and Mexican professionals, and H-2A/H-2B visas for seasonal workers. The H-1B, H-1C, and H-2B visas have numerical restrictions on annual admissions, while H-2A workers have no limit. O visas are for individuals with extraordinary ability in various fields, P visas are for internationally recognized athletes or entertainers. P visas are for internationally recognized athletes, sports teams, entertainment groups, performers in exchange programs, and culturally unique performers. R visas are for aliens working in religious vocations, while J visas, also known as the Fulbright program, are for cultural exchange. The J visa, also known as the Fulbright program, is a cultural exchange program that includes professors, students, teachers, and other participants. The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs approves these programs, allowing J visa holders to work and bringing their spouses and children as J-2 nonimmigrants. The Q visa is an employment-oriented cultural exchange program approved by USCIS, providing practical training and employment opportunities. Only employers can petition for Q visas. The F-1 visa is for foreign students pursuing full-time academic education, requiring acceptance by a government-approved school, proof of sufficient funds, scholastic preparation, and English proficiency. Spouses and children can accompany on F-2 visas, and practical training related to the degree program is allowed. F visa holders can work in practical training related to their degree program, including paid research and teaching assistantships. They can also participate in Optional Practical Training (OPT). M visa applicants must show acceptance to an approved school, financial ability, and scholastic preparation. Spouses and children can accompany M visa holders as M-2 nonimmigrants. K visas are available for fianc\u00e9s/fianc\u00e9es of U.S. citizens intending to marry within 90 days of admission. The V visa is for immediate relatives of LPRs with pending petitions for LPR status for three years. It allows families to reunite while waiting for LPR visas. The S visa is for informants in criminal investigations, T visa for human trafficking victims, and other criminal activity victims can get a visa by cooperating with prosecution. The U visa is available for individuals involved in criminal activities, such as domestic abuse, who cooperate with prosecution. The C visa is for aliens passing through the US to another destination, while the D visa is for alien crew members. The Departments of State and Homeland Security oversee nonimmigrant admissions, with DOS issuing visas and DHS inspecting arrivals. Both DOS consular officers and CBP inspectors must ensure aliens meet visa eligibility criteria. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines various grounds for inadmissibility, including health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, and more. Nonimmigrants must demonstrate they are not coming to settle permanently to qualify for a visa, with the \u00a7214(b) presumption being a common basis for visa rejections. Waivers may be granted on a case-by-case basis, except for security and terrorist-related grounds. Nonimmigrant visas like H-1, L, and V exempt applicants from proving they are not coming to live permanently. Nonimmigrants can have their legal status terminated for reasons like national security or working without authorization. Violating visa terms or committing a violent crime can also lead to status termination. Nonimmigrants who violate visa terms or overstay are considered unauthorized aliens and may face removal proceedings. Visas have two elements: duration of stay in the US and validity for entries. Various categories have specific time limits, such as A-1 ambassadors for the duration of their service and F-1 students until they complete their studies. Congress and the executive branch regulate visa lengths and extensions. The validity period of nonimmigrant visas is negotiated country-by-country and category-by-category, reflecting reciprocal relationships for U.S. travelers. For example, B-1 and B-2 visas from Germany are valid for 10 years, while those from Indonesia are valid for five years. The D crew member visa is valid for five years for Egyptians and one year for Hungarians. Nonimmigrants in the United States are generally not allowed to work, except for certain exceptions outlined in Table 2. Working without authorization is illegal and results in termination of nonimmigrant status. H-2 visas require employers to search for available U.S. workers and obtain certification from the Department of Labor. Labor attestation for H-1 workers is less stringent than labor certification. The market test required for H-1 workers, known as labor attestation, is less stringent than labor certification. Employers must attest that they will pay the nonimmigrant the prevailing compensation, provide suitable working conditions, and ensure no strike or lockout. H-1C nurses must also meet specific requirements related to wages, working conditions, recruitment of U.S. nurses, and anti-strike measures. In the United States, various employment-related visas are available for foreign nationals, including E investors, J cultural exchange visitors, L intracompany transfers, O extraordinary ability individuals, P internationally recognized athletes or entertainers, Q international cultural exchange participants, and R religious workers. Data on visa issuance and alien admissions are collected, with visas showing potential entries and admissions reflecting actual entries into the country. The lack of an exit registration system in the United States makes an actual count of out-migration impossible. In FY2009, the DOS consular officers issued 5.8 million nonimmigrant visas, with visitor visas for tourism and business comprising the largest group. Other categories of visas accounted for 29.3% of the total visas issued. In FY2009, non-tourist visas accounted for 29.3% of the total visas issued. This included 0.7 million students and exchange visitors (12.3%) and 0.5 million temporary workers, managers, executives, and investors (8.7%). Visa issuances fluctuated over the past decade, with a peak of 7.6 million in FY2001, a low of 4.9 million in FY2003, and 5.8 million in FY2009. Visitor visas for tourism fell by 40.7% from FY2000 to FY2003, rose by 34.3% from FY2004 to FY2007, and then dropped slightly by 8.5% in FY2009. The number of student visas issued fluctuated, falling by 23.9% from FY2000 to FY2003 and then rising by 51.5% through FY2009. Visas for diplomats and international organizations increased steadily. Employment-based nonimmigrant visas showed the impact of the economic recession, with temporary worker visas increasing by 48.1% from 2000 to 2007 and then dropping by 33.9% from 2007 to 2009. Intracompany transfer visas rose by 38.2% from 2000 to 2007 and decreased by 19.8% from 2007 to 2009. Investor and treaty trader visas increased by 11.3% from 2000 to 2007 and dropped by 14.8% from 2007 to 2009. The cultural exchange visas increased by 36.7% from FY2000 to FY2007 but dropped by 8.1% in FY2009. Nonimmigrant admissions data from DHS's Customs and Border Protection has limitations, as not all admissions are recorded and multiple admissions by the same person are counted. In 2009, CBP recorded 163 million nonimmigrant admissions to the United States, with Mexican and Canadian nationals accounting for the majority. Temporary visitors, including tourists and business visitors, dominated the admissions data. Other significant categories included students, workers, executives, investors, and cultural exchange participants. In 2009, CBP recorded 163 million nonimmigrant admissions to the United States, with tourists and business visitors being the majority. The trends show an increase in tourist entries on B-2 visas and VWP tourists, while business visitor numbers remained stable. The Guam Visa Waiver Program covers foreign nationals staying in Guam for up to 15 days. Overall, nonimmigrant admissions increased by 7.6% from FY2000 to FY2009. The I-94 admissions increased by 7.6% from FY2000 to FY2009, peaking at 39.4 million in FY2008. Admissions of temporary workers and other categories rose and then fell in subsequent years. Student admissions steadily rose by 36.0% over the decade. Asian nationals received the largest percentage of nonimmigrant visas in FY2009. In FY2009, nonimmigrant visas were issued to various regions, with 36.4% going to Asian nationals, 22.2% to North American nonimmigrants, 19.9% to South America, and 15.6% to Europe. The total number of visas issued by the Department of State decreased by 18.7% from 7.1 million in FY2000 to 5.8 million in FY2009. Visas issued to North Americans decreased by 45.3% and to Europeans by 17.1% over the decade. Visas issued to Asians decreased by 14.1% from 2.5 million in FY2000 to 2.1 million in FY2009. South America saw an increase of 40.0%, with visa issuances rising from 0.8 million to 1.2 million. Foreign nationals from Europe had the most I-94 admissions in FY2009 at 13.2 million, accounting for 36.5% of all admissions. Asia led in visas issued at 36.4% but only contributed 20.0% of I-94 admissions. North American countries accounted for 29.3% of I-94 admissions in FY2009. In FY2000, there were 8.7 million I-94 admissions from Asia and 7.8 million from North America. By FY2009, there were 10.6 million I-94 admissions from North America and only 7.2 million from Asia. The admission of foreign nationals from North America had increased by 36.2% in 10 years, while those from Asia fell by 17.2%. European I-94 admissions increased from 12.4 million in FY2000 to 13.2 million in FY2009. Oceania had 1.0 million admissions in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2000, there were 8.7 million I-94 admissions from Asia and 7.8 million from North America. By FY2009, there were 10.6 million I-94 admissions from North America and only 7.2 million from Asia. The overall ratio of visas issued by DOS to I-94 admissions recorded by CBP has fallen slightly from a 10-year high of 0.23 in FY2001 to 0.16 in FY2009. In FY2001, 7.6 million visas were issued and 32.8 million admissions, compared to 5.8 million visas and 36.2 million admissions in FY2009. The ratio of visas to I-94 admissions is lowest for Europe and Oceania, highest for Africa, with South America and Asia following. Africans are less likely to have visas for multiple entries compared to Europeans and Oceanians. The ratio of visas to I-94 admissions for foreign nationals from North America has decreased over the years. Visas issued to North Americans dropped from 2.8 million in FY2001 to 1.3 million in FY2009, while I-94 admissions increased from 7.8 million in FY2000 to 11.6 million in FY2007. This shift was mainly due to the issuance of biometric border crossing cards to Mexican visitors. In FY2009, the number of visas issued to Mexicans decreased to 0.7 million. Some nonimmigrant visas allow for longer stays, such as A-1 ambassadors, F-1 students, and R-1 religious workers. Resident nonimmigrants are foreign nationals with visas allowing them to establish residence. In 2008, the DHS estimated the resident nonimmigrant population in the US to be 1.8 million. The resident nonimmigrant population in the United States in 2008 was estimated to be 1.8 million. The majority were temporary workers, students, and exchange visitors. Most were aged 18 to 44, with a higher percentage of males. More than half were from Asian countries, with Europe and North America also represented. The top six countries accounted for over half of the total population. In 2008, India led with 21.9% of resident nonimmigrants, followed by Canada, South Korea, China, Mexico, and Japan. The number of resident nonimmigrant admissions decreased from 3.7 million in 2008 to 3.4 million in 2009, but nearly tripled over a 20-year period. Foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas must show they are not coming to reside permanently. In 2009, USCIS adjusted 667,776 foreign nationals to LPR status, with many originally entering the US as nonimmigrants. The H-1B visa often leads foreign students to become employment-based LPRs through US firms. Some policymakers view the transition from F-1 student visas to H-1B work visas to LPR status as a positive progression, while others see it as a way to bypass protections for U.S. workers. Research shows that a small percentage of foreign students directly adjust to LPR status, with more doing so after working as H nonimmigrants. About half of H-1B visa holders eventually become LPRs. According to data from the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, there is a data quality issue with last nonimmigrant status information for those adjusting to LPR status. Jeanne Batalova's analysis from FY1998 through FY2002 showed a flat percentage of foreign students adjusting, while the percentage of H nonimmigrant workers adjusting increased. The conventional route now is Optional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 students. The Department of Homeland Security reported 23,000 F-1 foreign students in STEM fields on OPT in 2008. To qualify for a 17-month extension, students must have STEM degrees, work for E-Verify employers, and have initial post-completion OPT. This extension allows U.S. employers two chances to recruit graduates through the H-1B process. Hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay visas annually, becoming unauthorized aliens. According to DHS, around 10.8 million unauthorized aliens were in the US in 2009, with estimates of 3.3 to 6.2 million nonimmigrant overstays. Regulations set terms for nonimmigrant stays, including residency requirements and limitations on activities. Policy complexity is illustrated in tables, posing challenges for policymakers. Table 1 and Table 2 provide details on limits and requirements for nonimmigrants staying in the US under different visa classifications. The tables also show labor market tests, entry limits, and the number of nonimmigrant visas issued in FY2009. Blank cells indicate where the law and regulations are silent on certain subjects."
