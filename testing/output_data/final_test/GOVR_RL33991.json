    "content": "The Washington Post published a series of articles in 2007 highlighting issues with outpatient medical care at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Media scrutiny revealed problems with infrastructure, cleanliness, and administrative systems in both DOD and VA facilities providing care to injured servicemembers returning from combat theaters. Delays and errors were also reported in processing retirement and other benefits for these servicemembers. Delays and errors in DOD's processing of retirement and other benefits for separating servicemembers, transitioning to veteran status, and VA's processing of veterans' benefits have been reported. Issues with understaffing and inadequate training of case workers assisting servicemembers and veterans have also been highlighted. Some reports have inaccurately described the roles of DOD and VA in providing healthcare and benefits to injured servicemembers. Problems faced by returning injured OEF/OIF servicemembers have been spotlighted, but disability evaluations are applied consistently across all servicemembers and veterans. Less than half of each department's disability evaluations are completed. The disability evaluation systems in the DOD and VA are strained by the complexity of OEF/OIF cases. Disability ratings range from zero to 100%, with ratings of 30% or greater making individuals eligible for lifelong military benefits. Less than half of disability evaluation caseloads involve OEF/OIF personnel. Some reports claim that the DOD underrates disability. A disability rating of 30% or greater entitles servicemembers to enhanced military benefits, including retirement pay and health insurance for the servicemember and their family. Veterans under the VA system with a service-connected disability rating of 10% or more receive monthly disability compensation, while a rating of 30% or more provides additional compensation for spouses and dependents. VA disability ratings can be revised over time as veterans file claims for changes in disability status related to prior military service. The disability evaluation systems at DOD and VA, along with civilian systems like the Social Security Administration and workers' compensation programs, have significant differences in process and basis for evaluation. These differences can lead to varying rating outcomes, impacting the financial situation of disabled individuals and benefits providers. The DOD and VA disability evaluation systems, along with civilian programs like the Social Security Administration, have significant differences in process and basis for evaluation. Some proposals suggest combining or linking these systems to improve outcomes, but challenges exist due to their different purposes. The Government Accountability Office has identified federal disability programs at SSA and VA as high-risk, citing outdated concepts of disability and missed opportunities for optimization. The DOD disability evaluation focuses on the impact of disabling conditions on military duties. It involves a two-step process to determine fitness for duty and rate service-connected disability based on various factors. The DOD evaluates servicemembers for fitness for duty and rates service-connected disabilities using the VASRD. This rating determines eligibility for benefits upon discharge. The DOD evaluates servicemembers for fitness for duty and rates service-connected disabilities using the VASRD to determine eligibility for benefits upon discharge. The VA evaluates a qualified individual's disability based on prognosis and its effect on employability in the civilian job market. No changes are made to the evaluation, rating, lump-sum payment, or pension once accepted by the servicemember. The VA evaluates all medical conditions incurred during military service, determining disability percentage rating for compensation and benefits. Reevaluation is possible for new conditions caused or aggravated by service. The VA evaluates medical conditions from military service to determine disability percentage ratings for compensation. Reevaluation may result in a different ranking. The SSA assesses eligibility for SSDI and SSI benefits based on disability, with SSDI for those below retirement age who paid into Social Security, and SSI for individuals with limited assets and income. Qualification requires a medically determinable impairment expected to last at least one year, rendering the person unable to work. SSDI and SSI benefits are based on disability, with SSDI for those below retirement age who paid into Social Security, and SSI for individuals with limited assets and income. SSDI benefit amounts are determined by career earnings covered by Social Security, while all SSI recipients receive a basic federal benefit that can be reduced by income received. Workers' Compensation (WC) is an employer-provided benefit that includes medical coverage and payments for lost wages, typically at 66\u2154% of the worker's usual wage. Workers' Compensation (WC) provides a percentage of the worker's usual wage during work-related disability, with full payment for necessary medical treatment until maximum medical improvement. Cost control measures may be used, and disputes can be resolved through an administrative proceeding. Total disability is compensated by a percentage of lost wages, while partial disability is evaluated in various ways across jurisdictions. The evaluation of partial disability in Workers' Compensation varies among jurisdictions, with three basic models: Impairment rating, Loss of earning capacity, and Actual wage loss. Additional criteria are applied to ensure that the loss of earnings is fully caused by the injury, and distinctions are made among types of injury. In Workers' Compensation, benefit limitations may differ for mental injury versus physical injury or occupational disease versus traumatic injury. States also specify types of injuries, such as loss of body parts, with standardized benefits. Return to work is a priority for state governments, insurers, and employers, with vocational rehabilitation included in all WC systems. Some employers offer private disability insurance for non-work-related disabilities. Private disability insurance is offered by employers to cover non-work-related disabilities. Employees make premium payments for insurance to replace lost income due to injury or illness. In the event of a battlefield injury, soldiers are stabilized in theater before being transferred to a combat support hospital or Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for specialized care. After stabilization in theater, injured servicemembers are transferred to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) in Germany for further treatment. Patients typically stay in Germany for about four to five days before being evacuated to higher-level Military Treatment Facilities in the United States, such as WRAMC or NNMC. Catastrophic burn patients are flown to Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) in Texas, which also has a specialized amputee rehabilitation center. Hospitalization continues until optimal medical care is achieved, and patients are discharged when ambulatory. When a servicemember is no longer hospitalized and can walk, they may transition to outpatient status. The length of stay in inpatient or outpatient facilities can be long, lasting months or even years. Servicemembers remain in the military until they separate from service. Disability evaluations are not done until the medical condition stabilizes. Active-duty servicemembers unable to work during recovery are placed on \"Medical Hold\" status. The DOD has strict criteria for enlisting in the military. For servicemembers potentially unfit for further service due to injury or disease, the DOD evaluates their fitness for retention in the Armed Forces. The determination of fitness is individualized based on medical criteria and the ability to perform military duties at a minimum level of competence, considering rank and duty position. Different MOSs may result in different fitness determinations for servicemembers with comparable medical conditions. When a military servicemember is deemed physically unfit for duty, they are referred to a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and then a Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) to assess their ability to perform military duties. The PEB determines the severity of the soldier's disability and their future status in the service. Trained counselors assist personnel throughout the informal, formal, and appeals procedures of the PEB process. The Physical Disability Evaluation System (PDES) involves the MEB and PEB processes, overseen by each branch of the Armed Forces. The MEB documents medical status and service connection, while the PEB determines disability rating and retention or separation decisions. Trained counselors assist military personnel throughout the process. The Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) consists of physicians and officers who make retention or separation decisions for servicemembers. PEBs can be conducted informally or formally, with a presumption of fitness for servicemembers until an injury or illness occurs. The PEB uses medical assessments from the Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) to determine if a servicemember meets retention standards. The Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) determines disability ratings based on fitness for military service. Servicemembers can appeal PEB findings, with final results forwarded for approval. Trained counselors, known as Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officers (PEBLOs), assist servicemembers in the disability process. The GAO has noted inconsistencies in PEBLO involvement and training among the Army, Air Force, and Navy. New programs by DOD and services support severely disabled OIF/OEF servicemembers. Five potential outcomes from the disability process include varying benefits based on years of service, service-connected disability, and disability rating. Lifelong benefits for those with 30% or greater disability ratings, while those with 20% or less receive a lump-sum severance payment. The military disability process outcomes include being found fit for duty, reclassified into a different job category, placed on the TDRL for up to five years with periodic reexaminations, and potentially being found fit for duty, having disability rating lowered with severance pay, or being permanently retired. While on the TDRL, servicemembers receive monthly retired pay and retiree benefits without military duties. The military disability process outcomes include being found fit for duty, reclassified into a different job category, placed on the TDRL for up to five years with periodic reexaminations, and potentially being found fit for duty, having disability rating lowered with severance pay, or being permanently retired. Disability benefits are not available if the injury or illness was not service-connected or due to willful misconduct. Severance pay is based on monthly basic pay and years of active service, with a maximum of two years of basic pay. Servicemembers with a disability rating of 30% or greater are generally retired with disability retirement pay calculated differently from longevity retirement pay. Retired servicemembers receive disability retirement pay based on the percentage of disability or 2.5% multiplied by years of service, capped at 75% of basic pay. They may also be eligible for VA disability compensation. Military retirees can now receive both VA and military retirement compensation under certain conditions. Disability retirement pay is generally taxable, except for combat-related injuries or for those in service before September 24, 1975. DOD aims for a consistent and timely physical disability evaluation process. The DOD aims for a consistent and timely physical disability evaluation process, but inconsistencies are inevitable due to services setting up their own processes. DOD has established timeliness standards for case initiation and processing, with specific timeframes for evaluation and completion of the MEB and PEB processes. However, GAO found that DOD has not monitored compliance with directives or overseen training of disability program staff. The Army Inspector General also noted that the Army was not meeting DOD timeliness standards. The Army was found to not meet DOD timeliness standards. Legislation required DOD and VA to explore consolidating disability evaluation systems. A joint pilot program was initiated in 2007 in Washington, DC to streamline the process and close the gap between active duty separation and VA benefits. VA conducts a single medical exam to meet DOD needs. The VA performs one medical exam to determine fitness for continued military service and rate disabilities. The DES pilot program involves a single rating system used by DOD for determining eligibility for military retirement benefits. DOD decides if a servicemember can remain on active duty or go through the VA disability evaluation process. In 2009, DOD modified the pilot to include an expedited DES process. The Secretary of Defense established a voluntary program to expedite servicemembers through the Disability Evaluation System (DES) for those with \"catastrophic\" conditions incurred in the line of duty. These conditions are severely disabling, requiring assistance for daily living. Participants will receive a 100% combined rating from DOD and access to VA benefits. As of November 2009, around 5,431 servicemembers have taken part in the pilot program. The pilot program for expedited servicemember disability evaluation has been successful, with around 5,431 participants as of November 2009. It is available at selected military facilities and is expanding to cover all of DOD. An interim evaluation in November 2008 showed favorable results. Some veterans may be eligible for additional financial assistance through DI and SSI. SSA has partnered with DOD and VA to ensure awareness and application for civilian financial assistance. SSA has partnered with DOD and VA to provide benefit information to wounded warriors, primarily servicemembers from OIF and OEF. Approximately 7,600 wounded warriors have been approved for SSA benefits out of 16,000 applicants. SSA has made efforts to educate wounded warriors on benefit options and expedite processing, but outreach has faced challenges. Outreach efforts to wounded warriors have faced challenges, such as delays in filing for benefits due to combat injuries like TBI and PTSD. Lack of coordination between VA and SSA leads to misinformation among veterans. Delays in receiving medical records from DOD hinder SSA's processing of claims. GAO proposed recommendations to improve access to SSA benefits for wounded warriors. The veterans disability evaluation process involves applying for disability compensation payments, which are determined by the VA disability rating. This rating also impacts the priority system for veterans' health care services. Various proposals are being considered to improve benefits for wounded warriors, including amending retroactive benefit periods and streamlining medical record transfers from DOD to SSA. The VA disability rating is crucial for disability compensation applications, requiring details on military service and medical conditions. Veterans must have served actively and been discharged honorably, with a current service-connected medical condition. While recent veterans have easier access to necessary data, those filing claims years later may face challenges in providing required documentation. A disability claim filed 15 years after service may require contacting multiple physicians for medical documentation. Veterans out of the military for years may need VA or DOD assistance in obtaining necessary discharge or medical records. Once all documentation is gathered, a compensation and pension examination is conducted at a VA facility, focusing on the body system relevant to the disability claim. The disability rating for veterans is determined through a compensation and pension examination at a VA facility. Ratings are done in increments of 10% from 0% to 100% based on the impact on civilian employability. The rating is reviewed and confirmed by specialists, with a letter sent to the veteran explaining the basis for the rating. Veterans have the right to appeal the determination, but current or potential future earnings are not considered in the evaluation. The evaluation for veterans' disability payments considers their unemployability and disability percentage, with additional payments for aid and attendance. Issues with geographic variations in disability ratings and lack of monitoring in the evaluation process have been noted. The VA's claims process has a large number of pending entitlement claims, with OIF/OEF servicemembers being the first priority. The increase in claims is attributed to factors like the military's size, aging veteran population, and outreach efforts. The Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 2008 established an Advisory Committee on Disability Compensation within the VA. The Advisory Committee on Disability Compensation within the VA advises the Secretary on revisions to the VASRD and veterans' ongoing needs for disability compensation. It has 18 members and must submit biennial reports to the Secretary by October 31, 2010, with copies to Congress within 90 days. Federal statutes define various components and types of military service, determining eligibility for different government benefits. The term \"armed forces\" includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. The National Guard consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, which are part of the organized militia of states and territories. The Army National Guard of the United States is the reserve component of the Army, with all members also belonging to the Army National Guard. The Air National Guard is also part of the organized militia of states and territories. The National Guard is the organized militia of states and territories, supported by federal funds and federally recognized. The Air National Guard is a state entity and the reserve component of the Air Force. The term \"reserve\" refers to enlistment or appointment in the armed forces. The reserve active-status list contains names of officers in active status. Active duty refers to full-time duty in the active military service of the United States, including training and attendance at designated schools. Active service includes service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty. Active status pertains to members of a reserve component not in inactive National Guard duty. The status of a reserve component member not in inactive National Guard duty, on an inactive status list, or in the Retired Reserve changes upon discharge from the military. Not all discharged service members are considered veterans for Veterans Affairs benefits. Services and benefits provided during military service may not be available post-discharge. Eligibility for benefits may vary. After discharge, not all service members are considered veterans for VA benefits. To qualify, a person must have served in the active military, naval, or air service and been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. The VA determines veteran status based on service records and other factors, affecting future benefits. To be considered a \"veteran\" eligible for VA benefits, a person must have served in active military, naval, or air service, during a time of war, and meet length of duty requirements. This status allows access to benefits such as health care and education provided by the VA."
