    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act of 2000\" introduces health care fees for prisoners in federal institutions under Chapter 303 of title 18, United States Code. This includes the addition of a new section, Sec. 4048, which outlines fees for health care services for prisoners. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'account', 'Director', 'health care provider', 'health care visit', and 'prisoner'. These definitions clarify the roles and responsibilities within the context of the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act of 2000. The Director may assess and collect fees for health care services provided to prisoners, excluding preventative, emergency, prenatal care, and chronic condition services. The Director may assess and collect fees for health care services provided to prisoners, excluding preventative, emergency, prenatal care, and chronic condition services. The fee shall be collected from the prisoner receiving health care services or the prisoner responsible for an injury resulting in the need for health care services, with a minimum fee of $1, and no consent from the prisoner is required for collection. The law allows for the collection of fees from prisoners' accounts without their consent, but prisoners can dispute the fee amount. Treatment cannot be refused based on financial reasons, and collected amounts from prisoners with restitution orders must be paid to victims. Prisoners' fees collected by the Director are allocated with 75% going to the Crime Victims Fund and 25% for administrative expenses. Prisoners must be informed of the law, and fees cannot be assessed if they are unable to pay. Prisoners must be provided with written and oral notices of regulations before fees can be assessed or collected. Fees for services provided before this notice period cannot be collected from prisoners. Before the public comment period for proposed regulations, the Director must notify advocacy groups and prisoners. The Director must also report to Congress annually on the amounts collected and the impact on healthcare visits by prisoners. The Bureau of Prisons must provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS services to federal prisoners when medically appropriate without charging a fee. The annual report to Congress must include information on healthcare visits by prisoners, program costs, inmate health status indicators, and the quality of healthcare services provided. Section 4013 of title 18, United States Code, allows State or local governments to assess and collect reasonable fees from Federal prisoners in non-Federal institutions for health care services. State or local government may charge fees for health care services provided to Federal prisoners, as long as the fees are authorized by State law, do not exceed the amount charged to State or local prisoners for the same services, and are provided by licensed healthcare professionals. The services must be considered a health care visit, not including preventative care, emergency services, prenatal care, chronic infectious disease treatment, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment. Financial reasons cannot be used to refuse treatment. The subsection prohibits refusal of treatment to prisoners based on financial reasons. Prisoners must be informed in writing and orally about this provision. Fees cannot be assessed or collected until 30 days after providing notices to all prisoners. The implementation of this subsection by the State or local government, and any amendment to that implementation, shall not take effect until 30 days after providing written and oral notices to all prisoners. Fees cannot be assessed or collected before this notice period. The proposed implementation of the subsection must be open to public comment and notice must be provided to advocacy groups and prisoners. Any State or local government collecting fees under this subsection must provide comprehensive HIV/AIDS services to Federal prisoners when medically necessary, without charging a fee for this coverage. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
