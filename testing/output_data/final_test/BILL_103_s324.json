The \"Fair Trade in Grain Act of 1993\" defines terms like \"entry\" and \"foreign grain\" and requires an end-use certificate for the entry of foreign grain into the US customs territory. The \"Fair Trade in Grain Act of 1993\" mandates that consignees of imported foreign grain must submit quarterly reports certifying the usage of grain covered by an end-use certificate. The content of the end-use certificate and quarterly reports must meet the requirements set by the Secretary of Agriculture. The end-use certificate for imported foreign grain must include the importer and consignee's name and address, country of origin, grain description, purpose of use, and transporter details. Quarterly reports must contain similar information as the end-use certificate. The quarterly reports required under subsection (b)(2) must include the identification of end-use certificates held by the consignee, quantity of foreign grain used, details of use made by the consignee, and quantity of wheat, barley, and oats exported. The Secretary of Agriculture will prescribe regulations for the preparation and submission of these reports. Penalties for violating end-use certificate requirements include customs penalties treated like other customs documentation and civil penalties up to $10,000. Entry of foreign grain is prohibited without presenting a compliant end-use certificate. SEC. 3. USE OF EXPORT ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM TO PROMOTE WHEAT EXPORTS TO MEXICO.
