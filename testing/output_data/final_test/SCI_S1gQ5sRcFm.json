This approach improves speed and functionality without sacrificing fidelity, as shown in synthetic video evaluations and 3D scene reconstruction applications. Stochastic video prediction models can efficiently generate future frames from a given set, enhancing speed and functionality without compromising quality. Reconstructions and videos can be viewed at https://bit.ly/2O4Pc4R. The ability to predict and visualize future events based on past experiences is a crucial cognitive skill. By observing a person in uniform approaching with a letter, one can easily anticipate their actions. This skill allows for flexible extrapolation and interpolation in visual scenes. The ability to predict and visualize future events based on past experiences is crucial for flexible extrapolation and interpolation in visual scenes. Traditional video prediction setups frame the task as sequential forward prediction, but this can be limiting as it requires generating all intermediate frames. Existing models often inefficiently produce unnecessary intermediate frames. Our model for video prediction is \"jumpy\" as it can directly sample frames in the future, bypassing intermediate frames. It is flexible at filling in gaps in data and can sample frames at arbitrary time points in a video. The model is not autoregressive and processes input and output frames in parallel. The model, JUMP, can sample frames at arbitrary time points in a video, maintaining diversity in predictions. It uses a stochastic latent to render frames based on the input frames. The model JUMP can render frames at arbitrary time points in a video using a sampled latent, capturing correlations over multiple frames. It is not limited to video prediction and can generate consistent images for occluded regions when conditioned on camera position. JUMP performs well on synthetic video prediction tasks, producing high-quality frames and reliable convergence. Additionally, it can be applied to stochastic 3D reconstruction by conditioning on camera location instead of time. JUMP introduces a dataset with images of 3D scenes containing a cube with random MNIST digits. It outperforms GQN on capturing correlated frames of occluded regions. The focus is on synthetic datasets to quantify how models handle stochasticity. The key contribution is formulating the problem of jumpy stochastic video prediction, where consistent target frames are predicted at arbitrary time points given context frames. Check the project website for experiment videos. The model presented in the curr_chunk focuses on consistent jumpy predictions in videos and scenes by sampling output frames in parallel and enforcing consistency through training on multiple correlated targets. The experimental results show that the model outperforms existing sequential video prediction models and produces high-quality images. Additionally, a dataset for stochastic 3D reconstruction is developed, demonstrating superior performance compared to GQN. The model in the curr_chunk outperforms GQN in stochastic 3D reconstruction and video prediction. Various models, such as Video Pixel Networks and sSSM, are discussed for generating frames in stochastic environments. JUMP extends the spectrum of models by generating frames faster and more flexibly in stochastic environments. Unlike traditional 3D reconstruction methods, JUMP does not require a predefined description of the 3D structure, making it suitable for a wider range of tasks. Research in 3D reconstruction can be categorized into traditional methods that handcraft a feature space and neural approaches that learn an implicit representation directly from data. The aim of models is to learn image distribution rather than 3D structure. Viewpoint transformation networks focus on structure but with limited transformations. GQN is used for spatial prediction but struggles with stochastic 3D reconstruction. The task can be seen as few-shot density estimation related to meta-learning for few-shot classification tasks. In few-shot density estimation for image generation, models with variational memory, attention, and conditional latent variables have limitations in querying specific target points. Neural processes can query density at specific points but are limited to low-dimensional datasets. The focus is on scenes consisting of viewpoint-frame pairs for videos or spatial data. The model generates viewpoint-frame pairs for scenes, with each scene split into a context and a target. The model parameterizes a conditional distribution to sample frames corresponding to target viewpoints. The training objective is to find model parameters that maximize the log probability of the data by sampling frames from a conditional distribution. JUMP uses a prior to sample a latent variable conditioned on input frames and viewpoints, rendering it at arbitrary viewpoints. The model encodes viewpoint-frame pairs of the context independently and aggregates them to obtain a single representation for sampling a latent variable. The JUMP model uses a prior to sample a latent variable conditioned on input frames and viewpoints, allowing for the generation of output frames from a single consistent scene. The representation network is a convolutional network, while the rendering network is implemented as an LSTM. These building blocks are customizable, with the latent variable being sampled using a convolutional DRAW prior. The JUMP model utilizes a prior to sample a latent variable conditioned on input frames and viewpoints for generating output frames. The model is trained using an approximate posterior to maximize the log probability of the data under the model through the evidence lower bound (ELBO) formulation. The ELBO consists of two terms: the reconstruction probability and the KL divergence from the approximate posterior to the conditional prior. Gradients are propagated using the reparameterization trick. The JUMP model uses the reparameterization trick to compute the KL divergence for Gaussian probability distributions. Gaussian noise is added to the output frame during training, with the variance annealed down over time. Evaluation is done on synthetic video prediction and 3D reconstruction tasks. Results are presented on \"narrative\" datasets describing shape interactions. The JUMP model is a flexible video prediction model that can handle arbitrary sets of input and output frames. It is evaluated on synthetic video prediction tasks with narrative datasets describing shape interactions. The datasets consist of videos with shapes moving and changing colors, sizes, and positions randomly. The number of distinct instances in a Traveling Salesman narrative with 5 shapes is over 260 billion. JUMP outperforms existing models and can accurately predict complex frame sequences. The JUMP model is compared with other models for video prediction on the Traveling Salesman narrative dataset. The evaluation involves taking 30 sample continuations for each video and computing the minimum mean squared error between the samples and the original video. JUMP outperforms other models in predicting complex frame sequences. The study compared the JUMP model with other video prediction models on the Traveling Salesman dataset. The evaluation involved testing different hyperparameter configurations and running the models for 3 days using distributed ADAM on 4 Nvidia K80 GPUs. Runs with poor metric scores were discarded for some models to benefit others. The study compared the JUMP model with other video prediction models on the Traveling Salesman dataset. Evaluations were done to benefit SV2P and sSSM, using all runs for JUMP. The plot with error bars is shown in FIG1. In the \"Color Reaction\" narrative, shapes change and our model can roll a video forwards, backwards, or both ways. The Traveling Salesman narrative involves shapes moving in a stochastic order, captured by JUMP, sSSM, and SV2P with some artifacts. BADJ, lacking consistency features, fails to capture a coherent narrative. Our model outperforms sSSM, SV2P, and CDNA in reliability and performance on the Traveling Salesman dataset. By avoiding back-propagation through time, our model converges more reliably. Qualitative comparisons in FIG0 show samples from JUMP, sSSM, and SV2P, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. JUMP, labeled as 'BADJ', includes essential architectural components for coherent video generation. It outperforms video prediction models in lower test errors and negative test ELBO scores. JUMP also demonstrates consistent 3D reconstruction capabilities. JUMP, labeled as 'BADJ', excels in coherent video generation by sampling frames in occluded regions of a scene. The model showcases consistent frame sampling in uncertain scenarios, outperforming GQN on a 3D dataset with randomly positioned cubes displaying MNIST digits. Videos of experiments can be viewed at https://bit.ly/2O4Pc4R. JUMP outperforms GQN on a 3D dataset by capturing coherent scenes, unlike GQN which samples frames independently. In a test example, JUMP consistently renders an unseen digit across different viewpoints, accurately capturing the ground truth digit. This shows JUMP's capability in sampling the target compared to GQN. JUMP captures correlations between frames in a 3D dataset, increasing the probability of accurately rendering an unseen digit compared to GQN, which samples frames independently. In practice, the benefits of consistency in model training may trade off with rendering accuracy. Comparing test-set ELBOs is important to evaluate model performance. JUMP samples consistent digits for unseen faces, while GQN may result in inconsistent scenes. The results show that JUMP outperforms GQN in 3D reconstruction. Analyzing the consistency of JUMP, the KL divergence from posterior to prior is measured. JUMP shows consistency with additional target frames, while GQN does not exhibit the same level of consistency. The JUMP model demonstrates consistency in its predictions, with a mean KL divergence of 4.25 for KL 3 and 4.19 for KL 1. This architecture allows for learning generative models in the visual domain that can be conditioned on various factors, enabling extrapolation in time and space without the need for intermediate frames. One limitation is the fixed size of the stochastic latent representation, which may restrict its expressivity in complex applications. Further testing on more intricate datasets is recommended. Future work includes fixing limitations in the JUMP model and testing on more complex datasets, particularly in video prediction to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance. The model is trained by maximizing an evidence lower bound, similar to variational auto-encoders, with a focus on matching the posterior to the prior to keep the KL low. This approach allows for jumpy predictions that look many frames ahead, dividing time into discrete periods for exploring possible futures. The training objective aims to match the posterior to the prior to keep the KL low, making model predictions deterministic. The pixel-variance affects the ELBO loss, with a balance needed for good reconstructions and samples. Linear annealing of pixel-variance is used over training steps. Other models have similar hyper-parameters for KL divergence. For the traveling salesman dataset, a convolutional net with 4 layers is used for the encoder network. Different parameters are used for the MNIST Cube 3D reconstruction task, including nt: 6, nf to hidden: 128, nf dec: 128, and a unique annealing strategy for pixel-variance. For the MNIST Cube 3D reconstruction task, a unique annealing strategy is employed for pixel-variance. The strategy involves keeping the pixel-variance at 2.0 for the first 100,000 iterations, then reducing it to 0.2 for 50,000 iterations, increasing it to 0.4 for another 50,000 iterations, and finally setting it at 0.9 until the end of training. This approach aims to maintain high KL values initially for deterministic predictions, then capture stochasticity with low pixel-variance, and ensure similarity between prior and posteriors by increasing pixel-variance. Hyper-parameter optimization was done through grid search for various stochastic video prediction models. During hyper-parameter optimization, a grid search was conducted by varying size parameters, learning rate, and KL divergence control parameter. Values slightly above and below the best-performing ones were tested."
