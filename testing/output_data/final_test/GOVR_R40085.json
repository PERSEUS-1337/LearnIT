    "content": "When a new Congress convenes in January, one of its first tasks is to receive the President's annual budget submission for the upcoming fiscal year. The budget includes proposals on spending, revenue, and debt levels, which Congress can accept, reject, or modify. The deadline for the budget submission is the first Monday in February. Congress then begins considering the budget resolution and other related legislation. The budget resolution, in the form of a concurrent resolution, guides spending, revenue, and debt measures in Congress. The deadline for the President's budget submission aims to balance time for budgetary legislation before the new fiscal year. In order to enact significant budgetary legislation in a timely manner, Congress sets a deadline for the President's budget submission, ranging from the first week in January to the first week in February. This allows time for legislative action before the new fiscal year begins. The President's budget is traditionally submitted on the first Monday in February, in accordance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This act also moved the start of the fiscal year from July 1 to October 1, providing Congress with more time to process budgetary legislation. Since the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, five Presidents have submitted budgets - Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. The transition between administrations raises questions about budget submission deadlines and requirements, which have changed over the years. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1933, requires each new Congress to convene on January 3 and provides a January 20 beginning date for a new President's term. The deadline for budget submission has changed over the years, allowing outgoing Presidents before 1990 to submit budgets. The deadline for budget submission changed in 1990, allowing outgoing Presidents to leave it to their successors. Outgoing Presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan submitted budgets on time, while incoming Presidents Carter and Reagan submitted revisions. President George H. W. Bush did not submit a budget for FY1994. President Clinton submitted the original budget for FY1994. The original budgets for FY1994 and FY2002 were submitted by Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively. Transition budgets during the congressional budget process have been comparable in timing to earlier years. Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Nixon submitted revised budget messages in their first year, while Presidents Reagan, Clinton, and George W. Bush provided general economic and budgetary policy outlines during their transitions. President Reagan, Clinton, and George W. Bush outlined their economic and budgetary policies in special messages to Congress in February, accompanied by joint session addresses. Reagan's plan was titled \"America's New Beginning: A Program for Economic Recovery,\" Clinton's was \"A Vision of Change for America,\" and George W. Bush's was \"A Blueprint for New Beginnings: A Responsible Budget for America's Priorities.\" President George H. W. Bush submitted a 193-page message to Congress titled \"Building a Better America\" along with a joint address on February 9, 1989, which included revised budget proposals. Cooperation and conflict between the President and Congress, as well as within each chamber, impact the federal budget process. To advance his budgetary agenda, a President must reach agreement with Congress in different phases of the budget process. The budget process involves Congress responding to the President's proposals by adopting an annual budget resolution and implementing policies through separate legislation. Success is measured by timely enactment of legislation, with key actions completed during presidential transition years. The budget process involves Congress enacting budget resolutions, reconciliation acts, appropriations acts, revenue bills, and debt-limit measures each year. Key actions are typically completed during presidential transition years. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires the House and Senate to agree on a budget resolution each year. The deadline for this resolution was originally set for May 15, then changed to April 15 in 1985. Despite delays in the past, final agreements were reached in each of the past five transition years, with most agreements reached in May. The budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 that operates as an adjunct to the annual budget resolution process. Its chief purpose is to enhance Congress's ability to change current law to align with the policies of the budget resolution, making it a potent budget enforcement tool. Reconciliation is a potent budget enforcement tool for Congress, first used in 1980. From 1980 to 2008, 19 reconciliation measures became law, with three vetoed. The process has no strict deadline, and the time to pass reconciliation legislation varies. The reconciliation process, used as a budget enforcement tool by Congress since 1980, has seen varying timelines for approval or veto by the President. The time taken ranged from 27 days to 384 days, with an average completion time of nearly five months. Reconciliation was utilized in four out of five transition years, with omnibus budget reconciliation acts being enacted at different times during the year. Total federal spending includes discretionary and mandatory spending. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees handle annual appropriations legislation, including regular, supplemental, and continuing appropriations acts. The budget process aims to complete action on these acts by October 1. Additionally, there are usually supplemental appropriations acts and continuing resolutions for stop-gap funding after the fiscal year begins. During the congressional budget process, the House and Senate aim to complete regular appropriations acts by October 1, but often resort to continuing resolutions for stop-gap funding. Multiple continuing resolutions are typically enacted each year, with supplemental appropriations acts also being common. During the congressional budget process, regular appropriations acts are aimed to be completed by October 1, but often continuing resolutions are used for stop-gap funding. Multiple continuing resolutions are enacted each year, with supplemental appropriations acts also being common. The appropriations process under different administrations varied in terms of completion timeframes, with some extending into January. During the G.W. Bush administration, eight continuing resolutions were enacted, with the final one providing funding into January. Revenue legislation originates in the House of Representatives, but the Senate can amend it. Presidents often propose changes to revenue laws, such as altering tax rates or modifying the tax burden. Revenue acts can be initiated through the reconciliation process to alter tax rates and modify the distribution of the tax burden. The timing of enacting major revenue legislation can vary, with some measures passing quickly while others may take longer. This process has been used under various administrations, including G.H.W. Bush, Clinton, and G.W. Bush. Table 7 shows that major revenue measures were enacted during the transition year of each of the five administrations, with timely congressional action in most cases. The Treasury Department handles federal borrowing within a statutory debt limit, which has mostly seen increases but occasionally reductions. The annual budget resolution includes recommended public debt limit levels for each fiscal year. The budget resolution recommends public debt limit levels for each fiscal year. Congress and the President must pass legislation to implement these policies, with three ways to adjust the debt limit: regular legislative procedures, the Gephardt rule, or budget reconciliation. Since 1940, there have been 88 measures adjusting the debt limit, with most done through regular legislative procedures. Between one and three debt limit measures were enacted during each transition year, except during the G.W. Bush administration. All three methods of adjusting the debt limit were employed, with only one measure being a reconciliation act in 1993 during the Clinton transition year."
