    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14005.12 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to establish income levels for maintenance need for medically needy persons to meet basic needs, without reducing aid payment levels. The department will seek federal authorization to maintain income levels for maintenance for medically needy persons at the levels in effect on June 30, 1991. If federal authorization is not obtained, medically needy persons will not have to pay the difference in share of cost between June 30, 1991, and July 1, 1991, and thereafter. Medically needy persons eligible for benefits under this chapter as categorically needy before reductions in minimum basic standards of care in 1995-96 will not be responsible for their share of cost under certain conditions. The eligibility for benefits under this chapter as categorically needy may be terminated due to reductions in minimum basic standards of care. The income level for maintenance per month is calculated based on a percentage of the amount paid to a family of two persons under certain conditions. The income level for maintenance per month is determined based on federal guidelines for families of two adults, with adjustments for specific circumstances such as medical care in institutions or nursing facilities. The department may annually increase the amount for personal and incidental needs based on the California Consumer Price Index. A long-term health care facility cannot charge for laundry services or hair care. Support for minor children, disabled relatives, and community spouse is provided for. The community spouse monthly income allowance and family allowance for family members are determined based on federal regulations. Income levels for maintenance in licensed community care facilities are established for each household. The income levels for maintenance per month in licensed community care facilities are calculated annually, rounded to the nearest hundred dollars, and prorated. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
