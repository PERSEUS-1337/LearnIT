    "content": "The Act titled \"Bank Accountability and Risk Assessment Act of 2009\" is abbreviated as such. The Act \"Bank Accountability and Risk Assessment Act of 2009\" highlights Congress's findings on the 2008 financial crisis, emphasizing the threat posed by large interconnected financial institutions and the significant taxpayer funds put at risk during the government intervention. The crisis strained the Deposit Insurance Fund and could have led to the collapse of the financial system. The Deposit Insurance Fund is at risk from large depository institutions that are deemed \"too-big-to-fail,\" posing a threat to the financial system and potentially risking taxpayer dollars. It is unfair to expect smaller institutions to bear the financial responsibility for the failures of these systemic risks. The purpose of this Act is to maintain the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system by ensuring that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Deposit Insurance Fund is adequately capitalized to respond to the failures of large depository institutions that could threaten the financial system. It aims to hold financial institutions accountable for causing crises and prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars from being put at risk. The Act aims to ensure the Deposit Insurance Fund is adequately capitalized to respond to large depository institution failures and hold financial institutions accountable for causing crises. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to define a 'risk-based assessment system' for depository institutions based on the probability and amount of potential losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The amended Federal Deposit Insurance Act defines a 'risk-based assessment system' for depository institutions based on the assets, liabilities, and other relevant factors determined by the Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to include a systemic risk premium assessment on systemically important depository institutions in addition to annual assessments. A 'systemically important depository institution' is defined as an insured depository institution designated as systemically important by the Corporation, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation designates insured depository institutions as systemically important based on asset and liability amounts, categories, and concentrations. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended to include the assessment of uninsured liabilities, activities, market share, and potential adverse effects on economic conditions and financial stability of entities and their affiliates. Section 7(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is amended by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D). Section 7(b)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is further amended by adding a new subparagraph (C) regarding the assessment base for insured depository institutions. The assessment amount is calculated based on the institution's average total assets minus average tangible equity during the assessment period."
