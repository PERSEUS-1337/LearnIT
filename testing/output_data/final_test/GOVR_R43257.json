Participation and costs rose due to responses to the 2007-2009 recession, including an increase in benefits through the ARRA. Benefit amounts are calculated based on household size, income, expenses, and geographic location. The SNAP benefit amount is determined by subtracting certain factors from a maximum benefit, which is adjusted annually for food-price inflation. The calculation is based on the cost of the Agriculture Department's Thrifty Food Plan in June of the previous year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased maximum monthly benefits substantially in April 2009, overriding the annual inflation-indexing rules. In FY2009, SNAP benefits were increased significantly, with the average household benefit rising from $250 to $291 per month. The increase varied based on household size, with one-person households receiving an additional $24 per month, and larger households receiving higher amounts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) also raised the SNAP minimum benefit for smaller households and increased funding for block grants in Puerto Rico and American Samoa. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased the maximum SNAP allotment for a four-person household from $588 to $668 per month in April 2009. This increase was scheduled to end after October 31, 2013. Without ARRA, deflationary pressures would have caused a decrease in the maximum SNAP allotment for FY2010 and FY2011, but benefit increases would have resumed in FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased the maximum SNAP allotment for a four-person household from $588 to $668 per month in April 2009. Legislation enacted after ARRA set a termination date for the benefit increase after October 31, 2013. The sunset of the ARRA benefit resulted in a reduction in the maximum benefit and all benefit amounts calculated based on it starting November 1, 2013. Starting November 1, 2013, SNAP maximum monthly allotments are set to revert back to pre-ARRA levels. USDA has instructed states to adjust benefit determination systems accordingly. The maximum benefit for a family of four will decrease from $668 to $632 per month after the ARRA increase expires on October 31, 2013. The scheduled reduction in maximum SNAP benefits on November 1, 2013, after the ARRA benefit increase sunsets is about 5.5%. The benefit reduction varies by household size, with reductions of $11 for a one-person household, $20 for a two-person household, $29 for a three-person household, and $36 for a four-person household. The President's FY2014 budget proposed to delay the sunset of the ARRA benefit increase to March 31, 2014. The ARRA benefit increase was originally intended to continue until food-price inflation caught up with the ARRA add-on, with no sunset. Extending the ARRA benefit increase for an additional five months of FY2014 would cost approximately $2.26 billion. The 113th Congress is developing a reauthorization of SNAP as part of the next farm bill, with no changes to the ARRA increase in current proposals. Congress reduced additional spending for SNAP ARRA benefit increase to finance other legislative priorities under PAYGO budget rules by setting a termination date for the increase. This was achieved through P.L. 111-226, which projected savings of $11.9 billion from FY2014 to FY2018 by terminating the increase after March 31, 2014. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 reauthorized child nutrition programs and the WIC program, offsetting costs by reducing ARRA-based SNAP benefits by $2.5 billion. This was achieved by moving up the termination date of the ARRA-generated SNAP benefit increase to October 31, 2013."
