    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Heart Disease Education, Analysis, and Research, and Treatment for Women Act\" or the \"HEART for Women Act\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death among women, with minority women at higher risk but less aware of this fact. There is a lack of awareness among healthcare providers about this issue, leading to disparities in treatment between men and women. Women tend to experience later onset of heart disease than men, leading to more complications in treatment. Diagnostic tests for cardiovascular disease may be less accurate in women, and drug effectiveness and metabolism differ between genders. Stroke kills more females than breast cancer, with gender differences in effects, diagnosis, and treatment. Stroke severity is greater in women than in men, leading to fewer diagnostic tests and interventions for women. Treatment issues unique to women are also present in strokes. SEC. 3.
