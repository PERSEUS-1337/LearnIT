Gibbons chairs the Budget Committee. Judge Julia S. Gibbons, chair of the Budget Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, acknowledged the country's financial difficulties in her testimony to the House Subcommittee on the judiciary's FY2010 budget request. She emphasized the importance of the courts in providing access to justice during economic challenges, as highlighted in Chief Justice John G. Roberts' 2008 Year-End Report. Judge Gibbons highlighted the impact of the deteriorating economy on the courts, with a rise in bankruptcy filings increasing workload. The judiciary has implemented cost-containment measures since 2004, reducing costs in various areas. Future initiatives include sharing courtrooms among senior judges to control space costs. The judiciary is implementing cost-containment measures, including sharing courtrooms among district judges in new courthouses and exploring the feasibility of courtroom-sharing for magistrate judges. They are also working with the General Services Administration to limit rent costs, with a projected FY2010 rent $200 million less than FY2005. Additionally, the Judicial Conference has adopted policies to reduce personnel costs and increase efficiency through IT consolidation. The judiciary is implementing technology to consolidate computer servers nationwide for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Initiatives include an eJuror pilot program for easier access to jury service information. Efforts to enhance judicial security were spurred by past incidents, leading to the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 being signed into law. Legislation enacted in the 109th Congress included intrusion detection systems for judges' homes to enhance security. Recent threats and incidents, such as a shooting at a courthouse in Las Vegas, highlight the need for increased oversight and security measures at court facilities. The U.S. Marshals Service may need to implement additional security enhancements for federal courthouses, especially for trials involving terrorism suspects. The U.S. Marshals Service is responsible for protecting judges and court officials at over 400 court facilities in the U.S. Threats and inappropriate communications against USMS protectees have increased over the years, reaching 1,141 in the current fiscal year. A pilot program was initiated in FY2009 to improve perimeter security at courthouses previously handled by the Federal Protective Service. The U.S. Marshals Service implemented a pilot program in 2009 to enhance perimeter security at seven courthouses. The judiciary and USMS will assess the program for improvements. Judge Gibbons requested $30 million for additional court support staff positions in FY2010 due to increased probation and pretrial service requirements. The Judicial Conference projects a slight increase in caseload for probation and pretrial services, and a substantial increase for bankruptcy filings in 2009. However, civil, criminal, and appellate filings are expected to decline. The number of appellate judgeships has remained constant since 1990, despite a 42% increase in appellate court case filings.

In the FY2010 judicial budget request, Judge Gibbons emphasized the need for modest staffing increases to address workload requirements and program enhancements. The Judiciary's funding requirements primarily cover basic operating costs, with over 80 percent allocated to personnel and space. The Judiciary lacks the flexibility to cut programs for budget savings like the Executive Branch. On April 23, 2009, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer testified before the Subcommittee on the FY2010 Supreme Court budget request.

In 1973, the Government Reorganization Act granted limited home rule authority to the District of Columbia, allowing citizens to elect a mayor and city council. Congress retained the authority to review and approve all District laws, including the annual budget. The city council must approve a budget within 56 days after receiving a proposal from the mayor, which is then forwarded to the President and Congress for review, modification, and approval. In 2009, the Mayor submitted a $8.9 billion budget to the council for approval. In 2009, the mayor submitted a revised budget to the council to address a $603 million budget gap caused by revenue shortfalls.

The OSC's budget for FY2010 is $18,495,000, 5.9% higher than FY2009. The agency's FTE employment level is estimated to be 111 for FY2010. The focus will be on improving performance in handling cases and fulfilling education and outreach responsibilities. The House and Senate committees recommended funding for OSC in line with the President's request. The Senate committee emphasized collaboration with whistleblower advocacy groups and efficiency in case processing. Legislation to reauthorize OSC was considered in the 110th Congress but not acted upon. NARA's FY2010 budget request was $466.9 million. President's FY2010 request for NARA was $466.9 million, $7.6 million more than FY2009. $339.8 million for operating expenses, including $1.9 million for Controlled Unclassified Information Office (CUIO) and $1.4 million for Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).

The NCUA, funded by credit unions, manages the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF) providing low-interest loans and grants. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 appropriated $1 million for technical assistance grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010 allocated $1.25 million for technical assistance grants. The Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) managed by the NCUA provides liquidity for credit unions with a borrowing limit set each fiscal year. The limit for FY2009 was increased to $41 billion by P.L. 111-8 to assist credit unions during the economic downturn. P.L. 111-117 allows the CLF to lend up to the maximum level authorized by the Federal Credit Union Act.

Its responsibilities include ensuring privacy and civil liberties concerns are considered in anti-terrorism efforts. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) advises the President and executive branch on privacy and civil liberties issues related to anti-terrorism efforts. The board provides annual reports to Congress and has a FY2010 budget request of $2.0 million. The House approved $2.0 million for the PCLOB for FY2010, the same amount as requested. Senate appropriators recommended $1.5 million, expressing concern over the board's reconstitution and staffing. P.L. 111-117 provides $1.5 million for the PCLOB. The SEC enforces securities laws to protect investors and maintain fair markets. The SEC's funding comes from fees imposed on securities market transactions, not the Treasury's general fund. The agency adjusts fee rates periodically to meet target amounts set in statute. The FY2009 appropriation was $960 million, with a requested increase to $1,026 million for FY2010. The House Committee recommended $1,036 million, with $10 million from prior-year balances. The rest would come from fees collected during the fiscal year. The SEC's funding for FY2010 was $1,111 million, with $16 million from prior-year balances and $1,095 million from offsetting collections. The Selective Service System (SSS) is an independent federal agency with the mission to serve the military's manpower needs by conscripting personnel when directed by Congress and the President. The Selective Service System (SSS) requires all males ages 18-25 in the US to register, but the draft ended in 1972. In 1980, President Carter proposed standby draft registration for both men and women, but only male-only registration was approved. Since 1972, there has been no authority to draft individuals into the military. Funding for the Selective Service has been stable, with an increase to $24.275 million in FY2010. The SBA provides $24.275 million in FY2010, an increase of $2.275 million from FY2009. The agency administers programs to assist small firms, including guaranteeing business loans, providing disaster loans, funding training programs, and advocating for small businesses.

The U.S. Postal Service generates funding through user charges, with Congress providing appropriations for specific purposes such as free mailing privileges for the blind and overseas voters. The Revenue Forgone Reform Act of 1993 authorized appropriations for these purposes and a $29 million annual reimbursement until 2035 for below-cost postal services to not-for-profit organizations in the early 1990s. Appropriated funds are deposited in the Postal Service Fund at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA), enacted in 2006, changed the budget submission process for the USPS's Office of Inspector General and the Postal Rate Commission. Under the PAEA, both entities must now submit their budget requests to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, to be paid from the Postal Service Fund. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) changed the budget submission process for USPSOIG and PRC. For FY2010, USPS requested $161.8 million for the Postal Service Fund, with $132.8 million for revenue forgone and $29 million for RFRA reimbursement. USPSOIG requested $244.4 million, PRC requested $14.3 million, and the President's FY2010 budget proposed a $362.3 million total postal appropriation. The President's budget for FY2010 proposed a $362.3 million total postal appropriation, including $118.3 million for the USPS, $244.4 million for the USPSOIG, and $14.3 million for the PRC. The House Committee on Appropriations agreed with this proposal on July 10, 2009. The committee recommended exploring potential revenues and savings through vehicle-to-grid partnerships for energy production and storage, as well as with electric vehicle manufacturers. They also expressed concern about the condition of postal facilities in municipalities like Hemet and Indio, California, recommending the USPS to evaluate community needs and report back to the Committee on Appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations affirmed recommended postal appropriations, emphasizing the importance of 6-day mail delivery and rural airmail services. The USPS was directed to continue rural airmail delivery in Idaho despite cost-cutting proposals. The Committee responded to a USPS mail processing plant consolidation study announcement regarding the Quincy, Illinois AMP. They are concerned about job losses and directed the Postal Service to explain the criteria for selecting Quincy AMP for study within 30 days. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Postal Service's fiscal health and willingness to consider altering future retiree health benefits fund payment schedule. The committee directed the USPS to develop a legislative proposal to provide financial relief by altering the future retiree health benefits fund payment schedule. The proposal should consider overfunding, meeting liability goals, and reducing incentives to cut costs. The USPS was appropriated $362.3 million by Congress, with $118.3 million for USPS and $244.4 million for USPSOIG. Congress also transferred $14.3 million from the Postal Service Fund to the PRC. H.Rept. 111-366 addressed concerns about postal facility closures and highlighted the PRC's role in evaluating these plans. The conferees commend the Commission for investigating the national service implications of the Postal Service's optimization and consolidation initiative. They urge the Commission to evaluate the effects of proposed closings and consolidations on service levels, costs, postal employees, and communities. The Government Accountability Office is directed to update studies on Postal Service initiatives and report to congressional committees within 6 months. The conferees directed the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on the criteria for selecting facilities for closure or consolidation by the Postal Service. They also instructed the USPS to work with OPM and OMB to develop a legislative proposal for relief from pre-funding retiree health benefits requirements. The United States Tax Court, an independent judicial body, has jurisdiction over tax matters. The President requested an increase in funding for the USTC for FY2010, which was approved by the House and recommended by Senate appropriators. The USTC's FY2010 funding was increased to $49.2 million, up from $48.5 million in FY2009. The budget proposed discontinuing some government-wide general provisions from the previous year's appropriations act. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills, along with P.L. 111-117, continue provisions related to communication with Congress, employee training, non-disclosure agreements, and publicity or propaganda. Section 716 prohibits propaganda and lobbying by executive agency personnel. Section 717 addresses the use of funds for publicity purposes. Section 720 prohibits unauthorized propaganda and publicity. Section 719 restricts the release of non-public information. Section 733 concerns e-government transfers. The law continues provisions on E-Government transfers and Midway Atoll Airfield funding. It also addresses the Privacy Act and Great Lakes Restoration budget reporting. The House-passed bill includes provisions on Great Lakes restoration activities, Regulatory Policy Officers, and Energy and Water Efficiency. The Senate-reported bill does not include these provisions. President Obama revoked Executive Order 13422 with Executive Order 13497. The House bill continues the provisions related to energy and water efficiency, while the Senate bill would repeal them. The Senate-reported bill would repeal provisions related to Executive Order 13423 and require the OMB Director to submit a report on workforce numbers. It also includes a provision for transferring funds for a rapid response to a catastrophic event. The Senate-reported bill includes a provision for transferring funds to expedite a rapid response to a catastrophic event as outlined in the National Response Plan. The transferred amounts would be subject to specific account purposes and limitations, with notification requirements to Congress. Additionally, agencies would be allowed to retain proceeds from real property transfers or sales for real property activities, establish a disposal pilot program, and create a comprehensive database of federal real property assets accessible to the public. Section 736 allows institutions of higher education to offer financial assistance to federal or DC government employees for student loan repayment. Section 744 directs the Attorney General to provide Congress with records of Miranda rights notification for captured foreign terrorism suspects. The law does not include a provision for captured foreign terrorism suspects within 14 days. Section 745 requires automobile companies receiving federal funds to reinstate agreements with franchise dealerships. Section 736 originally proposed a 2.9% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, but the law provides a 2.0% pay adjustment. The FY2010 budget endorses a 2.0% pay increase, with 1.5% base and 0.5% locality adjustments. Section 735 of P.L. 111-117 prohibits funds for public-private competitions involving federal employee work conversion to contractor performance. Section 743 of the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act requires agencies, excluding the Department of Defense, to submit an annual inventory of service contracts. Failure to do so may result in restrictions on public-private competitions involving the conversion of federal employee functions to contractor performance. OMB shall provide a report to Congress indicating agency compliance with the inventory requirement, including a summary of each agency's inventory. Within 180 days of submitting the inventory, agency heads must ensure contracts are in accordance with laws, give special attention to functions closely related to inherently governmental functions. The agency must ensure contracts are in compliance with laws and pay attention to functions closely related to inherently governmental functions. Specific safeguards and monitoring systems should be in place to prevent contractors from performing inherently governmental functions. Additionally, poorly performed contracts should be identified, and contracts that could be converted to performance by Federal employees should be considered. The agency must ensure contracts comply with laws and prevent contractors from performing inherently governmental functions. Agencies can use insourcing guidelines or alternative acquisition approaches to efficiently utilize assets. Reports on actions taken must be submitted to OMB and made public to ensure federal employees perform inherently governmental functions. Under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, agency functions designated as commercial may be subject to private-public competition. Despite regulations, some contractor employees may perform inherently governmental functions. Agency heads must identify contracts for potential conversion to federal employee performance. OMB issued insourcing guidance in 2009 to facilitate compliance with insourcing requirements. Since the early 1960s, U.S. policy towards communist Cuba has involved economic sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions administered by the Treasury Department. Some U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed since 2001 under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, but with various restrictions and licensing requirements. The Bush Administration tightened sanctions on Cuba in February 2005 by further restricting how U.S. agricultural exporters may be paid for their product. OFAC clarified that payment for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba must be received before shipment, causing objections from exporters and some Members of Congress. The United States has been Cuba's largest supplier of food and agricultural products since 2002, with Cuba purchasing almost $2.7 billion in agricultural products. U.S. exports to Cuba rose significantly from 2001 to 2008, reaching $712 million in 2008 due to higher food prices and increased food needs after natural disasters. In 2009, U.S. exports to Cuba were valued at $449 million. OFAC clarified payment terms for U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba, causing objections from exporters and some Members of Congress. In 2009, U.S. exports to Cuba were valued at $449 million, lower than in 2008. Congress attempted to ease economic sanctions on Cuba, but provisions were not enacted. The Bush Administration threatened to veto legislation weakening sanctions. Appropriations bills in 2008 included provisions easing restrictions on travel and payment terms for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. In 2009, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (H.R. 1105/P.L. 111-8) included provisions easing Cuba sanctions, allowing for family travel, marketing and sale of U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba, and easing payment provisions for U.S. agricultural exports. The Treasury Department's interpretation of the latter provision limited its impact. Section 622 of Division D prohibited funds from being used to enforce an amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations issued in 2005. The regulations issued in 2005 require U.S. agricultural exporters selling goods to Cuba to be paid in cash before the goods leave U.S. ports. The Treasury Department's guidance states that exports to Cuba must be paid for in cash in advance or financed through a third-country bank. The Treasury Department provided guidance on the implementation of the provision requiring exporters to receive payment in advance of shipment. This action continued the Bush Administration policy and had little practical effect. Some Senators were reassured by the Secretary's response, while others raised concerns about the legislative intent to ease restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba. This led to identical provisions in the House and Senate versions of the FY2010 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. During FY2010, provisions in bills S. 3170 and S. 1432 aimed to interpret \"payment of cash in advance\" as payment before transferring title and control of exported items to Cuban purchasers. The Senate Appropriations Committee urged the Treasury Department to amend regulations to facilitate U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba by removing the requirement for cash payments before shipping. The provision defining \"payment of cash in advance\" for FY2010 was included in the FY2010 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. Supporters believe it will make it easier for U.S. agricultural producers to export to Cuba, while opponents argue it was included in a must-pass spending bill without proper congressional consideration."
