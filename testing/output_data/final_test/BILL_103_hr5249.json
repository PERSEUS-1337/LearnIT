    "content": "The Act titled \"Historic Homeownership Assistance Act\" introduces a new section called \"Historic Homeownership Rehabilitation Credit\" in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Historic Homeownership Assistance Act\" introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing a 20% credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures on a historic home, with a maximum credit of $50,000 ($25,000 for married individuals filing separately) and the ability to carry forward unused credits. The \"Historic Homeownership Assistance Act\" allows a 20% credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures on a historic home, with a maximum credit of $50,000 ($25,000 for married individuals filing separately) that can be carried forward to the next taxable year. Qualified rehabilitation expenditure refers to amounts chargeable to capital account for certified rehabilitation of a qualified historic home. The tax credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures on a historic home requires at least 5 percent of total expenditures to be allocated to the exterior of the building. Rules similar to section 47(c)(2)(B) apply, and only qualified expenditures for the portion used as the taxpayer's principal residence are considered. Certified rehabilitation is defined under this section. The term 'certified rehabilitation' is defined under this section as per section 47(c)(2)(C). Factors to be considered for targeted area residences include preserving architectural elements, risk of deterioration, and potential demolition if certification is denied. The term 'certified rehabilitation' is defined under this section as per section 47(c)(2)(C). Factors to be considered for targeted area residences include preserving architectural elements, risk of deterioration, and potential demolition if certification is denied. This paragraph applies to buildings that are targeted area residences or located within an enterprise or empowerment zone, excluding those listed in historic registers. The term 'certified rehabilitation' includes a certification through a cooperative agreement between the Secretary of the Interior and a State Historic Preservation Officer. This allows the officer to certify building rehabilitation within their jurisdiction, subject to specified terms. The term 'qualified historic home' refers to a certified historic structure that has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The term 'substantially rehabilitated' refers to a building that has undergone significant restoration and meets certain ownership and usage criteria to be considered the taxpayer's principal residence. The terms 'principal residence' and 'certified historic structure' have specific definitions as outlined in relevant sections of the tax code. The term 'enterprise or empowerment zone' refers to areas designated as enterprise communities or empowerment zones under section 1391. Additionally, a taxpayer leasing their principal residence may be treated as the owner if the lease term meets certain requirements. Qualified rehabilitation expenditures for a building not covered by subsection (g) are treated as made upon completion of the rehabilitation or as specified by the Secretary. Regulations will include rules for recapture if the property no longer qualifies. For a purchased historic home, the taxpayer is considered to have made the seller's rehabilitation expenditures on the purchase date. The term 'qualified purchased historic home' refers to a certified historic structure that has been substantially rehabilitated and purchased by the taxpayer within 5 years of completion. The structure must be intended to be the taxpayer's principal residence, the seller must not have received any credits for the rehabilitation, and the taxpayer must be provided with necessary information by the Secretary. The taxpayer may elect to receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate instead of the credit allowable under this section. The certificate is issued to the taxpayer at the time of purchase for a building under subsection (g) or at the completion of rehabilitation for other cases. The taxpayer may receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate instead of the credit allowable under this section. The certificate is issued to the taxpayer for a certified rehabilitation, with a face amount equal to the allowable credit. It can only be transferred to a lending institution for a loan secured by the building and used solely for acquisition or rehabilitation purposes. The taxpayer may receive a historic rehabilitation mortgage credit certificate for a certified rehabilitation, which can be transferred to a lending institution for a loan used for acquisition or rehabilitation purposes. The lender can use the certificate to offset their regular tax and carry forward unused amounts until exhausted. If the taxpayer disposes of the building before the 5-year period ends, recapture rules apply. When the taxpayer disposes of their building or it ceases to be their principal residence, the tax for that year will increase by the recapture percentage of the rehabilitation credit claimed in prior years. The recapture percentage is determined according to a specific table under section 50(a)(1)(B), with adjustments for disposition or cessation events. When a taxpayer disposes of a building or it ceases to be their principal residence, the tax for that year will increase by the recapture percentage of the rehabilitation credit claimed in prior years. The increase in the basis of the property resulting from the credit allowed shall be reduced by the amount of the credit. Processing fees for certification of rehabilitation applications are deposited in a trust fund and can only be used subject to appropriations Acts. The text discusses the limitations on the use of funds for processing rehabilitation applications and the denial of double benefits under the tax code. It also mentions the Secretary's authority to create regulations for the implementation of the section. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 1016 of the tax code to include provisions related to section 23(j). The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the tax code is amended to include a new item after section 22. Sec. 23. Historic homeownership rehabilitation credit. The amendments made by this section apply to rehabilitations with physical work beginning after the enactment of this Act."
