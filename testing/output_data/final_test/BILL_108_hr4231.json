    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Department of Veterans Affairs Nurse Recruitment and Retention Act of 2004.\" It includes a pilot program to study innovative recruitment tools for addressing nursing shortages at Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities. The Department of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program in a designated region to test innovative recruitment methods for addressing nurse shortages. The program will involve private-sector entities in recruiting and retaining qualified nurses at VA healthcare facilities. The pilot program aims to use effective private-sector recruitment practices, such as employer branding and Internet technologies, to address nurse shortages. The Secretary will streamline the hiring process at VA healthcare facilities in the designated region. The Secretary will revise procedures for hiring nurses to reduce the hiring process length and may recommend changes in law to enable streamlining and automation. A report on the pilot program's success in improving nurse recruitment and retention at VA healthcare facilities will be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs within one year. SEC. 3. ALTERNATE WORK SCHEDULES FOR NURSES. Sec. 7456a of Chapter 74 of title 38, United States Code, allows registered nurses to work a 36/40 work schedule if deemed necessary by the Secretary to retain their services at a Department health-care facility. This schedule consists of three 12-hour shifts within a workweek, considered equivalent to a full 40-hour workweek for all purposes except personnel ceiling compliance. Registered nurses can work a 36/40 work schedule, with basic and additional pay subject to specific conditions. The hourly rate for a nurse on a 36-hour tour is calculated by dividing the annual pay by 1,872. Overtime pay is provided for hours worked beyond the scheduled 36-hour tour. Registered nurses on a 36/40 work schedule may not receive additional pay for a regularly scheduled 12-hour tour of duty. If absent on approved leave during a 12-hour shift, they will be charged 10 hours of leave for 9 hours of absence. The Secretary can implement a 7/7 work schedule for nurses if necessary to retain their services at a Department health-care facility. The Secretary may implement a 7/7 work schedule for registered nurses at a Department health-care facility, where nurses work seven 10-hour shifts with seven days off in a two-week pay period. Nurses on this schedule are considered to have worked a full 80-hour pay period for all purposes except personnel ceiling calculations. Their hourly rate is calculated based on their annual pay divided by 1,820 for each 70-hour tour of duty. A nurse on a 7/7 work schedule is entitled to overtime pay for hours worked beyond their regularly scheduled shifts, as outlined in section 7453(e) of the title. Registered nurses on this schedule do not receive additional pay for hours worked during their 10-hour shifts. A nurse on a 7/7 work schedule is charged leave at a rate of 8 hours for 7 hours of absence during a 12-hour shift. The Secretary may authorize a nurse to work full-time for 9 months with 3 months off duty, paid at 75% of the full-time rate. The schedule is considered part-time for benefits calculation under title 5. The Secretary will create regulations for implementation. A new item is added to the table of sections in chapter 74. SEC. 4 amends Section 7401(3) of title 38, United States Code to include additional positions in the Veterans Health Administration. SEC. 5 provides assistance for hiring and retaining nurses at State Veterans Homes. Section 1744 of title 38, United States Code establishes a payment program to assist State homes in hiring and retaining nurses to address nursing shortages. States eligible for payments must have employee incentive programs in place to promote nursing staff retention. The State may use funds received under this section to provide for a program described in subsection (b)(2), with limitations on the amount of payment that can be used for employee incentive programs. The Secretary will prescribe criteria for the program, considering flexibility and innovation. The payment to a State for any fiscal year is 2 percent of the estimated payments made to that State home under section 1741 of this title. Payments under this section for State homes are based on applications describing nursing shortages and incentive programs. Funds come from available sources, and disbursements are made along with other payments under section 1741. The Secretary requires specific conditions for payments, ensuring proper use of funds. State homes receiving payments under this section must return any refund payments from employees breaching agreements for employee assistance. They are also required to submit an annual report detailing the use of funds and the effectiveness of the incentive program on nurse staffing within 60 days of the fiscal year's close. The report is subject to audit by the Secretary. The Secretary requires state homes to submit an annual report on the use of funds and effectiveness of the incentive program for nurse staffing. Regulations will be prescribed for awarding payments under this section. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement section 1744 of title 38, United States Code, to assist States with hiring and retaining nurses. Interim procedures will be established to ensure payments to eligible States starting from January 1, 2005. Additionally, a technical clarification is made to section 8111(d)(2) of title 38, and an Under Secretary for Health is mentioned. The amendment to Section 305(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code removes the requirement for the Under Secretary for Health to be a doctor of medicine and allows for qualifications in health-care. This amendment was passed by the House of Representatives on September 30, 2004."
