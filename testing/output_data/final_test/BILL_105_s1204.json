    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997\". It pertains to jurisdiction in civil rights cases. Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to state that a district court must not abstain from jurisdiction in cases where no violation of State law is alleged. Additionally, the district court may certify unsettled questions of State law to the highest appellate court before proceeding with the case. The amended Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, prohibits district courts from abstaining jurisdiction in cases without a State law violation. It allows certification of unsettled State law questions to the highest appellate court. Claims under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983) for property rights deprivation are ripe for adjudication upon a final decision causing actual injury by a person acting under State law. The amended Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, prohibits district courts from abstaining jurisdiction in cases without a State law violation. It allows certification of unsettled State law questions to the highest appellate court. Claims under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983) for property rights deprivation are ripe for adjudication upon a final decision causing actual injury by a person acting under State law. This subsection outlines the conditions under which a party seeking redress for property infringement is not required to apply for an appeal or waiver if success is unlikely and district court intervention is necessary. The subsection specifies that a final decision for redress does not need the party to exhaust state judicial remedies. SEC. 3. UNITED STATES AS DEFENDANT. Section 1346 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a provision stating that any claim based on a property right secured by the Constitution and allegedly infringed by the United States must show concrete injury for adjudication. This requires a final decision by the United States on the permissible uses of the property, with a right of appeal available. The party seeking redress may be exempt from applying for an appeal or waiver if success is unlikely and court intervention is necessary to decide the merits. SEC. 4. JURISDICTION OF COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS. Section 1491(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a provision stating that any claim based on a property right or privilege secured by the Constitution and allegedly infringed by the United States must show actual injury and a final decision by the United States. This final decision must be definitive and not subject to appeal or waiver. The party seeking redress is not required to apply for an appeal or waiver if success is unlikely and intervention by the United States Court of Federal Claims is needed to decide the merits. The amendments made by this Act will apply to actions commenced on or after the enactment date."
