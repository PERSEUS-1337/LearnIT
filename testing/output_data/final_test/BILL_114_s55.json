The Act defines terms such as \"coast line,\" \"existing interest,\" \"expanded seaward boundary,\" and \"expanded submerged land.\" The Act defines terms related to coastal boundaries, submerged land, interest owners, the Secretary of the Interior, and specific states. SEC. 3. SEAWARD BOUNDARIES OF CERTAIN STATES. The Submerged Lands Act is amended to establish seaward boundaries for certain coastal states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The boundaries are set at a line 3 marine leagues from the coast as of the day before the enactment of the Offshore Fairness Act.

SEC. 4. CONVEYANCE. The Secretary must notify each State of the right to request a conveyance of the United States' interest in expanded submerged land and convey it upon request. The Governor of the State will then have the authority to exercise the powers and duties of the Secretary under certain conditions. The State must agree to indemnify the United States from any liability related to the conveyance of expanded submerged land or administration of existing interests. The State must agree to indemnify the United States from any liability related to the conveyance of expanded submerged land or administration of existing interests. SEC. 5. EFFECT.
