    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of 2010.\" It includes findings related to prison conditions. Congress finds that millions of incarcerated individuals worldwide endure inhumane conditions in overcrowded, unsanitary, and unsafe prisons and detention facilities, leading to high rates of malnutrition, disease, and death. The lack of adequate medical treatment further exacerbates these issues, especially in the face of severe overcrowding. Amnesty International's 2009 report highlighted inhumane conditions in prisons and detention facilities, including overcrowding, inadequate food and water, lack of hygiene products and medical care, juveniles detained with adults, and denial of family visits. Some governments neglect basic sanitation, endangering the health of prisoners and detainees. According to reports, prisons and detention facilities lack proper sanitation, increasing the risk of diseases for prisoners. Former prisoners may spread these diseases to the local population. Some governments also restrict religious worship and contact with family for detainees. Inadequate resources in prisons lead to inhumane conditions for religious prisoners, including overcrowding, extreme temperatures, lack of food and medical care, and limited access to clergy and religious materials. This situation is exacerbated by misplaced or lost prison records, resulting in indefinite incarceration and swelling prison populations. The United States Government provides assistance to countries with inhumane prison conditions, which jeopardize the lives of prisoners. The Department of State's 2009 report highlighted poor and life-threatening conditions in over 100 countries receiving US aid. The US should use its influence to address these issues. The United States Government should use its influence and resources to help ensure that governments receiving US assistance do not operate prisons and detention facilities under inhumane conditions. This will strengthen the rule of law, save lives, and advance US interests. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"Minimum standards for the elimination of inhumane conditions in foreign prisons and other detention facilities\" are defined as requirements for facilities in foreign countries receiving US assistance. The minimum standards for humane conditions in prisons and detention facilities include adequate sleeping space, sanitary waste facilities, safe lighting and ventilation, access to food and water, and medical care. The United States assistance refers to non-humanitarian aid provided under various acts. Prisoners and detainees should have access to religious observance, materials, and communication with clergy, family, and friends. SEC. 4. ACTIONS TO HELP ELIMINATE INHUMANE CONDITIONS IN FOREIGN PRISONS AND OTHER DETENTION FACILITIES. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to Congress on conditions in prisons and detention facilities in countries receiving US assistance, listing countries not meeting minimum standards and their efforts to comply. The Secretary of State evaluates if a country is meeting standards for humane conditions in prisons by monitoring facilities, allowing complaints from prisoners, cooperating with international experts, investigating allegations, and sharing information. The Secretary of State takes steps to improve conditions in prisons and detention facilities, such as appointing ombudsmen, providing alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders, addressing juvenile confinement, and implementing procedures to reduce pretrial detention periods. The Secretary of State aims to improve prison conditions by appointing ombudsmen, offering alternatives to incarceration, addressing juvenile confinement, and reducing pretrial detention periods. Additionally, efforts include preventing prisoners from serving beyond their maximum sentence and increasing resources to eliminate inhumane conditions in prisons and detention facilities. The report required may draw from Country Reports on Human Rights Practices and must provide detailed and up-to-date information on prison conditions for each country. The report will be made publicly available. The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should provide assistance to countries making efforts to eliminate inhumane conditions in prisons and detention facilities, even if they do not meet minimum standards. The prohibitions under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall not apply in this case. Grants under this subsection aim to improve conditions in recipient countries without building new prisons. Funds are subject to Congressional notification procedures. Negotiations are required with governments not making significant efforts to address inhumane conditions in prisons and detention facilities. The Secretary of State must negotiate with governments not addressing inhumane conditions in prisons within 90 days of a report. They can restructure assistance and visas to achieve the goals of the Act. The Secretary of State must negotiate with governments within 90 days to address inhumane prison conditions. A report must be submitted to congressional committees within 180 days detailing actions taken during negotiations. United States assistance may be restructured or reprogrammed if deemed necessary. The report must provide a detailed explanation if government restructuring, reprogramming, or reduction is considered, or if visas are issued or denied to government officials. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 is amended to include training for officers involved in assessing conditions in foreign prisons and drafting human rights reports. Additionally, a new position is created to monitor foreign prison conditions. The Secretary of State will establish a new Deputy Assistant Secretary position within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to monitor foreign prison conditions. Funds from various acts can be used to support the provisions of this Act. SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. The prohibitions of section 104(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall apply and shall not be altered by this Act. Minimum standards for foreign prisons shall not be based on prohibited funding."
