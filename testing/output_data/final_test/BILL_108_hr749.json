    "content": "The \"Cooperative Landscape Conservation Act\" establishes a program to provide grants for acquiring conservation easements on lands to conserve wildlife, fisheries, public recreation, and other conservation values while allowing traditional land uses by private owners. The Secretary of the Interior will establish the Cooperative Landscape Conservation Program to provide grants for acquiring conservation easements on private lands to preserve wildlife, fisheries, public recreation, and other conservation benefits. Eligible entities can apply for grants by describing the property and conservation benefits resulting from the easement. The Secretary of the Interior will prioritize grants for acquiring conservation easements in areas facing development pressures threatening traditional land use. The grants aim to provide the greatest conservation benefit for wildlife, fish, natural resources, or open space while maintaining traditional land use. The Federal government will share the cost of acquiring easements with eligible entities. Acquiring a conservation easement with a grant under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost. In-kind contributions can be applied to the non-Federal share of the acquisition cost. Title to the easement can only be held and enforced by an eligible entity. State certification is required for the conservation easement to be acquired using grant funds. The conservation easement acquired must meet State laws and grant terms. The Secretary can allocate up to 10% for technical assistance. Eligible entities include government agencies, Indian tribes, and organizations focused on conservation purposes. The term \"traditional use\" refers to the current land uses at the time of applying for a grant under section 170(h)(4)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Authorization of appropriations of $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2009 is granted to the Secretary of the Interior to implement the Act."
