    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act, born from a tradition that opposes military involvement in civilian affairs, prohibits the use of the Army and Air Force for civil law enforcement, except in extraordinary circumstances approved by Congress. Balancing the rule and exceptions is crucial to prevent unchecked rebellions or tragedies like the Boston Massacre. The USA PATRIOT Act expanded military assistance for countering terrorism but upheld the posse comitatus law. Calls to reassess military involvement in disaster response arose after Hurricane Katrina. Concerns over using military resources for civilian law enforcement, like drones, have been raised. This report analyzes the historical use of the Armed Forces in domestic law enforcement and the Posse Comitatus Act's constitutional foundations. The report discusses the historical origins and constitutional basis of the Posse Comitatus Act, highlighting the Magna Carta's influence on the Anglo-American tradition of limiting military involvement in civilian affairs. Lord Coke and Parliament later interpreted this to include a broad prohibition on punishment without due process of law. Parliament, influenced by the Magna Carta, prohibited the use of martial law in peacetime, leading to the Petition of Right of 1628 which outlawed quartering troops and martial law commissions. This historical context influenced the colonists' reaction to British troops being quartered in Boston. The British colonies faced different circumstances compared to England during the time of the Petition of Right. While England had troops stationed for protection, the colonies had troops stationed for different reasons. The colonists were subject to civil justice, not military justice, and soldiers who used excessive force were held accountable. The troops involved in the Boston Massacre were not there for protection against invaders, but for other purposes. During the American Revolution, public resentment grew towards the use of British troops as a policing force among civilians. This led to heightened resentment and was listed as a grievance in the Declaration of Independence. The Articles of Confederation addressed the threat of military intrusion into civilian affairs in the newly established United States. The newly established United States addressed the threat of military intrusion into civilian affairs by limiting the size of the Armed Forces during peacetime, entrusting control to civil authorities, and favoring a militia of farmers over a standing army. The Constitution further emphasized civilian authority, with the President as Commander in Chief and Congress empowered to raise and support armies. The Bill of Rights also restricted the quartering of troops in private homes and highlighted the importance of a well-regulated militia for the security of a free state. The Constitution allowed Congress to call out the militia for various purposes, despite the founders' preference for a militia over a standing army. Congress quickly established federal law enforcement capabilities through federal marshals to enforce federal court processes. The federal marshals had the authority to call upon the posse comitatus for assistance, similar to the sheriff's authority at common law. The militia under federal control could operate as an arm of the government or support the federal marshal. Troops serving as a posse comitatus remained subordinate to civil law enforcement authorities, while troops called up to suppress an insurrection supplanted civil authorities. The President may order troops to quell insurrections, sometimes without needing to issue a proclamation under the Insurrection Act. Congress has authorized federal troops to enforce specific laws, and Presidents have called upon the militia and Armed Forces for riot control. It can be unclear which authority is used to send in federal troops. The President has relied on the militia and Armed Forces for riot control or to ensure federal law execution. Congress authorized the President to call out the militia for various reasons, including protection against Indian incursions and in cases of invasion or insurrection. The Calling Forth Act allows the President to call out the militia in case of invasion or at the request of a state in case of insurrection. Congress empowered the President to call forth the militia for 30 days in case of opposition to or obstruction of federal laws in a state by powerful combinations. President Washington used this authority to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. The federal government called on the militia to restore peace during a rebellion against federal law. The Calling Forth Act was reenacted with changes, allowing for the use of the militia to aid civilian power or temporarily supplant local authority. The provisions were extended in 1807 to include the Army and Navy for domestic use. In 1807, the Forth Act was extended to allow the Army and Navy to be used in domestic situations. President John Adams had previously used federal troops to quell the 1799 Fries Rebellion in Pennsylvania. The resistance to federal laws was often due to objections to increasing taxes and military buildup. President Jefferson also called out troops in 1808 to suppress opposition to the Embargo Act. In 1808, President Jefferson used federal troops to enforce the Embargo Act in Vermont, facing opposition from traders reliant on trade with Canada. State militia troops were reluctant to enforce the law, leading to the deployment of regular troops. Congress later amended the act to authorize the use of troops, but resentment towards federal military force enforcing laws without armed resistance led to the act's demise. In 1832, resistance to revenue laws again raised the possibility of using federal troops due to objections to protective tariffs. In 1832, Congress steadily increased protective tariffs, leading to opposition from Southerners who believed it unfairly benefited Northerners. South Carolina nullified the tariff, prompting Congress to pass a \"Force Bill\" authorizing the use of military force. South Carolina eventually rescinded its ordinance, avoiding a confrontation. The early U.S. desire to avoid foreign entanglements led to a policy of neutrality, conflicting at times with economic interests or political views. Congress enacted a statute to prohibit enlistment in foreign military service and the arming of foreign war vessels. President Washington called on state militias to deal with French Ambassador's efforts to fit out privateers against British and Spanish interests. President Jefferson used authority to counter Aaron Burr's conspiracy and schemes to liberate Spain's South American colonies. State militias were under governors' control. The Armed Forces were employed to prevent armed American sympathizers from joining Texas's fight for independence and to enforce the Neutrality Act of 1818. The Army was also used to quiet militant activity along the Canadian border and prevent an expedition to attack Cuba. President Zachary Taylor issued a proclamation to halt the planned expedition, leading the Navy to dispatch vessels to New Orleans. President Grant issued a proclamation in 1870 urging measures to prevent expeditions in violation of neutrality. Section 2 of the Calling Forth Act lay dormant until the 1830s when violence between Irish laborers led Maryland to request federal aid in 1834. President Jackson endorsed the request and sent military force to aid state civil authorities. In 1838, during a Pennsylvania state election dispute, violent public reactions led to the governor calling out the militia for aid, which was denied by the local military commander. The governor then sought federal assistance from President Van Buren under the Domestic Violence Clause, but Van Buren declined, stating that the state authorities were capable of handling the situation. In 1838, during a Pennsylvania state election dispute, the governor called out the militia for aid, which was denied by the local military commander. The \"Buckshot War\" ended without armed confrontation, but the commander was reprimanded for acting without authorization. In Rhode Island in 1842, dissatisfaction with the government led to efforts to draft a new constitution, resulting in two separate sets of government officials claiming authority. The governor declared martial law and requested federal troops, but President Tyler declined, stating he had no power to anticipate insurrections. The \"Dorr Rebellion\" in Rhode Island in 1842 ended without violence after President Tyler declined to intervene, as the opposition army led by Governor Thomas Dorr dispersed. The Supreme Court decision in Luther v. Borden established that determining a state's republican form of government is a political matter for Congress, and the President has the authority to respond to calls for military intervention in cases of domestic violence. After the Civil War, labor disputes led to requests for federal troops to suppress violence in 1877. Governors of several states requested troops in response to strikes and related violence, with varying conformity to the Insurrection Act. Ohio's governor did not request troops, but local officials sought assistance from military commanders. No direct help was given, but arms from Rock Island Arsenal were made available to the state. During the 1877 riots, questions arose regarding federal versus state control of troops. Federal troops were placed under governors' command in West Virginia and Maryland, while in Indiana, federal troops were provided as a posse comitatus under the request of the federal marshal, not the governor. The President did not assert federal authority to intervene, possibly due to constitutional limitations or lack of available troops. During the 1877 riots, federal troops were placed under governors' command in West Virginia and Maryland. In Indiana, federal troops were provided as a posse comitatus under the request of the federal marshal, not the governor. When disorder spread to Pennsylvania, federal troops were initially sent in to protect federal property. The general officer in charge of federal troops believed that federal military power should supplant local civil authority when a state government asks for assistance under the Insurrection Act. The use of federal military authorities to resort to force and subordination of State authorities until lawful order is restored has gained approval from President Hayes. The doctrine of equating insurrection to war and using military force in civil disturbances is reflected in War Department manuals. U.S. troops were deployed to handle disputes in western territories and new states, with instances in California. The California Gold Rush saw heightened lawlessness, controlled by vigilantes. The Vigilance Committee of San Francisco defied federal authorities, leading to a militia response. Federal intervention was deemed unnecessary by the Attorney General. During the California Gold Rush, lawlessness was rampant, with the Vigilance Committee of San Francisco defying federal authorities. The state governor requested military assistance when a judge was taken prisoner, but the request was denied due to constitutional requirements. In Utah, resistance to federal law was significant, with Brigham Young appointed as governor by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1857, federal Armed Forces were sent to Utah to ensure a peaceful transfer of power after Governor Young declared martial law. President Buchanan issued a proclamation in 1858 offering amnesty to those who obeyed the law. Federal troops were also sent out in 1831 to respond to reports of slave insurrections in various states. In response to requests from local officials, military commandants in Maryland, Delaware, and the Carolinas took actions without statutory or presidential justification. President Pierce issued a proclamation in 1856 during troubles in Kansas, commanding unlawful combinations to disperse. The governor of Kansas called upon U.S. troops for assistance in disbanding a territorial militia in 1858. There were no further proclamations under the Insurrection Act, and only the federal marshal and deputies could request assistance. The Cushing Doctrine allowed members of the Armed Forces to act as a posse comitatus to enforce the law without invoking the Insurrection Act. President Buchanan declined to send troops into seceding states before the Civil War, citing the lack of federal law enforcement and judicial machinery in those areas. President Lincoln took a different approach to using federal military power, even in loyal Union states. Congress enacted a new provision allowing the use of Armed Forces for rebellions and changed the standard for intervention. The successful suppression of the rebellion did not end violence in the South during the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. Efforts to establish new governments in former Confederate states were contentious after the Civil War. Presidents received numerous requests for military aid from state governors, sometimes from rival governors claiming legitimacy. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1871, allowing the President to use military forces to enforce civil rights. President Grant immediately invoked this authority after the law was enacted. President Grant invoked the Civil Rights Act of 1871, allowing him to use military forces to enforce civil rights. He later issued proclamations commanding conspirators in South Carolina to disperse and turn in their weapons, leading to the arrest of suspected Klansmen by federal officials. Congress had granted the President authority to call out state militia and employ military forces for law enforcement purposes. The federal marshal could call on local military commanders for assistance without involving the President. Congress authorized the use of the posse comitatus in certain cases, such as the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. The military units serving on a posse were subordinate to the marshal and could not initiate legal proceedings. The Fugitive Slave Act allowed federal marshals to issue arrest warrants for escaped slaves and call on bystanders for assistance. In cases of fierce opposition, the President could authorize the use of military force to enforce the law. Troops in Boston Harbor were put on standby to respond to calls for assistance. President Fillmore asserted his authority to use the Army and Navy to enforce federal law, stating that it was an inherent power not restricted by the Insurrection Act. The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed that military members could be summoned as a posse comitatus if needed. In 1851, a federal marshal in Chicago arrested a fugitive slave with the help of police and state militia. The marshal filed a claim for reimbursement of funds spent on assistance. Attorney General Caleb Cushing was asked to determine if the claim should be honored. In 1854, another incident occurred in Boston involving the arrest of fugitive slave Anthony Burns, leading to the deployment of federal troops and artillery. In response to the deployment of federal troops and artillery in Boston, Attorney General Caleb Cushing announced a new doctrine regarding the employment of the Armed Forces, stating that members of the military were part of the posse comitatus by virtue of their duties as citizens. This declaration went beyond the question of whether state militia members could be considered \"bystanders\" under the Fugitive Slave Act. Cushing declared that the posse comitatus includes all individuals above the age of fifteen in a district, regardless of occupation, including military personnel who are obligated to obey the sheriff or marshal. This opinion justified the use of federal troops by civil law enforcement authorities, leading to a congressional restriction on military involvement in enforcing territorial law. After the Civil War, federal troops were used to enforce laws in former Confederate states, influencing political outcomes. In 1877, evidence suggested that Republican state governments in the South relied on military presence for support. A Democratic-controlled House passed a bill prohibiting the Army from backing Republican governments in the South or intervening in political disputes. The Senate, controlled by a Republican majority, refused to accept a provision in an Army appropriation bill, leading to a lack of compromise and the session ending without passage of the bill. Money for the Army was later appropriated in a special session without restrictions on its use. When the issue of Army appropriations arose again, the House included a posse comitatus section, which was accepted by the Senate with minor amendments. Colonel William Winthrop viewed the new law as not significantly impacting the relationship between civil and military authorities. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits federal marshals from using military assistance for arrests, but the President can invoke the Insurrection Act in cases of resistance to law enforcement. This act has been criticized for potentially undermining civilian law enforcement by allowing troops to be seen as an independent military force. Despite early attempts to repeal or amend it, the act is now seen as a symbol of American anti-militarism. The Posse Comitatus Act, despite remaining essentially unchanged since its passage, has exceptions and prohibits the use of Armed Forces for arrests or searches. It raises constitutional questions regarding the balance of power between the President and Congress, and the limits on involving the military in civilian affairs. Lord Coke and his colleagues crafted provisions for military law enforcement activities authorized in the Constitution. The Petition of Right of 1628 and the Magna Carta prohibit martial law in times of peace, including the quartering of troops among civilians. The Declaration of Independence lists martial law as a violation of fundamental liberties. The Second, Third, and Fifth Amendments also suggest a constitutional principle against using the Armed Forces for civilian matters. The Second, Third, and Fifth Amendments promise a civilian militia, freedom from quartering troops, and due process. Courts have been reluctant to give military tribunals authority over civilians. The anti-martial law principle in the Constitution is supported by Supreme Court cases. However, this principle has remained dormant, with uncharted boundaries in the Third Amendment and limited visibility in the Second Amendment. The Constitution recognizes the use of military force in domestic affairs, allowing Congress to authorize the militia to enforce laws, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions. States are protected against invasion or usurpation of their government and can request militia assistance to handle domestic violence. States cannot maintain standing armies but have some control over their militias, subject to congressional constraints. The Constitution allows for the use of military force in domestic affairs, including the authority to suppress insurrections or civil disturbances. Martial law, when military rule replaces civil authority during emergencies, has been proclaimed rarely. Military involvement in law enforcement has not been common but has occurred throughout history. Judicial guidance is needed to determine the extent of military involvement in civilian law enforcement, especially when it conflicts with constitutional guarantees like the right to a jury trial or freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. Congress's constitutional authority to enact and adjust the provisions of the Posse Comitatus Act is a matter of coordinating congressional and presidential powers. The President, as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief, has extensive responsibilities and prerogatives, including ensuring laws are faithfully executed. The Supreme Court has clarified that the President does not always need explicit authorization to exercise his powers. The President has the authority to act in emergencies, even without explicit statutory authorization. This includes appointing marshals for protection, using force against enemies, and calling upon the Armed Forces to address threats to federal responsibilities. Some believe this authority is inherent and not subject to congressional direction, although Congress also shares power over laws and the military with the President. The Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws and regulate the Armed Forces, while also allowing the President to act in emergencies. The Supreme Court has clarified the coordination of presidential and congressional powers regarding the use of the military to enforce civilian law. The President's power under the Guarantee Clause is only temporary until Congress acts, and the Armed Forces cannot be used in a domestic emergency if Congress has not authorized it previously. The President's implied and incidental powers may not always override conflicting, constitutionally grounded claims, even when Congress has not limited the exercise of the President's constitutional powers. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases expressly authorized by the Constitution, with some believing that the Constitution allows the President to use the military to enforce laws despite the Act. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases expressly authorized by the Constitution, with debates over the inclusion of the word \"expressly\" to prevent the use of the Army where implied authority could be inferred. The compromise reached at conference upheld the positions of the House and Senate managers on the issue. The Posse Comitatus Act may not limit the President's implied powers, with exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. The question of whether the Act includes instances of the President's inherent powers remains unanswered by the courts. The use of the Armed Forces to enforce federal law is allowed when authorized by Congress. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply when Congress authorizes the military to enforce the law, either by giving them law enforcement authority or through specific legislation. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply when Congress authorizes the military to enforce the law, either by giving them law enforcement authority or through specific legislation. Statutes have been passed allowing the Armed Forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies, with restrictions on direct law enforcement involvement. The debate revolves around the level of explicitness required in statutory exceptions for military involvement in civilian tasks. Some argue that as long as Congress authorizes a task to be done, the military can be asked to help, while others maintain a stricter interpretation. The debate revolves around the level of explicitness required in statutory exceptions for military involvement in civilian tasks. Some argue that as long as Congress authorizes a task to be done, the military can be asked to help, while others maintain a stricter interpretation. The phrase \"in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by ... Act of Congress\" demands that the statutory exception specifically refer to some form of military assistance. The Posse Comitatus Act allows for exceptions in cases of insurrection or civil disturbance, where the President can call forth the military under Chapter 13 of Title 10, U.S. Code. The President must issue a proclamation ordering insurgents to disperse peacefully. Section 251 of Title 10 authorizes the President to use the military to suppress an insurrection at the request of a state legislature or governor if the legislature cannot be convened. The first request for troops after the Posse Comitatus Act was in 1879 by the governor of Nebraska to protect a local court. In 1879, the governor of Nebraska requested troops to protect a local court during the trial of an outlaw, but the request was denied due to the Posse Comitatus Act. President McKinley later deployed troops to Coeur d'Alene, ID in 1899 to control a conflict between union miners and mine owners. During the early 20th century, state officials directed operations in Colorado during a coal miners' strike. When the governor requested federal aid, Secretary of War Elihu Root clarified that troops provided under the insurrection statutes would be under the President's direction. In 1907, troops were requested in Nevada to address violence by a miners' union. In response to a miners' strike in Ludlow, Colorado in 1914, President Wilson granted federal troops at the governor's request. In 1917, a \"Direct Access Policy\" was implemented by the Secretary of War to allow local and state officials to directly request federal troops for assistance during labor disputes. Between 1919 and 1920, federal troops were used to help quell labor disputes and other minor conflicts. Between 1919 and 1920, federal troops were deployed 29 times to assist in labor disputes and minor disturbances across various industries and cities. The policy was revoked in 1921 due to misuse of troops, but was reinstated in 1932 by President Hoover to oust the Bonus Army at the request of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia. President Hoover used federal troops in 1932 to remove the Bonus Marchers from Washington, DC. President Roosevelt directed the Secretary of War in 1941 to seize and operate an aviation plant during a strike threat to fighter plane production. The workers returned to the plant under military supervision to avoid losing deferred draft status. Other labor disturbances were handled by having the Army or Navy seize and manage necessary plants or railroads for the war effort. During World War II, racial tensions led to civil disturbances, prompting federal troops to be deployed in Detroit and Philadelphia. President Roosevelt sent troops to Detroit in 1943 and Philadelphia in 1944 to restore order during race riots and strikes. In 1967, President Johnson sent troops to Detroit again at the request of the Michigan governor. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson deployed troops to Washington, DC, Chicago, and Baltimore to quell riots following Martin Luther King's assassination. President George H. W. Bush also sent troops to St. Croix in 1989 after Hurricane Hugo for widespread looting. President George H. W. Bush issued a proclamation and deployed troops to the Virgin Islands in 1989 to address looting and restore order after Hurricane Hugo. The troops, including military police and federal investigators, were sent to St. Croix to enforce federal law and protect public property. This action was similar to President Lyndon Johnson's deployment of troops in 1968 to quell riots following Martin Luther King's assassination. The Posse Comitatus Act allows the President to use the Armed Forces to enforce laws or suppress rebellion when necessary. It was first used in 1878 in New Mexico to restore order and combat robber bands terrorizing the territory. The Posse Comitatus Act was used in 1878 in New Mexico to restore order and combat robber bands. Civil authorities relied on U.S. troops for law enforcement, leading to a dependence on military intervention due to lawlessness and riots in the territory. President Arthur invoked the Insurrection Act in response to the territorial governor's plan to arm citizens against Apaches suspected of murder. He sought relief from the Posse Comitatus Act to allow military intervention, but Congress refused. Federal troops were later deployed to Chicago in 1894 to quell riots during railroad strikes. President Grover Cleveland issued proclamations to disperse rioters during railroad strikes in 1894 after violence erupted in Hammond, IL. Federal troops were used to recapture stolen trains as civilian authorities struggled to find deputies due to popular sympathies favoring the strikers. In 1885, federal troops were used to recapture stolen trains from disaffected miners and laborers. There was resistance in Utah to the \"Edmunds law\" for the suppression of polygamy, leading to the governor seeking federal assistance. Animosity towards Chinese railroad laborers and miners resulted in disturbances in western states and territories in 1885-1886. Federal troops were employed in Montana in 1897 to protect a prisoner from a potential lynching. In 1914, troops were used to suppress a riot in Arkansas and support the courts. During the 1967 anti-war demonstration known as the March on the Pentagon, a task force of troops and police was assembled to protect the Pentagon. A covert intelligence operation was authorized to infiltrate protest groups, with radio communications monitored. Section 332 was considered for legal justification but not used. Authorities relied on an implicit sovereign right to protect government property, with section 332 held in reserve in case of escalating violence. In 1970, the National Guard was called to enforce laws during a postal strike, citing the Economy Act of 1932. In 1973, the Army was considered for a federal law enforcement operation at the Pine Ridge Reservation, but military advisors advised against it. In 1987, President Reagan ordered rioting prisoners in Atlanta to disperse and authorized military support to civil authorities, leading to litigation and legislation to allow certain types of military aid. The Secretary of Defense can call up National Guard units to suppress violence, following law enforcement policies set by the Attorney General. Section 253 of Title 10 allows the President to use the Armed Forces to suppress insurrection or domestic violence if local law enforcement is hindered. This provision does not require the governor's permission. In 1957, President Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard to enforce a court order allowing black students to attend a white high school, citing Title 10, U.S. Code. This action set a precedent for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to address resistance to desegregation in Southern states. President Kennedy federalized the Mississippi National Guard and ordered Army troops to enforce a court order for desegregation in Mississippi. He used the same authority to confront resistance in Alabama in 1963 and President Johnson did the same in 1965 to protect civil rights marchers. Congress enacted general law enforcement exceptions in 1981. In 1981, Congress enacted general law enforcement exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act prohibitions in order to resolve questions raised by cases from events at Wounded Knee. The legislation grants military assistance to federal, state, and local police, including information and equipment, with restrictions on its use. The Posse Comitatus Act exceptions in Chapter 15 of Title 10, U.S. Code allow military sharing of information acquired during operations with civilian law enforcement. Military undercover agents and intelligence collection on civilian activities are permitted only if related to a military purpose. The Posse Comitatus Act allows military sharing of information with civilian law enforcement for a military purpose. Section 273 permits military personnel to train civilian police on equipment and provide expert advice. An implementing regulation excludes certain intelligence activities from this assistance. Enforcement by Defense intelligence and counterintelligence components is allowed for investigating or preventing clandestine intelligence activities by foreign powers or international terrorist or narcotics activities. Intelligence elements can cooperate with law enforcement agencies to protect personnel, property, and information, and provide specialized equipment or assistance when lives are at risk. The use of military weapons and equipment, even by civilians within the United States, may violate the Posse Comitatus Act. The Posse Comitatus Act applies to the use of military personnel and equipment by civilian authorities. The Defense Department can provide civilian police with military equipment and personnel for certain purposes, such as drug cases. Congress has also authorized military assistance for enforcing laws against chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction. In 2015, Congress authorized military assistance to the Department of Justice for situations involving bombings of public places and infrastructure facilities. This authority does not allow for military arrests, searches, seizures, or intelligence collection for law enforcement purposes. In 2016, Congress also granted military support for counterdrug activities and combating transnational organized crime, allowing the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to various law enforcement agencies upon request. The authorized military assistance for counterdrug and counter-transnational crime activities includes maintenance and repair of equipment, transportation of personnel and supplies, training of law enforcement personnel, detection and monitoring of air and sea traffic, construction of roads and fences, establishment of command and control centers, linguist and intelligence analysis, and aerial and ground reconnaissance. The authorized military assistance for counterdrug and counter-transnational crime activities includes maintenance and repair of equipment, transportation of personnel and supplies, training of law enforcement personnel, detection and monitoring of air and sea traffic, construction of roads and fences, establishment of command and control centers, linguist and intelligence analysis, and aerial and ground reconnaissance. Support for foreign law enforcement agencies requires congressional notification and is subject to certain limitations to prevent undermining US military capability and ensure civilian beneficiaries pay for assistance. Regulations under section 275 prevent the use of Armed Forces for civilian law enforcement purposes. The regulations in subsection 213.10(a)(3) prohibit military personnel from directly assisting in activities such as interdiction, search and seizure, arrest, surveillance, and pursuit of individuals. These provisions were incorporated into a DoD Instruction in 2013. The new C.F.R. part 182 expanded on these limitations to match those in the Instruction. Prohibited activities for military personnel include interdiction, search and seizure, arrest, using force or violence, evidence collection, surveillance, pursuit, and forensic investigations. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits military personnel from engaging in civilian law enforcement activities, such as interdiction, search and seizure, arrest, using force or violence, evidence collection, surveillance, pursuit, and forensic investigations, unless there is a DoD nexus or written consent from civilian law enforcement. The Act was designed to prevent the use of the Armed Forces for civilian law enforcement, but does not limit their authority to perform military duties. The Posse Comitatus Act does not restrict the Army from performing military duties that incidentally benefit civilian law enforcement. Courts believe that as long as the primary purpose is military, assisting law enforcement is permissible. Maintaining order on military facilities is seen as essential for military operations, allowing military personnel to cooperate with civilian law enforcement without violating the Act. Military personnel can assist civilian law enforcement authorities by turning over armed felons, drunk drivers, stolen firearms, and equipment on military bases without violating the Posse Comitatus Act. They can also arrest civilians for crimes committed on military facilities and investigate off-base conduct of military personnel and civilians suspected of UCMJ violations. The DOD Instruction supports this understanding. The DOD Instruction supports military personnel assisting civilian law enforcement authorities in various ways, including arresting civilians for crimes on military facilities and investigating off-base conduct for UCMJ violations. The military purpose doctrine in cooperative police activities off-base presents challenges in determining the level of military connection required. Congress's authorization for the use of force post-9/11 has potentially altered limitations on military involvement in law enforcement by framing them as military operations. The Posse Comitatus Act was advised not to constrain the President's use of military forces domestically for anti-terrorism operations. The Posse Comitatus Act does not restrict the President's use of military forces domestically for anti-terrorism operations against international terrorists within the United States. The Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Act applies to law enforcement purposes, not military functions, but allows for military use when constitutionally or statutorily authorized. Counter-terrorism operations may involve military actions like arrests, searches, and seizures, which can overlap with law enforcement activities. The Office of Legal Counsel determined that the President's use of military forces domestically for anti-terrorism operations against international terrorists within the United States is not restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. Military actions such as making arrests, seizing documents, and intercepting communications could be useful for federal prosecutors. The President's inherent power to defend the United States provides a constitutional exception to the Act, with statutory exceptions found in the authorization for use of military force and the Insurrection Act. However, much of this opinion is no longer the official interpretation of the Justice Department. The Office of Legal Counsel criticized a 2001 memorandum regarding the Authority for Use of Military Force, stating that certain propositions should not be considered authoritative. The revised view emphasized that the use of military force under the AUMF would be a military action, not a law enforcement action, potentially subject to the 'military purpose' doctrine. The revised view of the OLC emphasized that the use of military force under the Insurrection Act would require an actual obstruction of federal law or breakdown in state authorities. Despite Congress' push to use military for counter-terrorism, there is more discussion on Posse Comitatus Act and \"Global War on Terror\" than actual judicial decisions. One U.S. citizen detained as an \"enemy combatant\" sought habeas corpus relief, claiming military confinement violated Posse Comitatus. The district court judge ruled that Jose Padilla's military detention was for interrogation and prevention of re-affiliation with an unlawful organization, not for civilian law violations. The decision was initially reversed but later vacated by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds. Padilla did not rely on the Posse Comitatus Act in subsequent proceedings. The Posse Comitatus Act is limited to \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force, with conflicting interpretations in case law. It is unlikely that a court would convict for anything less than a deliberate disregard of the law's requirements. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the Army or Air Force to execute laws, with interpretations suggesting violations occur when military performs tasks typically handled by civilian government. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of military forces in law enforcement activities, particularly when they assist civilian police. This restriction was prompted by instances where the Army acted as a police force in various situations, such as labor disputes, tax collection, and maintaining order at the polls. Courts developed tests to determine if military support for civilian authorities violates the Posse Comitatus Act, stemming from incidents at Wounded Knee. The majority of cases found that military assistance to law enforcement did not breach the Act, except for cases with questionable military purposes and insufficient government justification. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opined in 1991 that military personnel conducting aerial infrared monitoring for law enforcement purposes is authorized by law and not prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act. OLC interpreted that Congress did not intend the term \"search\" in the law to include all Fourth Amendment searches, but only those involving physical contact with civilians or their property. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the Army or Air Force to enforce the law, but does not mention the Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or National Guard. Congress intended to prevent direct confrontations between military personnel and civilians. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, but they are subject to similar restrictions through administrative and legislative supplements. The Coast Guard, originally formed from civilian agencies, is now a branch of the Armed Forces under the Department of Homeland Security. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the Coast Guard while it remains part of the Department of Homeland Security. Even when part of the Navy, the Coast Guard is authorized to perform law enforcement functions, exempt from posse comitatus restrictions. The act is unclear on what constitutes being \"part\" of the Army or Air Force for proscription purposes. The National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and civilian employees of the Armed Forces are not clearly addressed by the Posse Comitatus Act. The National Guard is considered part of the Army or Air Force when in federal service, and historical context suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service. The Posse Comitatus Act's reference to \"posse comitatus or otherwise\" covers troops acting as citizens, not soldiers. The National Guard is subject to both state and federal law, not covered by the Act when not in federal service. The DOD Instruction applies only when National Guard members are in federal service. The Act's extension to soldiers assisting civilian law enforcement is unclear. The Posse Comitatus Act allows soldiers to assist civilian law enforcement like any other citizen, especially off duty. Congress passed the act in response to cases where military members were used based on civic obligations. The Senate debate influenced earlier court decisions, stating that soldiers assisting law enforcement in a manner similar to civilians do not violate the Act. Recent decisions focus on the nature of assistance provided and its relation to the action taken. The Posse Comitatus Act applies to civilian employees of the Armed Forces, with some debate on whether they are considered part of the Armed Forces. The Defense Department Instruction includes civilian employees within its policy restrictions, while the Office of Legal Counsel believes they are not \"part of\" the Armed Forces and can be assigned to law enforcement duties without violating the Act. Military members under civilian command are also not considered part of the Armed Forces according to the Office of Legal Counsel. The Posse Comitatus Act, enacted in response to issues within the United States, does not have extraterritorial application. It applies to civilian employees of the Armed Forces and military members under civilian command, who are not considered part of the Armed Forces. The Posse Comitatus Act does not have extraterritorial application, as it applies to civilian employees of the Armed Forces and military members under civilian command. Congress intended the authority and restrictions of certain sections to apply both in the United States and beyond its borders, including on the high seas. The regulations implementing 10 U.S.C. Section 275 address assistance to law enforcement officials in the U.S. and its territories, not foreign officials. The Mansfield Amendment creates a version of the Posse Comitatus Act for overseas drug enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act applies to civilian employees of the Armed Forces and military members under civilian command, with no extraterritorial application. The Posse Comitatus Act has been invoked in various legal challenges, including jurisdiction of courts, defense in criminal prosecutions, suppression of evidence, civil liability, and actions by the Armed Forces. Violations are often alleged by defendants to exclude related testimony or evidence. In United States v. Walden, the court found that the use of Marines as undercover agents violated Navy regulations but did not exclude the obtained evidence. The court in United States v. Walden found no deliberate intent to violate regulations or the Posse Comitatus Act. It noted the lack of enforcement mechanisms in the regulation and the act only allowing for criminal prosecution. The court considered the use of Marines as aberrational and warned of adopting an exclusionary rule if future violations occurred. Later defendants and courts have focused on this warning. Later defendants have focused on the Walden court's warning against adopting an exclusionary rule. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that a Navy investigation of child pornography involving surveillance of all computers in Washington violated DoD regulations by actively involving in civilian enforcement. The Ninth Circuit found that a Navy investigation involving surveillance of all computers in Washington violated regulations prohibiting direct military involvement in civilian law enforcement. The court initially ordered evidence suppressed for deterrence, but later ruled that suppression was unnecessary as the government was already taking corrective action. There is no clearly established right to exclude evidence for a Posse Comitatus Act violation. The Posse Comitatus Act does not guarantee the exclusion of evidence even in cases of widespread violations. Some states have suppressed evidence obtained by military undercover agents targeting civilian drug dealing without military connections. In cases involving military investigators, failure to challenge Posse Comitatus Act violations does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Criminal defendants have unsuccessfully sought refuge in the Act when transported by the military. The Posse Comitatus Act does not guarantee exclusion of evidence even in cases of violations. Defendants have unsuccessfully sought refuge in the Act when transported by the military, but courts have noted that dismissal is not an appropriate remedy for violations. Defendants have used the Posse Comitatus Act to challenge prosecutions, arguing violations precluded their convictions for obstructing law enforcement officials. The Act has been found to potentially constitute an unreasonable search and seizure, leading to legal action against federal officers. The Posse Comitatus Act is used by federal officers as a defense against legal claims, including those under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Plaintiffs facing violations by state or local law enforcement officers also have challenges. The Act is rarely raised in civil cases, but its impact is significant in ensuring compliance by the Armed Forces to avoid involvement in civilian affairs contrary to the Act."
