The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include material disclosures for high-cost mortgages and clarify the definition of a creditor. Additionally, disclosures are required and certain terms are prohibited for high-cost mortgages. \"SEC. 129. REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH COST MORTGAGES.\" The creditor must provide specific written disclosures for high-cost mortgages, including a statement about the risk of losing the home, the initial annual percentage rate, the consumer's income and monthly payment, and information for variable rate loans. The disclosures for high-cost mortgages include details on the initial annual percentage rate, the period of time it will be in effect, the rates after the initial period, consumer's non-obligation to complete the transaction, and a statement about the loan being high cost under Federal law. The disclosures for high-cost mortgages must be provided at least 3 business days before the loan is finalized. The loan terms cannot be changed after these disclosures are given.

Protection laws prohibit certain actions related to home equity loans and home improvement contracts, including falsifying information, disbursing funds prematurely, engaging in deceptive conduct, and attempting to evade regulations.
