    "content": "The \"Invest in Women's Health Act of 2017\" aims to increase women's access to preventive cancer screening, including breast, cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar cancer screening. The Act focuses on serving at-risk populations, reducing healthcare disparities among low-income women and women of color, decreasing healthcare spending, and expanding health literacy and education on the benefits of regular cancer screening for women. Congress finds that breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women under 54, with recommendations for regular clinical breast exams. Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other female reproductive system cancer. The most common cancers in women are breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer, with over 314,000 new cases in 2013. Gynecologic cancer rates vary by race and ethnicity, with some cancers showing similar incidence and death rates across all races. Among all races, women of color have a higher incidence of cervical cancer. While White women have a higher incidence of uterine cancer, Black women have a 2 times higher death rate from uterine cancer. Prevention and cancer screening are crucial for early detection and treatment. Deaths from breast and cervical cancers are more common among uninsured or underinsured women. Cervical cancer, once a leading cause of cancer death in the US, is now more preventable and treatable due to enhanced screening. Increased access to education, information, and preventive cancer screening at women's health care providers like Planned Parenthood helps women, especially women of color who face higher risks of breast cancer and other gynecologic cancers. SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING ACCESS TO CANCER SCREENING FOR WOMEN. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide grants for women's health care providers. The Secretary is authorized to make grants and contracts to expand preventive health services, focusing on cancer screening, Pap tests, HPV vaccination, and diagnostic tests for women with cancer symptoms, especially women of color. $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2017 through 2020 for this purpose. The Public Health Service Act authorizes funding for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program for fiscal years 2017 through 2020. SEC. 5. EXPAND CANCER SCREENING PROVIDER TRAINING. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Women's Health Care Providers Demonstration Training Project. The Secretary will establish a program to award grants for training healthcare providers in breast and gynecologic cancer screening. The purpose is to provide clinical training based on the latest guidelines and research, and to create a specialized training model for healthcare providers. The program aims to award grants for training healthcare providers in women's health care, focusing on breast and gynecologic cancer screening. Eligible entities include those receiving funding under section 1001, essential community providers in family planning, and entities serving individuals eligible for medical assistance. Entities eligible for funding include those providing cancer screening services under the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. The text chunk discusses a study and report to Congress on increased cancer screening for women. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on women's cancer screening access in the US, with reports due to Congress every 5 years. The study will analyze cancer rates and screening services by state, income, race, and insurance coverage. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on women's cancer screening access in the US, analyzing cancer rates and screening services by state, income, race, and insurance coverage. Additionally, estimated Federal savings achieved through early detection of breast and gynecologic cancer will be examined, along with recommendations for increased access to women's health care providers for preventive care, including cancer screening."
