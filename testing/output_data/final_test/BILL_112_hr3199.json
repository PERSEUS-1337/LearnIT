FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that while blends of up to 10 percent ethanol are currently required in the American motor fuels market, further research is needed on the effects of higher percentage ethanol blends before widespread use. Testing suggests negative environmental, safety, durability, health, and performance effects for vehicles and infrastructure from mid-level ethanol blends containing up to 15 percent ethanol. The Environmental Protection Agency's decision to allow the use of mid-level ethanol blends in newer motor vehicles is also noted. The Environmental Protection Agency's decision to allow mid-level ethanol blends in newer motor vehicles did not consider all available research and relied on a single study, violating scientific integrity principles. The Act defines the term \"Administrator\" as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and \"mid-level ethanol blend\" as a blend containing 15 or 20 percent ethanol for use in gasoline-powered vehicles. Prior to any waiver implementation, the Administrator must contract the National Academies for a comprehensive assessment of mid-level ethanol blends compared to 10% and 0% ethanol gasoline blends. The assessment will evaluate environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects on various engines, vehicles, and equipment. The Administrator must evaluate tailpipe emissions, evaporative emissions, engine durability, on-board diagnostics, emissions inventory, materials compatibility, operability, fuel efficiency, catalyst durability, and storage tank durability for engines, vehicles, and equipment. The evaluation includes assessing the durability of storage tanks, piping, and dispensers for retail, as well as identifying research and development needed for existing motor fuels infrastructure to handle mid-level ethanol blends without adverse impacts like corrosion or misfueling. This involves bulk storage, retail distribution, and standardizing labels. The National Academies will assess the durability of storage tanks, piping, and dispensers for retail, and identify research needed for existing motor fuels infrastructure to handle mid-level ethanol blends. They will follow technical standards from various organizations and submit a report to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology within 18 months of the Act's enactment. Authorization of up to $900,000 from funds under Public Law 96-569 for carrying out the Act."
