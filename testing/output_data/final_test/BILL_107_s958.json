The funds from docket 326-K awarded to the Western Shoshone Indians by the Indian Claims Commission will be distributed to eligible individuals meeting specific criteria set by the Secretary. This includes those with at least 1/4 degree of Western Shoshone Blood, U.S. citizenship, and living at the time of enactment. Additionally, those eligible for per capita payments from other judgment funds appropriated before a certain date may also receive payments. The Secretary will establish the Western Shoshone Judgment Roll for eligible individuals with specific criteria. Per capita distribution of funds will be made to each person listed on the Roll. The Secretary's decision on enrollment applications will be final. The Western Shoshone Judgment Roll will determine per capita shares for living competent adults, deceased individuals' shares will go to heirs, and shares of minors will be held by the Secretary. The Secretary will hold funds in supervised individual Indian money accounts, disbursing payments over 4 years equaling 25% of the principal plus interest. The first payment goes to individuals at age 18 if legally competent, with subsequent payments on following birthdays. Per capita shares are not subject to federal or state income taxation, nor considered income or resources. Per capita shares belonging to eligible adults will be added to principal funds if unpaid for 6 years. For minors, the 6-year period starts when they reach adulthood. These shares are not considered income or resources and do not affect eligibility for financial assistance or benefits under federal programs. Any remaining principal and interest funds after distribution to minors will be added to principal funds held and invested according to section 3. SEC. 3. DISTRIBUTION OF DOCKETS 326-A-1 AND 326-A-3.
