    "content": "The discovery of new domestic natural gas sources from shale has sparked interest in using natural gas for transportation. This can be achieved by burning methane directly in modified engines, using natural gas liquids as gasoline substitutes, or converting methane to synthetic diesel and gasoline alternatives. Natural gas can also be used to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles and generate electricity for charging electric vehicles. Automakers and truck manufacturers are introducing new vehicle lines fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) due to increased supplies and lower prices. Interest in using natural gas for transportation has increased due to factors such as price differentials, environmental benefits, energy diversity, and growth potential. Currently, only 2.9% of U.S. natural gas production is used for transportation. Natural gas production in the U.S. is mainly used for transportation through pipelines. Increased use of natural gas vehicles would boost demand. Technology advancements like hydraulic fracturing have led to a significant rise in shale gas production. Despite growth in natural gas consumption by vehicles, it still represents less than 1% of fuels used in transportation. Oil-based fuels remain dominant, but demand for petroleum products has decreased due to greater natural gas use. Natural gas is increasingly used as a transportation fuel due to its price advantage over diesel and gasoline. One gallon of LNG has 82,644 Btu compared to 139,000 Btu for diesel and 114,000 Btu for gasoline. Natural gas prices fell by half between 2008 and 2014, making it more competitive. However, this advantage could be affected if crude oil prices drop or natural gas prices rise. The increased use of natural gas as a transportation fuel would require substantial changes in vehicles and fueling infrastructure, with new technologies and investments needed. Various technologies can be used to harness natural gas, either in gaseous or liquid form, for powering internal-combustion engines. New fueling stations would need to be developed to make natural gas widely available for vehicles. Natural gas can be compressed to 3,600 psi for use in vehicle engines, with a CNG vehicle's fuel tank holding about eight gasoline gallons equivalent. The fuel system transfers pressurized gas to the engine, operating similarly to a gasoline engine. CNG vehicles use compressed air mixture ignited by a spark plug to drive pistons. Modifications are needed for CNG use, adding $11,000 to the price of a vehicle. Some models are bifuel, running on both CNG and gasoline. CNG is used in taxis, trucks, fleets, and buses. CNG vehicles are used for package delivery, residential refuse pickup, and transit buses. Government subsidies have been necessary to make CNG competitive with diesel fuel. Anheuser-Busch replaced 66 heavy-duty delivery trucks in Houston with CNG-powered vehicles after receiving a grant. There are approximately 150,000 CNG vehicles in the US, with a variety of models available for both commercial and passenger use. General Motors offers Express and Savana cargo and passenger vans with dedicated CNG engines. LNG, produced by cooling natural gas to a liquid state, is favored over CNG for long-haul trucks due to its higher energy density and storage efficiency. Long-haul truck drivers prioritize range and quick refueling, making LNG a preferred fuel option. When a truck engine is started, it warms the LNG, converting it into a compressed gas. LNG-related components add about $50,000 to the price of a truck that might otherwise sell for $150,000. An LNG-fueled truck driven 50,000 miles per year could save $85,000 in annual fuel costs, recouping the additional capital cost of the vehicle in seven months. LNG is not ideal for passenger vehicles due to the large insulated tanks needed to keep the fuel cold. LNG is most effective for long-haul trucks used regularly. The market for LNG trucks is growing, with fleet operators like Waste Management and UPS showing interest. Conversion kits allow trucks to run on LNG or diesel, taking advantage of changing fuel prices. Methanol, made from plant material or natural gas, is used in various industrial products due to its liquid form and high octane rating. Methanol, a liquid with a high octane rating, can be used as a motor vehicle fuel source in various ways, including direct use, conversion into DME as a diesel replacement, and biodiesel production. Despite its low volumetric energy density compared to gasoline, the cost of adding methanol capability to a vehicle is relatively low. This is typically done by installing an alcohol fuel sensor to create a \"flex-fuel\" vehicle that can run on pure methanol, pure gasoline, or a blend of both. No methanol flex-fuel vehicles are currently produced domestically. Manufacturers added larger fuel injectors and stainless steel fuel tanks and lines to methanol vehicles due to its corrosive nature. California experimented with methanol as a fuel from 1988 to 2004, producing about 15,000 methanol vehicles, mostly flex-fuel cars. Propane, accounting for 2% of US energy, is used for heating, cooking, and in the chemical industry due to its high energy density and clean-burning properties. Propane, also known as autogas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), is used as a motor vehicle fuel due to its high energy density and clean-burning attributes. Stored in a pressurized tank, it becomes a liquid with an energy density 270 times greater than its gaseous form. Vehicles can be produced as dedicated propane or bifuel, allowing the use of either propane or gasoline. General Motors offers light-duty propane vehicles such as the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans. Approximately 157,000 propane vehicles are on U.S. roads, mainly used for school buses, police cars, and fleet vehicles. Natural gas can be processed into various fuels for motor vehicles, such as DME derived from renewable materials and fossil fuels. China leads in DME consumption for heating, cooking, and as a truck and bus fuel. A U.S. pilot program for trucks is ongoing. Gas-to-liquids technology can convert natural gas into synthetic base oil with fewer impurities, improving equipment wear and fuel efficiency. GTL products can replace motor oil and diesel fuel. Royal Dutch Shell operates GTL plants globally. Gas-to-liquids (GTL) technology can convert natural gas into synthetic base oil and diesel fuel. Royal Dutch Shell operates GTL plants globally, with plans to use the technology for lower-viscosity engine oils to improve fuel economy. Hydrogen, mainly produced from natural gas, can power fuel cell vehicles, utilizing the existing natural gas supply and pipeline network. 95% of hydrogen in the US is produced this way in 73 plants, with ongoing research and development to make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles more competitively priced. Methods of making hydrogen from natural gas result in greenhouse gas emissions, requiring further research for better processes. The absence of a refueling network is a challenge for introducing fuel cell cars in 2015. Butanol, an alcohol that can be used as a gasoline substitute, can be produced from petroleum, sugar beets, cereal crops, and corn. A blend of 85% butanol and 15% gasoline can be used in unmodified gasoline engines, providing more power per gallon than ethanol. Butanol can be transported in existing gasoline pipelines, used in existing motor vehicles without engine adjustments, and sold through gasoline stations. The production and use of electric vehicles, fueled by natural gas, is on the rise. In 2013, 27% of U.S. electricity was generated from natural gas, with forecasts predicting steady growth. This shift towards electric vehicles could indirectly increase the natural gas/vehicle linkage. Additionally, a joint venture between BP and DuPont is retrofitting a Minnesota ethanol plant to produce butanol for vehicles, which can be used in unmodified gasoline engines and sold through gasoline stations. The success of natural gas vehicles depends on various factors such as fuel prices, infrastructure, incentives, and competition with traditional gasoline vehicles. Rising gasoline prices are crucial for the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles like electric, ethanol, natural gas, or hydrogen. If buyers expect low gasoline prices in the future, the adoption of natural gas vehicles will face challenges. The adoption of natural gas vehicles faces challenges due to the lack of refueling infrastructure and the chicken-and-egg dilemma. Despite being less expensive than gasoline, the biggest obstacle is finding economical ways to transfer gas to facilities. The biggest challenge in adopting natural gas vehicles is finding an economical way to transfer the gas to facilities for pressurization and commercial distribution. Stations offer fast-fill, time-fill, and combination fill options for filling up vehicle tanks with CNG. Fast-fill draws gas from the utility line, compresses it, and stores it for quick filling, while time-fill provides CNG directly from the gas line to the compressor, filling tanks more thoroughly but at a slower pace. There are 772 public CNG service stations in the country, with 127 more planned. Car owners can also refuel vehicles at home with a $5,000 home refueling unit. LNG refueling infrastructure is less developed than CNG, with LNG produced off-site and trucked to stations. LNG refueling is similar to diesel refueling but requires safety equipment due to its cryogenic nature. Mobile tanker trucks also offer LNG refueling options. LNG refueling stations are being built primarily on major highways for long-haul trucks. There are currently 64 public LNG stations open, with 82 more planned. Three investor groups are building the public network, including Clean Energy Fuels, Pilot Flying J, and Shell Oil Company. Blu.LNG is also building an infrastructure in Utah and neighboring states. Blu.LNG is constructing infrastructure in Utah, western states, and some Midwestern states. California and New York previously developed a methanol infrastructure with over 100 dispensing locations by 1997, but retail stations no longer dispense methanol or M85. Propane production, storage, and distribution facilities are widespread in the US, and expanding propane refueling stations would require a modest investment in dispensing equipment. Propane autogas is delivered to stations by transport trucks and stored in above-ground tanks. Dispensers can be added to existing retail outlets for gasoline and diesel. There are 2,687 propane refueling stations across the country. Additionally, there are 13 publicly available hydrogen fuel cell refueling stations, mainly in the Los Angeles area. Electric vehicles can be charged at home or at commercial charging stations. The Department of Energy (DOE) notes that most vehicle charging is done at home, with options for standard and fast charging. There are over 8,685 public electric charging stations and 21,000 outlets nationwide. Converting a vehicle to run on natural gas is technically feasible, with costs ranging from $6,500 to $12,000. Converting a vehicle to run on natural gas can cost between $6,500 to $12,000, with a long payback period unless the vehicle has low fuel efficiency and high mileage. Natural gas conversions may face challenges with the Clean Air Act regulations, as all new vehicles must pass emissions tests. Certifying vehicle conversions for small producers and individuals used to be expensive due to the need for independent approval for each converted vehicle. The EPA issued new regulations in 2012 to simplify the certification process for converting vehicles to natural gas. While natural gas vehicles are generally cleaner than gasoline and diesel vehicles, consumers should investigate warranty issues before making changes. New vehicles, regardless of fuel type, are cleaner than older vehicles due to stricter emission standards. The EPA issued new regulations in 2012 to simplify the certification process for converting vehicles to natural gas. New vehicles, regardless of fuel type, are cleaner than older vehicles due to stricter emission standards. CNG and LNG vehicles have lower greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions compared to gasoline and diesel vehicles, with CNG cars predicted to achieve roughly 10% lower greenhouse emissions than gasoline cars in 2035. Projected emissions in 2035 for CNG, gasoline, and diesel vehicles are about half of 2012 gasoline cars. Analyzing total emissions involves detailed assessment of fuel production, vehicle emissions, and indirect changes like land use. Petroleum fuels have lifecycle emissions from extraction, refining, distribution, and combustion. Various factors like efficiency and resource use impact emissions. The analysis of emissions for natural gas vehicles must consider fugitive methane emissions, which can impact total lifecycle emissions. While CNG vehicles have lower projected emissions compared to gasoline or diesel, there is still significant overlap in the range of emissions. Vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy are regulated under the Clean Air Act and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. EPA has authority to regulate these factors. The Clean Air Act and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act give EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and NHTSA administers CAFE standards. Both agencies have issued joint rules since 2012 to double fuel economy and halve greenhouse gas emissions by MY2025. Incentives for natural gas vehicles include emitting fewer greenhouse gases and generating credits under the CAFE standards based on petroleum consumption. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates federal agencies, state governments, and alternative fuel providers to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, including those capable of operating on ethanol, methanol, natural gas, and propane. This law aims to increase the use of alternative fuels in new passenger vehicles, such as police cars. Additionally, federal programs have started to focus more on natural gas vehicles, offering incentives to offset the incremental cost of these vehicles. The DOE provided $50 million in loans for natural gas vehicle production, including a loan to VPG for a wheelchair-accessible van. VPG closed in 2013, and its assets were sold to AM General, which relaunched the MV-1 van with gasoline and optional CNG fuel systems. The CMAQ program funds transportation projects for state and local governments to meet CAA requirements. Eligible activities include transit improvements, traffic flow enhancements, and public fleet conversions to cleaner fuels. The CMAQ program, authorized at $2.4 billion for FY2014, funds transportation projects for state and local governments. Recent grants will help Oregon build CNG fueling stations. ARPA-E's MOVE program focuses on advancing technologies for using domestic natural gas as fuel for vehicles, with a $30 million investment in 13 projects. MOVE program, funded with $30 million for 13 projects, aims to develop GTL technologies for transportation fuels using low-cost natural gas. ARPA-E has announced $34 million for 15 projects across nine states to reduce petroleum use in transportation. Clean Cities program supports alternative fuels, fuel economy improvements, and new transportation technologies, expanding the use of natural gas vehicles and funding public-access refueling infrastructure. State policies on natural gas vehicles vary, with different laws and regulations governing their sale and use. Taxation of natural gas motor fuel also differs among states, with varying methods for taxing CNG and LNG. Some states offer incentives for purchasing or converting to alternative fuel vehicles. Additionally, the interest in expanding natural gas refueling networks varies among states, with local codes and permitting processes influencing the construction of CNG stations. State policies and permitting processes dictate the construction of CNG stations. Some states have designated highways as corridors for natural gas service stations. Initiatives like the South Coast Air Quality Management District and UPS are building a natural gas corridor from Las Vegas to Ontario. Interstate 15 in Utah and the Texas Clean Transportation Triangle are also designated as natural gas vehicle corridors. Thirteen governors have agreed to expand the production of natural gas vehicles. As domestic natural gas supplies increase, congressional interest in using natural gas in transportation grows. Federal policies like tax incentives and research aim to expand natural gas vehicle production. Legislation in the 113th Congress proposes changes in taxation, regulations, weight limits, and funding for alternative fuel vehicles. One proposal affecting natural gas vehicles has passed in the 113th Congress. An amendment by Representative Eliot Engel in the 113th Congress prohibits the purchase of new light-duty vehicles by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs unless they are alternate fuel vehicles. This aligns with President Obama's federal fleet performance requirements. Additionally, a Senate bill includes a provision authorizing energy savings performance contracts and utility use amendments. The Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013 authorizes energy savings contracts for projects supporting natural gas and electric vehicles. S. 2260 extends tax credits for alternative fuels and fueling infrastructure. H.R. 5559 also extends fuel and infrastructure credits. S. 1486 includes provisions for postal reform. The Postal Reform Act of 2014 (S. 1486) requires a report on using natural gas in USPS trucks. Bills aim to change Motor Fuels Excise Tax for LNG. LNG users pay more tax than diesel users due to volume basis. CNG tax is based on energy content. Senate considered tax change in PATH Act but adopted H.R. 5021. The Senate adopted the House Highway and Transportation Funding Act (H.R. 5021) without the LNG tax provision. Federal tax policy has supported alternative fuels and vehicles, including natural gas. Pending legislation like S. 2065 seeks to provide parity for dual-fuel natural gas vehicles with electric vehicles under federal standards. H.R. 1027 and S. 488, Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2013, would authorize a DOE program for research, development, and application of vehicle technologies to reduce petroleum use. H.R. 1364, New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions Act of 2013, offers tax credits for alternative fuels and vehicles, grants for improving natural gas vehicle performance, and incentives for EPA to encourage natural gas vehicles. H.R. 2242 and H.R. 2493 promote the use of natural gas vehicles and alternative fuel light vehicles. H.R. 3937 and H.R. 3938 focus on assessing the economic and environmental impact of using natural gas in long-haul trucks. H.R. 3938, H.R. 3940, S. 2721, H.R. 4753, H.R. 4956 promote the use of natural gas and alternative fuel vehicles, including tax credits and weight limit regulations for long-haul trucks. The Fuel Choice for American Prosperity and Security Act of 2014 aims to promote various types of efficient motor vehicles and alternative fuels through tax credits and grants. It includes provisions for the purchase of the most efficient vehicles, excise tax credits for alternative fuels, benchmarks for federal fleet electrification, and a grant program for electric vehicle recharging facilities. Additionally, the Act revises fuel economy calculations for alternative fuel vehicles and promotes competitiveness and energy security for alternative fueled vehicles. S. 1230, Alternative Fueled Vehicles Competitiveness and Energy Security Act of 2013, expands vehicle technology categories eligible for DOE loans, provides technical assistance and grants for alternative fuel vehicles, identifies barriers in fuel distribution systems, and establishes an interagency council for federal agencies' alternative fuel vehicle procurement."
