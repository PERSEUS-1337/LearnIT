This threat of retaliation may discourage potential whistleblowers from coming forward. There is tension between encouraging whistleblowers to expose agency misconduct and protecting government secrets for national security. Congress and President Obama have taken steps to limit retaliation against Intelligence Community whistleblowers, but disclosures to media sources are generally unprotected. Protections against retaliation for IC whistleblowers include the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, Presidential Policy Directive 19, and Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, Presidential Policy Directive 19, and Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 provide protections against retaliation for Intelligence Community whistleblowers. The ICWPA was passed to fill a gap in whistleblower protections for intelligence agency employees, who were initially excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act. While the ICWPA extended some protections to intelligence whistleblowers, they still have less protection compared to non-intelligence whistleblowers under the WPA. The ICWPA, PPD-19, and Title VI provide protections for intelligence whistleblowers. PPD-19 expanded upon ICWPA's protections, and Title VI codified and built upon them. The ICWPA allows IC employees to disclose information to Congress to ensure proper oversight. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) allows intelligence community employees to disclose specified information to Congress. However, it does not explicitly prohibit retaliation against whistleblowers for bringing complaints to Congress. The ICWPA applies to employees of various intelligence agencies and contractors. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) allows intelligence community employees and contractors to disclose \"urgent concerns\" to Congress, which include serious abuses, violations of law, deficiencies in funding, and false statements to Congress. Employees must first report the concern to the agency head before disclosing it to Congress. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) allows intelligence community employees and contractors to disclose \"urgent concerns\" to Congress, including serious abuses, violations of law, deficiencies in funding, and false statements. Complaints must be brought to the agency head first before being brought to Congress, as outlined in the ICWPA. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) requires employees to report complaints to the agency head first. If the Inspector General does not find the complaint credible, employees can contact intelligence committees directly, but must first inform the agency head and follow their direction. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) requires employees to report complaints to the agency head first. If the Inspector General does not find the complaint credible, employees can contact intelligence committees directly. The ICWPA aims to extend whistleblower protections to IC whistleblowers, but it provides fewer protections compared to the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) for non-intelligence whistleblowers. The WPA allows employees to bring a claim against the agency in the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) for prohibited retaliation. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) lacks explicit remedies for retaliation, unlike the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) which allows for remedies such as back pay and consequential damages. The ICWPA also does not provide for judicial review of actions taken under it, unlike the WPA. Some commentators have raised concerns about the ICWPA's protections compared to the WPA. President Obama issued PPD-19 on October 10, 2012, to protect intelligence whistleblowers from retaliation by allowing them to report instances of waste, fraud, and abuse. Unlike the ICWPA, PPD-19's protections do not cover IC contractors. Five types of disclosures are considered \"protected disclosures\" under PPD-19, including reports to agency Inspector General, Director of National Intelligence, IGIC, or supervisors in the employee's chain-of-command. PPD-19, issued by President Obama in 2012, protects intelligence whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health or safety. It covers disclosures to congressional committees, investigations, and Inspectors General, ensuring employees making protected disclosures are not subjected to adverse actions or restricted access to classified information. Intelligence agencies must certify internal procedures for reviewing disclosures within 270 days of PPD-19 issuance. PPD-19 requires agencies to certify internal procedures for reviewing allegations of wrongful personnel actions or impacts on access to classified information within 270 days. Agency procedures must protect classified information and intelligence sources. Inspectors General can review employee allegations and recommend corrective action, such as reinstatement and back pay. Agency heads must carefully consider IG recommendations. Employees can request external review to the IGIC after exhausting internal agency review processes. PPD-19 allows agencies to request external review to the IGIC for allegations of retaliation. An external review panel, including the ICIG and two Inspectors General, determines if improper retaliation occurred within 180 days. If retaliation is found, corrective action is recommended to the agency head, who must consider it within 90 days. The Director of National Intelligence must be informed of any action taken. PPD-19 requires agencies to notify the President if the agency head does not inform the Director of National Intelligence of the action taken within 90 days. It also mandates the IGIC to report panel determinations and recommendations annually to the Director of National Intelligence and relevant congressional committees. PPD-19 provides more protection to intelligence whistleblowers against retaliation compared to the ICWPA, as it prohibits retaliation for protected disclosures and adverse security clearance determinations. PPD-19 offers more protection to intelligence whistleblowers against retaliation compared to the ICWPA. However, questions arise about the impartiality of the initial review process within the agency and the effectiveness of an external review panel in addressing retaliation claims. The external review panel can recommend corrective action but cannot mandate it. The external review panel under PPD-19 can recommend corrective action for retaliation against intelligence whistleblowers, but agency heads are not obligated to follow the recommendations. Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014 provides additional protections for IC whistleblowers, extending only to employees of covered intelligence community elements. Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014 protects intelligence community whistleblowers from retaliation through disclosures made to specific entities, safeguarding them from adverse personnel actions and security clearance determinations. Protected disclosures include those made to the Director of National Intelligence, IGIC, employing agency heads, agency Inspectors General, congressional intelligence committees, or their members. Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014 protects intelligence community whistleblowers from retaliation by prohibiting adverse personnel actions for disclosures of violations of federal laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. Enforcement of this protection is left to the President, who may develop new procedures or utilize existing ones like PPD-19. Adverse security clearance actions or restrictions on access to classified information are prohibited under Title VI for employees making protected disclosures. Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014 protects intelligence community whistleblowers from retaliation by prohibiting adverse personnel actions for disclosures of violations of federal laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. In the context of adverse security clearance actions or access determinations, protected disclosures include communications to designated officials about violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health or safety. Additionally, disclosures made in accordance with the procedures outlined in the ICWPA are also protected. Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014 protects intelligence community whistleblowers from retaliation by prohibiting adverse personnel actions for disclosures of violations of federal laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. It also provides mechanisms for enforcing protections against adverse security or information access determinations. The President was directed to select an agency responsible for ensuring intelligence agencies have adequate procedural protections within 180 days of the statute's enactment. Title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2014 ensures procedural protections for intelligence community whistleblowers, allowing them to appeal adverse security clearance or information access decisions to the ICIG or agency Inspector General within 90 days. The appeal procedures include a fact-finding investigation by the ICIG or agency Inspector General, with results reported to the agency head within 180 days. Employees are allowed to present relevant evidence during the investigation. The ICIG or agency Inspector General cannot find a prohibited security clearance or information access determination occurred if the agency proves the employee's disclosure was not a contributing factor. The agency must show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even without the employee's disclosures. The ICIG or agency Inspector General must give \"utmost deference\" to the agency's judgments on national security threats. Title VI mandates corrective action if a prohibited security clearance or information access determination is found by the ICIG or agency Inspector General. If no improper adverse determination is found, employees have 60 days to externally appeal, with procedures to be developed by the Director of National Intelligence, Attorney General, and Secretary of Defense. As of now, appeal procedures have not been established. Title VI expands protections against retaliation in security clearance determinations by introducing additional enforcement mechanisms, requiring adequate protections before adverse determinations. However, it does not strengthen protections against retaliation in adverse personnel actions, leaving enforcement to the President."
