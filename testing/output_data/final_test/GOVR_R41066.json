These technologies enhance communication but also raise concerns about adapting existing laws and regulations. The report examines Member use of Twitter as a new electronic communication medium, highlighting the dynamic nature of technology adoption by Members of Congress. Members of Congress now have more communication options with constituents, including e-mail, websites, social media, and online videos. This shift in communication methods has changed traditional patterns, with an increase in the use of new technology like e-mail. In 2008, nearly 200 million e-mails were exchanged between Members and constituents. The use of electronic communication by Members of Congress has increased significantly, with a rise in e-mails, websites, social media, and online videos. This shift has led to a decrease in postal mail sent to Congress. Electronic technology has made constituent communication more cost-effective, but it also raises concerns such as the potential electoral advantage for incumbent Members and issues related to third-party communication platforms. Twitter, created in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, is a web-based social networking service where users can send and read short messages called \"tweets\" of up to 140 characters. It allows individuals and organizations to share opinions, promote events, and announce products and services. The platform has unique features compared to traditional communication mediums like the United States Postal Service. Several legislative branch entities, including the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Library of Congress (LOC), actively use Twitter to communicate. Restaurant Associates, the House's food service vendor, also utilizes Twitter to announce daily specials and events. Twitter's 140 character limit highlights the ease of sending quick messages from mobile devices to followers worldwide, enabling instant communication without physical limitations. Twitter allows individuals to follow other users and access their tweets instantly. Users follow accounts based on interest, friendship, or fandom. Following enables quick access to tweets, useful for finding information or understanding activities. Users can access tweets on mobile devices. This report analyzes Member use of Twitter, including usage proportion and frequency. For August and September 2009, Member use of Twitter was tracked to determine the proportion of Members using it, how often they tweeted, and what they tweeted about. The analysis included both House and Senate Members during session and recess. The study used TweetCongress to identify Members on Twitter and cross-checked with a list of all Members. The results treat all Member tweets as structurally identical, without distinguishing between personal or staff tweets. The analysis covers Member use of Twitter, whether personally or through staff, for official or campaign purposes. It only spans two months, providing a snapshot of a dynamic process with potential for rapid changes in usage patterns. The data cannot be easily generalized or used to predict future behavior but offers insight into how Members are adapting to this new communication medium. During a 61-day period in 2009, 7,078 tweets were sent by Members of Congress, with 205 registered on Twitter. Registration rates were similar between the Senate and House, with more Republicans (60%) than Democrats (40%). During the observation period, 7,078 tweets were sent by Members of Congress, with 60% being Republicans and 40% Democrats. The average number of tweets per Member was 35, with wide variation in usage. 79% of tweets were sent by Representatives. During the observation period, 7,078 tweets were sent by Members of Congress, with 60% being Republicans and 40% Democrats. House Republicans sent approximately 55% of all tweets, while House Democrats sent 24%. Senate Republicans sent slightly more tweets (12%) than Senate Democrats (9%). On average, Republican Senators sent 39 tweets, while Democratic Senators sent 36 tweets during the period. During August and September 2009, Members of Congress sent a total of 7,078 tweets, with Republicans sending more tweets than Democrats. On average, Republican Representatives sent 38 tweets, while Democratic Representatives sent 27 tweets. Senators sent a total of 844 tweets during session and 628 tweets during recess. Overall, more tweets were sent during recess than during session, but on a per-day basis, more tweets were sent during session. During session, Senators and Representatives sent a total of 5,624 tweets, with an average of 109 tweets per day. The tendency towards in-session tweeting had a partisan component, with Republican Representatives and Democratic Senators sending significantly more tweets during session than during recess. Data was collected on the day of the week each Member tweet was sent, showing the average number of tweets sent by day in the House and Senate during session and recess. Representatives tweeted more during session, with the most tweets on Wednesdays, while Senators followed a similar pattern. Weekday tweeting during recess was consistent, with fewer tweets on weekends. During session, Senators sent the most tweets on Wednesdays, averaging 57 tweets. Fewer tweets were sent on Mondays (30), Tuesdays (39), Thursdays (37), and Fridays (32). Member tweets were categorized into eight major message categories, including position taking, policy statements, and personal content. Tweets were coded based on the issuer's party affiliation and whether they serve in the House or Senate. The tweets collected from Representatives and Senators were coded into categories based on the type of message issued, with each author coding approximately one-third of the 7,078 tweets. The categories included tweets where a position on a policy or political issue was taken, as well as tweets discussing public policy without taking a position. Examples of tweets included expressing support for legislation to audit the Federal Reserve and discussing the cost of cap and trade on families. House: Cap and trade could cost families $1,761 a year. Information on health care reform and preexisting conditions. Representatives and Senators tweeting about media appearances, district events, and official congressional actions. Example: holding a health care town hall tomorrow. Jefferson parade with calls for leadership. A Member of Congress may tweet about official congressional actions, such as roll call votes or committee hearings. They may also share personal experiences or campaign-related material, like fundraising efforts or campaign events. The Member of Congress released a web video for their campaign and thanked supporters. A study showed that policy tweets were common during sessions, while district tweets were more frequent during recess. During sessions, Members of Congress commonly tweeted about \"position taking,\" \"media,\" and \"official action,\" while during recess, \"personal,\" \"campaign,\" and \"other\" tweets were more prevalent. Twitter has changed how lawmakers communicate with the public, primarily serving as a one-way platform for sharing information on official actions and policy positions. The effectiveness of using Twitter for communication depends on the number of followers. Members of Congress had a total of 2,328,809 followers on Twitter as of December 30, 2009. Only 3.7% of tweets were direct replies to other tweets. Members of Congress had a total of 2,328,809 followers on Twitter. The median Representative had 1,297 followers, with the most-followed Representative having over 19,434 followers and the least-followed having 8 followers. In the Senate, the median Member had 3,536 followers, with the least-followed Senator having 216 followers, and the most-followed Senator having almost 1.7 million followers. Republican Members of the House had more followers than Democrats, while Senate Democrats had slightly more followers than Republicans. The use of Twitter by Members of Congress is increasing as they embrace new technologies, allowing them to communicate directly with constituents in a potentially interactive way. This can be influential for policy or voting decisions as they collect and transmit real-time information."
