    "content": "The Department of Defense and Congress are discussing the future of U.S. defense strategy, including both conventional and nuclear forces. The 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review was the first to examine both types of forces. Analysts are now assessing the relationship between conventional and nuclear weapons, using a possible conflict with China as a case study. The focus on potential military conflict with China has increased since the end of the Cold War, presenting challenges in a complex political, economic, and social relationship. The conflict presents a complicated political/economic/social relationship among participants and military challenges of defending a distant ally from a nearby adversary with large conventional and nuclear forces. Many in DOD view military conflict with China as a significant threat, requiring adequate military capabilities. Practical decisions on equipping forces and developing strategies for possible conflicts with China raise issues on U.S. conventional forces and nuclear deterrence. During the Cold War, the interplay between nuclear and conventional forces was assessed. During the Cold War, the United States and NATO assessed the interplay between nuclear and conventional forces in deterring potential conflicts with the Soviet Union and its allies. NATO's weaker conventional forces were balanced by the threat of nuclear escalation as a deterrent strategy. The United States and NATO considered deterring Soviet and Warsaw Pact attacks by threatening nuclear escalation. Analysts debated the effectiveness of this strategy, leading to discussions on increasing NATO's conventional force capabilities. The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review introduced a \"new triad\" including offensive strike weapons, missile defense, and nuclear infrastructure, expanding on the previous triad of ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers. The new triad's offensive strike component integrates nuclear and conventional capabilities, potentially reducing U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons. Questions arise on how this integration may impact the role and requirements of U.S. conventional weapons, with little influence on budget and procurement debates. DOD leaders believe current conventional and nuclear forces effectively deter state-on-state conflict. The current security environment poses challenges in deterring non-state actors, while potential conflicts with countries like North Korea, Iran, and China are of concern to military planners. A review of military strategy today is dominated by uncertainty and the need to consider a variety of national security challenges. During the Cold War, the United States focused on deterring the Soviet Union, assuming this would also deter lesser threats. However, the 9/11 attacks showed that non-state actors can pose significant dangers using easily accessible technology. Today, non-traditional threats are no longer considered secondary concerns, requiring a different approach to combat them effectively. In addressing non-state threats, defense planners must determine the allocation of military capabilities between traditional and non-traditional challenges. Preparing for non-traditional threats requires a different investment pattern than focusing on peer competitors. Resource constraints are also a significant factor influencing strategy and force structure decisions. Pressure is mounting on DOD leaders to make cost-effective strategy and force structure decisions due to budget constraints. The cost of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could reach $2 trillion, leading to resistance towards large supplemental appropriations. Long-term spending plans are under intense pressure, with the possibility of restrictions on emergency war funding. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that DOD's spending plans are underfunded by $50-150 billion annually during the years covered by the QDR. This could lead to hard decisions on force structure, such as choosing between new equipment and maintaining old equipment or personnel end strength. Failure to consider the interaction between nuclear and conventional weapons could result in acquiring redundant or unnecessary military forces and strategies ill-suited to guide them. The development of military strategies must address a broad range of threats, with projected budget shortfalls making cost-effective decisions crucial. Understanding nuclear weapons and deterrence in a conflict with China requires knowledge of U.S. and Chinese nuclear strategy. U.S. nuclear strategy has evolved over three eras: Cold War, post-Cold War, and 21st century strategy, focusing on deterrence during the Cold War against the Soviet Union. The United States developed nuclear forces to deter the Soviet Union and other countries like China and Eastern Europe. The goal was to prevent nuclear, conventional, or coercive attacks on the US and its allies by threatening nuclear retaliation. This was necessary because the Soviet Union and its allies had superior conventional forces. The United States developed nuclear forces to deter the Soviet Union and other countries due to their superior conventional forces. This led to the doctrine of extended deterrence, where nuclear weapons were used to repel attacks and prevent escalation into a nuclear conflict. Critics questioned whether the Soviet Union would believe the US would use nuclear weapons to defend its allies. During the 1950s and 1960s, the United States developed strategic doctrines of \"massive retaliation,\" \"damage limitation,\" and \"assured destruction\" to deter the Soviet Union and its allies from attacking the US or its allies with nuclear or conventional weapons. These doctrines focused on targeted strikes against Soviet military forces to impede their warfighting capability and convince the Soviet leadership of the potential destruction of their society. The United States shifted its strategic doctrine from \"massive retaliation\" to \"Flexible Response\" and \"Countervailing Strategy\" in the 1970s, focusing on retaliatory strikes against Soviet military forces instead of civilian targets. This change aimed to deter Soviet aggression while avoiding large-scale attacks on civilian and industrial sites. In the post-Cold War era, the Clinton Administration emphasized deterrence in its 1995 National Security Strategy report following the dissolution of the Soviet empire. The Clinton Administration acknowledged Russia's nuclear arsenal as a concern for U.S. national security, viewing nuclear weapons as a deterrent against potential threats. China was not seen as a direct threat, but DOD officials noted its military capabilities. The Clinton Administration recognized Russia's nuclear arsenal as a concern for U.S. national security, viewing nuclear weapons as a deterrent against potential threats. DOD officials also noted China's formidable small nuclear force and its efforts to modernize, highlighting the potential threat of weapons of mass destruction. The Administration issued new guidelines for U.S. nuclear strategy in late 1997, focusing on deterring a nuclear war. The Clinton Administration's nuclear strategy focused on deterring nuclear war rather than seeking to win a prolonged nuclear exchange. This approach did not change U.S. nuclear war plans or the President's options for a retaliatory strike. The use of nuclear weapons to deter nations other than Russia was highlighted in PDD-60, but the U.S. always maintained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks by conventional, chemical, or biological weapons. The George W. Bush Administration emphasizes the continued importance of nuclear weapons for U.S. security and deterrence. While Russia still possesses a significant nuclear arsenal, the improved cooperation between the two nations has led to a new strategic framework replacing the adversarial relationship of the Cold War. The U.S. faces threats from multiple potential opponents and unprecedented challenges. The Bush Administration highlights the significance of nuclear weapons for U.S. security and deterrence, facing threats from various opponents and challenges. Adversaries could include non-state actors, terrorists, China, Iran, and North Korea. The administration views nuclear weapons as part of a comprehensive strategy, not just for deterring nuclear conflicts with Russia but also assuring allies of U.S. commitment. The Bush Administration emphasizes the importance of nuclear weapons for U.S. security and deterrence against various adversaries. They aim to deter and defeat enemies using precision conventional weapons and ballistic missile defenses in addition to nuclear retaliation. The Bush Administration is shifting towards a \"tailored deterrence\" strategy, focusing on specific responses and a broader range of military capabilities to address emerging threats. They are moving away from sizing nuclear forces based on the Soviet threat and towards a \"capabilities-based\" approach, tailoring military capabilities to a wide spectrum of possible contingencies. This includes identifying potential conflicts, reviewing adversaries' capabilities, and developing appropriate responses. The Bush Administration is shifting towards a \"tailored deterrence\" strategy, focusing on specific responses and a broader range of military capabilities to address emerging threats. They are developing a force posture and nuclear weapons employment strategy to target specific capabilities, including the replacement of the Cold War SIOP with a new war plan known as OPLAN 8044. Additionally, a companion contingency plan, CONPLAN 8022-22, has been developed for prompt U.S. response to contingencies with nations other than Russia. The Bush Administration's new plan for U.S. response to contingencies with nations other than Russia includes options for using conventional and nuclear weapons. The focus is on developing and deploying nuclear capabilities to defeat potential adversaries, regardless of their possession of nuclear weapons. The United States has deactivated all Peacekeeper ICBMs, with their warheads no longer operational. China's nuclear force structure follows a strategy of \"minimum deterrence\" to prevent nuclear attacks. The US has uncertain estimates of China's evolving nuclear forces, including concerns about the speed of deployment of new missiles. China has deployed a small number of nuclear warheads on operational delivery systems, including CSS-4 and CSS-3 ICBMs for its primary and regional nuclear deterrents. Additionally, China has deployed intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The US lacks dialogue with China on strategic nuclear forces and doctrine. China has deployed CSS-2 and CSS-5 ballistic missiles, JL-1 SLBMs, and is developing new DF-31 and DF-31A ICBMs and JL-2 SLBMs for greater survivability. The PRC's strategic nuclear force could grow to 75-100 warheads by 2015, primarily targeting the United States. China may deploy new capabilities like multiple warheads, with some experts questioning U.S. intelligence estimates of China's missile force modernization. China's missile force modernization in China has been slower than predicted for about 15 years. China employs various basing modes and techniques for missile survivability, which could hinder a first strike against the United States but ensure a retaliatory strike capability. China opposes U.S. plans for ballistic missile defenses. China opposes U.S. plans to deploy ballistic missile defenses, citing concerns about undermining the credibility of China's deterrent. China's missile force includes nuclear warheads and regional range ballistic missiles, with a declared \"no first use\" policy. China's nuclear strategy involves a \"no first use\" policy, meaning they will not use nuclear weapons first against any nation or threaten non-nuclear nations. However, they have not ruled out retaliation in response to a nuclear attack, following a minimum deterrent strategy. Some observers question the reliability of declaratory policy in determining actual military plans, but China's limited first strike capabilities suggest sincerity in their no-first-use policy. China's nuclear strategy involves a \"no first use\" policy, but there are concerns that China might pursue a more proactive \"limited deterrence\" strategy with its nuclear weapons, allowing for the use of nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks or to compel an adversary to back down. This shift in strategy is prompted by the PLA's strategic nuclear modernization and statements about China's ability to strike the United States. China's nuclear strategy may shift towards a \"limited deterrence\" approach, allowing for the use of nuclear weapons to deter U.S. intervention in a crisis with Taiwan. This strategy would address concerns about U.S. missile defenses and would require China to enhance its nuclear forces with various delivery vehicles and warhead types. China would need a variety of delivery vehicles and warheads types, along with high accuracies on its weapons to threaten a range of targets. Advanced command and control capabilities are necessary for directing attacks. There is no evidence that China's \"no first use\" doctrine has changed, but observers have expressed concerns about China's nuclear force capabilities and doctrine. China's Gen. Zhu dismissed China's \"no first use\" policy, stating it could be changed in response to challenges from U.S. defense policy. Some viewed his comments as personal opinion, while PLA's nuclear forces assured not being the first to use nuclear weapons. U.S. policymakers face the challenge of balancing relations with China, Taiwan, and Japan to deter aggression in East Asia. The U.S.-China relationship is complex, marked by competition, tension, cooperation, and interdependence. The potential economic and political consequences of a military conflict between China and the United States would be significant due to their strong economic ties. China's role in global affairs, as a major trading partner and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, raises questions about the likelihood of China risking its economic partnerships by initiating military actions against Taiwan or Japan. Similarly, the United States faces the dilemma of potentially jeopardizing its economic and political interests in a cooperative China by engaging in war. The Bush Administration's policy towards China shows ambivalence, with calls for China to be a responsible stakeholder while also criticizing its military expansion. The US aims for a cooperative relationship with China but also adopts a hedging strategy against it. The 2006 Defense Review highlighted the U.S. goal for China to be an economic partner and responsible stakeholder, while also acknowledging China's military potential to compete with the U.S. and develop disruptive technologies. Some advocate for a proactive hedging strategy against China, while others see mutual hedging as hindering a cooperative relationship for Asian stability. The Department of Defense notes that China's military modernization poses a challenge to U.S. military advantages, with a focus on conflict with Taiwan. China's investments include ballistic missiles, submarines, and advanced aircraft, raising concerns about potential escalation to nuclear war in the Taiwan Strait. Both countries have issued warnings regarding military matters. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), P.L. 96-8, governs U.S. security assistance to Taiwan since 1979. It is not a formal commitment to Taiwan's defense, and the U.S. is not legally obligated to defend Taiwan. Admiral Fallon emphasized common interests and increased military contacts between the U.S. and China during a Senate hearing. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) governs U.S. security assistance to Taiwan since 1979. The U.S. is not legally compelled to defend Taiwan, but the TRA specifies U.S. policy to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and maintain the capacity to resist any coercion jeopardizing Taiwan's security. Congress and the President determine defense assistance based on Taiwan's needs. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) governs U.S. security assistance to Taiwan since 1979, specifying U.S. policy to provide defensive arms and maintain the capacity to resist coercion jeopardizing Taiwan's security. U.S. response to future Taiwan Strait situations is not specified by Congress, leading to differing opinions on the clarity of U.S. policy towards Taiwan. President Clinton deployed aircraft battle groups in 1996 in response to Chinese missile tests, while President Bush stated in 2001 that he would support Taiwan in defending itself. Supporters see this clarity as necessary to prevent miscalculations in Beijing and deter attacks, but critics argue it may encourage provocations from Taiwan and weaken its own defense efforts. The U.S. intends to fulfill defense responsibilities under the TRA \"to the extent necessary\" and opposes actions unilaterally altering Taiwan's status. President Bush's support for Taiwan is clarified, decisions of war and peace are made by the president with consultation with Congress. Rising concern about Sino-Japanese tensions is noted, with China increasingly skeptical of the U.S.-Japan alliance's benefits to its interests. Sino-Japanese tensions are fueled by historic hostility, rising military capabilities, territorial disputes, and emotional nationalism. Sino-Japanese tensions have dangerous potential for conflict involving U.S. armed forces. Japan and the U.S. are military allies under a security treaty granting the U.S. military base rights in Japan. Japan's constitution, particularly Article 9, hinders closer U.S.-Japan defense cooperation by forbidding \"collective defense\" and outlawing war as a sovereign right. The Japan-U.S. security treaty limits Japan's military involvement to logistical support for counterterrorism and humanitarian efforts, with a focus on peaceful resolutions for issues like the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan Strait. The Japanese military is not engaged in combat missions, aligning with their constitution's Article 9 which prohibits war as a sovereign right. Military capabilities are structured to address specific conflicts, such as the need to handle two major regional conflicts simultaneously. In the 2005 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America, the Department of Defense (DOD) has adopted a \"new approach for planning to implement our strategy\" with \"capabilities-based\" planning focusing on potential challenges from adversaries rather than specific adversaries. Debate continues over military force size and allocation, with different formulas proposed for U.S. forces to handle multiple regional conflicts simultaneously. Some argue that analyzing feasible contingencies is crucial for determining the size and characteristics of the military. This includes considering the emphasis on air, naval, or ground forces, as well as the relevance of nuclear weapons in different scenarios and their impact on conflicts. The availability of nuclear weapons can either de-escalate a conflict by highlighting the risks of escalation or be used for striking capabilities. The DOD's 2006 Report to Congress on China's military capabilities outlines possible courses of action the PLA could take to prevent Taiwan from claiming formal independence, including missile strikes, air and missile campaigns, naval blockade, and amphibious invasion. Additional sources of conflict between the United States and China could also emerge, such as Taiwan taking initial military action in expectation of a Chinese attack. China could potentially insert military special operations forces (SOF) into Taiwan using small boats, submarines, and helicopters. The total number of troops involved could range from 100 to 1,000, cooperating with covert PRC intelligence operatives already in Taiwan to conduct disruptive attacks on various sectors. China may insert military special operations forces into Taiwan to conduct disruptive attacks on political, economic, communications, and military centers. Potential targets include political and military leaders, infrastructure, radars, and command facilities. The purpose could be to instill fear and unrest in the Taiwanese population or facilitate a combined arms attack by the PLA. Additionally, China's People's Liberation Army Navy deploys ships to support oil-drilling operations near disputed islands in the East China Sea. Japan and China are involved in a military conflict over disputed islands in the East China Sea. A collision between a Chinese submarine and a Japanese destroyer leads to a tense situation, with both countries preparing to dispatch additional forces. The incident prompts Japan's Ambassador to the United States to request a meeting with the President to discuss the U.S.-Japanese Mutual Security Treaty. This scenario is a major topic of discussion in defense circles and has implications for Taiwan. In a scenario where China attempts to invade Taiwan, Taiwan launches attacks on Chinese forces and infrastructure across the Taiwan Strait, including air and missile strikes on ports, airfields, and ground forces in southern China. Taiwan's Navy also targets Chinese ships in territorial waters. The analysis focuses on the role of U.S. nuclear and conventional forces in potential conflicts involving Taiwan and China. Deterrence is crucial in all stages of the conflict, with credibility of threats being key. Military capabilities and intentions play a significant role in deterrence. The analysis emphasizes the importance of deterrence in potential conflicts between Taiwan and China, highlighting the role of U.S. nuclear and conventional forces. Military capabilities and intentions are crucial in deterring aggression, with the need for credible threats. Cultural, societal, and historical differences also impact conflict deterrence strategies. The U.S. deterrence objectives involve fielding superior forces compared to China, maintaining credible postures, and casting doubt on China's ability to achieve its objectives at an acceptable cost. The mere existence of military capabilities can sometimes be enough to deter aggression, with nuclear weapons overshadowing interactions between the U.S. and China. The analysis highlights the importance of deterrence in potential conflicts between Taiwan and China, focusing on the role of U.S. nuclear and conventional forces. While U.S. nuclear forces could severely punish China for attacking Taiwan, China's ability to respond with a limited nuclear attack may deter the U.S. from threatening a nuclear response. The credibility of U.S. extended deterrence to Taiwan is also questioned. In scenarios where nuclear threats may not be credible, such as SOF infiltration and Maritime Conflict, nuclear capabilities may not play a significant role. In potential conflicts between Taiwan and China, U.S. nuclear and conventional forces may not have a significant deterrent value in scenarios where nuclear threats are not credible. The escalation of a crisis can be rapid and unpredictable, with limited warning and effectiveness of conventional forces. In the event of an accidental conflict like Scenario B, deterrence is not possible. In potential conflicts, U.S. crisis stability objectives include fielding forces that are not vulnerable to early attack, do not create \"use it or lose it\" pressures, and do not add to instability. Chinese long-range nuclear forces are not vulnerable to a first strike and are deployed in ways that do not create \"use it or lose it\" pressures. Their lack of accuracy to attack U.S. land-based forces and inability to effectively track and engage U.S. submarines make them unlikely to undermine stability in a crisis. Both the United States and China have deployed their long-range missiles in protected locations, reducing the pressure to use them before losing them. However, early warning and command and control systems on both sides could still be vulnerable to disruption. Currently, conventional forces do not seem to impact crisis stability due to the distance they must travel to address scenarios. In Scenario A, surveillance, intelligence, and information operations resources could contribute to Taiwan's defense without exacerbating a crisis. Scenario B represents an unstable crisis escalating quickly as each side defends its interests. The crisis may not be affected by U.S. forces initially, as both nations focus on each other's actions. U.S. decision makers may not feel pressured to intervene quickly. If the U.S. can disrupt China's critical targets with conventional forces, China may act swiftly to achieve its goals. This issue may be more relevant in the \"warfighting\" phase of the conflict. In the \"warfighting\" phase of a conflict with China, the United States would aim to limit collateral damage, minimize casualties, focus on aviation and naval engagements, and avoid urban warfare. The effectiveness of current U.S. military forces and doctrine in achieving these objectives is questioned. In recent conflicts in Somalia or Iraq, urban warfare amidst civilian populations poses challenges. Uncertainty about Chinese SOF forces, difficulty in distinguishing friend from foe, and the need to limit civilian casualties could hinder achieving objectives. Scenario B presents fewer challenges for conventional military forces, with a focus on crisis stability. Discussions on nuclear weapons often revolve around deterrence and achieving warfighting objectives not possible with conventional weapons. The United States could potentially use nuclear weapons in Scenario C, a combined arms attack, if it deems the conflict between China and Taiwan as a threat to vital U.S. interests. This could involve targeting critical Chinese assets that can only be effectively destroyed by nuclear weapons, such as hardened bunkers or command facilities. While conventional options would be explored first, the use of nuclear weapons would not be ruled out. Casualties are likely in such a scenario. The United States may consider using nuclear weapons in a conflict with China over Taiwan to target critical assets, despite potential high casualties. The use of nuclear weapons could quickly end the conflict but may have unpredictable long-term consequences, impacting regional stability and international support. Airpower would likely be used to defeat China's air force, disrupt the invasion force, and target PLA's command and control. The United States would utilize naval forces to destroy or degrade the invasion force, including carrier battle groups and Marine Corps Amphibious Ready Groups. The air wings on these aircraft consist of tactical combat aircraft and helicopters, with potential use of long-range maritime patrol aircraft and mine countermeasures ships. China's anti-access weapon systems are a primary concern in Scenario C. The United States would seek to disable, defeat, or destroy China's anti-ship cruise missiles and theater ballistic missiles early in a conflict. While U.S. conventional forces are superior to China's, operational challenges and potential high casualties may hinder large scale conventional warfare. In a conflict with China, the U.S. would benefit from nuclear and conventional forces for favorable war termination objectives. In a conflict with China, the United States aims to achieve war termination objectives such as decisive victory, improved regional relationships, and no long-term need for increased U.S. presence. Scenario A presents challenges in achieving these objectives, with the threat of escalation to nuclear weapons potentially ending the conflict. However, using nuclear threats may not improve regional relationships. Scenario B offers more promise in achieving war termination objectives by utilizing conventional and nuclear forces effectively. In Scenario B, the United States could play a significant role in ending the crisis with China by brandishing its conventional and nuclear capabilities and reminding China of its commitment to Japan. The threat of nuclear attack may seem extreme, but deploying conventional forces could demonstrate U.S. commitment to Japan with greater credibility. No increased presence or commitment by U.S. forces is likely required, and the threat of escalation to nuclear weapons could help achieve decisive victory without long-term increased U.S. presence in the region. Scenario D presents significant challenges in achieving war termination objectives as it would be difficult to end the conflict without allowing either Taiwan or China to emerge as the victor. The high stakes involved for both parties make it hard to return to the status quo ante once the conflict has started. Rapid deployment of a large U.S. or coalition force may be necessary. The conflict between Taiwan and China presents challenges in achieving war termination objectives, as it is hard to return to the status quo ante once the conflict has started. Rapid deployment of a large U.S. or coalition force may be necessary, but the long-term costs and instability of such actions are concerning. The potential conflict with China is a focus for defense planners due to the regional competition and the possibility of escalation to nuclear use. The United States has a longstanding nuclear deterrent relationship with China. The United States has a nuclear deterrent relationship with China, which has become more significant since the end of the Cold War. Questions arise about the adequacy of U.S. capabilities to deter or defeat China and other potential challengers. Decisions on nuclear and conventional capabilities in the military force structure are influenced by these questions, especially in a time of budget scrutiny. Investment in conventional weapon systems like ballistic missile defense, F-22A Raptor, and Airborne Laser is justified for potential conflicts with near-peer competitors like China. U.S. Navy's desired number of aircraft carriers, attack submarines, and anti-submarine warfare assets are also linked to countering Chinese military actions. Other weapon systems programs are geared towards large-scale conventional war amid increasing threats from non-state actors. The Navy is converting Trident nuclear missile submarines into conventional guided-missile delivery systems (SSGN). Questions arise about the potential enhancements these weapons offer for deterrence, crisis stability, warfighting, and conflict termination, and whether the costs are justified. The balance between nuclear and conventional forces in the U.S. military force structure is also considered. The U.S. military force structure is being analyzed, with a focus on the balance between nuclear and conventional forces. The possibility of conflict between the United States and China is discussed, with considerations of deterrence, economic repercussions, and domestic instability. Some believe that conflict could increase as China's interests expand, while others argue that conflict may not escalate due to various factors. The United States and China may find areas for cooperation rather than competition, potentially decreasing conflict. China's assessment of conflict costs depends on US intervention and nuclear escalation. The Bush Administration suggests altering nuclear force structure for national security, but credibility is questioned without dire threats. The credibility of a more prominent role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security policy is questioned when considering extended deterrence for Taiwan or Japan due to China's potential nuclear retaliation. However, the possibility of each side being deterred from escalating conflicts and the potential for far greater destruction if China were to use its nuclear forces after a limited U.S. nuclear attack have led to arguments for maintaining conventional conflict. Some argue that the current nuclear relationship between China and the United States is enough to deter conflict, as both countries possess nuclear weapons. There are concerns about China potentially using nuclear weapons for an EMP attack, but doubts exist due to the impact on China's own forces. The debate includes discussions on developing ballistic missile defense capabilities. Some argue that missile defenses, like the Airborne Laser, could enhance the deterrent value of U.S. nuclear weapons by undermining China's confidence in retaliating. Proponents believe that missile defenses could improve crisis stability and allow the U.S. to control conflicts on its own terms. Others fear that developing ballistic missile defenses could disrupt the current stable balance in the U.S.-China nuclear deterrence equation. The pursuit of ballistic missile defenses by the United States could upset the current stable balance in the U.S.-China nuclear deterrence equation. China may view U.S. missile defenses as shifting the military balance too much in favor of the U.S., potentially leading to earlier military actions against Taiwan to deter U.S. nuclear attacks. This could also prompt China to develop more capable missiles or countermeasures, making any warfighting advantages from missile defenses unlikely to be realized. The pursuit of missile defense systems by the United States may not achieve desired outcomes, especially if China can develop more ballistic missiles or countermeasures faster. The justification for new military capabilities often revolves around potential conflicts with China, leading to the exploration of prompt global strike options like conventionally armed ICBMs, SLBMs, and hypersonic air vehicles for rapid trans-continental targeting. These systems aim to target high-value assets that currently require nuclear weapons for assured destruction. Prompt global strike capabilities, using conventionally armed weapons, could enhance deterrence by targeting high-value assets that currently require nuclear weapons for destruction. This could make the US more credible in extending deterrence to allies, as China may not be able to respond with nuclear weapons due to its no-first use policy. In the event of a conflict, these conventional weapons could provide improved warfighting capabilities for the US. Weapons like China's ballistic missiles, air defenses, surveillance radar, and anti-ship cruise missiles pose challenges for the US Department of Defense. Advocates believe that advanced weapons like PGS and the F-22 Raptor could effectively counter these threats with less casualties. However, while these new weapons may enhance deterrence, they could also impact crisis stability in a conflict scenario. In Scenario C, neither U.S. nor Chinese nuclear forces are postured in a way that would worsen a crisis over Taiwan. However, China may perceive vulnerability of its conventional forces to an attack by Taiwan or the U.S., leading to a potential conflict initiation. The U.S. defending Taiwan by attacking China's \"centers of gravity\" could escalate the crisis and prompt China to expand its attack on Taiwan. Potent conventional forces that overpower China's defenses may also weaken deterrence. During the Cold War, weak U.S. conventional forces were seen as strong deterrence, relying on nuclear weapons if attacked. The current stable deterrent relationship between China and the U.S. is based on economic, political, and military factors. Despite this, military conflict could still occur due to various factors. U.S. nuclear and conventional capabilities contribute to military deterrence. Investments in military capabilities that positively contribute to all stages of conflict, including deterrence, crisis stability, warfighting, and war termination, should be preferred over those with mixed effects. Consideration of the interplay between nuclear and conventional capabilities is crucial in force structure and strategy decisions to avoid negative impacts on crisis stability or war termination objectives."
