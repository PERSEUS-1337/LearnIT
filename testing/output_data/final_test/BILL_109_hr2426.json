SEC. 30B. EDUCATIONAL IMPROVEMENT CONTRIBUTIONS CREDIT. This section adds a new credit for educational improvement contributions to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax code allows a credit for qualified contributions made to scholarship granting organizations. The credit is limited to $3,000 for individuals ($6,000 for joint returns) and a maximum of 5% of a corporation's regular tax liability or $20,000.

The credit allowable for a taxable year can be carried over to the succeeding year if it exceeds the limitation imposed. The credit cannot be carried forward beyond the third taxable year after it arose. The credit allowed for any taxable year shall not exceed the regular tax liability reduced by the sum of other credits allowed. The credit allowed for a taxable year can be carried over to the succeeding year if it exceeds the limitation imposed. No credit shall be allowed with respect to any contribution unless substantiated with a receipt. Rules similar to controlled groups apply, and no double benefit is allowed for any contribution. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for this section. Coordination with charitable deductions is amended. Clerical amendment to the table of sections. Effective Date: The amendments made by this section apply to contributions made during taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
