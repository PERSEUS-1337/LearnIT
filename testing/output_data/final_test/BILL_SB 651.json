    "title": "SB 651",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Amendment to Section 730.6 of the Welfare and Institutions Code requires minors found guilty under Section 602 to pay restitution directly to victims for economic losses incurred. The court must also consider imposing fines and ordering restitution to victims in addition to any other penalties. The court must impose a separate restitution fine on minors found guilty under Section 602, based on the seriousness of the offense. For felony offenses, the fine ranges from $100 to $1,000, while for misdemeanor offenses, it does not exceed $100. A separate hearing for the fine is not required. The court imposes a separate restitution fine on minors found guilty, regardless of their ability to pay. The fine is based on factors like the seriousness of the offense, economic gain, and losses suffered by others. Minors must demonstrate their inability to pay, including future earning capacity. The court may waive the restitution fine for minors who committed a felony offense if compelling reasons are found. The court must state the reasons for the waiver on record. If a minor falls under a specific category, the court will waive the restitution fine for felony offenses. Restitution ordered for losses must be imposed in the determined amount. If loss amount is unknown at sentencing, court can determine it later. Full restitution is typically ordered unless compelling reasons are provided. A minor's inability to pay is not a valid reason to avoid restitution. Restitution order should identify victims if possible, unless there is good cause not to do so. The court must order restitution in a sufficient dollar amount to fully reimburse victims for economic losses incurred due to the minor's conduct. Restitution may include payment for stolen or damaged property, medical expenses, and lost wages/profits due to injury, including commission income. Lost wages or profits, including commission income, can be included in restitution for victims who have spent time as a witness or assisting the police or prosecution. Commission income should be based on evidence from the 12-month period prior to the crime, unless a shorter time period is justified. A minor has the right to dispute the amount of restitution in a hearing before a judge. The court can modify the amount on its own motion or upon request from the district attorney, victims, or the minor. If the victim restitution amount is unknown, the court order must identify the victim(s) and state that the amount will be determined later. Co-offenders who are jointly liable for restitution should also be identified if possible. A restitution order imposed on a minor shall identify the losses, be enforceable as a civil judgment, and not affect the victim's right to recovery from the Restitution Fund. Restitution collected will be credited to any other judgments for the same losses, and may be ordered to be made to the Restitution Fund if the victim received assistance from the Victims of Crime Program. The curr_chunk states that funds can be received from the Victims of Crime Program as per the Government Code. The Victims of Crime Program under the Government Code defines \"victim\" to include immediate family members, governmental entities responsible for property damage, legal entities directly affected by a crime, and individuals who suffer economic loss due to a crime. The Victims of Crime Program defines a \"victim\" to include immediate family members, governmental entities, legal entities, and individuals who suffer economic loss due to a crime. Restitution for crimes committed against a victim can be limited to out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance, paid by the facility or employee, if the victim is a minor placed in a group home or facility. Upon a minor being found to be a person described in Section 602, the court shall require payment of restitution fines and orders as a condition of probation. Restitution orders unsatisfied after probation can be enforced by the victim. Probation cannot be revoked for failure to pay restitution unless willful non-payment is proven. In exceptional cases, the court may order community service instead of restitution. The court may avoid ordering community service as a condition of probation only if compelling and extraordinary reasons are found. Restitution to be paid to the victim takes priority over any other restitution fine imposed. The board of supervisors of any county may impose a fee up to 10% of the restitution fine to cover administrative costs. The judgment for a restitution fine can be enforced as per Penal Code Section 1214."
