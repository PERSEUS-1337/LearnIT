    "content": "AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDS FOR CONSERVATION OF MIGRATORY WATERFOWL AND HABITAT. The Wetlands Loan Act (Public Law 87-383) is amended to allocate $400,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 through 2016. Funds from this Act will be considered an advance to the migratory bird conservation fund and must be repaid without interest starting from July 1, 2007. Repayment will be made annually from the revenue generated by migratory bird hunting stamps sold above $15 per stamp. The Duck Stamp Act is amended to allow stamps to be sold by the Postal Service, the Secretary of the Interior, or any other authorized person. The amendment also expands the locations where stamps can be sold beyond first- and second-class post offices. The Duck Stamp Act is amended to allow stamps to be sold by the Postal Service, the Secretary of the Interior, or any other authorized person. Amendments include changes in pricing and sales locations. The Duck Stamp Act is amended to prohibit the Postal Service from selling stamps on consignment and to specify prices for stamps sold for hunting years. In 2007, the Duck Stamp Act was amended to include conservation in the disposition of unsold stamps. The amendment also allowed the Secretary of the Interior to be involved in the sale of stamps, in addition to the Postal Service. The Duck Stamp Act was amended to clarify that a stamp sold under the Act is not required to be affixed to any other license for hunting. Additionally, a technical correction was made to change \"personal\" to \"personnel\" in the Act. Congress believes that funds from this Act should be used to preserve and increase waterfowl populations, supplementing existing conservation funding without replacing it. The Act should also help private landowners achieve their land use goals while enhancing wetlands and wildlife habitat conservation."
