    "content": "Trips by the President, Vice President, and First Lady are classified as official or political travel. Official travel involves carrying out presidential duties, while political travel involves party-related activities. The White House determines the purpose of each trip. The Reagan Administration established guidelines in 1982 for reimbursing expenses for unofficial travel by the President, Vice President, and their companions on military aircraft. These guidelines were based on legal principles, opinions from the Department of Justice, FEC rules, and GAO audits. They apply to trips within the United States. The Reagan Administration established guidelines in 1982 for reimbursing expenses for unofficial travel by the President, Vice President, and their companions on military aircraft within the United States and its territories. Personal expenses for official travel are covered by the government, with the White House covering expenses for domestic travel and the State Department for foreign travel. The President's and Vice President's staff and immediate family are considered on official travel when assisting in their duties. The Vice President's wife uses a military aircraft for travel. The Vice President's wife uses a military aircraft only when accompanying him or representing him at special functions. Reimbursement is required for political travel by the President, Vice President, and First Lady, covering airfare, food, lodging, and incidental expenses. Certain staff like Secret Service agents have their travel costs paid by the government. The White House uses a formula for determining expenses on trips involving both official and political functions. The government covers diem and travel costs for official trips. Reimbursement is required for mixed official/political trips based on prorated time spent on activities. Time for travel, study, or recreation is not included in the calculation. The formula for calculating reimbursement for mixed official/political trips involves determining the percentage of time spent on each type of activity. The political portion of the trip is multiplied by the amount that would be reimbursed if all travel was political. Adjustments may be made for factors like delayed return due to political activities. The White House determines the nature of travel on a case-by-case basis, considering the event and individual's role to distinguish between official and unofficial trips. The White House designates travel based on the event and individual's role, treating most trips as official. Security concerns drive the President, Vice President, and First Lady to use military aircraft for travel. The President, Vice President, and First Lady's travel expenses are a fraction of the total cost of their trips, with operational costs of military aircraft being the main expense. The 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base operates specially configured Boeing 747s for the President's use, equipped with electronic and communications equipment for constant contact with officials. \"Air Force One\" is used for most trips, with smaller planes used when necessary. The President's designated plane is a 747, known as \"Air Force One,\" with operational costs of $179,750 per hour. The Vice President and First Lady use different aircraft, such as the C-32 and C-40. Trips abroad involve multiple aircraft accompanying Air Force One, while domestic trips have a cargo aircraft and backup plane accompanying. During presidential trips, additional aircraft may accompany Air Force One to accommodate assistants and subordinates. An advance party may also make trips to ensure everything goes as planned. Costs include maintenance, per diem, and expenses for official travelers like Secret Service agents and communication personnel. The overall cost associated with travel by the President, Vice President, and First Lady includes operational costs and per diem expenses. In 1998, GAO estimated that presidential trips to Africa, Chile, and China cost at least $42.8 million, $10.5 million, and $18.8 million respectively. In 2000, the Department of Defense spent at least $292 million on fixed-wing airlift and air refueling for these trips. The Department of Defense spent $292 million on fixed-wing airlift and air refueling for 159 White House foreign trips from January 1, 1997, through March 31, 2000. This cost did not include per diem and other travel-related expenses. Comparable information for earlier or subsequent Administrations is not available."
