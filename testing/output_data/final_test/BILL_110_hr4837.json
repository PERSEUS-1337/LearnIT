    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Spacefaring Priorities for America's Continued Exploration Act\" or the \"SPACE Act\". Congress acknowledges that Russia is not a reliable partner for space operations, as the United States will heavily depend on Russia for crew and cargo transport services to the International Space Station from 2010 to 2015. The U.S. should not increase its reliance on Russia due to differing views and actions, such as Russia's opposition to U.S. plans for missile defense systems in Europe. Russia suspended its participation in the CFE treaty, arms hostile adversaries like Iran and Venezuela, and has a history of weapons trading with Iran, including advanced technology. Russia also abused past NASA cooperation agreements. In the late 1990s, Russia failed to fulfill its commitment to the International Space Station, causing NASA to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to complete the critical Zvezda service module. This delay reflected serious Russian mismanagement in the field of space. In 2000, Russia diverted resources from the International Space Station to maintain the Mir Space Station. The US should not rely on Russian space services due to past failures. American space science should not depend on Russian support, as the US has invested billions in the ISS program. Research conducted on the International Space Station may lead to significant advancements in medicine and climate understanding. The microgravity environment in space could facilitate the development of new drugs and therapies. It is crucial for the United States to maintain assured access to space to benefit from the investments made in the ISS program. NASA's plan for crew transport to the International Space Station lacks necessary redundancies, relying heavily on Russian Soyuz spacecraft post-2010. Without the Space Shuttle, NASA faces challenges in transporting equipment like the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the ISS. The AMS development cost over $1.5 billion, and NASA needs to extend Space Shuttle operations to transport it to the International Space Station. The Japanese Centrifuge Accommodation Module is also crucial for ISS missions. The Space Shuttle is essential for transporting modules like the AMS and the Japanese Centrifuge Accommodation Module to the International Space Station. NASA needs a better approach than relying on the Russians for crew rotation, and the Space Shuttle can fill this gap during the flight program between Shuttle and Orion missions. The Space Shuttle is crucial for ISS transport. Replacing Russian services with Shuttle could save costs. Extending Shuttle operations may save on retention bonuses for skilled workers. Keeping skilled workers employed until Orion is operational is vital. The success of the Constellation program relies on retaining skilled workers. NASA faces a workforce gap as workers transition from the Space Shuttle to Constellation. To mitigate this, NASA could continue Shuttle operations at a reduced rate and integrate workers into the Orion program. The Government Accountability Office highlighted NASA's challenges in recruiting and retaining senior-level engineers for the next generation of human space flight systems. The Act authorizes additional funding to address appropriation shortfalls in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. NASA is authorized an extra $1,000,000,000 to cover costs incurred. NASA is authorized an extra $1,000,000,000 in section 4(b) to reimburse NASA for costs incurred from the Space Shuttle return-to-flight efforts after the Columbia disaster. NASA is prohibited from relying solely on Russian space services for astronaut transport or cargo resupply, except for Soyuz emergency escape services on the International Space Station. Additional funding of $1 billion is authorized for NASA to cover costs from the Space Shuttle return-to-flight efforts after the Columbia disaster. NASA is authorized additional funding for fiscal year 2007 and 2008 shortfalls, with a portion allocated for Exploration Systems and Space Operations. Emergency funding of $1 billion is designated for Columbia return-to-flight costs, with proportional distribution to Exploration Systems and Space Operations Accounts. Funding preservation is mandated for NASA's Exploration Systems account and the Constellation program. NASA is authorized additional funding for fiscal year 2007 and 2008 shortfalls, with a portion allocated for Exploration Systems and Space Operations. Emergency funding of $1 billion is designated for Columbia return-to-flight costs, with proportional distribution to Exploration Systems and Space Operations Accounts. Funding preservation is mandated for NASA's Exploration Systems account and the Constellation program to support the continued operation of the Space Shuttle program as required by the Act. NASA is authorized additional funding for fiscal year 2007 and 2008 shortfalls, with a portion allocated for Exploration Systems and Space Operations. Emergency funding of $1 billion is designated for Columbia return-to-flight costs, with proportional distribution to Exploration Systems and Space Operations Accounts. Funding preservation is mandated for NASA's Exploration Systems account and the Constellation program to support the continued operation of the Space Shuttle program as required by the Act. NASA is required to conduct at least 2 Space Shuttle missions annually for crew transport from 2010 to 2015 or until Orion is operational. Additional funding may be appropriated for this purpose, including production of external tanks. The Act's requirements are contingent on sufficient funding, defined as necessary to comply fully or partially. NASA must report to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment. NASA must investigate operational efficiencies to extend the Space Shuttle program, including possibly retiring one orbiter and reducing design changes to ensure safe operation. NASA aims to significantly reduce Space Shuttle orbiter operations and payload configurations while ensuring program safety. They also plan to maximize shared personnel between the Space Shuttle and other NASA programs. If conflicts arise in resource allocation between the Space Shuttle and Constellation programs, NASA will report them to Congress with mitigation recommendations. NASA will define requirements for Space Shuttle program operation beyond 2010, as recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. These requirements will be transmitted to Congress in a report within 6 months of the enactment of this Act. NASA must begin satisfying these requirements immediately and complete them by March 31, 2010."
