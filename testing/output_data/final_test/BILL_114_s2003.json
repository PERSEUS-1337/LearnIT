    "content": "The \"Free Market Energy Act\" defines a distributed energy resource as a technology connected to the electricity distribution system that generates, manages, or reduces energy use. It also establishes a general right to neutrality of interconnection in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The \"Free Market Energy Act\" grants distributed energy resources the right of interconnection, with states ensuring fair rates and fees that benefit both the resource and the grid. Timeframes for interconnection must be clear, prompt, and not unnecessarily delayed or denied. The \"Free Market Energy Act\" grants distributed energy resources the right of interconnection, with states ensuring fair rates and fees that benefit both the resource and the grid. Interconnection of energy resources shall not be delayed or denied unless deemed unsafe or impracticable by the electric utility. The \"Free Market Energy Act\" grants distributed energy resources the right of interconnection, with states ensuring fair rates and fees that benefit both the resource and the grid. Interconnection of energy resources shall not be delayed or denied unless deemed unsafe or impracticable by the electric utility. SEC. 4. ENERGY AND RATE TREATMENTS FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. Section 111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to require that distributed energy resources be eligible for fair energy and rate treatment using dynamic pricing, considering locational benefits, on an unbundled basis. Distributed energy resources must be eligible for fair energy and rate treatment through dynamic pricing, considering locational benefits, on an unbundled basis. This includes pricing for energy sold to or purchased from an electric utility, capacity, ancillary services, and the societal value of distributed energy resources. The State regulatory authority should consider various factors when determining fair treatment for distributed energy resources, including energy resources, transmission and distribution losses, and other relevant benefits. SEC. 5. CONSIDERATION OF NONTRANSMISSION ALTERNATIVES. Section 111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to require State regulatory authorities and Regional Transmission Organizations to consider nontransmission alternatives for proposed transmission projects seeking cost recovery. The cost of these alternatives can be recovered from the ratebase or regional recovery mechanism to reduce costs for ratepayers. State regulatory authorities and Regional Transmission Organizations must consider nontransmission alternatives for proposed projects to reduce costs for ratepayers by recovering the cost from the ratebase or regional recovery mechanism. SEC. 6. PRIOR STATE ACTIONS. Section 112 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to exempt certain electric utilities in a State from specific standards if the State has already implemented comparable standards or taken steps to consider them before the enactment of this subsection. Section 112 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to exempt certain electric utilities in a State from specific standards if the State has already implemented comparable standards. Additionally, Section 124 is amended to adjust references for standards established under section 111(d). Effect: This Act does not apply to distributed energy resource contracts already in effect at the time of enactment."
