    "content": "Several interest groups have suggested that Congress require agencies to reexamine existing regulations to determine if they are still necessary or can be made less burdensome. One proposed model for regulatory \"lookbacks\" is to expand the requirement in Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, which mandates federal agencies to review rules with significant economic impact on small entities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 mandates agencies to review existing rules within 10 years of enactment and new rules within 10 years of publication. Agencies must provide an annual notice of rules designated for review. This advance notice requirement allows for public input into rule reviews, but it is unclear if agencies consistently implement it. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to conduct Section 610 reviews, but agencies are carrying out relatively few reviews due to discretion and confusion about the requirements. This report examines the issues and implications for regulatory reforms. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 mandates agencies to assess the impact of rules on small entities, including estimating their number and compliance costs. Agencies have discretion to determine when to initiate these analytical requirements, and they are not required for final rules without a proposed rule. Small entities have the option of judicial review for agency compliance with the Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to assess the impact of rules on small entities. The Small Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy monitors agencies' implementation of the act. The Government Accountability Office has found a lack of clarity in the act, leading to variability in implementation among agencies. In a 2000 report on the implementation of the RFA at the EPA, GAO found that the agency had broad discretion in determining rule impacts on small businesses. EPA certified that 96% of proposed rules would not significantly impact small entities after the SBREFA of 1996. EPA's pesticides and solid waste offices stated that all 46 proposed rules during this period would not have a significant impact on small entities. In reports, GAO suggested clarifying the RFA's requirements and developing criteria for agencies to conduct RFA analyses. GAO highlighted the need to define \"significant economic impact\" and \"substantial number of small entities\" for rulemaking. Questions were raised about interpreting the RFA, such as considering cumulative impacts of similar rules and when a rule has a positive impact on small entities. GAO emphasized the importance of clarifying key terms in the RFA and SBREFA to ensure regulatory relief for small entities. Congress needs to address unanswered questions to align agency interpretations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that Congress review the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) to determine if changes are needed to better achieve its intended purposes. GAO also highlighted the impact of agency determinations on other statutory requirements, such as preparing compliance guides for small entities. The Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy emphasized the need for flexible definitions due to differences in agency operating environments. In August 2002, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13272 to promote compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). The order required agencies to consider the impacts of their draft rules on small entities and notify the Office of Advocacy of any rules with significant economic impact. However, it did not define what constitutes a \"significant\" impact or a \"substantial\" number of small entities. SBA's annual reports on RFA implementation have occasionally addressed these issues. SBA's annual reports on the implementation of the RFA have occasionally mentioned Section 610 of the statute. In 1992, SBA's Chief Counsel for Advocacy requested information from 83 executive departments and agencies on their implementation of Section 610. Of the 55 agencies that responded, 13 had published the required plan for the review of their rules. The remaining 42 agencies indicated they had not done so, citing lack of significant economic impact on small entities. SBA did not follow up with these agencies as they lacked authority to compel reviews. In 1998, the House Committee on Small Business held a hearing on Section 610 implementation, with witnesses indicating few reviews were conducted. The witnesses indicated that few Section 610 reviews had been done, with reasons for this lack of action varying. Some agencies had effectively exempted themselves from the RFA by defining rules as \"interpretative\" or by narrowly defining \"small business.\" Agencies are required to publish a regulatory flexibility agenda and a notice of rules to be reviewed within the next 12 months. Many agencies use the Unified Agenda to fulfill this requirement. The Unified Agenda is published twice a year in the Federal Register to report on regulatory activities under development across the federal government. It serves as a compendium of agency rulemaking actions for the next 12 months, indicating the extent of agencies' compliance with Section 610 of the RFA. GAO has found flaws in the implementation of Section 610 through its analysis of the Unified Agenda in the past. Few agencies had entries in the Unified Agenda for Section 610 reviews in November 1996 and October 1997. The agencies' entries often did not meet the requirements of Subsection 610(c). In April 1999, GAO found that even agencies issuing rules with significant economic impact on small entities were not conducting Section 610 reviews. Only eight out of 61 federal departments and agencies in the November 1998 Unified Agenda indicated they were reviewing rules under Section 610, with most reviewing only one or two rules each. Several agencies had no Section 610 review entries despite multiple editions of the Agenda mentioning regulatory activities. In 20 successive editions of the Agenda, agencies indicated that many regulatory actions would have a significant economic impact on small entities, suggesting a need for Section 610 reviews. However, a 1999 GAO report found no definitive database existed to determine which rules should be reviewed under Section 610, leading to differences in opinion among federal agencies on the act's requirements. Subsection 610(c) mandates agencies to publish notices in the Federal Register for rules with a significant economic impact on small entities. Some agencies interpret the statute's use of the present tense \"have\" to mean they must review rules that have a significant economic impact on small entities at the time of the review, rather than relying on previous determinations. This requires agencies to reexamine all rules within 10 years of issuance to determine their current economic effect on small entities. The Department of Health and Human Services believed they met public notice requirements by listing rules in the Unified Agenda with significant impact on small entities. Other agencies, like the Small Business Administration, claimed they had reviewed all rules in the mid-1990s and had no rules over 10 years old. However, GAO found that SBA's reviews did not meet the RFA requirements. Regulatory agencies raised issues on the interpretation of the RFA's Section 610 \"lookback\" at a meeting in February 2000. Some agencies raised issues with the interpretation of the RFA's Section 610 \"lookback\" requirement, affecting its implementation. They set a high threshold for what constituted a significant economic impact on small entities, resulting in few rules subject to reexamination. Some agencies believed their rules only implemented underlying statutes with significant impact on small entities, not their regulations. Similarly, some agencies noted that actions of states and other parties implementing federal rules could have a significant impact on small entities. The implementation of Section 610 of the RFA raised concerns among agencies regarding the definition of a \"rule\" and the interpretation of the \"lookback\" requirement. Some agencies questioned whether making changes to rules every 10 years would reset the review period. By 2004, the GAO had not assessed the implementation of Section 610 in the past five years, leaving uncertainty about agencies' compliance with the rule. In 2004, CRS examined agencies' implementation of Section 610, finding over 4,000 entries in Unified Agendas from 60+ regulatory agencies. About 400 entries could impact small entities, with FCC, SEC, SBA, DOC, HHS, USDA, DOT, and DOL having the most entries. In 2004, CRS found that the eight departments and agencies including FCC, SEC, SBA, DOC, HHS, USDA, DOT, and DOL accounted for about 90% of regulatory actions expected to trigger the RFA. However, the Unified Agenda in June and December 2004 contained only a few notices of upcoming Section 610 reviews, indicating a discrepancy in the agencies' plans to issue rules affecting small entities. The Unified Agenda in 2004 showed that agencies like FCC, SEC, SBA, DOC, HHS, USDA, DOT, and DOL accounted for most regulatory actions affecting small entities. However, there were few Section 610 reviews planned, indicating a lack of thorough review under the RFA. The Unified Agenda in 2004 highlighted regulatory actions impacting small entities by agencies like FCC, SEC, SBA, DOC, HHS, USDA, DOT, and DOL. However, there was a lack of thorough review under the RFA, with less than 10% of rules impacting small entities being reviewed. GAO's report in July 2007 revealed that selected agencies completed over 1,300 reviews of existing regulations from 2001 to 2006, with varying impetus and purposes for the reviews. The purpose of regulatory reviews varied among agencies, with mandatory requirements sometimes driving the process. Agencies conducted reviews to assess regulation effectiveness, reduce burdens, and validate benefit/cost estimates. Processes and standards for reviews differed across agencies, with more public involvement in discretionary reviews. Standards for conducting mandatory reviews were more common than for discretionary reviews. The GAO recommended that agencies improve the effectiveness and transparency of retrospective regulatory reviews by incorporating various elements into their policies and procedures. Lessons from the failure of Section 610 of the RFA to prompt agencies to review the impact of their rules on small entities offer valuable insights for advocates of broader regulatory review requirements. Regulatory review legislation should clearly outline which rules need to be reviewed and how the reviews should be conducted, instead of giving agencies broad discretion in deciding which rules to review. Giving agencies discretion to decide which rules meet certain criteria for review may lead to few rules being subject to reexamination under Section 610. This could be addressed by outlining specific rules that need to be reviewed in any new statutory \"lookback\" requirement. One way to address the problem of agency discretion in reviewing rules could be to require agencies to review all final rules considered \"significant\" by both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the agencies under Executive Order 12866. This could make a comprehensive review requirement more manageable. One approach to address agency discretion in reviewing rules is to require agencies to review all final rules deemed \"significant\" by both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the agencies under Executive Order 12866. This could streamline the comprehensive review process. Additionally, suggestions from the public could be solicited for rules that require review, as mandated by the \"Regulatory Right to Know Act.\" OMB is asking the public to nominate rules for review to increase net benefits. Initially, they asked for suggestions to rescind or change rules, receiving 71 suggestions. The request was broadened to include revisions that would increase net benefits, resulting in 316 suggestions. OMB continues to seek public input on rules in need of review. Congress should be clear on expectations for these reviews, especially regarding what constitutes a \"rule.\" Congress faces the challenge of clearly indicating what should be considered a \"rule\" for review, including whether associated burdens should be considered part of the rule and if revisions would restart review requirements. Agencies may be required to post upcoming and completed reviews for public involvement and tracking. This would ensure transparency on which rules need review, have been reviewed, and still require review. Congress could consider adding an enforcement mechanism to any lookback requirement, such as withholding agency appropriations or implementing judicial review provisions. Regular scrutiny by Congress, OMB, or another entity could also increase the requirement's visibility. Without enforcement, agencies are unlikely to conduct additional reviews. H.R. 4458, the \"Small Business Regulatory Improvement Act,\" was introduced on December 12, 2007. H.R. 4458, the \"Small Business Regulatory Improvement Act,\" introduced by Brad Ellsworth and nine cosponsors, aims to amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) with changes supported by the SBA Office of Advocacy and small business representatives. The bill includes defining \"economic impact\" to encompass direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect effects of a rule on small entities. No action has been scheduled by the House Committee on the Judiciary, and no similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate. H.R. 4458, the \"Small Business Regulatory Improvement Act,\" proposes changes to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), including new analytical and reporting requirements. The bill would require a more detailed statement for regulatory flexibility analysis and establish new requirements for the periodic review of rules with significant economic impact on small entities. The bill proposes a plan for the review of existing rules within 10 years and new rules within 10 years of publication. Agencies must publish a list of rules to be reviewed, request public comments, and submit annual reports to Congress. H.R. 4458 proposes agencies to review all rules for economic impact on small entities annually and provide detailed explanations for their determinations to Congress and OIRA Administrator. This change may lead to more Section 610 reviews, requiring additional time and effort. The legislation proposes agencies to review all rules for economic impact on small entities annually, leading to more Section 610 reviews. However, there is uncertainty on what constitutes a \"rule\" and what defines a \"significant\" economic impact on small entities."
