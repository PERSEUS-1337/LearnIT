    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commemoration of the Victory of Freedom in the Cold War Act\" and it commemorates the victory of freedom in the Cold War. Congress finds that the Cold War was a significant struggle for democracy and freedom, with the outcome impacting millions worldwide. Democratic countries, especially the United States, bore the burden and costs to protect these principles. The US Armed Forces and taxpayers played a crucial role, with many soldiers sacrificing their lives to preserve freedoms and liberties. The Berlin Wall symbolized totalitarianism during the Cold War, which ended with the fall of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991. A Cold War Medal was authorized to honor those who served in the armed forces during this period to protect freedoms and liberties. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall design a decoration called the 'Reagan-Truman Victory in the Cold War Medal' to recognize the contributions of those who served honorably in the armed forces during the Cold War, which lasted from September 2, 1945, to December 26, 1991. The Armed Forces can participate in a celebration of the 10th anniversary of the end of the Cold War in Washington, D.C. on December 26, 2001. Up to $15,000,000 from the Army's operation and maintenance funds can be used for this purpose. The Secretary of Defense can accept private sector contributions to reduce costs, with the amount of funds available being reduced by the amount of contributions accepted. The \"Commission on Victory in the Cold War\" is established with twelve members appointed by various officials. Its duty is to review the expenditure of funds by the Armed Forces before a celebration in Washington, D.C. commemorating the end of the Cold War. The Commission on Victory in the Cold War has the authority to oversee the expenditure of funds by the Armed Forces and design medals for individuals who contributed to the United States victory in the Cold War. The Commission is chaired by two individuals selected from appointed officials."
