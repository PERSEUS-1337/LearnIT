    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts Act of 2011\" establishes Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Small Business Start-Up Savings Account can be established by an individual or eligible small business through an agreement with the Secretary. It is a trust created for the beneficiary, with specific requirements for contributions and trustee qualifications. The trustee of the Small Business Start-Up Savings Account must be a bank or a person approved by the Secretary. Trust funds cannot be invested in life insurance contracts, individual account balances are nonforfeitable, and trust assets must not be commingled except in common trust or investment funds. Eligible small businesses are defined as those with a certain number of employees engaged in a trade or business. Employees employed by a person on business days during the taxable year must be 500 or fewer for deductions to apply to small business start-up savings accounts. Contributions for the year to all accounts maintained for a beneficiary are deductible up to $10,000 or $150,000, reduced by the aggregate amount. For taxable years, contributions to small business start-up savings accounts are deductible up to $10,000 or $150,000, reduced by previous contributions. The $10,000 amount is adjusted for inflation annually. The taxable year begins with adjustments for inflation annually. Rollovers from retirement plans are not allowed, and contributions to small business start-up savings accounts are treated as deductions for individuals and corporations. For chapter 1, deductions for small business start-up savings accounts are treated as specified in part VI of subchapter B of chapter 1. Qualified distributions are excluded from gross income, while other distributions are included. The term 'qualified distribution' from a small business start-up savings account refers to payments for business expenses and capital contributions to an eligible small business for the taxable year. The qualified distribution from a small business start-up savings account must be used for business purposes within 5 years of the first payment, and for the same eligible small business. After the account beneficiary's death, specific treatment applies. If the account beneficiary of a small business start-up savings account dies, the account will no longer be considered as such, and the fair market value of the assets in the account at the time of death will be included in the gross income of the person who acquires the beneficiary's interest. If a small business start-up savings account beneficiary dies, the fair market value of the assets in the account will be included in the gross income of the person who acquires the beneficiary's interest. Special rules apply, such as reducing inclusion for predeath expenses and allowing a deduction for estate taxes. If a taxpayer holding a small business start-up savings account ceases to be an eligible small business, the account will no longer be considered a small business start-up savings account. The balance of the account will be treated as paid out in a non-qualified distribution for that taxable year. Special rules apply in this situation. Special rules apply to deductions or credits for amounts described in subsection (e)(2)(A) to prevent double benefits. Qualified distributions reduce deductions and credits, as well as the adjusted basis of property placed in service for the taxable year. All persons treated as a single employer are subject to aggregation rules under this section. Persons treated as a single employer under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code shall be treated as one person. An excise tax on excess contributions and nonqualified distributions is added to the Code. Tax on excess contributions and nonqualified distributions to small business start-up savings accounts is imposed under sections 5000C and 5000D of the Internal Revenue Code. Tax on excess contributions to small business start-up savings accounts is 6 percent of the excess amount contributed, with a limitation not exceeding 6 percent of the account's value. Excess contributions are the amount contributed exceeding the allowable contribution limit. The tax on excess contributions to small business start-up savings accounts is calculated based on the excess amount contributed, limited to 6 percent of the account's value. This excess amount is determined by subtracting the allowable contribution limit from the total contributions made in a taxable year. The tax on nonqualified distributions from small business start-up savings accounts is 10 percent of the amount included in the taxpayer's gross income. There is an exception for payments made after the account beneficiary becomes disabled or dies. The tax on nonqualified distributions from small business start-up savings accounts is 10 percent of the amount included in the taxpayer's gross income. Prohibited transactions related to small business start-up savings accounts are outlined in section 4975 of the Code, with a special rule for ceasing to be a small business start-up savings account. The tax on nonqualified distributions from small business start-up savings accounts is 10 percent of the amount included in the taxpayer's gross income. Contributions to small business start-up savings accounts are deductible under section 7529(d)(1)(A) of the Code. Chapter 50 introduces Small Business Start-Up Savings Accounts under section 7529 of the tax code, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2010."
