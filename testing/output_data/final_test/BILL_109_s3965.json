    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Latina Health Access Act\". Congress finds that Latinas in the United States face significant health disparities, with a high number being uninsured and at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases. HIV infection rates, AIDS cases, and chlamydia rates are all significantly higher among Latinas compared to their white counterparts. Latinas in the United States face significant health disparities compared to white women. Latinas have higher rates of gonorrhea and cervical cancer, lower rates of breast cancer screening, and higher prevalence of diabetes compared to white women. Latinas aged 65 to 74 have a high prevalence of Type II diabetes, with heart disease being the leading cause of death among all women. Latinas face higher risks of heart disease due to obesity and diabetes, highlighting the importance of addressing preventable health concerns such as sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes, and cancer through improved health access. Title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act focuses on providing health access for uninsured and low-income individuals, specifically addressing preventable health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act aims to improve health access for uninsured and low-income individuals by providing grants to eligible entities like high-performing hospitals, community health centers, state or local governments, and private nonprofit entities. These grants support programs and activities that offer healthcare services to those in medically underserved areas. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary to receive a grant and are authorized to carry out specific activities with the funding. An eligible entity receiving a grant under Title XXIX of the Public Health Service Act must use the funds for programs providing access to a range of health care services in a culturally appropriate manner. This includes family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, as well as assistance for various health issues like asthma, cancer, HIV/AIDS, mental health, diabetes, and heart disease. $18,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2007 and beyond. \"SEC. 2902. FOCUS ON UNINSURED AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS.\" The Secretary shall prioritize health grants for entities representing medically underserved areas or populations with a large number of uninsured and low-income individuals. Additionally, grants will be awarded to research institutions to conduct research on the health status of populations lacking health data. Research institutions can apply for grants to conduct health research on populations with limited health data, such as the Latina population. $18,000,000 is authorized for this purpose annually. The Secretary will collaborate with healthcare professionals and community organizations to provide outreach and health services to uninsured and low-income individuals. A targeted health education program will focus on populations like Latinas through various informational forums and media campaigns. $18,000,000 is authorized annually for these efforts."
