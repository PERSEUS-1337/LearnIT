    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 by adding a section on energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act defines key terms and requires Federal agencies to develop an implementation strategy for energy-efficient information technologies in coordination with relevant authorities. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act mandates Federal agencies to consider various energy-efficient technologies in their implementation strategy, including advanced metering infrastructure, energy-efficient data center strategies, advanced power management tools, building information modeling, secure telework tools, and mechanisms for realizing energy cost savings. Performance goals for evaluating agency efforts must be established within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act requires Federal agencies to improve the use of energy-efficient IT, with the Chief Information Officers Council recommending best practices. Agencies must report their efforts and results, and OMB will assess government efficiency starting from October 1, 2016. Starting October 1, 2016, Federal agencies must report their efforts and results on energy-efficient IT in the Director's annual report and scorecard as required by the Energy Efficient Government Technology Act. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to involve stakeholders from the information technology industry and other key stakeholders in producing energy efficiency results. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Section 453, is amended to involve stakeholders from the information technology industry in promoting energy efficiency. This includes representatives from hardware manufacturers, data center operators, and facility managers, who must follow accepted procedures and standards development processes. Additionally, input from Department of Energy National Laboratories, colleges, universities, research institutions, and industry associations with relevant expertise should be considered. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Section 453, is amended to involve stakeholders from the information technology industry in promoting energy efficiency. This includes representatives from hardware manufacturers, data center operators, and facility managers. The Secretary and the Administrator will assess specifications for energy efficiency programs, including the Federal Energy Management Program and the Energy Star program. A study will be conducted to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency within one year of the Act's enactment. The Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency report, published in 2007, compares estimates from 2007 to 2014, analyzes the impact of information technologies, evaluates the influence of cloud platforms, mobile devices, social media, and big data on energy usage, and provides updated projections and recommendations until 2020. The Data Center Energy Practitioner Program is also discussed. The Secretary, in collaboration with stakeholders and the Office of Management and Budget, will implement a data center energy practitioner program for certifying individuals to assess energy usage in Federal data centers. Federal agencies are encouraged to have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified practitioners. Additionally, an open data initiative for Federal data centers will be carried out. The Secretary will implement an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage to encourage innovation and consolidation. Efforts will be made to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, including the development of an efficiency metric. Protection of proprietary information will also be ensured. The Secretary and the Administrator will not disclose proprietary information or trade secrets provided by individuals or companies for the programs and initiatives under this section."
