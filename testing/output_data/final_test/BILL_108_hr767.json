    "content": "The \"Homeland Investment Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. A toll tax is imposed on excess qualified foreign distribution amounts under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code. A tax of 5.25 percent is imposed on excess qualified foreign distribution amounts under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code. This tax applies to dividends received by the taxpayer from controlled foreign corporations in which the taxpayer is a United States shareholder. The tax of 5.25 percent is imposed on excess qualified foreign distribution amounts under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code for dividends received by the taxpayer from controlled foreign corporations. The base dividend amount is determined based on the average dividends received during the fixed base period from such corporations. The corporation received the highest dividends from controlled foreign corporations in one taxable year compared to the other 4 years. If the taxpayer has fewer than 5 taxable years before 2002, a shorter period will be used for calculating the fixed base period. In the case of acquisitions or dispositions of controlled foreign corporations after the fixed base period, section 41(f)(3) applies. Definitions for dividends, controlled foreign corporations, and United States shareholders are provided in this section. The text discusses the reduction of foreign tax credits by 85 percent for certain qualified foreign distribution amounts. It also mentions the disregarding of 85 percent of the excess qualified foreign distribution amount for foreign tax credit limitation purposes under section 904. Additionally, it addresses the treatment of consolidated groups in relation to filing a consolidated return. The taxpayer, as part of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return, is treated as a single entity. They must designate specific dividends received from controlled foreign corporations, which are excluded from the excess qualified foreign distribution amount. An election under this section must be made on the taxpayer's timely filed income tax return and can only be revoked with the Secretary's consent. The election under this section applies to all controlled foreign corporations of the taxpayer and must be made by the common parent of an affiliated group filing a consolidated return. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement this section, including addressing corporations during the fixed base period. The text chunk addresses corporations joining or leaving an affiliated group filing a consolidated return. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for the subpart. The text chunk introduces a toll tax on excess qualified foreign distribution amount. The amendments apply to the first taxable year ending 120 days after the enactment of the Act."
