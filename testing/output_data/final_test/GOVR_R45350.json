However, trust fund revenues stopped growing faster than spending in 2001, leading to Congress providing Treasury general fund transfers to keep the HTF solvent since 2008. Every year since 2008, there has been a gap between the dedicated tax revenues flowing into the HTF and the cost of the surface transportation spending Congress has authorized. Since 2008, Congress has authorized transfers from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to cover shortfalls in surface transportation spending. The FAST Act, signed in 2015, allocated $70 billion for federal transportation programs until 2020. Despite projections showing a continued imbalance between fuel tax receipts and HTF expenditures, funding surface transportation remains a pressing issue for Congress. The HTF consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has two separate accounts for highways and mass transit, primarily funded by federal fuel taxes. Since its creation in 1956, Congress has increased fuel taxes four times. Fuel taxes provide 85% to 90% of the amounts paid into the fund by highway users. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon of fuel taxes, with the remainder going to the highway account. Since its creation in 1956, the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has seen four fuel tax increases in 1959, 1982, 1990, and 1993. Changes to the taxation structure have boosted trust fund revenues, but since 2001, revenue has not met expectations. Legislation like the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act aimed to increase trust fund income and address tax fraud. These efforts, along with a $12.5 billion unexpended balance and higher fuel tax revenue, were expected to finance the surface transportation program. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has faced revenue shortfalls since 2001 despite efforts to boost income through legislation. In FY2009, trust fund revenue fell short of expectations, leading to Treasury general fund contributions to cover the gaps. Congress transferred $8 billion from the general fund in 2008 to support the HTF, with additional transfers following. The Federal Highway Administration projects a slower growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and motor fuel tax revenue in the next 20 years, while policy changes are weakening the link between driving activity and tax revenues. Under rules issued in 2012, new passenger cars and light trucks are expected to achieve higher fuel economy standards in the coming years. The Trump Administration announced plans to revise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for model years 2022-2025, which could impact the increase in average fuel economy. Increasing fuel tax rates could provide immediate relief to the Highway Trust Fund, with each penny increase generating billions of dollars annually. The growing fleets of hybrid and electric vehicles pose equity issues as they pay less or no fuel taxes. Motor fuel taxes provide the trust fund with $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion per year, but reduced fuel consumption raises doubts about long-term funding. The gap between transportation revenues and spending is projected to average $19 billion annually from FY2021 to FY2026. Congress may need to find new income sources or settle for a smaller transportation program. General fund transfers impact the imbalance between revenues and spending. The FAST Act is set to expire at the end of FY2020, leading to a projected gap in funding for surface transportation programs. A five-year reauthorization starting in FY2021 would face a $94 billion gap, while a six-year reauthorization would face a $117 billion gap. The balance in the Highway Trust Fund is expected to be $14 billion when the FAST Act expires, which, along with incoming revenue, should cover obligations to states. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is projected to have a balance close to zero by the end of FY2021, leading to potential delays in payments for completed work by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Without changes, the HTF balance is estimated to go from $14 billion at the start of FY2021 to a deficit of $85 billion by the end of FY2025, which current law does not allow. Additional revenue or budget offsets will be needed to cover this shortfall. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is projected to have a balance close to zero by the end of FY2021, leading to potential delays in payments for completed work by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Without changes, the HTF balance is estimated to go from $14 billion at the start of FY2021 to a deficit of $85 billion by the end of FY2025. Congress may need additional revenue or budget offsets to cover this shortfall, impacting the size of the program approved to follow the FAST Act. Highway and transit spending based solely on projected HTF revenue under current law would be limited, affecting contract authority through FY2026. FTA would have reduced contract authority through FY2026, impacting the HTF. Obligated amounts for highway projects are projected at $62 billion, with an additional $22 billion available. For public transportation, projected obligations are nearly $18 billion with $11 billion unobligated. These amounts must be paid from future HTF receipts. President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 on February 9, 2018. President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, raising ceilings on non-defense discretionary spending for FY2018 and FY2019. At least $10 billion per year of the additional outlays would be allocated for infrastructure, including surface transportation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $2.834 billion for infrastructure funding from the general fund, not impacting HTF solvency. The first federal gas tax was imposed in 1932 as a deficit-reduction measure. The gasoline tax was initially imposed in 1932 to address a deficit, and has since been raised multiple times to fund various initiatives, including World War II and the construction of the Interstate Highway System. The tax remained at 4 cents per gallon from 1959 to 1983, when it was increased to 9 cents per gallon, followed by subsequent increases in 1990 and beyond. The fuel tax rate has increased multiple times since 1983, with significant hikes in 1990 and 1993. These increases were influenced by budgetary concerns and political factors, with the last increase occurring during the lame-duck session of the 97th Congress. President Reagan opposed the increase, but a compromise was reached to allocate a portion of the tax for mass transit funding. President Reagan's opposition to a gas tax increase softened during the lame-duck session of the 97th Congress. Despite facing filibusters, the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) was eventually signed into law on January 6, 1983, doubling the highway fuel tax to 9 cents per gallon. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90) was passed under pressure from impending sequestration orders, increasing the fuel tax rate further. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90) included budget cuts, tax changes, and the Budget Enforcement Act (P.L. 101-508). It raised the tax on gasoline by 5 cents per gallon, with half going to the Highway Trust Fund and the rest to the general fund for deficit reduction. The act also expressed Congress's intent for all motor fuel taxes to be directed to the Highway Trust Fund. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93) made further changes to fuel taxes. Section 13241(a) redirected the 2.5-cents-per-gallon fuel tax from OBRA90 to the Highway Trust Fund starting October 1, 1995. An additional 4.3-cents-per-gallon fuel tax was implemented in October 1993 for deficit reduction. The gasoline tax increased to 18.3 cents per gallon, with 6.8 cents per gallon going to the general fund initially. By October 1, 1995, the amount going to the general fund decreased to 4.3 cents per gallon, with 14 cents per gallon dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund. All motor fuel tax revenue was later redirected to the Highway Trust Fund under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The motor fuel tax revenue was redirected to the Highway Trust Fund under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Alternative approaches for supporting the HTF include indexing a differently designed gas tax to inflation and fuel-efficiency improvements. Adjusting the gas tax rates for gasoline and diesel in 2017 would have resulted in higher taxes per gallon. The proposal suggests raising the base tax rate for gasoline by 13.4 cents per gallon and for diesel by 17.8 cents per gallon to address revenue lost due to greater fuel efficiency. Future adjustments would be based on inflation rates, and taxes would be assessed as a percentage of the retail price of fuel under the sales tax concept. The proposal suggests raising the base tax rate for gasoline and diesel to address revenue lost due to greater fuel efficiency. Taxes would be assessed as a percentage of the retail price of fuel, leading to potential fluctuations in sales tax revenue based on fuel price changes. Many states that tied fuel taxes to prices in the past faced revenue shortfalls during periods of declining fuel prices. Virginia eliminated its cents-per-gallon fuel taxes in 2013 in favor of a sales tax on fuel tied to the average wholesale price. A federal sales tax on motor fuel may not be a long-term solution for financing transportation infrastructure as it relies on fuel consumption. Economists suggest mileage-based user charges as an alternative source of highway funding, where motorists pay fees based on distance driven and other costs of road use. The concept of mileage-based user charges for funding transportation infrastructure is gaining renewed interest due to technological advancements and the limitations of fuel taxes. VMT charges could vary from a flat cent-per-mile fee to a variable charge based on GPS tracking of vehicle movements. Implementation of a VMT charge would face challenges such as public privacy concerns, higher collection costs, administrative difficulties, and controversy over rate adjustments. Collecting from drivers without bank accounts or cards is also a concern. A nationwide VMT charge would be similar to a national toll, potentially leading to double charges for vehicles on toll roads. The prospect of vehicles being charged twice on toll roads due to VMT charges replacing tolls could complicate bond servicing. The distinction between a VMT charge for highways only as a user fee and one that funds public transportation as a tax raises legal issues. A VMT charge would need clear legislation on spending, while a carbon tax could fund transportation programs and replace current taxes. CBO estimated a $25 per metric ton carbon tax would increase federal revenues by $977 billion between 2017 and 2026. A carbon tax of $25 per metric ton could increase federal revenues by $977 billion between 2017 and 2026, with a projected 9% reduction in emissions from taxed sources. The impact on the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) would depend on tax design and revenue use, but electric vehicles are expected to have a modest effect on HTF revenue in the near term. Electric vehicles are projected to impact Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenue in the near future. As of 2017, 18 states had taxes or fees on electric vehicles, with revenue typically dedicated to transportation. Congress could consider a federal registration fee, but it may face legal challenges if it mandates state implementation. Various proposals have been suggested to generate revenue for the HTF. Various proposals have been suggested to generate revenue for the Highway Trust Fund (HTF), originating from commissions and groups like AASHTO and TRB. AASHTO's \"Matrix of Illustrative Surface Transportation Revenue Options\" lists 33 potential revenue options, many involving taxes on freight movements or energy. The revenue estimates are suggestive and dependent on various factors. The HTF, initially temporary, has endured and expanded its financing scope beyond its original purpose. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has expanded its financing scope beyond its original purpose since its inception. Congress can still fund transportation projects using general fund appropriations, even if new taxes and fees dedicated to the HTF are not imposed. Various revenue options have been proposed to generate revenue for the HTF, including taxes on freight movements or energy. Possible alternatives to the trust fund financing model include eliminating the trust fund, which would simplify the budget framework but could lead to surface transportation competing with other federal programs for funding annually. The donor-donee dispute over which states contribute more to the highway account of the HTF than they receive has been a longstanding issue in reauthorization debates. The donor-donee dispute in the federal highway program has largely been resolved with general fund transfers to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). This issue arose due to tracking federal fuel tax revenues by state, but injecting general fund monies into the HTF has made nearly all states recipients. If transportation-related taxes were deposited into the general fund instead of the trust fund, Congress would have more flexibility in allocating funding. However, this could weaken the link between road user charges and program spending. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has been a source of contention due to the donor-donee dispute in the federal highway program. General fund transfers have resolved this issue, making nearly all states recipients. Eliminating the trust fund could lead to more flexibility in funding allocation but may weaken the link between road user charges and program spending. Performance measures in federal transportation spending have been slow to implement, but eliminating the trust fund could allow for more creativity in infrastructure provision. Reconsidering the trust fund structure for federal transportation spending could involve devoting HTF revenues exclusively to highways, leaving transit and other programs to be funded by general appropriations or devolved to states. This change may have political implications as various groups have become supporters of the current program. Devolving surface transportation programs to states is another option that the federal government could consider. The federal government could devolve most federal responsibility for highways and public transportation to the states, reducing federal taxes that support surface transportation programs. Congress transferred funds into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through the FAST Act, but debate is likely on whether general fund support should continue beyond FY2020. Congress may consider making the general fund share permanent to address the inadequacy of motor fuel taxes for surface transportation needs. The Federal Aviation Administration budget is supported by trust funds and general funds, with the general fund amount reflecting the value of the airways system to military and other users. Congress could potentially provide an annual general fund share for federal highway funding, leading to a change in the financing structure of the federal-aid highways program. This could involve appropriating the general fund share to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) or funding some programs from the trust fund and others via appropriations. Congress may also consider authorizing trust-funded programs separately from appropriated programs, allowing for a long authorization for projects that require extensive planning and completion. The history of toll roads in the United States dates back to the early days of the republic, with toll revenues allowing states to build highways without federal aid in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Federal law has prohibited tolling roads that benefited from federal funds since the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 authorized funds for the Interstate System and created the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through raised fuel taxes. Exceptions to the tolling ban now cover most federal-aid roads and bridges, with restrictions on tolling of Interstate System highways. Some toll projects have faced financial challenges, and non-Interstate highways can be converted to toll roads after reconstruction. Existing Interstate surface lanes cannot be tolled except under limited pilot programs, while bridges and tunnels may be converted under certain conditions. Interstate System bridges and tunnels can be converted if reconstructed or replaced. New capacity on federal-aid highways, including Interstate Highways, can generally be tolled. Toll revenue nationwide was $14.457 billion in FY2016, with revenue per mile varying among toll facilities. All toll revenue goes to state, local agencies, or private entities operating tolled facilities; the federal government does not collect toll revenue. Increasing revenue from tolling can be achieved by expanding toll roads and raising the average toll per mile. While there are 6,001 tolled miles of roads in the US, toll-road mileage only makes up 0.6% of public roads eligible for federal highway aid. Raising tolls can be challenging politically, especially when revenue is used for purposes other than maintaining the toll facility. Trucking interests often oppose rate changes that increase tolls. Increasing toll road usage depends on policies that expand the number of tolled miles and set optimal toll rates. However, economic and social trends also influence toll road use. The financing of toll roads in the 20th century assumed increased vehicle usage, but this was challenged by a decline in vehicle miles traveled after the 2007 recession. Trucking interests often oppose rate changes that increase truck tolls relative to automobile tolls, and large toll increases can lead motorists to seek alternative routes, reducing revenue potential. Toll operators' contracts with state governments typically limit the rate at which tolls can rise. Vehicle miles traveled declined after the 2007 recession but have been rising since 2014, potentially increasing toll revenues. However, slower growth in personal vehicle use could constrain toll revenues in the long term. Imposing tolls on individual facilities may have limited impact on overall highway capital spending, especially in states with low population densities. Toll collection costs can be high, with some exceeding 10% of revenues. Tolls may be effective for financing specific facilities, but challenges exist in expanding toll road usage. Value capture is a revenue mechanism that aims to cover transportation improvement costs by benefiting landowners or developers. It includes tax increment financing, special assessments, development impact fees, negotiated exactions, and joint development. The federal role in value capture strategies may be limited, but they can supplement or replace traditional funding methods for transportation programs. Value capture, a revenue mechanism to cover transportation improvement costs, can supplement traditional funding methods. Joint development, a widely used strategy, involves real estate projects near transit stations cooperatively pursued by public and private sectors. For example, a transit agency may lease air rights over a station to a developer for a regular payment. While joint development has generated some revenue for transit agencies, less common strategies like special assessments are also available. Special assessment districts and value capture are alternative funding strategies for transportation projects. Special assessment districts involve properties in a defined area being taxed for a specific purpose, generating significant funding for projects like the South Lake Union streetcar in Seattle. Value capture, on the other hand, involves revenue mechanisms like tax increment financing in Texas to fund highway projects. These strategies have been used in various states to fund transportation projects effectively. The expansion of Route 28 near Washington Dulles International Airport in the late 1980s led to calls for more private-sector involvement in highway and transit infrastructure through public-private partnerships (P3s). Private involvement can take various forms, such as design-build and design-build-finance-operate agreements. The federal government influences the prevalence and structure of P3s through transportation programs, funding, and regulatory oversight, with private financing typically requiring a project-related revenue stream from sources like tolls or fees. Private-sector resources for infrastructure projects can come from sources like vehicle tolls, freight container fees, or building rents. Private financing often involves facility user fees, such as tolls, and may include availability payments from the government based on performance standards. Demand risk has led to an increase in availability payment P3s in recent years, with state and local governments retaining more risk. Private financing for infrastructure projects, including transportation P3s, has been limited in the United States compared to other countries like Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Despite assertions of ample private funds globally, only a small number of transportation P3s have been implemented in the US, with total project costs of $39 billion from 1993 to September 2017. Major impediments remain for private investment in infrastructure, although demand risk has led to an increase in availability payment P3s. Private investment in infrastructure faces several obstacles, including the attractiveness of tax-exempt financing for state and local governments, political opposition to tolling and privatization, and challenges in project development. Private-sector financing through P3s should complement traditional public funding rather than replace it. P3s can attract private capital and improve efficiency in construction, maintenance, and operation, potentially providing more infrastructure at the same cost. However, cost reductions may not occur if decisions are tied to short-term budget cycles. Private investment in infrastructure through Public-Private Partnerships (P3s) can reduce government costs by transferring financial risks to private investors. However, this transfer of risk may not always be effective if major miscalculations occur, leading to contract renegotiations or financial guarantees. Not all risks can be shifted to the private sector, such as higher construction costs due to delays in the environmental review process. Asset recycling involves selling or leasing infrastructure to the private sector. Asset recycling in Australia involved the sale or lease of government-owned infrastructure assets to the private sector, with incentive payments given to state governments for reinvestment in new infrastructure projects. The national government entered into agreements totaling A$3.175 billion over a three-year period, including the lease of electricity network businesses in New South Wales for investment in various projects. A similar program was proposed for the United States in a draft bill on infrastructure. In the United States, a draft bill proposed a program for infrastructure investment, offering a federal payment of 15% of the assessed value of leased infrastructure assets to project sponsors. The bill allocated $3 billion from FY2019 through FY2023 for this purpose. Qualifying infrastructure assets include highways, public transit, airports, ports, railroads, bus facilities, and water facilities. Municipal bonds are a significant source of financing for transportation infrastructure, with tax-exempt interest for investors. Municipal bonds offer tax-exempt interest for investors, leading to lower interest rates for borrowers and reduced project costs. The federal government's contribution to projects financed with municipal bonds is estimated at 26 cents per dollar. Private activity bonds (PABs) require congressional approval for federal tax exemption and are used for specific purposes like airports, docks, and highways. The authorization for the sale of qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities was a provision in SAFETEA, enacted in 2005. As of August 1, 2018, $8.38 billion of the $15 billion had been issued to finance 23 projects, and another $2.63 billion had been allocated to five other projects. There have been proposals to increase the bond issuance cap so that PABs, which are seen as an important support for P3 deals, can continue to be issued in the future. Tax-exempt bonds issued by state and local governments have disadvantages as they reduce federal control over project support and contribution amounts. These bonds are inefficient in subsidizing debt as borrowing costs are reduced by less than forgone federal revenue. They mainly benefit bond buyers in the highest income tax brackets and are unattractive to investors without federal tax liability, limiting funds available to governments. Tax credit bonds, an alternative type of municipal bond, could help overcome these limitations by not paying interest but providing a tax credit to investors. Tax credit bonds do not pay interest but provide a tax credit to investors, making them more efficient than tax-exempt bonds. Unused tax credits can be carried forward or sold. Some types of tax credit bonds pay the credit to the issuer and offer interest to investors, attracting those without federal tax liability. However, current authority does not allow tax credit bonds to finance transportation projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized Build America Bonds for financing various projects, including transportation. However, the authorization for these bonds expired in 2010. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program, established in 1998, provides federal credit assistance through secured loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit to support large transportation infrastructure projects. TIFIA aims to reduce borrowers' costs, lower project risks, and leverage nonfederal funding, including private sector investments. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program provides federal credit assistance through loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit to support transportation projects. TIFIA has assisted over 70 projects with about $30 billion, totaling nearly $110 billion in project costs. Funding for TIFIA has been authorized through the FAST Act, with appropriations covering administrative costs and the subsidy cost of credit assistance. The FAST Act allows states to use funds from the NSFHPP and NHPP programs to cover subsidy and administrative costs for TIFIA credit assistance. This could significantly increase the amount of loans and credit assistance available beyond the direct authorization of $275 million. The BUILD Transportation Discretionary Grants program, funded by general appropriations, also plays a role in supporting transportation projects. The TIFIA program in the FAST Act has provisions to finance smaller projects, including rural projects and transit-oriented development infrastructure. Changes allow for TIFIA loans to capitalize a \"rural project fund\" and pay application fees for projects costing $75 million or less. The FAST Act authorized the creation of the Build America Bureau within DOT to administer federal transportation financing programs, including the TIFIA program, SIB program, RRIF Program, and private activity bonds for qualified projects. The bureau will also establish best practices for innovative financing. The Build America Bureau within DOT will oversee innovative financing programs, including the INFRA grants. Congress has considered creating a national infrastructure bank for a wider range of projects, claiming it would offer more independence and expertise in project selection. A national infrastructure bank could be capitalized through appropriations or bond issuance, attracting private capital from sources like pension funds and foreign investors. Tax-exempt municipal securities may not appeal to all investors, making taxable bonds with long maturities more attractive. The bank could also help reduce the federal government's share of project costs. The national infrastructure bank could reduce the federal government's project costs by relying more on nonfederal capital and user fees. However, funding projects with the highest economic returns may conflict with Congress's desire for diverse funding purposes. This could lead to major transportation projects not being funded if the bank prioritizes water or energy projects with higher returns. Additionally, the bank duplicates existing programs like TIFIA and may not be the most cost-effective way to increase infrastructure spending. A national infrastructure bank may not be as cost-effective as the U.S. Treasury due to higher interest and issuance costs. State infrastructure banks (SIBs) already exist in many states, with some states having their own investment banks. Local governments, like Chicago and Dauphin County, PA, are also exploring infrastructure funding options. Dauphin County, PA, has established an infrastructure bank funded by a state tax on liquid fuels to provide loans to municipalities and private project sponsors. States can capitalize the banks using highway and transit funds, and rural project funds can now be capitalized by a loan from the TIFIA program under the FAST Act. Federal funds must be matched with state funds on an 80% federal, 20% state basis."
