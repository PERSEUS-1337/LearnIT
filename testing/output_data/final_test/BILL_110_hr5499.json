    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Iraq Redeployment Timetable and Political Reconciliation Act of 2008\". Congress expresses its views on the service of US Armed Forces in Iraq and political reconciliation in Iraq. The Congress acknowledges the honorable service of the US Armed Forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom and emphasizes the importance of political reconciliation in Iraq for stability. It highlights the need for robust diplomatic efforts for reconciliation and calls for a defined schedule for the redeployment of US forces from Iraq. The quickest, safest, and most responsible way to bring the US Armed Forces home from Iraq is through a defined schedule for redeployment. This will encourage Iraq to take responsibility for its future and engage the international community for assistance. Continuous deployments have compromised US military readiness globally, impacting its ability to fulfill other international commitments. SEC. 3. TIMETABLE FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ. The Secretary of Defense must begin redeploying US Armed Forces from Iraq within 90 days of the Act's enactment to protect national security interests and enhance military readiness. The redeployment should be completed within 180 days, and a report must be submitted within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to the congressional defense committees outlining the necessary elements for the redeployment of US Armed Forces from Iraq within 180 days. The report should include a timetable, estimates of personnel and equipment needed, a plan for safe withdrawal, and cost estimates for security. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report certifying the redeployment of all US Armed Forces from Iraq. The Secretary may retain forces for protection of the US Embassy in Baghdad. SEC. 4. RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ. The Secretary of State will work with the elected Government of Iraq for security and stability through diplomatic means. Funds can be used for diplomatic, social, and economic activities in Iraq. The President must submit reports to Congress every 30 days. The report to Congress will detail US efforts in Iraq, including political dialogue, international organization assistance for reconciliation, and US initiatives for governance, rule of law, democracy, and human rights. SEC. 5. MIDDLE EAST SECURITY AND ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION. Sense of Congress: Security and stability in Iraq and the broader Middle East are crucial for global nations. International diplomatic involvement is essential for regional security. The US national security interests are tied to the Middle East region. A regional security and economic organization, similar to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, should be established to promote dialogue among participating nations. The Middle East Security and Economic Organization aims to enhance regional security and economic cooperation through negotiations for a multilateral organization involving nations in the Persian Gulf and broader Middle East region. The Middle East Security and Economic Organization aims to include representative countries from the League of Arab States, member states from NATO, and interested nations holding seats in the UN General Assembly. The Secretary of State must provide progress reports to Congress every 30 days during negotiations. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"United States Armed Forces\" and \"congressional defense committees.\""
