    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Syria Accountability Act of 2002\". Congress finds that President George Bush declared that nations must choose to support either the US or terrorists, and UN Resolution 1373 requires states to prevent support for terrorist acts. The Government of Syria is prohibited from receiving US assistance due to being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. Syria provides support to various terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas, operating in Lebanon and on Syrian territory. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 calls for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, as more than 20,000 Syrian troops occupy Lebanese territory, exerting undue influence and undermining political independence. Multiple bills and resolutions have been passed by the US Congress since 1990, urging the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon. The Lebanese people demand the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, while Israel has already withdrawn its forces in compliance with UN Resolution 425. Despite this, Syria allows attacks on Israeli outposts by militant groups, claiming Shebaa Farms as Lebanese territory. The United States provides financial assistance to Lebanon through private organizations, including support for Lebanese-American educational institutions. President Bush stated in his State of the Union address in 2002 that the US will continue to work on the situation in the region. President Bush declared that the United States will work closely with the coalition to prevent terrorists and their state sponsors from obtaining materials for weapons of mass destruction. Syria is developing ballistic missiles and pursuing biological and chemical weapons. UN resolutions restrict Iraq from selling oil and commodities, but Syria is receiving oil from Iraq in violation of these resolutions. Syrian President Bashar Assad promised to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661 in February 2001, but this pledge remains unfulfilled. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that Syria should immediately stop supporting terrorism, declare its renunciation of terrorism, close terrorist offices, and withdraw its armed forces from Lebanon. Lebanon should deploy its armed forces in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for the sovereignty of Lebanon over its territory, the eviction of terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Syria should cease the development and deployment of ballistic missiles, as well as the production of biological and chemical weapons. Additionally, Syria should comply with UN Security Council Resolution 661 regarding illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil. Lebanon and Syria should engage in unconditional bilateral negotiations. The United States should engage in serious bilateral negotiations with Israel for a full peace agreement. Humanitarian and educational aid to Lebanon should be provided through private and international organizations until Lebanon achieves full independence as per UN Security Council Resolution 520. The policy statement in Section 4 emphasizes the need for bilateral negotiations with Israel for a full peace agreement. The United States policy includes continuing the campaign against international terrorism, holding Syria accountable for attacks by terrorist groups it supports, denying Syria the ability to support terrorism and acquire weapons of mass destruction, and listing Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism until it ends its support for terrorist groups. The United States emphasizes the importance of Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, stating that Syria is in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 520 for its occupation of Lebanese territory. Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon is not tied to progress in peace processes with Israel, but is a direct obligation under Resolution 520. Additionally, concerns are raised about Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs pose a threat to the Middle East and US national security. The US will withhold assistance and oppose multilateral aid until Syria withdraws from Lebanon, stops developing weapons of mass destruction, and complies with relevant UN resolutions. The text chunk \"SEC. 5. PENALTIES AND AUTHORIZATION.\" is a condensed summary of the section discussing penalties and authorization in relation to Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. Until the President determines that Syria meets specified requirements and certifies it to Congress, penalties include prohibiting exports to Syria of items on controlled lists, US government assistance to businesses in Syria, and programs of certain agencies. The President can impose sanctions on Syria, including prohibiting US exports (excluding food and medicine), US businesses from investing in Syria, restricting Syrian diplomats' travel, and banning Syrian-owned aircraft from entering or flying over the US. The President can impose sanctions on Syria, including restricting diplomatic contacts, blocking transactions involving Syrian government property, and providing assistance to Syria and Lebanon if certain conditions are met. The President may waive sanctions if it is in the national security interest of the United States. If the President determines that specific requirements are met regarding negotiations for peace agreements between Israel and Syria and Israel and Lebanon, as well as Syria's respect for Lebanon's sovereignty, then the President is authorized to impose sanctions on Syria. The President can also waive sanctions if it is in the national security interest of the United States. The President is authorized to provide assistance to Syria and Lebanon under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. A certification must be made by the President that Syria does not support international terrorist groups and has withdrawn all military personnel from Lebanon. The Government of Syria has ceased developing and deploying ballistic missiles, as well as producing biological and chemical weapons. They are no longer violating United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 and relevant resolutions.
