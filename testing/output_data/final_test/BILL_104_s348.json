The Regulatory Oversight Act of 1995 requires Congressional review of significant rules that may impact the economy or public welfare before they can take effect. The agency must submit a report to Congress with details about the rule before it becomes final. The Regulatory Oversight Act of 1995 mandates Congressional review of significant rules before they can be finalized. The rule must include the proposed effective date and a complete cost-benefit analysis. The rule takes effect 45 days after Congress receives the report or when it is published in the Federal Register, whichever is later. If Congress passes a resolution of disapproval and the President vetoes it, the rule takes effect after a failed override vote. The Regulatory Oversight Act of 1995 requires Congressional review of significant rules before finalization. Rules take effect 45 days after Congress receives the report or when published in the Federal Register. If Congress passes a resolution of disapproval and the President vetoes it, the rule takes effect after a failed override vote. Rules may not take effect if a joint resolution of disapproval is passed by Congress. The President can determine a rule to take effect in cases of imminent threat, criminal law enforcement, or national security. This determination is not subject to judicial review. Rules published in the Federal Register are subject to Congressional review procedures. During the period between Congress adjourning and the next Congress convening, rules published in the Federal Register will take effect as final rules. Any rule that is later nullified by a joint resolution will be treated as if it never took effect. If Congress does not pass a joint resolution to disapprove a rule, no inference can be made from Congress's actions or inactions regarding the rule. A joint resolution introduced after receiving a report can nullify a rule by stating that Congress disapproves of it, rendering the rule ineffective. The submission or publication date for a resolution to disapprove a rule is defined as the later of when Congress receives the report or when the rule is published in the Federal Register. If a committee has not reported on the resolution within 20 days of the submission date, the Majority Leader can discharge the committee from further consideration of the resolution. When a committee reports or is discharged from a resolution, any Member can move to proceed to its consideration. The motion is privileged, not debatable, and not amendable. It cannot be postponed or set aside for other business, and a motion to reconsider is not allowed.

The resolution debate concludes with a vote on final passage as per House rules. Appeals on Chair decisions regarding resolution rules are decided without debate. If one House receives a resolution from the other House, specific procedures apply, including no referral to a committee and the same procedure in the receiving House. The resolution debate ends with a final passage vote following House rules. If one House receives a resolution from the other, specific procedures apply, including no committee referral and following the same procedure in the receiving House. The House can change rules relating to its procedures at any time, similar to other rules. A technical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code. The Act will be effective upon enactment and will apply to significant rules that become final on or after the effective date."
