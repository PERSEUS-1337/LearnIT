    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Handgun Control Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that the number of handguns in private hands has reached seventy-six million, and they play a disproportionate role in violent crimes. Licensing and restrictions on new handguns may not reduce handgun crime significantly, as they are not primarily used for sporting purposes. The Congress believes that handguns in the home are less effective for defense than commonly believed, and that restricting their availability will reduce violent crime and deaths from handguns in the United States. SEC. 3. HANDGUN CONTROLS. Title 18, United States Code, amended by inserting CHAPTER 50A--HANDGUNS. Sec. 1091 of CHAPTER 50A--HANDGUNS prohibits the import, manufacture, sale, purchase, transfer, receipt, or transportation of handguns, with exceptions for licensed importers, manufacturers, dealers, and pistol clubs. Sec. 1092 of CHAPTER 50A--HANDGUNS outlines the licensing requirements for pistol clubs, including the application process, age restrictions for members, and the fee of $25 per year. Applicants must meet certain criteria to be approved for a license under this chapter. The pistol club must meet certain criteria to be approved for a license, including not violating any firearm laws, disclosing all required information truthfully, and having secure facilities for storing handguns. The Secretary must approve or deny a license application within 45 days. Failure to act allows the applicant to compel action through legal means. Licenses can be revoked for violations of firearm laws or regulations. The Secretary must provide written notice for denial or revocation of a license, with specific grounds stated. A hearing can be requested to review the denial or revocation, with the option to stay the effective date of revocation. After a hearing, if the Secretary decides not to reverse the denial or revocation of a license, the aggrieved party can file a petition for judicial review within sixty days. The court may consider evidence and order the Secretary to take necessary action if unauthorized. The court can order the Secretary to comply with its judgment. Licensed pistol clubs must maintain records of handgun transactions as prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary can inspect club premises for compliance with record-keeping regulations. The Secretary may provide information to States or political subdivisions regarding pistol club members and their handguns. Licenses issued under this chapter must be posted for inspection. Violations of the chapter or false statements are subject to penalties. Any information required for pistol club records or license applications under this chapter may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. Handguns involved in violations can be seized and forfeited. Exceptions apply to certain activities under this chapter. Sec. 1095 outlines exceptions to regulations on handguns, stating that certain handguns intended for specific uses are exempt from the importation, manufacture, sale, purchase, transfer, receipt, or transportation restrictions. Additionally, individuals can voluntarily deliver handguns to designated law enforcement agencies. The Secretary can arrange for the transfer, destruction, or disposal of handguns delivered to designated law enforcement agencies. Owners of handguns delivered under this section can receive payment equal to the fair market value of the handgun or $25, funded by fees collected under section 1092(a). The fees collected under section 1092(a) will be used to pay for certain purposes, with the remainder coming from general revenues. The Secretary has the authority to establish rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this chapter, including providing certified copies of licenses to licensed individuals.
