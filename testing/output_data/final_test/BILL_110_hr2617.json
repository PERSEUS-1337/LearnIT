    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preparing Excellent Teachers Act of 2007\". Congress acknowledges the critical shortage of qualified teachers in the United States, with nearly 50% of new teachers leaving within the first 5 years. This impacts the quality of education for children. Inexperienced teachers are less effective, but successful teacher preparation programs can help them become effective more rapidly. Teacher candidates need to see expert practices modeled. Teacher candidates must see expert practices modeled and practice them with mentoring support. Teacher preparation often lacks opportunities to learn under expert teachers in schools serving high-need students. Student teaching in ineffective classrooms does not generalize to teaching in high-need schools. Programs are needed to support teacher recruits in high-need classrooms where they are needed. Teacher residency programs are crucial for building teacher supply in hard-to-staff urban and rural areas. These programs recruit, prepare, retain, and support teachers effectively in high-need schools. Grants for teacher residency programs are introduced under Part C of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to support the recruitment, preparation, retention, and support of teachers in high-need schools. The Secretary will provide grants to high-need local educational agencies to establish teacher residency programs in collaboration with non-profit organizations. These programs involve prospective teachers teaching alongside mentor teachers for at least 1 academic year and receiving coursework in their content area. Teacher residency programs involve prospective teachers receiving instruction in various areas such as planning, content, pedagogy, student learning, assessment, classroom management, and professional responsibilities. They must attain full state certification before program completion and undergo a midpoint review. Successful programs integrate pedagogy. Teacher residency programs integrate pedagogy and classroom practice through partnerships with higher education institutions. Residents engage in master's level coursework and teaching apprenticeships, guided by experienced mentor teachers. Mentor teachers align classroom practice with coursework and may receive additional compensation. Experienced mentor teachers in teacher residency programs have extra responsibilities as teacher leaders, mentors for residents, and coaches for novice teachers. They establish a learning community focused on improving student learning. The director of the program sets clear criteria for selecting mentor teachers based on effectiveness and subject area knowledge. Teacher effectiveness is evaluated through observation in various domains. The curr_chunk discusses the key components of effective teaching, including planning, preparation, engaging students with different learning styles, collaborating with colleagues, and analyzing student learning gains. Teacher residency programs emphasize these aspects to improve student learning outcomes. Teacher residency programs group teacher candidates in cohorts to facilitate collaboration. Admissions goals align with hiring objectives of local educational agencies. Residents learn and teach in the same district, receiving ongoing support and professional development. To participate in a teacher residency program, eligible individuals must enroll in a masters degree program in education or teaching at a university or college with a written agreement with a high-need local educational agency. Experienced mentor teachers must have at least five years of teaching experience in the agency and a masters degree in education. Participants in a teacher residency program must complete ten months of teaching under a mentor teacher in a school chosen by the high-need local educational agency. They must agree to be placed in a school after completing the program. Participants in the teacher residency program must teach for at least 5 academic years in a high-need area school after completing the program. Failure to complete the placement results in repayment of training costs. Grants for the program are distributed over three years, totaling $5 million. The Secretary can award up to ten grants. The Secretary may award up to ten grants each fiscal year, with each high-need local educational agency eligible for one grant per year. Agencies must submit an application for the grant, and awards are given on a competitive basis. Up to 5 percent of funds are reserved for program evaluation. The Secretary may award grants to high-need schools and local educational agencies for teacher residency programs, with evaluations conducted by specified organizations. Matching funds are required from agencies receiving grants. High-need local educational agencies are defined in the section. The term 'high-need local educational agency' is defined as an agency with high poverty rates, low assessment scores, and a high percentage of classes taught by teachers not teaching in academic subjects. The text chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for teacher residency programs, with $50,000,000 allocated annually from 2008 to 2012. The funds can be used by the Secretary to make additional grants starting from fiscal year 2013. A clerical amendment is also mentioned in the text."
