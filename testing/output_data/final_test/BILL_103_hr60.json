The new section in the Internal Revenue Code provides a 10% credit for first-time homebuyers on the purchase price of their first principal residence, limited to $2,500. To qualify as a first-time homebuyer, all individuals purchasing the residence must be first-time homebuyers. The maximum credit is allocated among all individuals purchasing the residence, and certain individuals are ineligible if specific conditions are met.

The maximum credit is allocated among all individuals purchasing the residence, and certain individuals are ineligible if specific conditions are met. Section 1034(a) is suspended under subsection (a)(6), (h), or (k) of section 1034 with respect to such individual. A residence shall be treated as purchased during the eligibility period if the purchaser enters into a binding contract to purchase the residence. The term 'purchase' in the Internal Revenue Code refers to acquiring property under specific conditions, such as not acquiring it from certain individuals and having the basis of the property determined in a certain way. A contract to purchase a residence is considered binding even if contingent on financing or the condition of the property. The term 'purchase price' in the Internal Revenue Code refers to the adjusted basis of a residence at the time of acquisition, regardless of the basis of the previous owner or property acquired from a decedent. The credit allowable for the purchase price may exceed the limitation imposed by section 26(a) reduced by other credits. The excess credit from sections 21 and 22 can be carried forward to the next taxable year, with a 5-year limit on carryforwards. If a taxpayer disposes of property within 36 months of acquiring it, the credit may be recaptured. If a taxpayer disposes of property within 36 months of acquiring it, the tax imposed under this chapter for the taxable year is increased by the amount allowed as a credit for the purchase of such property. If the taxpayer purchases a new principal residence within the applicable period, the tax is increased by the difference between the credit claimed on the new residence and the credit claimed on the disposed property. The tax implications for property disposition under this section are exempt in certain circumstances such as death of the owner, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion. This exemption applies to a residence sold due to the owner's death within a 36-month period, a residence destroyed by a qualifying casualty, or a residence disposed of in a divorce settlement.

The amendments in this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
