    "content": "The \"Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 2002\" establishes a fire safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission must issue a safety standard for cigarettes within 18 months to reduce fire risk, using a specific testing methodology. The safety standard for cigarettes must include a specific testing methodology requiring complete test trials with at least 40 replicate tests. Cigarettes failing to self-extinguish before burning the full length of the tobacco column in more than 50% of tests will be considered a test failure. Manufacturers can propose alternative test methods for unique cigarette designs. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has the authority to regulate the ignition propensity of cigarettes with unique characteristics. If the test method for cigarettes is revised, the Commission must be notified, and the revision may be incorporated if deemed in the public interest. The Commission can also revise the rule and performance requirements as needed. Manufacturers of cigarettes must identify measures to meet the consumer product safety standard for cigarettes set by the Commission. The Commission will assess if these measures increase cigarette toxicity before deeming a cigarette compliant with the standard. The Commission will promulgate a standard for cigarettes in consultation with various organizations and agencies, considering findings that low ignition propensity cigarettes are already available on the market. The Commission will prohibit stockpiling of cigarettes that do not comply with the standard between promulgation and enforcement dates. Certain provisions do not apply to the promulgation of the standard. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will enforce a standard for cigarettes as consumer products under the Act, with jurisdiction limited to enforcement of this standard. The definition of a cigarette is as prescribed by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will enforce a standard for cigarettes as consumer products under the Act, with jurisdiction limited to enforcement of this standard. The term 'cigarette paper' is defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act does not modify any provisions of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. The effective date of the consumer product safety standard for cigarettes will be determined by the Commission."
