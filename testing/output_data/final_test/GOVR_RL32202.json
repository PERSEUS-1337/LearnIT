Efforts like the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program have been made to enhance safety at Russian nuclear facilities. Questions persist about the long-term security of Russia's nuclear weapons and materials due to economic hardship and aging systems. This report discusses the relocation of nuclear weapons after the Soviet Union's demise and the safety and security issues raised in 1991 and beyond. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, concerns were raised about the safety and security of its vast nuclear arsenal, which included over 27,000 nuclear weapons. Efforts have been made to address these issues through cooperative programs and assistance from the United States to Russia and other former Soviet states. By early 2003, Russia retained around 5,500 strategic nuclear warheads after implementing the START I Treaty. Reports suggest Russia also has between 7,000 and 12,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads. By the end of 1998, former Soviet states had returned their nuclear warheads to Russia and began eliminating launchers under the treaty's terms. Ukraine was the last to eliminate its Soviet-era strategic missiles. Ukraine dismantled its Soviet-era bombers, with Russia taking 8 aircraft as partial payment for gas debt. In October 1999, Russia bought 11 strategic bombers from Ukraine. Many of the Soviet Union's tactical nuclear weapons stationed outside Russia were returned by 1989. By 1989, most of the Soviet Union's weapons in Eastern Europe had been returned to Russia. In late 1991, the majority of weapons outside Russia were in Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. By the end of 1992, all weapons had been moved to storage areas in Russia. The command and control system for nuclear weapons was centered in Moscow, with Boris Yeltsin replacing Gorbachev as the top authority. Concerns about safety, security, and control over nuclear weapons in Russia have been raised by many in the United States and Russia. Concerns about safety, security, and control over nuclear weapons in Russia focus on weaknesses in the command and control system, potential loss of warheads, and theft of nuclear materials. Russia's nuclear command system includes early warning satellites, political and military leaders for decision-making, and communication links for authorization of nuclear weapon use. Russia's nuclear command system relies on authorizing the use of nuclear weapons to field commanders through messages containing enabling codes. Concerns arise from the degradation of Russia's early warning network, leading to fears of a loss of control over strategic nuclear forces without modernization of communication links. Russia's geostationary early warning satellites failed, forcing reliance on older satellites and ground radar stations for missile attack warnings. Concerns persist about gaps in coverage, especially after Latvia shut down a key radar station. The U.S. Defense Department downplays worries about losing control over Russia's nuclear weapons, but analysts fear potential unauthorized launches due to system degradation. According to Russian press reports, strategic rocket forces personnel have faced financial hardship, which could impact training and maintenance. Concerns about troop problems may affect Russia's confidence in the reliability of its nuclear deterrent. The National Intelligence Council noted improvements in these areas, including screening programs for troops responsible for nuclear weapons. In the early 1990s, Russia consolidated nonstrategic nuclear weapons into secure storage facilities, with concerns about the security and dismantling of warheads. Former Russian Security Council head Alexander Lebed raised alarms about potential issues with tracking warheads in these facilities. Russian Security Council head Alexander Lebed alleged that 100 out of 250 small portable nuclear demolition munitions were missing. The Russian Defense Ministry denied the claim, stating that all nuclear weapons were under control and withdrawn from former Soviet republics. Lebed later retracted his allegation, but debate in Russia continued over the existence and accountability of the munitions. The White House stated that the United States had no credible information on the matter. The White House stated that the United States had no credible information on the possible loss or theft of Russian nuclear weapons. Concerns were raised about declining social and economic conditions in Russia leading to potential security risks, with worries about low morale and poor living conditions affecting nuclear weapon controls. General Eugene Habiger visited Russian nuclear weapons storage facilities to assess safety measures. General Eugene Habiger, from U.S. Strategic Command, visited Russian nuclear weapons storage facilities in 1997 and 1998, impressed with safety measures but noted lack of high-tech security devices. Concerns were raised in Congress about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons stockpile, leading to calls for reduction. After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Russian officials increased security at nuclear weapons facilities and denied any missing weapons. Concerns about nuclear materials from Russia grew due to demand, not new threats. Some analysts and officials have raised concerns about the potential acquisition of nuclear materials by terrorists like Osama bin Laden, possibly for a \"dirty bomb\" rather than a nuclear explosive device. Reports of nuclear materials from former Soviet facilities appearing on the black market have raised worries about the purity of these materials for weapon development. In 1999, the National Research Council issued a report on this issue. The National Research Council reported that security at Russia's nuclear materials facilities was worse than previously known, highlighting the risks of theft or diversion. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates enough materials for 40,000 nuclear weapons in 8 countries once part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's nuclear facilities lacked proper security measures due to budget cuts and political upheavals, leading to risks of theft or diversion. Economic problems and military spending cuts displaced scientists and engineers, causing further security challenges at these facilities. Members at Arzamas-16, a premier nuclear research facility in Russia, went on strike for back payment of wages, budget allocations for 1997, and a pay increase for 1998. Nuclear workers from closed cities also participated in a strike in September 1998, protesting at the Atomic Ministry in Moscow. The United States and former Soviet states collaborate to address nuclear security concerns, with the US providing significant financial assistance for securing and eliminating weapons materials and providing alternative employment for scientists and engineers. In November 1991, Congress allocated $400 million in Department of Defense funds to help former Soviet republics secure their nuclear weapons, providing assistance in transportation, storage, safeguarding, destruction of weapons, and prevention of proliferation. The Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program aims to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the diversion of weapons-related expertise. Congress has consistently supported the program's objectives by allocating $300 to $475 million annually. The program primarily focused on helping Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan eliminate strategic nuclear weapons and improve the safety of nuclear warheads. Additionally, funding was provided to help Russia dispose of its chemical weapons, which has been controversial in Congress. The Bush Administration conducted a review of U.S. threat reduction programs in Russia, leading to increased funding for certain efforts. The CTR program's objectives were altered to serve U.S. national security interests, focusing on assisting Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan in the disposal of weapons of mass destruction. The CTR program's new objectives include dismantling weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union, securing related technologies, increasing transparency, and supporting defense cooperation to prevent proliferation. Funding may shift towards securing and eliminating chemical and biological weapons, with an emphasis on promoting higher standards of conduct. The Bush Administration's focus on conditioning U.S. assistance on recipient nations' policies and activities was evident in early 2002 when it refused to certify Russia's commitment to arms control obligations. This certification is required for assistance under the CTR program or State Department nonproliferation programs. Despite Russia's lack of full cooperation, the Administration requested Congress to waive the certification requirement to continue funding the CTR program. The State Department funds nonproliferation programs in Russia and former Soviet states to enhance border and export controls for nuclear materials. It also oversees research centers in Moscow and Ukraine for nuclear scientists. These centers have funded 450 projects totaling $145 million and supported over 17,000 scientists and engineers. The Bush Administration recommended expanding science centers to prevent biological weapons scientists from being lured to other nations. The budget for FY2003 included $52 million for a program combining Science Centers and the State Department's program for redirecting former Soviet Union scientists. The Nunn-Lugar CTR program initially focused on securing nuclear weapons but also provided funding for materials control and protection. The Material Protection, Control and Accounting (MPC&A) program, funded through the U.S. Department of Energy, began in 1994 to enhance security and monitoring systems at facilities housing nuclear materials in Russia and other former Soviet republics. The program started with less than $3 million in the FY1993 budget and grew to over $220 million per year by FY2003. The DOE's Material Protection, Control and Accounting program started in 1994 to upgrade security at facilities housing nuclear materials in Russia and former Soviet states. By early 2003, security had been improved at buildings containing 38% of the at-risk materials. Upgrades included modern security systems and training for Russian nuclear specialists. However, access to facilities in Russia's closed nuclear cities and weapons complex has been limited due to sensitivity and slow information sharing by MINATOM. The Department of Energy implements programs to prevent Russian nuclear scientists from selling their knowledge. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program funds projects with commercial value, while the Nuclear Cities Initiative brings commercial enterprises to Russia's closed nuclear cities. Congress authorizes $20-$30 million annually for these programs. The Nuclear Cities Initiative aims to prevent nuclear scientists from selling their knowledge by promoting nonproliferation goals and creating commercial opportunities in Russia's closed nuclear cities. The program faced funding cuts under the Bush Administration, jeopardizing its presence in two out of three participating cities. The Administration proposed merging NCI projects into the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program. The Nuclear Cities Initiative faced funding cuts under the Bush Administration, leading to a merger with the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program. Congress approved the merger but required separate planning and funding for NCI programs. Funding for the combined program was increased, but the NCI program ended in late 2003 due to disagreements between the United States and Russia over liability protections. In September 1998, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to convert 50 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium to prevent its use in nuclear weapons. The conversion could be done by turning it into fuel for nuclear reactors or mixing it with other nuclear waste for disposal. This agreement aimed to address concerns about theft or diversion of plutonium for nuclear weapons development. Congress allocated $200 million for this program. The Bush Administration sought an alternative plan to address concerns with Russia's weapons-grade plutonium. The new plan involves converting plutonium to MOX fuel, but U.S. assistance to Russia ended in 2003 due to disagreements over liability protections. Discussions in the 1990s aimed to resolve issues related to Russia's nuclear weapons and materials. The Bush Administration pursued discussions with Russia on nuclear weapons and materials through the U.S.-Russian Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation. Vice President Gore and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin addressed arms control and missile defense cooperation, including building a storage facility for plutonium removed from Russia's nuclear weapons. During a meeting in 1998, Vice President Gore and Prime Minister Kiriyenko signed agreements on nuclear issues, including the conversion of plutonium from nuclear weapons to fuel for reactors and providing assistance to Russian scientists for peaceful civilian projects in closed nuclear cities. The Nuclear Cities Initiative, part of the Strategic Stability Working Group, aimed to improve US-Russia relations by detargeting ballistic missiles in 1994. This move was seen as a step towards reducing the risk of accidental missile launches. In 1998, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to share real-time early warning data on missile launches worldwide to address concerns about inadvertent nuclear weapon launches due to Russia's weakened ballistic missile early warning system. The United States and Russia signed an agreement in 2000 to establish a Joint Data Exchange Center near Moscow for sharing information on ballistic missile and space launches. This agreement aimed to prevent false alarms triggering a nuclear launch and promote stability through cooperation between the two nations' military personnel. The Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC) near Moscow was established to prevent false alarms during ballistic missile and space launches. Critics raised concerns about hindering U.S. access to space, but the military community approved the plan. Delays in the center's operations were attributed to disagreements between the U.S. and Russia on tax issues and strained relations. Funding for the JDEC was authorized by Congress in 2002, with 50% withheld pending resolution of issues between the two countries. Funding for the JDEC was authorized in 2002, with 50% withheld until Russia and the U.S. reach agreements on cost-sharing, taxes, and liability. Progress on opening the center halted in 2002 due to disagreements over taxation and liability issues."
