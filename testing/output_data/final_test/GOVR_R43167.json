    "content": "Credit unions engage in financial intermediation by facilitating transfers of funds between savers and borrowers. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 created federally chartered institutions to promote thrift and provide low-cost credit. This report focuses on issues facing the credit union industry. The credit union industry evolved to meet the credit needs of members during the Great Depression. Credit unions provide similar financial services to banks and savings associations. Charters are granted based on a common bond, with three types available. Credit unions are owned by their members, who elect a board of directors. Credit unions operate on a membership basis with one member, one vote. They return profits to members and offer savings referred to as \"shares\" earning \"dividends.\" Loan and investment powers are restricted compared to commercial banks. Federal credit unions have limited investment authority. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulates and insures credit unions. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provides deposit insurance and manages the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) for credit unions. In response to the 2007-2009 recession, the NCUA has implemented enhanced capital requirements to increase the resiliency of credit unions and minimize losses to the NCUSIF. Some credit unions may need to adjust lending practices to meet these requirements. Congress is considering legislation to address credit union issues. Congress is considering legislation to enhance the lending ability of credit unions, including the Credit Union Small Business Jobs Creation Act and the Credit Union Residential Credit Union Loan Parity Act. These policies aim to spur economic growth and increase the capacity of credit unions to make more member business and commercial loans. The credit union system faces financial risks, as seen in the recent financial crisis. During the recent financial crisis, corporate credit unions faced liquidity pressures, leading to five of them being placed into conservatorship in 2008. These wholesale credit unions provide financing, investment, and clearing services for retail credit unions, reducing costs for smaller institutions. Retail credit unions, as cooperative owners of corporate credit unions, are federally insured by the NCUA. The five corporates under conservatorship represented 70% of the entire system's assets and 98.6% of the investment losses. The Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund (TCCUSF) was established by Congress in May 2009 to recover losses from corporate credit unions. The TCCUSF borrowed from Treasury to cover conservatorship costs, and NCUA raised assessments on all federally insured credit unions. Safety and soundness regulation requires sufficient capital reserves to reduce insolvency risk. Higher capital reserves enhance the ability of financial firms to absorb adverse financial events. The NCUA issued a Supervisory Letter in May 2012 warning about large concentrations of 30-year fixed rate mortgage loans held by some credit unions, which could lead to financial risks in the future. Credit unions that made significant mortgage loans during low interest rates may struggle to generate enough revenue to pay depositors if interest rates rise. This interest rate risk could escalate into a systemic crisis if multiple credit unions face similar challenges simultaneously. The NCUA issued guidance for vulnerable credit unions to submit plans to manage interest rate risks. Capital requirements were increased for complex credit unions with at least $100 million in assets. The NCUA finalized the risk-based capital rule, introducing a new asset risk-weighting system for complex credit unions. The NCUA introduced a new risk-based capital ratio of 10% for complex credit unions to align with global standards. Compliance is required by January 1, 2019, to avoid enforcement actions. Non-complex credit unions under $100 million in assets are exempt from the new requirements. According to the NCUA, 1,455 credit unions (or 22% of all credit unions) reported having at least $100 million in total assets as of December 31, 2013, representing 89% of all assets held in the credit union system; 19 of those institutions would need to raise capital to avoid being undercapitalized. Undercapitalized credit unions may face constraints in lending until they comply with higher capital buffer requirements. Congress passed the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998, which established a commercial lending cap in response to a Supreme Court decision. The Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998 (CUMAA; P.L. 105-219) established a commercial lending cap, defining credit union member business loans (MBL) and limiting the aggregate amount of outstanding business loans. Exceptions were authorized for credit unions with low-income designations or participating in certain programs. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to increase the business lending cap for credit unions, allowing them to enhance their member business lending activities. H.R. 1188 and S. 2028 would gradually raise the cap to 27.5% of total assets, up from the current limit of 1.75 times net worth or 12.25% of total assets. The bills aim to increase the business lending cap for credit unions to 27.5% of total assets, requiring well-capitalized ratios and five years of experience in underwriting. Currently, credit unions provided $43.42 billion of member business loans in 2013, with 85% secured by real estate. Raising the MBL cap could pose challenges for smaller credit unions due to the need for increased net worth holdings and limited resources. Credit unions with assets under $10 million are unlikely to expand their commercial lending significantly, while those already active in the market would benefit from the cap increase. Lifting the MBL cap would benefit credit unions with a presence in commercial lending and a large asset base, allowing them to expand in the market. Larger credit unions could become stronger competitors with small community banks and regional banks by offering a wider range of financial products. The credit union system can support increased member business lending through participation loans. Financial institutions collaborate to provide credit through loan participations, with the loan originator retaining the largest share and selling smaller portions to other institutions. This arrangement allows the originator to maintain control of the customer relationship and overcome funding limitations. Participating institutions use their portions of the loan to diversify their portfolios, serving as a cost-effective risk management tool. Credit unions with MBL programs can enter into MBL loan participations, with an increasing trend in credit unions purchasing loan participations since 2007. The value of loan participations on credit unions' balance sheets grew by over 40%, potentially making them more competitive with the banking system in commercial lending markets. However, credit unions could face increased risk of insolvency if many fail simultaneously due to their restricted membership affiliations. Increasing the lending cap for credit unions may lead to more diversification in their MBL holdings, but there is a risk of \"too many (small institutions) to fail\" if participation lending becomes more common. The NCUA reported a 160% increase in participation loan charge-offs, prompting the implementation of more rules to mitigate risks to the NCUSIF. NCUA proposed updates to MBL rules on July 1, 2015, shifting from a prescriptive to a principles-based approach to streamline the underwriting process for credit unions. This change aims to provide more flexibility and autonomy while still requiring compliance with prudential underwriting practices and net worth requirements. The NCUA proposed updates to MBL rules on July 1, 2015, transitioning to a principles-based approach to streamline underwriting for credit unions. Credit unions with a high concentration in commercial lending will need higher net worth to mitigate risk. H.R. 1422 and S. 1440 aim to enhance credit unions' capacity to make more MBLs and commercial loans by amending the FCU Act. The MBL cap is a policy tool that can influence credit union lending ability. It may be too high for some and too low for others, leading to shortages. A lending cap is seen as a blunt instrument that doesn't consider differences in asset size and market focus. The MBL cap is a policy tool that can influence credit union lending ability. Increasing asset risk weights for MBLs imposes costs without directly capping lending ability. Other policy tools, like subjecting net income to UBIT, may still allow credit unions to increase member business lending activity. The 114th Congress has introduced legislative actions to facilitate credit union lending by allowing them to use supplemental capital in addition to retained earnings. An NCUA working group has identified three sources of supplemental capital, including voluntary patronage capital, which would be repaid in the event of a credit union liquidation. Credit unions can raise voluntary patronage capital (VPC) by selling equity shares to members, with dividends but no voting rights. They can also collect mandatory membership capital (MMC) similar to a membership fee, considered equity but without dividends. Subordinate debt (SD) can be obtained from external investors, functioning as a debt-equity hybrid with no voting rights or management involvement. H.R. 989, the Capital Access for Small Business and Jobs Act, aims to redefine net worth for credit unions to include additional sources of supplemental capital. This would allow credit unions to increase lending, including MBLs, while maintaining overall net worth requirements. The bill is not dependent on concurrent enactment with other related bills. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides secured loans to banks, credit unions, and insurance companies engaged in housing finance, agricultural, and small business lending. Membership requires institutions to hold at least 10% of their assets in mortgage-related assets, but community financial institutions with less than $1 billion in assets are exempt from this requirement. The Community Lender Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 aims to amend the FHLB Act to include state-chartered credit unions as insured depository institutions, harmonizing FHLB membership requirements for small banks and credit unions. Additionally, the Preserving Capital Access and Mortgage Liquidity Act of 2015 would redefine community financial institutions to include federal or state credit unions. The Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015, Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, and Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2016 contain language similar to H.R. 299. Community banks, defined as institutions with less than $1 billion in assets, engage in relationship banking, providing services within a specific area to understand local lending risks. Credit unions also offer financial services. Credit unions and community banks both rely on deposits to fund their assets. They serve similar consumer markets but larger institutions have advantages. Regulatory differences exist in fair lending and taxation between the two. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was enacted in response to perceived shortcomings in addressing credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods by banks. The Act requires federal banking regulatory agencies to assess how regulated institutions meet the credit needs of their entire communities, without imposing specific rules. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires banking institutions to meet the credit needs of their communities, especially low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals. CRA credits are earned by providing LMI loans or other financial services, and are important for obtaining regulatory approval for activities like office moves or mergers. Credit unions are not subject to the CRA and do not receive credits for expansion beyond their defined membership charters. Credit unions can expand into underserved areas in their field of membership, potentially gaining a competitive advantage if the CRA applied to them. Not-for-profit credit unions may offer lower rates and fees on loans compared to for-profit banks, as they prioritize serving their members over making profits for investors. As of 2012, smaller financial institutions, including not-for-profit credit unions, may have cost advantages in providing low-cost lending services to underserved markets. There were 180 banking institutions with minority ownership and 809 credit unions with over 50% minority membership in 2012. Credit unions, as not-for-profit financial cooperatives, are exempt from federal income tax. Share deposit holders pay taxes at individual rates on interest received, while credit unions do not pay taxes at the corporate level. Some credit unions may still pay unrelated business income tax. Community banks, on the other hand, are for-profit institutions that accept deposits and provide lending services without restrictions on their customer base. Community banks, unlike credit unions, are publicly owned and issue common equity shares. They generally pay taxes at the corporate level, leading to double taxation for shareholders. However, small banks meeting eligibility requirements can become \"S corporations,\" allowing them to be taxed only once at individual income tax rates. As of 2013, 2,210 insured banking institutions were organized as S corporations, similar to credit unions in terms of taxation. Larger banks may face difficulty converting to S corporations if much of their equity is held in Individual Retirement Accounts. Retirement Accounts cannot hold equity in S corporations. The tax treatment differences between credit unions and banks not organized as S corporations must be determined case-by-case. The nature of competition, based on size and market, determines if a cost advantage exists. Large credit unions offering full financial services may benefit from tax treatment differences compared to similar-sized banks. Data from the NCUA shows similarities in consolidation trends. Similarities in Consolidation Trends: Data from the NCUA shows that total credit union assets have increased from $610.1 billion in 2003 to $1,021.7 billion in 2012, while the total number of credit unions has decreased from 9,369 to 6,819 over the same period. The largest 197 credit unions with over $1 billion in assets held 51.2% of total industry assets in 2012. Loan and membership growth rates were positive for credit unions with assets exceeding $100 million, with the highest growth rates seen in institutions with $500 million or more in assets. Institutions with less than $100 million in assets experienced negative loan growth. In 2012, there were approximately 6,421 community banks and 6,819 credit unions. Community banks collectively had $400 billion more in assets than credit unions. Community banks with less than $1 billion in assets had $904 billion more in assets than credit unions of similar size. Most credit unions have significantly less assets compared to community banks. Total credit union assets in Figure 1 show slightly greater trend growth compared to community banks, driven by large credit unions gaining more industry assets over time. Bank Transfer Day on November 5, 2011, led to a migration of consumers to credit unions due to frustration with bank fees. Larger credit unions benefited from this trend by offering more financial services. Regulatory differences may also provide advantages, especially for smaller institutions. Regulatory differences can create cost advantages for smaller financial institutions, especially those serving riskier customers. Compliance with multiple regulations may burden small institutions more than larger ones, which benefit from fee revenue. Cost advantages from regulations for one set of firms may be offset by advantages from other regulations. Cost advantages from regulations for one set of financial firms may be offset by advantages from other regulations for another set of financial institutions."
