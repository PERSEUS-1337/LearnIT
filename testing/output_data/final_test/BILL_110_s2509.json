The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance for a working group to study barriers to the use of point-of-use and point-of-entry water treatment systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance for a working group to study barriers to the use of various water treatment options for small water systems. This includes point-of-use and point-of-entry treatment units, package plants, and modular units. A model guidance document will be developed based on recommendations from the working group to assist states in regulating and promoting these treatment options. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance for a working group to study barriers to water treatment options for small systems. This involves developing a model guidance document and providing relevant information to assist states in regulating these treatment options. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include guidance for a working group to study barriers to water treatment options for small systems, including affordability criteria for treatment technologies. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include regulations for municipalities and small public water systems to comply with, giving extra weight to low-income households and communities meeting affordability criteria. The criteria should not be more costly for small public water systems on a per-capita basis. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include regulations for small public water systems to comply with, ensuring affordability for low-income households. Before enforcement, funds must be available to assist systems serving fewer than 10,000 individuals. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to allow small water systems serving fewer than 10,000 individuals to renew exemptions for necessary improvements if they demonstrate efforts to meet requirements. Additionally, Section 1442 is amended to provide research, technical assistance, information, and training for personnel. Section 1442 of the Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to provide various types of assistance for personnel, including research, technical assistance, information, and training. The Administrator shall ensure that small water systems receive technical assistance to comply with Federal drinking water rules, with priority given to systems not in compliance. The Administrator will ensure compliance with Federal drinking water rules for small water systems, prioritizing those not in compliance. This includes rules on disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, arsenic, new source contaminants monitoring, stage 2 disinfectants, and ground water. The Administrator will establish a research pilot program to explore new technologies for small water systems to comply with drinking water standards. The Administrator will establish an application process to select 20 communities for a program funding projects on new technologies for Federal drinking water standards, coordinating with the Arsenic Water Technology Partnership program. The Administrator will conduct a pilot program on technology transfer and disinfection strategies for drinking water, including risks of using chloramines. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008-2012, with restrictions on the use of funds for lobbying expenses. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a panel of experts to study contaminants and report findings.

The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a panel of experts to study contaminants. The panel will consist of up to 6 members appointed based on specific recommendations. The panel's duties include reviewing studies on the health effects of exposure to arsenic and disinfection byproducts, and submitting a report to the Senate and House committees within 180 days. The panel of experts will assess recent scientific findings on health effects of exposure to specified substances, comparing studies conducted after establishing contaminant levels under the Safe Drinking Water Act."
