    "content": "The Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (DPA), grants the President broad authorities to ensure domestic industry can meet national defense needs. Congress recognizes the importance of the domestic industrial base in supplying materials for defense and responding to disasters or conflicts. The DPA allows the President to prioritize contracts, offer incentives for critical materials production, and has been reauthorized over 50 times since 1950. Most DPA authorities will expire on September 30, 2014, unless reauthorized. The report examines the history and authorities of the Defense Production Act (DPA), focusing on its creation, recent reauthorization, and changes in authorities. It also discusses relevant delegations of the President's DPA authorities and tracks legislation in Congress to reauthorize the DPA. H.R. 4809, reported out of the Committee on Financial Services in the House of Representatives on June 11, 2014, aims to reauthorize the Defense Production Act (DPA) for five years and reform other provisions. The DPA, inspired by wartime powers acts, grants broad executive authority for regulating industry in the interest of national defense. Congressional considerations include expanding, restricting, or modifying DPA authorities. President Truman proposed legislation for stronger executive authority in national defense due to factors like demobilization after WWII, reduced military expenditures, reliance on atomic weapons, economic turmoil, and the need for reduced defense appropriations. The economic turmoil post-WWII led to labor strikes, including a nationwide rail shutdown in 1946. President Truman threatened to seize control of railways and draft striking workers into the military. This context set the stage for the Korean War and the enactment of the Defense Production Act in 1950, granting the President broad authority over national economic policy. The Defense Production Act of 1950 granted the government authority over defense production, rationing consumer goods, fixing wage and price ceilings, settling labor disputes, controlling credit, and establishing antitrust protections. Titles related to requisitioning, rationing, wage and price fixing, labor disputes, and credit controls terminated in 1953. The DPA currently falls under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Prior to 1975, House rules did not allow bills to be referred to multiple committees simultaneously. The Defense Production Act of 1950 was initially assigned to the House and Senate Committees on Banking and Currency due to its focus on economic policy. Although certain provisions of the act are no longer in effect, these committees still have jurisdiction. Additionally, a Joint Committee on Defense Production was established by the original statute. The Joint Committee on Defense Production, composed of selected members from the standing Committees on Banking and Currency of the Senate and House, was intended to review programs established by the Defense Production Act (DPA) and advise on legislation. The committee ceased to exist in 1977, with the DPA being amended and reauthorized multiple times since its enactment. Notably, Titles II, IV, V, and VI of the DPA expired in 1953, while Titles I, III, and VII were reauthorized through P.L. 85-95. The Defense Production Act (DPA) has been reauthorized 51 times since its passage in 1950, often through short-term extensions. In some cases, the DPA has expired without immediate reauthorization, but Congress has retroactively set the effective date for the law. Most recently, the DPA was reauthorized by the 111th Congress. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was reauthorized by the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in the 111th Congress with the introduction of S. 1677 on September 16, 2009. The bill passed both chambers of Congress by September 23, 2009, and was signed into law as P.L. 111-67 on September 30, 2009. The reauthorization extended most DPA authorities until September 30, 2014, after which they would be terminated unless reauthorized. For more details on the potential termination of DPA authorities after September 30, 2014, refer to the \"Reauthorization of the DPA in the 113th Congress\" section in this report. The DPA authorities are delegated to Cabinet officials or other U.S. government offices in E.O. 13603. The report highlights changes in authorities from the Defense Production Act Reauthorization of 2009. It does not cover all DPA authorities but focuses on key changes in E.O. 13603 and the Reauthorization of 2009. The DPA gives the President various authorities to shape national defense preparedness programs and enhance the domestic industrial base. The Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities are tied to the definition of national defense, requiring any major DPA authority to promote, support, or be essential for national defense. National defense includes military and energy programs, critical infrastructure assistance to foreign nations, homeland security, stockpiling, space activities, and emergency preparedness. Emergency preparedness activities are defined in Title VI of The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities extend beyond military preparedness to include enhancing domestic preparedness, response, and recovery from hazards and national emergencies. The DPA defines national defense as operations of armed forces, Atomic Energy Commission, or other agencies concerned with national defense. The Defense Production Act (DPA) has seen expansions in the definition of national defense over the years, including critical infrastructure assistance to foreign nations and homeland security. In 2009, Congress amended the declaration of policy to explicitly include natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and renewable energy technologies like biomass and efficient energy storage. The Defense Production Act (DPA) was expanded in 2009 to include renewable energy technologies like biomass and efficient energy storage to enhance domestic energy supplies for the maintenance of the industrial base. The Reauthorization of 2009 also made changes to various clauses in the DPA. Section 101(a) of Title I authorizes the President to prioritize contracts necessary for national defense and allocate materials, services, and facilities as needed. The Defense Production Act (DPA) allows the federal government to prioritize contracts for critical materials, equipment, and services in the interest of national defense. Individuals and corporations are required to accept prioritized contracts/orders, with limited exemptions. Contractors are not liable for actions taken to comply with DPA regulations. The government can prioritize contracts between private parties to fulfill national defense needs. The President has authority to allocate materials, services, and facilities, historically used during World War II. Currently, this authority is only implemented for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program allows the DOD to use civilian aircraft for airlift during national defense crises. There are restrictions on priorities and allocation authority, such as not being used for employment contracts or wage/price controls. Private persons can only assist in chemical/biological weapons production with authorization. Title I priorities can only be used to promote national defense, further constrained by E.O. 13603 to support necessary defense programs determined in writing by specific cabinet secretaries. The delegation of priorities and allocation authority under E.O. 13603 allows certain Cabinet Secretaries to use their expertise in resource sectors for national defense purposes. This delegation remains consistent with previous executive orders, with slight changes in the definitions of assigned resource areas. Table A-3 in the Appendix provides a summary of this delegation. In 2009, Congress added a rulemaking requirement to the statutory language providing Section 101(a) priorities and allocation authority. Cabinet Secretaries delegated this authority were mandated to establish standards and procedures within 270 days of the bill enactment. As of June 10, 2014, three departments had issued final rules. The Department of Commerce's rule has been periodically updated to align with evolving practices and the DPA statute. The Department of Commerce's rule establishing the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) has been in place since 1984 and is being updated to align with the Reauthorization of 2009. The Department of Agriculture has also issued a proposed rule, while the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services have not released rules yet. The DOD routinely prioritizes contracts, assigning DPA priority to over 300,000 contracts annually. The DOD's use of Title I priorities authority includes supporting projects like the Integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System and MRAP Vehicles. Other agencies have used this authority for terrorism prevention and disaster preparedness. Title I also includes provisions related to domestic energy allocation and prioritization by the President. Section 101(c) of the DPA authorizes the President to prioritize contracts for materials, equipment, and services to maximize domestic energy supplies. This authority was used to ensure emergency natural gas supplies to California utilities in 2001. Section 105 restricts rationing gasoline without Congress approval. Energy is designated as a strategic material, allowing other DPA authorities to be used for energy-related policy decisions. The DPA did not grant new energy production authority before the 2009 Reauthorization. The DPA authorizes the President to engage in energy production, with restrictions on synthetic fuel production being repealed in the 2009 Reauthorization. Title III authorities ensure a sufficient supply of essential materials for national defense. Title III authorities under the DPA allow the President to provide financial incentives to enhance domestic production capacity for critical components and technology items essential for national defense. These authorities ensure availability of necessary materials and resources during peacetime, mobilization, and national emergencies. The 2009 Reauthorization updated the language of Title III while maintaining its core purpose. The 2009 Reauthorization updated the language of Title III under the DPA to comply with modern legislative style. Sections 301 and 302 authorize the President to issue loan guarantees and direct loans to address shortages of industrial resources, critical technology items, or essential materials for national defense. Loan guarantees and direct loans can be provided to private businesses to support production and services vital to national defense. The 2009 Reauthorization updated Sections 301 and 302 of the DPA to comply with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, increasing restrictions on the President's authority to provide loans and loan guarantees for national defense purposes. Senator Christopher J. Dodd sponsored the bill to ensure compliance with modern legislative style. The 2009 Reauthorization updated the DPA to increase restrictions on the President's authority to provide loans and loan guarantees for national defense purposes. The President can waive restrictions during national emergencies, but must meet conditions for issuance, including cost-effectiveness. The Reauthorization of 2009 updated the DPA by removing the requirement for the President to determine insufficient supply before issuing a loan guarantee or direct loan. Instead, the President must now ensure there is \"reasonable assurance\" of repayment. Section 303 of Title III grants the President authorities to support domestic industrial base capabilities essential to national defense. Section 303 of Title III grants the President authorities to support, expand, or restore domestic industrial base capabilities essential to national defense by providing incentives for domestic private industry to produce critical goods necessary for national defense. These authorities include purchasing industrial resources, making subsidized payments for domestically produced materials, and installing equipment for industrial facilities to expand productive capacity. The President must determine a \"domestic industrial base shortfall\" before using these authorities. The President is granted authorities under Section 303 of Title III to address domestic industrial base capabilities essential for national defense. This includes determining a \"domestic industrial base shortfall\" and taking actions to remedy the shortfall. The President must notify relevant committees if the cost exceeds $50 million, but can waive provisions in emergencies. The President may take various actions to meet national defense needs as outlined in the Defense Production Act. In the Reauthorization of 2009, Congress clarified and expanded the President's authority under Section 303 of Title III to address domestic industrial base capabilities for national defense. This included creating, maintaining, protecting, expanding, or restarting domestic industrial base capabilities, developing production capabilities, and increasing the use of emerging technologies in security program applications. Additionally, the President was authorized to enhance productive capacity by procuring and installing manufacturing equipment in government and privately owned industrial facilities. In the Reauthorization of 2009, the President's authority under Section 303 was expanded to modify or expand privately owned industrial facilities and sell equipment to them. Owners receiving equipment must indemnify the government from liability claims. The use of Section 303 authorities requires a determination of a domestic industrial base shortfall. The President's authority under Section 303 was expanded in the 2009 reauthorization to include modifying or expanding privately owned industrial facilities and selling equipment to them. This requires a determination of a domestic industrial base shortfall before taking action. The conditions for the President's determination were previously more stringent but were removed in the 2009 reauthorization. In 2009, the President's authority under Section 303 of the DPA was expanded to allow actions exceeding $50 million without specific authorization by law. E.O. 13603 delegates procurement authorities to agencies for national defense, excluding the authority to promote exploration and mining of strategic materials. The President's authority under the Defense Production Act (DPA) allows for exploration, development, and mining of strategic materials. E.O. 13603 delegates procurement authorities to agencies for national defense, with a focus on Title III projects. Loan authorities in Title III have not been used in over 30 years. Title III of the DPA focuses on research and procurement projects to maintain U.S. technological leadership in critical markets. It establishes a Defense Production Act Fund for funding these projects and collecting proceeds from DPA activities. The Defense Production Act Fund collects proceeds from DPA activities and has a maximum balance of $750 million. The Reauthorization of 2009 increased the allowable annual balance from $400 million to $750 million. Appropriations to the DPA Fund have mainly come from the Department of Defense, with the Department of Energy authorized in FY2014. In FY2014, the Department of Energy authorized a transfer of up to $45 million to the DPA Fund. The President must designate a \"Fund manager\" for accounting functions, with the Secretary of Defense delegated this role. The Fund Manager is responsible for financial accounting but not decision-making. Title VII of the DPA clarifies authorities and presidential powers, with changes under the Reauthorization of 2009. The DPA provisions regarding special preference for small businesses and definitions have remained unchanged under the Reauthorization of 2009 and E.O. 13603. The Reauthorization of 2009 and E.O. 13603 added and edited definitions related to national defense and homeland security. The President may obtain information from private industries under Section 705 of the DPA to utilize DPA authorities effectively. The President, under Section 705 of the DPA, can obtain necessary information for enforcement or administration of the Act. This authority is delegated to the Secretary of Commerce in E.O. 13603 and is commonly used for industrial base assessments to monitor manufacturing capabilities. Regulations ensure the authority is used with defined scope and purpose. The President, under Section 705 of the DPA, can obtain necessary information for enforcement or administration of the Act. This authority is delegated to the Secretary of Commerce in E.O. 13603 and is commonly used for industrial base assessments to monitor manufacturing capabilities. Regulations ensure the authority is used with defined scope and purpose. However, no regulation has been issued by the executive branch for voluntary agreements between private industry interests. Title VII of the DPA authorizes the President to consult with various representatives to make voluntary agreements and plans of action for national defense, but only if a direct threat to national defense is determined. The President or appropriate delegate may approve and commence voluntary agreements for national defense after consultation. Parties are given legal defense if actions within the agreement violate laws. The Maritime Administration manages Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement and Voluntary Tanker Agreement. The Voluntary Tanker Agreement, also known as \"VISA,\" is established to ensure the maritime industry can meet Department of Defense mobilization needs. In 2009, changes were made to allow finalization without consultation in certain circumstances and extended the agreement term from two to five years. The Voluntary Tanker Agreement, also known as \"VISA,\" was extended from two to five years in 2009 to meet Department of Defense mobilization needs. E.O. 13603 includes a requirement for the Department of Homeland Security to issue regulations on voluntary agreements. The National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER) is a pool of industry executives and experts who can be called upon for executive positions in the federal government during emergencies. The National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER) is a pool of industry executives and experts who can be called upon for executive positions in the federal government during emergencies. The Reauthorization of 2009 amended the statute by removing a clause that allowed the President to grant exemptions to criminal statutes for NDER participants. NDER units may be activated only in emergencies declared by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department of Defense appropriations bill provides regular annual funding for the Defense Production Act (DPA) purposes. The Defense Production Act (DPA) is funded through the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with appropriations also possible in other bills. The Reauthorization of 2009 removed a separate provision for Title III appropriations. The President has authority under Title VII to review corporate mergers for national security impact and can suspend or prohibit transactions. This includes the Exon-Florio Amendment, which involves the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury is designated as the entity through which the President acts on national security impact of corporate mergers. Examples include ordering divestment in 1990 and approving acquisitions in 2005. The Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC) advises the President on the effective use of DPA authorities. The Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC) was created to advise the President on the effective use of DPA authorities. It consists of the heads of federal agencies with DPA authorities and the Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors. The President appoints a Chairperson and an Executive Director to support them as needed. The DPAC was established to advise the President on DPA authorities. It includes agency heads and the Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisors. An Executive Director supports the Chairperson. The DPAC's main duty is to provide an annual report on DPA use and recommendations for improvement. Reports are submitted to specific congressional committees. The latest available report was for the calendar year 2012. In defense trade, industrial compensation includes co-production, licensed production, technology transfer, and foreign investment. The Secretary of Commerce must report annually on the impact of offsets on defense preparedness, industrial competitiveness, employment, and trade. The reporting provision was moved to Title VII from Title III in the Reauthorization of 2009. The reporting provision in the Defense Production Act (DPA) was moved to Title VII from Title III. DPA authorities are set to terminate on September 30, 2014, except for four exempt sections: prohibiting wage or price controls, granting limited immunity from liability, establishing voluntary agreements, and giving review authority to the President and CFIUS. The Defense Production Act (DPA) includes the Exon-Florio Amendment, giving the President and CFIUS review authority over certain corporate acquisitions. Even if the DPA is not reauthorized, contracts or projects created under DPA authority before September 30, 2014, will still be executed. The authority to investigate and collect information under the DPA will not expire until two years after its termination. If the Defense Production Act (DPA) were to expire, other authorized authorities like Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 could partially substitute for the DPA's priorities and allocations authority. However, the Selective Service Act authority is more limited as it only applies to orders for materials for the armed forces or atomic energy programs and does not offer liability protection for recipients of prioritized orders. The Defense Production Act (DPA) can be reauthorized by Congress through extending termination dates without significant amendments. Reauthorizations are typically presented as discrete bills or included in larger legislative vehicles like the National Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Production Act (DPA) can be reauthorized by Congress through extending termination dates without significant amendments, typically through discrete bills or larger legislative vehicles like the National Defense Authorization Act. Appropriating funds for DPA activities can implicitly extend the termination clause, avoiding a situation where funds are allocated for unfulfillable purposes. The Defense Production Act (DPA) can be reauthorized by Congress through extending termination dates without significant amendments, typically through discrete bills or larger legislative vehicles like the National Defense Authorization Act. Appropriating funds for DPA activities can implicitly extend the termination clause to avoid allocating funds for unfulfillable purposes. This rationale is strongest when funding would not become available until after the termination date has passed. A continuing resolution would be available at the beginning of FY2015 after the DPA provisions sunset at the end of FY2014. Appropriations for DPA activities in preceding fiscal years are typically \"available until expended,\" theoretically extending beyond the termination date. However, GAO has stated that no new obligations may be incurred after the termination date, even if funds remain from an appropriation made available prior to the termination date. H.R. 4809 passed the House on July 29, 2014, reauthorizing the DPA. The bill H.R. 4809, passed on July 29, 2014, would reauthorize the Defense Production Act (DPA) provisions for five years. It includes reforms to the Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC), redirecting its focus to coordination and planning for Title I priorities and allocations authority within the executive branch. This change may lead to the abolishment of certain industrial capability assessment study groups. The bill H.R. 4809 would reauthorize the Defense Production Act provisions for five years, with reforms to the Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC). It would supersede the rotating chair system for DPAC, appointing the head of the agency responsible for government-wide coordination as chair. The chair would appoint a coordinator for committee activities and revise annual reporting requirements. Section 2 of the bill revises annual reporting requirements for the DPAC to focus on Title I priority and allocation authority, including updated copies of related rules. Section 3 emphasizes the need for delegated agencies with Title I authority to issue and review final rules annually. As of June 10, 2014, only three out of six departments delegated Title I authority had issued final rules. Section 4 of the bill would amend the DPA's Title III, Section 303 authority, requiring the President to provide written explanations on actions taken under this section. Section 4(a) of the bill would reinstitute provisions removed in 2009, requiring the President to provide written explanations on actions taken under Section 303 of the DPA. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics has been responsible for making determinations related to national defense and commercial production. The President must also determine that actions taken are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical. The bill would reinstitute a provision requiring actions exceeding $50 million to address manufacturing capacity or supply shortfall to be authorized by Congress. It would also retroactively exempt existing Title III projects. Section 4(b) of the bill would retroactively exempt existing Title III projects from new requirements, potentially limiting Congress's authority over new projects exceeding $50 million. The President could still waive these requirements in emergencies. The bill aims to authorize $133 million per fiscal year for the Defense Production Act, replacing the previous \"such sums as necessary\" authorization. Past appropriations to the DPA Fund ranged from $34.3 million to $223.5 million annually between FY2010 and FY2014. Congress has the option to amend the DPA to modify the President's powers granted under the act. Congress has the option to extend, expand, restrict, or clarify the President's powers granted in the Defense Production Act (DPA). This could involve eliminating certain authorities, adding new ones for national defense threats, and amending the \"Declaration of Policy\" to specify when DPA authorities are appropriate for use. The Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities are appropriate for use by the President, but changes to the Declaration of Policy may not fully empower or restrict these authorities without amending other provisions of the DPA. Congress could clarify the purpose of DPA authorities through a resolution, such as H.Con.Res. 110 in the 112th Congress, which states that the DPA should not be used to confiscate property, conscript individuals into the Armed Forces, force labor without compensation, or compel businesses to give up goods or services without compensation. However, such resolutions do not have the force of law. Congress may consider amending key terms in the Defense Production Act (DPA) to shape the scope and use of authorities. For example, amending the definition of national defense could limit the President's use of DPA for space-related projects or expand it to include counter-narcotics, cybersecurity, or organized crime. Congress could also adjust appropriations to the DPA Fund to manage Title III projects initiated by the President. Adjusting appropriations to the DPA Fund may not impact the President's authority under other titles of the DPA unless Congress specifically changes the Fund's nature. Congress could consider reintroducing a provision for certain appropriation amounts for Title III or other DPA authorities. They may also want to direct funds for specific purposes, like advanced biofuels. Congress may be satisfied with the current use of DPA authorities but could add more notification requirements. Congress may wish to add more extensive notification and reporting requirements on the use of all or specific authorities in the DPA. This could involve formal notification of Congress prior to or after the use of certain authorities in certain circumstances, such as notifying Congress when priorities and allocations authority is used on a contract over a certain dollar amount. Congress might also consider expanding reporting requirements of the Defense Production Act Committee (DPAC) to include semi-annual updates on recent use of authorities. The DPAC has failed to regularly submit an annual report on time, limiting Congress's oversight of the DPA. Congress may consider expanding notification and reporting requirements for the Defense Production Act (DPA), including notifying Congress before or after using certain authorities. They may also review compliance with existing rulemaking requirements and potentially expand them for other authorities in the DPA. Additionally, Congress could reestablish a select committee similar to the Joint Committee on Defense Production to enhance oversight. Congress may consider expanding and limiting the use of certain Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities, potentially assigning specific authorities to individual Cabinet Secretaries instead of the President. This could be done by amending the President's delegation of DPA authorities and ensuring that certain authorities are not delegated beyond the person identified in the statute. Congress may determine that the use of some authorities by certain agencies is necessary for national defense, while not for others. There are government resources available that discuss various aspects of the Defense Production Act in depth, which may be of interest to Congress. Table A-1 lists some of these resources."
