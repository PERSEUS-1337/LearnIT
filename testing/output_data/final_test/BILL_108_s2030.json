    "content": "Dependent Care Tax Credit: Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on Dependent Care Services. The Dependent Care Tax Credit allows individuals with qualifying household members to claim a credit for employment-related and respite care expenses paid during the taxable year. The applicable percentage is defined as 50 percent reduced by 1 percentage point for each full $1,000 amount by which the expenses exceed a certain threshold. The Dependent Care Tax Credit applies a reduction of 1 percentage point for each full $1,000 increase in adjusted gross income over $15,000. Adjustments for cost-of-living are made for taxable years after 2004. The Dependent Care Tax Credit increases are rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 or the next highest multiple of $10 if the increase is a multiple of $5. Employment-related expenses include household services and care for a qualifying individual to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed. The Dependent Care Tax Credit increases are rounded to the nearest multiple of $10 or the next highest multiple of $10 if the increase is a multiple of $5. Employment-related expenses for care outside the taxpayer's household are only considered for qualifying individuals spending at least 8 hours daily in the household. For the Dependent Care Tax Credit, expenses for care outside the taxpayer's household are eligible if the individual spends at least 8 hours daily in the household. Dependent care centers must comply with state laws and regulations to qualify. The Dependent Care Tax Credit applies to facilities caring for more than 6 individuals, receiving payment for services provided. The maximum amount of eligible expenses is $3,000 for one qualifying individual per taxable year. The Dependent Care Tax Credit allows for a maximum of $6,000 in eligible expenses for one qualifying individual, or $6,000 for 2 or more qualifying individuals. This amount is reduced by any excludable income under section 129. Additionally, the limit is further reduced by respite care expenses. There is an earned income limitation for the credit. The earned income limitation for the Dependent Care Tax Credit states that the employment-related expenses incurred in a taxable year cannot exceed the individual's earned income for the year if unmarried, or the lesser of the individual's earned income or their spouse's earned income if married. There is a special rule for a spouse who is a student or incapable of caring for themselves. For the Dependent Care Tax Credit, a spouse who is a full-time student or a qualifying individual is deemed gainfully employed with a minimum income requirement of $250 or $500 per month. The respite care expenses definition is provided for tax purposes. The term 'respite care expenses' refers to payments made for the care of a qualifying individual who is unable to care for themselves, either due to age or a physical/mental impairment, and spends at least 8 hours daily in the taxpayer's household. Additionally, it includes care for the same individual for up to 14 days a year. The term 'respite care expenses' cover payments for the care of a dependent under 13 years old, who the taxpayer can claim a deduction for, and who spends at least 8 hours daily in the taxpayer's household. The maximum deductible amount is $1,200 for one qualifying individual or $2,400 for two or more individuals in a taxable year. The tax credit for maintaining a household is available for a dependent who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care, or the taxpayer's spouse in a similar situation. Special rules apply, such as the requirement for married couples to file a joint return to claim the credit. The tax credit for maintaining a household is available for a dependent who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care, or the taxpayer's spouse in a similar situation. An individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married. Certain married individuals living apart may qualify for the credit if they meet specific criteria. If an individual's spouse is not a member of the household during the last 6 months of the taxable year, they shall not be considered as married. In the case of divorced parents, a child under 13 or incapable of self-care is treated as a qualifying individual with the custodial parent for tax purposes. Payments to related individuals are not eligible for tax credit if they are a dependent of the taxpayer or their spouse, or if they are the taxpayer's child under 19 years old. The term \"student\" refers to an individual pursuing education. The term \"student\" is defined as an individual who is a full-time student at an educational organization for 5 calendar months during the taxable year. An \"educational organization\" is described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). To claim a credit, identifying information of the service provider must be included on the return. The taxpayer must include the name, address, and TIN of the qualifying individual on the return to claim the credit. Failure to provide this information can be excused if due diligence was exercised. The Secretary will establish regulations to implement this section. Section 23(f)(1), 35(g)(6), and 129(a)(2)(C) of the Code are amended to replace \"section 21(e)\" with \"section 36(e)\". Section 129(b)(2) is amended to replace \"section 21(d)(2)\" with \"section 36(b)(3)(B)\". Section 129(e)(1) is amended to replace references to section 21 with section 36. Section 213(e) is amended to replace \"section 21\" with \"section 36\". Section 6213(g)(2)(H) is amended to remove references to section 21. Section 21 is being replaced with section 36 in various sections of the Code, including amendments to the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments replace section 21 with section 36 in the table of sections for subpart A of part IV, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
