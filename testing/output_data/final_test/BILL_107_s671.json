The \"Andrew Carnegie Libraries for Lifelong Learning Act\" authorizes grants to states for public library construction and technology enhancement, including new buildings, expansion, remodeling, equipment acquisition, and installation. The term \"remodeling\" in the context includes architect fees, land acquisition costs, meeting accessibility standards under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, ensuring safe working environments, conserving energy, and renovation. The term 'equipment' includes information and building technologies, video and telecommunications equipment, machinery, utilities, and necessary enclosures. Public library refers to a facility for providing library services. \"A public library serves residents of a community, district, or region free of charge and receives financial support from public funds. It also includes a research library with extensive collections for scholarly research.\" The curr_chunk discusses the dissemination of humanistic knowledge through various services and activities by organizations not affiliated with higher education institutions. It also defines technology enhancement as the acquisition and maintenance of technological equipment for accessing information in electronic formats. The provisions of this subtitle do not apply to this chapter, except as provided in section 243. \"SEC. 242. USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS.\" The State receiving a grant must use the funds to cover half the cost of construction or technology enhancement for public libraries. The remaining cost can be covered by State, local, or private sources. The United States can recover funds if necessary. The United States can recover grant funds if a public library facility ceases to be used as a library within 20 years of completion, or if the recipient ceases to be a public or nonprofit institution. The amount to be recovered is based on the value of the facility. The value of a facility can be determined by the parties involved or through legal action in the United States district court. SEC. 243. STATE PLAN. State library administrative agencies without an approved plan must submit a 5-year State plan for public library construction or technology enhancement activities to be eligible for grants under this chapter. The plan must include assurances of implementation. Each State library administrative agency must make their State plan public. The Director will approve plans that meet requirements and offer assistance for revisions if needed. The State library administrative agency must submit an amendment to their State plan for public library construction or technology enhancement activities to be assisted under this chapter. Authorization of appropriations of $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and the following 4 years is provided under this chapter."
