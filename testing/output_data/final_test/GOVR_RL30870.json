    "content": "In Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, the Supreme Court ruled against sampling in the census for House of Representatives apportionment. The decision did not address the constitutionality of sampling or prohibit it for other purposes. Opponents planned to improve traditional headcount methods, while proponents, like the Clinton Administration, highlighted the decision's limitations. The Supreme Court ruled against sampling in the census for House of Representatives apportionment, but did not prohibit it for other purposes like intrastate redistricting and federal funding allocations. The Federal Constitution does not mandate the use of federal decennial census data for intrastate congressional and state legislative redistricting. The Federal Constitution does not require states to use federal census data for redistricting. In a 1969 Supreme Court case, it was noted that projected population figures could be considered if accurate, although decennial census data is considered the best available. In Senate of the State of California v. Mosbacher, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that states can use non-census data for redistricting if census data is inadequate. The court also ruled that the Secretary of Commerce is not obligated to provide adjusted census data. However, in Assembly of the State of California v. U.S. Department of Commerce, the court ordered the release of adjusted 1990 census data under the Freedom of Information Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that states are not required to use official census data for redistricting, and can use adjusted population figures as long as the adjustment is well-documented and systematic. In various cases, courts have addressed the release of adjusted census data under the Freedom of Information Act. In City of Detroit v. Franklin, the city argued that the apportionment clause requires states to use only official census data for redistricting, citing Karcher v. Daggett. The District Court held that this argument was based on a misinterpretation of Karcher. The court in City of Detroit clarified that states are required to use the best available census or population data for redistricting, based on well-established constitutional law. Plaintiff states sued to obtain adjusted census data for redistricting, while federal courts have addressed cases where states did not use federal census data for redistricting. The Supreme Court has ruled that states are not required to use federal census data for redistricting activities, as seen in cases like Kirkpatrick and Burns v. Richardson. The Court has left open the question of what population basis is appropriate for redistricting, recognizing that total population may not always be the best measure. In the Burns case, Hawaii used registered voters as the basis for redistricting the state senate, as the Court recognized that total population might not always be suitable. Hawaii's unique situation with a significant transient population distorted the distribution of legislators, making a registered voter basis the closest approximation of state citizens. The Court in the Burns case allowed Hawaii to use registered voters as the basis for redistricting the state senate, as it was deemed consistent with the Equal Protection Clause. However, the ruling did not establish the validity of this unique population basis for all circumstances. States can use alternate data for redistricting if shown to be the best available or justified by specific circumstances. Most states do not have a statutory procedure for congressional redistricting, allowing state legislatures to decide on an ad hoc basis after a federal decennial census. If a state's laws do not explicitly require the use of official federal decennial census data for redistricting, they are free to use other data. The state can use other data for intrastate redistricting if its laws do not mandate the use of official federal decennial census data. If the Federal Government releases two official sets of data, it is unclear what reference to official federal decennial census data would mean. The Court's holding indicates that official federal decennial census data refers to apportionment data. In the aftermath of the Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives decision, states have been active in determining the type of federal decennial census data to be used for intrastate redistricting. Some states have enacted legislation requiring unadjusted data for redistricting purposes. Several states, including Colorado, Kansas, and Virginia, have passed laws mandating the use of unadjusted federal census data for redistricting. Most states have issued resolutions opposing the use of adjusted data for redistricting and urging the Census Bureau to conduct the census without sampling. Some states have also called on Congress to ensure a fair and legal census. States have resolutions urging the Federal Government to use modern, scientific techniques like sampling for redistricting data. Sixteen states are considered \"covered jurisdictions\" under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, including Alaska, Arizona, and Virginia, which have submitted their laws for preclearance. In 1999, Virginia submitted its law for preclearance to the District Court in 2000. The DOJ has sixty days to respond to a submission, and further requests for information do not restart the clock. If no response is received within sixty days, the law is considered precleared. If the DOJ objects to preclearance due to negative impacts on voting rights, the decision is unreviewable, but a declaratory judgment can be sought from the District Court. This does not preclude litigation challenging the constitutionality of the law. The preclearance process for three states was delayed until the release of the 2000 census redistricting data. DOJ requested more information from Alaska and Arizona but did not issue a decision. Arizona withdrew its law from preclearance process in February 2000, while DOJ informed Alaska that it could not evaluate the statute until redistricting data was released. In Virginia v. Reno, Virginia claimed that its new redistricting law did not require preclearance as it continued the status quo and did not abridge minority voting rights. A three-judge panel dismissed the claims as not ripe for review. The court ruled that the claims in Virginia v. Reno were not ripe for review as no final Administrative decision had been made regarding the release of adjusted census figures. The release of unadjusted figures would not allow for a proper evaluation of the impact on voting rights. Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans announced the decision to send unadjusted census data to states for redistricting purposes. The District Court ruling on the Virginia statute noted that releasing only unadjusted census figures would not allow for a proper evaluation of the impact on voting rights. The DOJ is likely to grant preclearance to the Alaskan statute, as the officially released data will match the data required by the statute. Proponents of adjustment still seek the release of adjusted data. Proponents of adjustment seek the release of adjusted data for redistricting and federal funding allocation purposes. The ESCAP recommended against adjusting census data due to unresolved discrepancies and time constraints. The Administration must provide census figures for redistricting activities by April 1, 2001. The Clinton Administration announced plans to release both adjusted and unadjusted census figures. Concerns about partisan influence led to the proposal of a rule delegating the decision to adjust census data to senior officials. The Director ultimately decided not to adjust the data by the end of the year. The unadjusted and adjusted census data would be released simultaneously in accordance with P.L. 105-119, \u00a7 209(j), 111 Stat. 2440, 2483 (1997). The final rule, 15 C.F.R. part 101, was issued on October 6, 2000, after considering comments from opponents and proponents of statistical adjustment. A new paragraph was added, 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.1(a)(5), stating that the Secretary of Commerce retains authority to revoke or amend the delegation of authority. On February 16, 2001, Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans announced a new final rule revoking the delegation of authority to make the adjustment decision to the Director of the Census Bureau. This led to a lawsuit filed by the City of Los Angeles and other municipalities, challenging the new rule as inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs challenged a new rule revoking the delegation of authority to the Director of the Census Bureau, alleging it was substantive and could result in a prohibition on adjusted census data release. The defendants argued it was a procedural act, not subject to notice and comment, and that claims of harm were speculative. The federal District Court denied a temporary restraining order to the plaintiffs regarding the release of adjusted census data. The hearing for a preliminary injunction was cancelled following the Acting Census Director's recommendation and the ESCAP report. The lawsuit was deemed moot due to Secretary Evan's decision not to release adjusted data, as the original rule did not require it if ESCAP recommended against it. Los Angeles city officials and statisticians considered the ESCAP report, while the plaintiffs lacked standing to show injury from the Secretary's actions. The City Attorney of Los Angeles announced plans to pursue legal action to obtain adjusted census data by amending the complaint with new allegations. This decision echoes past litigation following the 1990 census, where the Secretary ultimately decided not to adjust the data despite initial challenges. The Secretary's decision not to adjust the 1990 census data was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Wisconsin v. City of New York, as it was deemed consistent with the goal of equal representation. The Court did not find that the use of unadjusted data violated this goal, and did not address whether Congress had limited the Secretary's authority in this matter. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Secretary's decision not to adjust the 1990 census data in Wisconsin v. City of New York, stating it was consistent with the goal of equal representation. The Court did not find that unadjusted data violated this goal or address any limitations on the Secretary's authority by Congress. In Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, it was found that the Secretary must use statistical sampling techniques if feasible for purposes other than apportionment. The issue raised by the City of Los Angeles, regarding the Secretary's refusal to adjust data despite feasibility, remains undecided. The debate over adjustment has shifted to state legislatures and federal courts, with a potential congressional role in the future. Congress could potentially require the Census Bureau to provide adjusted data, similar to the release of unadjusted data mandated under P.L. 105-119. This could be done under Congress's constitutional powers to establish redistricting guidelines, potentially impacting congressional redistricting. The accuracy of different data sets remains a consideration. Congress could potentially require the use of adjusted census data for certain purposes, as proposed in H.R. 941 by Representative James Clyburn. This would not apply to congressional redistricting but could impact the administration of laws determining benefits for state or local governments. Utah filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Commerce regarding this issue. Utah filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Commerce alleging exclusion of overseas missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints in violation of various constitutional clauses and acts. District Court denied request for a three-judge panel, delaying the suit's resolution. The challenge to a redistricting statute in Utah has caused delays in reaching a final resolution, as decisions now have to be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit before potentially going to the U.S. Supreme Court. The House has postponed certifying a disputed seat until after a District Court decision on March 20. North Carolina and the Federal Government are opposing Utah's lawsuit. The Franklin v. Massachusetts case is relevant to census methodology, where the Supreme Court upheld the inclusion of overseas federal employees in census data for House of Representatives apportionment, resulting in Massachusetts losing a congressional seat. The Supreme Court's decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts upheld the inclusion of overseas federal employees in census data for House of Representatives apportionment, leading to Massachusetts losing a congressional seat. The Court found that the allocation of overseas federal employees to their home states was consistent with the \"usual residence standard\" of other censuses and promoted equal representation. The issue of distinguishing between overseas federal employees and other expatriate U.S. citizens was not addressed by the Court, leaving room for Congress to potentially mandate the inclusion of all expatriate U.S. citizens in the decennial census. Representative Maloney introduced a bill, H.R. 680, to fund a special census of expatriates and encourage the Census Bureau to plan for their inclusion in the 2010 census. The 2010 census included overseas federal employees in response to legislative activity in the late 1980s. Various CRS reports addressed issues such as sampling, redistricting, and census coverage adjustments.
