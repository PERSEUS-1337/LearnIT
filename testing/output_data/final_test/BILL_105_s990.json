    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging Establishment Act\" and establishes the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging under the Public Health Service Act. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging (referred to as the Institute) conducts research, training, and dissemination of health information related to biomedical imaging. The Director establishes a National Biomedical Imaging Program to support research into new techniques and devices. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging conducts research on new techniques and devices in physics, computer science, and other disciplines. This includes technology assessments, screening for diseases, advancing existing modalities, and developing image-enhancing agents and contrast media. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging conducts research on new techniques and devices in physics, computer science, and other disciplines, including the development of image-enhancing agents, advanced technologies for molecular imaging, new techniques for imaging-guided surgery, and research into technologies to enhance picture archiving systems and telemedicine. The Director of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging is required to create a plan with recommendations for consolidating NIH programs related to biomedical imaging and establishing a center for this purpose. The plan will be periodically reviewed and revised, with updates transmitted to the Secretary and the Director of NIH. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging is mandated to establish a center to coordinate imaging research activities supported by Federal agencies and facilitate technology transfer. An advisory council with 12 members, including scientists and health professionals in biomedical imaging disciplines, will be established under section 406 of the Institute. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging will establish an advisory council with 12 members, including scientists and health professionals knowledgeable about biomedical imaging applications in medicine. Ex officio members will include the Directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Authorization of appropriations is subject to annual budget allocations. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging will establish an advisory council with 12 members, including scientists and health professionals. Authorization of appropriations for biomedical imaging research is outlined for fiscal years 1996, 1998, and 1999, with adjustments for inflation. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging can utilize existing resources from the National Institutes of Health for personnel, facilities, and administrative support. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging can utilize existing resources from the National Institutes of Health for personnel, facilities, and administrative support. The Act does not authorize the construction of facilities for the Institute, and an advisory council must be established within 90 days of the Act's effective date. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging is added to the Public Health Service Act. This Act will be effective on October 1, 1997, or upon its enactment, whichever is later."
