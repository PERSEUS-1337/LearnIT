    "content": "The federal crop insurance program, authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency. It protects crop producers from risks like adverse weather, plant diseases, insect infestations, and price declines. Insurance is available for major and specialty crops, as well as forage and pastureland. Policies must be purchased by a deadline, usually before planting season, and options for revenue and profit margin protection are offered. The program dates back to the 1930s. The federal crop insurance program, established in the 1930s, underwent legislative reforms in 1980, 1994, and 2000. The Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 increased federal spending for the program through premium subsidies to enhance farmer participation levels. Producers select crop yield and price coverage levels, paying a premium that increases with higher coverage. Catastrophic (CAT) coverage is fully subsidized by the government, providing a payment equal to 55% of the estimated market price. Producers can receive 50/55 coverage under the federal crop insurance program, with a payment equal to 55% of the estimated market price on crop losses exceeding 50% of normal yield. While CAT coverage is free, producers must pay a $655 administrative fee per covered crop. They can opt for \"buy up\" coverage by paying a premium subsidized by the government to increase coverage levels between 50/100 and 85/100. Additionally, revenue insurance is available for eligible commodities, providing indemnity payments based on actual farm revenue. The annual agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the federal crop insurance program, including indemnity payments, premium subsidies, and expenses. The program offers indemnity payments to farmers when actual farm revenue falls below the target level, regardless of the cause. Insured producers can also receive reduced coverage for late or prevented planting due to flooding. Total program costs vary yearly based on commodity prices, planting decisions, and weather conditions. The federal crop insurance program provides indemnity payments to farmers when farm revenue falls below target levels due to various factors. Premium subsidies average around 63% of total premiums, with the government also subsidizing selling and servicing costs. Producers can apply for the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) for crops ineligible for insurance. NAP is administered by USDA's Farm Service Agency and was first authorized in 1994. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) was authorized in 1994 under the Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act. NAP is funded through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation and covers commercial crops not eligible for federal crop insurance, such as mushrooms, aquaculture, and industrial crops. To receive NAP payments, producers must apply for coverage before the application closing date. The NAP program requires producers to apply before the closing date, pay an administrative fee, and experience a 50% crop loss to be eligible for a payment. They can receive 55% of the market price for losses exceeding the threshold. Additional buy-up coverage is available at varying percentages. Buy-up coverage can be purchased at 50-65% of established yield and 100% of market price. The fee is 5.25% of the coverage level and production value. Grazing land is not eligible. Annual payment limits are $125,000 for catastrophic coverage and $300,000 for buy-up coverage. Producers with AGI over $900,000 are ineligible. Federal costs for NAP were $165 million in FY2014, $125 million in FY2015, $137 million in FY2016, $157 million in FY2017, and $164.3 million in FY2018. Livestock and fruit trees have four authorized disaster assistance programs. Authorized disaster assistance programs for livestock and fruit trees include Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and Tree Assistance Program (TAP). Administered by FSA nationwide, producers can apply at local offices without fees. Mandatory funding via CCC reimburses eligible producers for losses, with total payments varying yearly. In FY2018, LFP payments were $487.5 million, LIP payments were $36.6 million, TAP payments were $11.3 million, and ELAP payments were $47 million, all subject to sequestration. LFP payments per producer are capped at $125,000 annually, while there are no limits for LIP, ELAP, and TAP payments. The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) provides payments to eligible livestock owners and contract growers for livestock deaths caused by adverse weather, disease, or animal attack. Payments may also be made for injured animals sold at a reduced price. Eligibility requires a total AGI not exceeding $900,000 per year. Eligible loss conditions include extreme weather, vector-borne diseases, and attacks by federally protected animals. The Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) provides payments to livestock owners for deaths caused by adverse weather, disease, or animal attack. Eligible livestock include various animals for commercial use, excluding pets and recreational animals. The payment rate is 75% of the average fair market value of the deceased animal type. Livestock Forage Program (LFP) provides payments to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses on drought-affected pastureland or rangeland managed by a federal agency due to a qualifying fire. Eligible producers must own, cash or share lease, or be a contract grower of covered livestock during the 60 calendar days before the beginning date of a qualifying drought or fire. The Livestock Forage Program (LFP) provides payments to eligible livestock producers affected by drought or fire on grazing land. Eligible livestock types include alpacas, beef cattle, buffalo, sheep, and more for commercial use. Payments are based on drought intensity levels and duration of designation as published in the U.S. Drought Monitor. ELAP provides payments to livestock producers for losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, and other conditions not covered by LIP or LFP. It specifically assists with honey bee colony losses due to eligible adverse weather conditions. Livestock losses covered by ELAP include death losses caused by various factors. ELAP covers livestock losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, and other conditions. TAP provides payments to orchardists and nursery tree growers for replanting or rehabilitating trees damaged by natural disasters. Crop production losses are generally covered by federal crop insurance or NAP. Eligible trees, bushes, and vines are those that produce an annual crop for commercial purposes. Nursery trees include ornamental, fruit, nut, and Christmas trees. ELAP covers livestock losses due to disease, adverse weather, feed or water shortages, and other conditions. TAP provides payments to orchardists and nursery tree growers for replanting or rehabilitating trees damaged by natural disasters. Eligible trees, bushes, and vines are those that produce an annual crop for commercial purposes, including ornamental, fruit, nut, and Christmas trees. To be considered an eligible loss, the stand must have sustained a mortality or damage loss exceeding 15% after adjusting for normal mortality or damage. The loss must not have been preventable through reasonable measures. Payment for replacement, replanting, and rehabilitation is calculated as a percentage of the actual cost, with a maximum eligible amount established by FSA. When a county is declared a disaster area, agricultural producers may qualify for low-interest emergency disaster loans through FSA. These loans can help farmers recover from production or physical losses, with funds available for repairing structures, equipment, or replanting crops. Eligible applicants can borrow up to 100% of actual losses, not exceeding $500,000. Emergency disaster loans through FSA are available for agricultural producers in disaster-declared counties. Eligible applicants can borrow up to 100% of actual production or physical losses, not exceeding $500,000. To qualify, producers must meet specific requirements, including experiencing a crop loss of more than 30% or a physical loss of livestock, products, real estate, or property. Additionally, applicants must be unable to obtain credit from a commercial lender but demonstrate the potential to repay the loan. Applications must be submitted within eight months of the disaster designation date, with repayment terms varying based on the purpose of the loan. The EM loan program, authorized by Title III of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, offers repayment terms of up to 20 years for nonreal-estate losses and 40 years for real estate losses. In FY2018, the program received $25.6 million in new loan authority, with unused funds carried over to the next fiscal year. The total loan authority for FY2019 is $99.5 million. Producers with existing direct loans may be eligible for Disaster Set-Aside in counties with disaster designations, allowing for one year's payment to be deferred in case of disaster-related financial difficulties. USDA offers permanent disaster assistance programs to help producers repair damaged land after natural disasters. Programs like the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) provide financial and technical assistance to restore private land. ECP also funds water for livestock and water conserving measures during droughts. EFRP assists private forestland owners with losses from natural disasters. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program, administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and the U.S. Forest Service, helps private forestland owners with losses from natural disasters. It assists in implementing emergency recovery measures for runoff retardation and erosion prevention to protect life and property. The EWP floodplain easement program pays for permanent easements on private land to safeguard against future floods and drought. For more information, refer to CRS Report R42854, Emergency Assistance for Agricultural Land Rehabilitation. The USDA's Section 32 program, funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts, supports various activities including child nutrition programs, commodity purchases for domestic food programs, and farm disaster assistance. The program's authority is derived from the Agricultural Adjustment Act Amendment of 1935. The USDA's Section 32 program, funded by a permanent appropriation of 30% of the previous year's customs receipts, supports various activities including child nutrition programs, commodity purchases for domestic food programs, and farm disaster assistance. The authority to provide disaster assistance is attributed to Section 5 of the act (15 U.S.C. 714c), which authorizes the CCC to support agricultural commodity prices through loans, purchases, payments, and other operations. The FY2019 omnibus limits clause 3 to carryover funding of no more than $350 million following a two-week advance notice to Congress. USDA can use existing programs to help producers recover from natural disasters, such as extending emergency grazing and haying on CRP acres, reducing loan interest rates, and providing conservation assistance for drought areas. Additional funding helps farmers implement conservation practices to conserve water resources and improve livestock access to water. USDA can provide assistance to producers affected by natural disasters by extending emergency grazing and haying on CRP acres, reducing loan interest rates, and offering conservation assistance for drought areas. This includes funding for conservation practices to conserve water resources, address erosion on drought-impacted fields, and improve livestock access to water. Additionally, USDA has the authority to take protective actions under the Animal Health Protection Act to prevent the spread of livestock disease and compensate producers for animals that must be euthanized or destroyed. The 2018 farm bill expanded coverage under federal crop insurance, including for forage, grazing, and hemp. It also authorized catastrophic level coverage for insurance plans covering grazing crops and grasses, allowing producers to purchase separate crop insurance policies for dual-purpose crops. Funding for natural disaster assistance can be provided through annual appropriations or the CCC, with the most recent example being payments to producers during the 2015 and 2016 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the U.S. poultry industry. The 2018 farm bill expanded crop insurance coverage, allowing producers to purchase separate policies for dual-purpose crops. Amendments were made for hemp, including eligibility and post-harvest losses. Administrative fees for catastrophic coverage were increased, and payment calculations were adjusted to consider the producer's share of the crop. Payment limits were set for catastrophic and buy-up coverage, with expanded payments under buy-up coverage. The 2018 farm bill expands buy-up coverage payments to include premium prices like local or organic, makes buy-up coverage permanent, and adds data collection requirements. It also increases payments for livestock losses and expands eligibility for disaster assistance programs. The U.S. farm policy mix provides assistance to agricultural producers for damage and loss following natural disasters, with a shift between permanent and temporary authorized support. Permanent disaster assistance programs were authorized in the 2008 and 2014 farm bills to reduce the need for ad hoc disaster assistance. Congress appropriated little supplemental disaster assistance for agriculture after the 2008 farm bill, but in 2018, supplemental assistance was authorized due to an active hurricane and wildfire season in 2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized $2.36 billion for production losses not covered under NAP or crop insurance. USDA announced the availability of funding through the Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program (WHIP) for crop losses from wildfires or hurricanes in 2017. Payments range from 70% to 95% of the expected crop value for insured producers and 65% for uninsured producers. The USDA announced payments for crop losses due to wildfires or hurricanes in 2017, with payments ranging from 70% to 95% of the expected crop value for insured producers and 65% for uninsured producers. Participants are required to purchase crop insurance or NAP for the next two years, with payments limited to $125,000 or $900,000 depending on the participant's AGI from farming. Additionally, a $340 million block grant was provided to Florida for assisting the citrus industry with tree replacement and grove rehabilitation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 authorized $15 million for pecan orchardists or nursery tree growers for mortality losses in 2017. The act lowers the mortality loss threshold under TAP to cover losses between 7.5% and 15%, with payments proportionally reduced if applications exceed the available funds."
