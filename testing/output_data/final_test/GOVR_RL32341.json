    "content": "During the 1990s, state and local governments faced budget shortfalls, leading to calls for federal financial support for firefighters. While some federal funding existed for training and counterterrorism, there was no dedicated program for direct federal funding to local fire departments. This lack of support was highlighted during the 106th Congress. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) was established to provide federal grants directly to local fire departments and EMS organizations for equipment, training, and other needs. Administered by FEMA, the program also supports fire prevention projects and firefighter health and safety research. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program has been reauthorized three times, with the current reauthorization authorizing the program through FY2023. The program provides federal grants to local fire departments and EMS organizations for equipment, training, and other needs. The 2012 reauthorization of the fire grant program made significant changes in how grant money would be disbursed. The 115th Congress considered reauthorization legislation for the AFG and SAFER programs, leading to the introduction of S. 829 by Senator McCain. The bill was passed by the Senate on August 2, 2017. The Subcommittee on Research and Technology held a hearing on U.S. Fire Administration and Fire Grant Programs Reauthorization. H.R. 4661 was introduced to reauthorize the USFA, AFG, and SAFER programs. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4661, extending the sunset dates to September 30, 2024. The AFG and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017, signed into law as P.L. 115-98, extends authorizations for AFG and SAFER programs through FY2023 and USFA through FY2023. It prioritizes grants for planning, training, and equipment for firefighters responding to crude oil-by-rail and ethanol-by-rail incidents. The AFG and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017, signed into law as P.L. 115-98, extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. It allows for the development of an online training course on AFG and SAFER grant administration. It expands SAFER hiring grant eligibility and directs FEMA to develop a grant monitoring framework to prevent fraud and abuse. Various technical corrections to the AFG and SAFER statute are also included. The fire grant program, in its 19th year, received annual appropriations through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. Tables show funding history for firefighter assistance programs like AFG and SAFER. The Obama Administration requested $335 million for each program in FY2017, a $10 million reduction from the previous year, citing FEMA's successful prior investments. The proposed budget would transfer AFG and SAFER grant accounts to FEMA's broader \"Federal Assistance\" account. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $680 million for firefighter assistance in the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2017. This includes $340 million for AFG and $340 million for SAFER. The committee maintained a separate budget account for Firefighter Assistance and did not transfer it to the Federal Assistance account as proposed in the Administration budget request. Funding applications will continue to be based on local priorities and those established by the USFA, with direct funding to fire departments. The House Appropriations Committee approved $690 million for firefighter assistance in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017. This includes $345 million each for AFG and SAFER. The committee directed FEMA to continue administering the fire grants programs as in previous years and ensure equipment costs are accurately reflected in formulas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated $690 million for firefighter assistance in FY2017, split equally between AFG and SAFER. The funds are available until September 30, FY2018. The firefighter assistance account was moved to FEMA's Federal Assistance account. For FY2018, the Administration requested $688.688 million for firefighter assistance, slightly lower than FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee approved $690 million for firefighter assistance in the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018, with $345 million each for AFG and SAFER. In FY2018, the House passed H.R. 3354, providing $345 million for AFG and $365 million for SAFER. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $700 million for firefighter assistance, split equally between AFG and SAFER, available until September 30, 2019. For FY2019, the Administration requested $688.688 million for firefighter assistance. The Administration requested $688.688 million for firefighter assistance, with $344.344 million for AFG and $344.344 million for SAFER. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees approved bills providing $700 million for firefighter assistance, split between AFG and SAFER. The House committee encouraged FEMA to prioritize grants for planning, training, and equipment for crude oil and ethanol derailment response. The committee encouraged FEMA to prioritize grants for planning, training, and equipment for ethanol-by-rail derailment response. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided $700 million for firefighter assistance in FY2019, split between AFG and SAFER. The Administration requested $688.688 million for firefighter assistance in FY2020, a 1.6% reduction from the FY2019 appropriation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $210 million for firefighter assistance grants to modify, upgrade, or construct state and local nonfederal fire stations. The application period for Assistance to Firefighters Fire Station Construction Grants opened on June 11 and closed on July 10, 2009, with no cost share requirement for grants. Eligible applicants are nonfederal fire departments. The Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (DHS/FEMA) received 6,025 applications for $9.9 billion in federal funds for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Act. As of October 1, 2010, 119 grants totaling $207.461 million were awarded to nonfederal fire departments in the United States. Ineligible applicants include federal fire departments, EMS or rescue organizations, airport fire departments, for-profit fire departments, fire training centers, and emergency communications centers. The SAFER Act, enacted by the 108th Congress, authorizes grants to fire departments to increase firefighter numbers for 24-hour staffing. It also provides grants for volunteer recruitment and retention. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33375. The U.S. Fire Administration released an evaluation of the Assistance to Firefighters Program, which was found to be highly effective in improving firefighter readiness nationwide. Another evaluation by the DHS Office of Inspector General praised the program for its balanced funding distribution and provided recommendations for improvement. The National Academy of Public Administration conducted a study to identify new strategic directions for the program at the request of DHS. The report recommended new strategic directions for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program, including national preparedness, prevention vs. response, social equity, regional cooperation, and emergency medical response. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 directed the Government Accountability Office to review the application and award process for fire and SAFER grants. FEMA was also directed to peer review grant applications that align with program priorities and criteria. In October 2009, GAO reported to Congress that FEMA met most statutory requirements for awarding fire grants. GAO recommended that FEMA track EMS awards, align grant priorities with application questions, provide feedback to rejected applicants. DHS OIG audited AFG grants for fiscal years 2010-2012 and released a report on June 9, 2016. The DHS OIG released a report in June 2016 finding that 64% of AFG grant recipients from 2010 to 2012 did not comply with grant requirements to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. FEMA has taken corrective actions to address the recommendations. The Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2012 directed GAO to assess the impact of changes on fire grant effectiveness and accountability. In September 2016, GAO released a report on FEMA's fire grant policies and awards in FY2013 and FY2014, noting improvements in program administration and performance assessment. However, GAO also found that performance measures lack measurable targets linked to program goals, recommending alignment with more objective approaches used in other DHS programs. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) released its Fourth Needs Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service in November 2016, highlighting extensive needs in staffing, training, facilities, apparatus, personal protective equipment, and health and wellness. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating fire grants into national preparedness efforts and objectively assessing their impact. The NFPA's Fourth Needs Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service in 2016 identified significant needs in staffing, training, facilities, apparatus, personal protective equipment, and health and wellness. Concerns include the expanding roles and responsibilities of the fire service, the need for updated equipment, and the reliance on AFG and SAFER grant funds for support. Grant programs should be expanded to address the multifaceted needs of the fire service. The FEMA fire grant money can be used for various purposes such as training firefighting personnel, creating rapid intervention teams, certifying fire and building inspectors for fire safety inspections, establishing wellness and fitness programs, funding emergency medical services, acquiring firefighting vehicles and equipment, modifying facilities for health and safety, educating the public on arson prevention, incentivizing volunteer firefighter recruitment, and supporting other activities determined by FEMA. The Criteria Development Panel, consisting of fire service and EMS representatives, recommends criteria for awarding grants. Fire departments mainly use the majority of fire grant funding to purchase firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and vehicles. Eligible applicants are primarily fire departments or nonfire department EMS organizations. The FIRE Act statute provides guidelines for distributing fire grant money to eligible applicants such as fire departments, EMS organizations, and other fire safety organizations. For more information and application guidelines, visit the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program web page at http://www.fema.gov/welcome-assistance-firefighters-grant-program. The Fire Grants Authorization Act of 2012 changed the distribution formula for grant funding, ensuring that career, volunteer, combination, and paid-on-call fire departments each receive a minimum percentage of funding. Award caps were raised to $9 million, and matching requirements were lowered for fire departments in higher population areas. Geographical distribution of fire grants is not based on a set formula. Geographical distribution of fire grants is not based on a set formula. Fire departments nationwide apply for grants, with decisions made by a peer panel considering department type, location, and community served. FEMA may consider factors like department type and location when evaluating applications. State location is a deciding factor for diversity in grant awardees. Tables show funding breakdowns by state and department type for different grant programs. The distribution of AFG grant funds by department type and community service area for FY2009 through FY2014 is shown in tables. The partial government shutdown impacted firefighter assistance grants, delaying the application and awards process for AFG, SAFER, and FP&S grants. The processing of 2018 grant applications was also delayed. Grant recipients draw down funds for incurred expenditures or in advance. FEMA personnel administering the grants were furloughed during the shutdown. Grant recipients were unable to access funds during the government shutdown, impacting their ability to continue grant-funded activities, including personnel costs covered by SAFER grants. A backlog of payment requests will need to be processed once furloughed FEMA grant personnel return to work. AFG assistance is distributed to various types of fire departments serving different areas. Congress is considering expanding AFG to allow additional eligible uses of grants. H.R. 1823 proposes expanding AFG grants to include providing opioid receptor antagonists to first responders. Budget appropriations for AFG and SAFER may be impacted by concerns over the federal budget deficit. Firefighter assistance budgets may face scrutiny due to local budgetary shortfalls."
