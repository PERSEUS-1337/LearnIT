This round focuses on transforming defense organization and infrastructure to modernize the Military Health System. The 2005 BRAC round aims to realign Walter Reed Army Medical Center with other military health facilities to improve interoperability and reduce redundancy. The recommendations include reorganization of medical markets, downsizing hospitals to clinics, consolidating medical training and biomedical R&D capabilities. Reports of inadequate care at Walter Reed led to an independent panel commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates. The Independent Review Group (IRG) was commissioned by Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates to review rehabilitative care and administrative processes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center. The panel, cochaired by two former Secretaries of the Army, submitted its report with findings and recommendations on patient administrative and clinical practices, as well as BRAC and facilities management issues. The IRG recommended accelerating construction projects for WRNMMC and Ft. Belvoir, surveying patients for feedback, assigning a senior facilities engineer at WRAMC, modernizing facility assessment tools, and prioritizing maintenance requirements. The report focused on identifying problem areas and providing recommendations to improve military services and DOD processes. The IRG recommended accelerating construction projects for WRNMMC and Ft. Belvoir, surveying patients for feedback, assigning a senior facilities engineer at WRAMC, modernizing facility assessment tools, and prioritizing maintenance requirements. The Department of Defense created a plan for the 2005 BRAC round to adapt installations to national security needs, including the suggestion of creating a new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The Department of Defense recommended consolidating military medical treatment capacity in the national capital area by relocating routine care to a new community hospital on Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. Local and professional medical communities expressed concerns about the impact on the integrated military medical facility, economy, and homeland security in the region. They also raised issues about the availability of family housing near the planned WRNMMC. Witnesses suggested an alternative to the DOD recommendation of relocating military medical treatment capacity, proposing to retain the current WRAMC and realign the mission of the NNMC to avoid disruption of wartime casualty care. Concerns were raised about the proposed dissolution of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) located at the WRAMC Main Post, with professional organizations emphasizing its irreplaceable role in disease research and medical education. The Commission acknowledged community concerns regarding the potential impact of the proposed changes. The Commission acknowledged community concerns and objections but judged that a new facility would provide state-of-the-art treatment.

Monroe, Virginia, and includes seven regions. IMCOM's commander is dual-hatted as the Army's Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management. Created in October 2006, IMCOM oversees various Army facilities. IMCOM, created in October 2006, oversees Army installations in Southwest, Europe, Pacific, and Korea. It brings efficient oversight and business practices to Army's management, inheriting this from its predecessor, the IMA. Before 2002, each installation was managed by a senior post commander without a consolidated agency dedicated to their operation and maintenance. The IMA was established to advocate for installation funding and oversee operations. It became the Army's \"landlord\" by creating garrisons at each installation, with a designated officer in charge of maintenance and construction. This shifted funding away from operational chains of command towards infrastructure upkeep. The IMA and its regions oversee operations at individual garrisons, including the installation of contract guard forces, military construction, provision of supplies, privatization of utilities and housing, and public-private partnerships. Responsibilities at Walter Reed Army Medical Center are divided between MEDCOM's installation commander for medical practice-related functions and IMCOM's garrison commander for facility maintenance and operations. The Department of the Army, military departments, and defense agencies agreed on a plan to establish the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center by September 15, 2011. This involved relocating tertiary medical services to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, and completing necessary planning and environmental actions by Fiscal Year 2007. The National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda requires additional facilities to absorb functions from WRAMC. Construction is scheduled to begin in March 2008 and continue through May 2011. Tertiary care is set to move to WRNMMC in April 2010, with construction costs covered by the DOD TRICARE Management Agency.

Legislation affecting BRAC Commission Recommendation #169 has been proposed in the 110th Congress, including bills like H.R. 1585 and S. 1606. These bills aim to establish funding for WRAMC operations and accelerate construction of new medical facilities. Congress has various options for creating the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Proposed legislative actions regarding the BRAC Commission Recommendation #169 include modifying, delaying, or negating the recommendation, requiring progress reports from the DOD, adjusting implementation timelines, creating dedicated funding, and mandating tracking and reporting of suggested reforms. The blue ribbon panel will monitor the implementation of Independent Review Group recommendations and BRAC Commission Recommendation #169 by the Department of Defense and Department of the Army. They will assess the performance of the newly created Installation Management Command and its subordinate Installation Management Agency since 2002. The recommendation involves realigning Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, relocating tertiary medical services to National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. The Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC will be realigned and relocated to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. This includes relocating Legal Medicine, establishing a Program Management Office, moving non-tertiary patient care functions to Ft. Belvoir, VA, and relocating various elements to Dover Air Force Base, DE. Relocate enlisted histology technician training to Ft. Sam Houston, TX; move Combat Casualty Care Research sub-functions to Army Institute of Surgical Research, Ft. Sam Houston, TX; transfer Medical Biological Defense Research to Ft. Detrick, MD and consolidate with US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases; relocate Medical Chemical Defense Research to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD and consolidate with US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical. The recommendation to close Walter Reed Army Medical Center and relocate medical care to facilities with higher military value and capacity in the National Capital Region. This will transform legacy medical infrastructure into a modernized joint operational medicine platform. The plan involves relocating inpatient care from Walter Reed AMC to DeWitt Hospital and NNMC Bethesda to better serve the beneficiary population in the southern region. DeWitt Hospital will take on most patient care missions, while specialty units like the Amputee Center will be relocated. The plan involves relocating specialty units, such as the Amputee Center at WRAMC, within the National Capitol Region. Casualty care is not affected. The development of a premier National Military Medical Center will enhance visibility and recruitment advantages. Unnecessary civilian authorizations and contractors at Walter Reed AMC will be eliminated. Military personnel can replace these positions in higher military value activities. Co-location of combat casualty care research with related military clinical activities at Brooke Army Medical Center promotes translational research for rapid application in healthcare delivery. The plan involves relocating specialty units within the National Capitol Region to promote rapid application of research findings to health care delivery. This action will co-locate Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Agency program management expertise for non-medical chemical and biological defense research, fostering joint perspective and sharing of expertise. The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) was established in 1862 as a repository for Civil War soldiers' specimens. In 1976, Congress made AFIP a joint entity of the Military Departments to optimize medical product development and acquisition. AFIP was established as a joint entity of the Military Departments under the Secretary of Defense. The Department will rely on civilian market for pathology consults when local labs are overwhelmed. Concerns were raised about moving Walter Reed Army Medical Center to Bethesda, MD affecting the premier military medical facility and economy of Washington, DC. The Commission found that Walter Reed Army Medical Center deviated from BRAC criteria, underestimated closure costs, and ignored environmental cleanup costs. They recommended keeping Walter Reed open and aligning its mission with the National Naval Medical Center to avoid disruptions during war. Concerns were raised about disestablishing the Armed Force Institute of Pathology, which is crucial for disease research and education in military and civilian medicine. The Commission acknowledged Walter Reed's reputation but emphasized the need for a state-of-the-art facility for service members. The Commission supports the Secretary's proposal to create a state-of-the-art medical center for service members, preserving the Walter Reed legacy. Concerns about housing availability for family members at the Bethesda Campus were raised, urging the DoD to address the issue. The professional community values the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for its role in military and civilian medical research. The Commission recommends realigning Walter Reed Army Medical Center to National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, relocating tertiary medical services and Legal Medicine. Relocate personnel to new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD for a Program Management Office coordinating pathology results, contract administration, and quality assurance of DoD second opinion consults worldwide. Move non-tertiary patient care functions to a new community hospital at Ft Belvoir, VA. Disestablish elements of Armed Forces Institute of Pathology except National Medical Museum and Tissue Repository. Relocate Armed Forces Medical Examiner, DNA Registry, and Accident Investigation to Dover Air Force Base, DE. Absorb remaining AFIP capabilities into other DoD, Federal, or civilian facilities as needed. Enlisted histology technician training to be relocated to Ft. Sam Houston. Relocate Combat Casualty Care Research sub-functions to Ft. Sam Houston, TX; move Medical Biological Defense Research to Ft. Detrick, MD; relocate Medical Chemical Defense Research to Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; consolidate research functions with existing institutes; close main facilities. The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Army Component was created in 1909, with the Army Medical School joining in 1951. The inpatient capacity was increased in the mid-1970s with the construction of an additional hospital building. In 1999, the Institute of Research moved to a new facility at the Center's Forest Glen Annex in Maryland. Building 40 was then leased to a private concern by the Department of Defense. The Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, opened in February 1942, consisting of a 1,200-bed hospital, the Naval Medical School, the Naval Dental School, and the Naval Medical Research Institute. In 1942, the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland opened with temporary facilities for World War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War patients. By the late 1970s, permanent structures replaced the temporary ones. The facility was renamed the National Naval Medical Center in 1989, with 257 inpatient beds. In 1999, the Naval Medical Research Center moved to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Forest Glen Annex. Plans were made to create the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center by relocating services from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the Bethesda Navy site in 2010. Various bills introduced during the 110th Congress would impact the implementation of BRAC Commission Recommendation #169, specifically regarding the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. One bill, H.R. 1417, aims to prohibit the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center despite the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness on April 3, 2007. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from closing Walter Reed Army Medical Center as per the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. Guaranteed funding for the center is ensured until expanded facilities at the National Naval Medical Center and DeWitt Army Community Hospital are certified by the Secretary of Defense. The National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and DeWitt Army Community Hospital in Ft. Belvoir, Virginia must be equipped and staffed to provide the same level of care as Walter Reed Army Medical Center in fiscal year 2006 before it can be closed. This requirement is outlined in the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The Walter Reed Army Medical Center shall be adequately funded for renovation and maintenance to maintain inpatient and outpatient services. Funds cannot be used to reorganize or relocate the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology until a detailed plan is submitted to Congress by December 31, 2007. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is preparing a study on dispersing functions of AFIP among multiple locations or consolidating them at one location. The study will include options for the location of the Program Management Office for second opinion consults, in line with BRAC recommendations. Effective Care for the Armed Forces and Veterans Act of 2007 (S. 1044) has been referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. Congress limits the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center until a detailed plan is submitted by December 31, 2007. The final recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission in 2005 include closing Walter Reed Army Medical Center and building new facilities at National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Ft. Belvoir. The closure of Walter Reed has affected the ability to attract medical personnel for proper services. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from implementing recommendations to transfer medical services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Ft. Belvoir for 60 days after Congress receives a required plan. Within one year, a plan assessing the feasibility of providing medical personnel at Walter Reed must be submitted to Congress. The feasibility and advisability of guaranteeing employment for employees at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area for more than two years after closure, detailed construction plans for new medical facilities and housing at National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Ft. Belvoir, and the costs and feasibility of completing construction before transferring patients from Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act (S. 1606) was enacted to address deficiencies at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The Secretary of Defense was required to submit reports on the Army's action plan to correct facility conditions and outpatient administration every 120 days until March 1, 2009. The report under the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act includes information on the number of inpatients and outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, descriptions of lodging facilities, and the status of proposed or ongoing corrections for inadequate conditions. The report includes details on proposed actions to correct inadequacies, staffing ratios at Army facilities for medical hold patients, calls received on the Wounded Soldier and Family hotline, and findings of the Army tiger team. The Army tiger team of medical professionals visited medical facilities to assess activities and make recommendations. The report also covers the status of ombudsman programs at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and other installations. The Secretary is required to post reports online within 24 hours. Additionally, there are details on proposed actions to correct inadequacies and findings of the Army tiger team. The Secretary of Defense is assessing the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of accelerating the construction of new facilities to facilitate the closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. This is required due to the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment. Additionally, a plan for the construction and completion of these facilities will be developed and implemented based on the assessment. The Secretary will submit a plan for accelerated construction of new facilities to replace Walter Reed Army Medical Center by September 30, 2007. Additionally, certifications regarding a transition plan and resources for patient care services at the center will also be submitted by the same date. The closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center will not result in a net loss of capacity in major military medical centers in the National Capitol Region. Adequate funds have been provided to complete all facilities identified in the Base Realignment and Closure Business Plan for Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The justification materials submitted to Congress with the President's budget for fiscal year 2008 are in line with the business plan. The Secretary is not required to waive environmental responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
