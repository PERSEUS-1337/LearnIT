The fund is administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and has seen steady growth in revenue transfers over the years. The majority of the funds go towards fisheries science and management, with the remaining supporting the Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant Program and sometimes the National Program for fishing industry research. Some critics question if the U.S. commercial fishing industry has enough input in the S-K competitive grant process, leading to concerns about funding distribution and allocation. There are debates on whether more financial support should go to S-K competitive grants or NMFS fisheries science and management activities. The S-K Act requires funds from marine product duties to be transferred to support NMFS fishery research and management activities. Congress may need to consider implications of reallocating funds to the S-K Grant Program. The S-K Act mandates the allocation of funds from marine product duties to support NMFS fishery research and management activities. It requires at least 60% of funds to be used for direct industry-assistance grants for various topics related to fisheries. The remaining funds are to finance NMFS activities that aid in the development of U.S. fisheries. In 1935, Congress passed legislation to provide financial support for domestic agricultural commodity markets through a permanent appropriation equal to 30% of customs duties. The Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to use these funds to support exports and domestic consumption of agricultural commodities. Additionally, the Act of August 11, 1939, allowed the transfer of funds to support the fishing industry by purchasing and distributing surplus fishery products and promoting markets. The S-K Act of 1954 amended the Act of August 11, 1939, to provide additional funding from Section 32 funds to support the U.S. fishing industry. It authorized the transfer of funds from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior for the development and promotion of fishery products. Annual expenditures were limited to $3 million, with a fund balance cap of $5 million. The S-K Act of 1954 allowed annual expenditures to exceed $5 million and removed the limit on fund balance. In 1976, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act established a 200-nautical mile fishery conservation zone, giving priority fishing rights to domestic industry. U.S. policy focused on developing domestic fisheries and replacing foreign fishing in the conservation zone. In 1979, NMFS allocated $5.3 million of S-K funds to support fisheries development projects. Congress authorized the S-K Grant Program in 1980, directing at least 50% of funds to the program for research and development in areas like harvesting and marketing. In 1980, the S-K fund transfer from USDA grew to $26.7 million, with responsibility transferred to the Secretary of Commerce. Congress made changes to fund allocation, increasing funds for competitive grants. The fund's potential uses were broadened in subsequent years. The S-K fund transfer from USDA increased from $26.7 million in 1980 to $182.8 million. The fund's potential uses were broadened to include the Fisheries Promotion Fund, the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Fisheries Reinvestment Fund, and a fishing capacity reduction program. The Fisheries Promotion Fund supports domestic and international seafood markets. The P&D account receives revenues from duties on fishery products and does not require periodic reauthorization or appropriation. The transfer of funds from USDA to NOAA's P&D account has increased steadily from $26.7 million in 1980 to $182.8 million in 2020. In CY2017, most revenues came from duties on imports of nonedible marine products, with the remaining from duties on edible seafood products. Tariffs on edible fish products have been reduced, with most duties collected on canned or processed products. The majority of duties were collected from imports from India, China, Thailand, Italy, and France. Congress has allocated a growing portion of revenue to the ORF account instead of the S-K Grant Program as prescribed by the S-K Act. The transfer of funds from USDA to NOAA's P&D account has increased steadily over the years. Funds are often allocated to the ORF account, limiting funding for specified purposes of the S-K Act. Recent budget proposals aimed to transfer all P&D account funding to the ORF account for NMFS activities, but restrictions were placed on the use of these funds for fisheries activities. The funding for fisheries activities under the S-K Act has been limited to specific purposes such as cooperative research, stock assessments, and monitoring projects. Congress has consistently included similar language in appropriations laws, with remaining funds used for the S-K Grant Program and National Program. Funding for the S-K Grant Program has varied significantly, from no funding in some years to a high of $29.5 million in FY2009. Funding for the S-K program reached its highest level of $29.5 million in FY2009. The S-K Act mandates that 60% of funds be allocated for fisheries research and development grants, with the remaining funds used for NMFS activities related to U.S. fisheries development. Historically, funding for the Fisheries Promotion Fund ranged from $750,000 to $3 million between FY1987 and FY1990, but no funding has been provided since 1991. The S-K program has been funded since 1991, with most funding used for regional seafood marketing initiatives. The program aims to support fishing communities, sustainable fisheries, and working waterfronts. Projects funded include enhancing fishery markets, exploring management options, and developing efficient fishing gear. Funding for the program peaked at $29.5 million in FY2009, with 60% allocated for research grants. No funding has been provided for the Fisheries Promotion Fund since 1991. The S-K program, funded since 1991, supports various marine sectors like aquaculture and recreational fishing. NMFS solicits proposals for funding opportunities with priorities set by regional fishery management councils. In 2020, priorities include seafood promotion and sustainable U.S. seafood production. The review process involves pre-proposal, technical, and panel reviews before grant selection. The review process for funding proposals under the S-K program involves multiple stages including administrative screening, technical review by experts, and funding recommendations by program and NMFS leadership. Input may also be sought from a constituent review panel. Funding decisions are made by the NMFS assistant administrator based on proposal rankings, availability of funds, and other considerations. NMFS is considering improving the dissemination of results from funded projects and seeking input from fishery management councils. Some in the fishing industry question if more support is needed from S-K funding, suggesting greater industry input in grant processes and allocation of funds. Concerns include NMFS prioritizing programs that may not align with industry priorities. The fishing industry believes more direct participation is needed to inform grant funding priorities, including potentially allocating more funds to the S-K Grant Program. There are concerns about shifting funding from NMFS activities and the potential impact on other functions like data collection and fish population assessments. Several bills introduced in Congress aimed to change the allocation of funding for fisheries investment. The Fisheries Investment and Regulatory Relief Act proposed changes in funding allocation to regional fishery management councils for strengthening fisheries management. Each council would establish a fishery investment committee to develop regional investment plans, review grant applications, and make recommendations on projects to rebuild fish populations. Plans would address research, conservation, and management needs to support stock surveys and fisheries sustainability. The investment plan under the Fisheries Investment and Regulatory Relief Act would cover topics such as supporting stock surveys, improving data accuracy, analyzing social and economic impacts, providing financial assistance to fishermen, developing conservation technologies, and restoring fish habitat. Plans would be reviewed for consistency with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Limited funding would also cover administrative costs and plan development. The Fisheries Investment and Regulatory Relief Act would establish a regional fisheries grant program to fund regional fishery investment plans. The Secretary of Commerce would allocate funds to projects recommended by regional fishery investment committees and approved by regional fishery management councils. 70% of funds would be allocated to the eight council regions based on economic impact, with 20% allocated for a national fisheries investment program. The legislation proposed allocating 20% of funds for a national fisheries investment program to support fish populations, promote sustainable fisheries, and address various needs. Funding would be divided among regional fisheries commissions, seafood promotion, fisheries management, disasters, and other needs. Limits were set on transferring funds and provisions were included to review and streamline regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2014 aimed to prevent the transfer of funds to the ORF account by introducing new rules in the Senate and House. No further action was taken on this bill. In the 116th Congress, identical versions of the American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act were reported from the Senate and House committees, proposing the establishment of an American fisheries advisory committee and changes to the awarding process for S-K. The American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act proposes establishing a committee to oversee the awarding process for S-K grants in the seafood industry. The committee would consist of representatives from six regions appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, with specific expertise in seafood harvesting, fishing, and fisheries science. The bill aims to expand the purposes of fisheries research projects to include fisheries science and recreational fishing. The Secretary of Commerce would appoint a committee to oversee S-K grant awards in the seafood industry. The committee would consist of representatives with expertise in seafood harvesting, fishing, and fisheries science. Meetings would occur twice annually in rotating regions, with technical review of grant applications conducted by three or more experts. Guidance would be developed for the review process, including criteria for eliminating applications that do not meet minimum standards. The Secretary of Commerce appoints a committee to oversee S-K grant awards in the seafood industry. The committee consists of experts in seafood harvesting, fishing, and fisheries science. Grant applications undergo technical review by three or more experts, with criteria for elimination of applications not meeting minimum technical merit. The Secretary evaluates proposed projects based on committee recommendations and additional criteria as needed. If funds are not provided to a selected grant, the Secretary must justify the decision in writing to the committee."
