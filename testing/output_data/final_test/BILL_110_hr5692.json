    "content": "The \"Infant Crib Safety Act\" is the short title of this legislation. The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings section. The Infant Crib Safety Act aims to address the serious threat to public health posed by injuries and deaths of infants in cribs. Each year, thousands of children are injured and dozens die from crib-related incidents, costing society millions of dollars. The design and construction of cribs must prioritize safety for unattended infants. The Infant Crib Safety Act aims to prevent injuries and deaths caused by unsafe cribs, especially secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs. Existing legislation is inadequate in addressing this hazard, and prohibiting the sale or placement of unsafe cribs in the market will help save lives. The Infant Crib Safety Act aims to prevent injuries and deaths by prohibiting the sale of unsafe cribs, including secondhand or heirloom cribs. It is unlawful to manufacture, sell, or resell any crib that is unsafe for infants. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIBS. Manufacture and Sale of Cribs: It is illegal for commercial users to sell cribs manufactured before 1999, those that do not meet safety standards, or have missing components. Lodging facilities are also prohibited from offering pre-1999 cribs or those that do not conform to safety standards. Crib Safety Standards: Cribs must comply with specific safety standards to avoid being considered hazardous products under the Consumer Product Safety Act. These standards include regulations outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations and standards set by the American Society for Testing Materials for both full-size and nonfull-size cribs. The Consumer Product Safety Commission enforces regulations on baby crib safety, including corner post extensions and compliance with specific standards. Exceptions apply to cribs not intended for infant use, such as toys or display items. The Consumer Product Safety Commission enforces regulations on baby crib safety, including corner post extensions and compliance with specific standards. Cribs not intended for infant use must be accompanied by a notice declaring their danger for infants when placed in the stream of commerce. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will revise regulations for cribs to include safety requirements and address durability hazards. This includes considering standards like UL-2275 and the Cribs and Cradle Regulations from Canada. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will require warning labels on cribs to caution against using soft bedding for infants, including bumper pads, quilts, blankets, pillows, and sleep positioners. In this Act, the definition of a \"commercial user\" includes individuals involved in manufacturing, selling, or dealing with full-size or nonfull-size cribs, as well as those in child care facilities or family child care homes. The term \"commercial user\" includes individuals involved in selling or reselling full-size or nonfull-size cribs, but not those who sell used cribs at private sales. A crib is defined as a full-size or nonfull-size baby crib, with specific definitions for full-size and nonfull-size cribs.

(5) Nonfull-size crib is defined as a nonfull-size baby crib according to federal regulations, including portable cribs and crib-pens. (6) Sleep positioner refers to any wedge, roll, prop, or pillow meant to promote a specific sleep position. The requirements of section 3 of this Act will be effective one year after the Act is enacted."
