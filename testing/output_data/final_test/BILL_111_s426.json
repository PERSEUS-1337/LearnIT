The \"Social Security Solvency Act of 2009\" amends benefit calculations for old-age insurance recipients, capping earnings at certain amounts based on indexed monthly earnings. For calendar year 2012, the amount established is determined by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration at the 30th percentile for the period of calendar years 2001 through 2003. The \"Social Security Solvency Act of 2009\" adjusts benefit calculations for old-age insurance recipients by capping earnings based on indexed monthly earnings. The amount established for calendar year 2012 is determined by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration at the 30th percentile for the period of calendar years 2001 through 2003. For calendar years after 2012, the amount is calculated based on specific formulas involving the national average wage index. The amount for calendar year 2012 is determined by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration at the 30th percentile for the period of calendar years 2001 through 2003. For calendar years after 2012, the amount is calculated based on specific formulas involving the national average wage index. The formula for calculating the quotient involves the maximum CPI-indexed benefit amount, the maximum wage-indexed benefit amount, and the average indexed monthly earnings for individuals. In positive balance years, different percentages apply as specified in subparagraph (B). The formula for calculating the maximum wage-indexed benefit amount for any calendar year involves specific percentages determined in preceding years. In non-positive balance years, adjustments are made by substituting the second calendar year before the most recent positive balance year. The maximum wage-indexed benefit amount is based on an individual's wages and self-employment income in each computation base year. The maximum CPI-indexed benefit amount for any calendar year is calculated based on specific ratios of the Consumer Price Index and national wage index for preceding years. A positive balance year is defined as a calendar year after 2050 certified by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. The combined balance ratio of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund must be at least 100 percent for the year. The ratio is calculated based on the combined balance of the Trust Funds at the end of the calendar year, minus any transfers, compared to the estimated amount to be paid from the Trust Funds in the following year. Rules similar to those for positive balance years apply. For this paragraph, rules similar to those in paragraph (1) apply.
