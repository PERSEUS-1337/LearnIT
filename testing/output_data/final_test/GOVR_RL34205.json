    "content": "The federal government provides elementary and secondary education and educational assistance to Indian children through federally funded schools overseen by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) in the U.S. Department of the Interior. Funding comes from the BIE and the U.S. Department of Education, with public school systems also receiving federal funding. Programs are based on tribal membership or familial relationships, not race/ethnicity. Indian education programs are for Indian children who are members of or descendants of tribal entities recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The programs are based on the federal government's trust relationship with Indian tribes, but they are discretionary and not an entitlement like Medicare. Indian children can also access general federal educational assistance programs. The report provides a history of federal Indian education programs, focusing on Congress's efforts to assimilate Indians into Euro-American cultural patterns through education. The government's concern with Indian education dates back to the Continental Congress in 1775, which funded the education of Indian students at Dartmouth College. From the Revolution to the Civil War, the federal government funded Indian education through treaties with tribes, providing vocational and academic instruction. Over 150 treaties included provisions for teachers or schools, with the first U.S. statute for Indian education being the Civilization Act of 1819. The federal government funded Indian education through treaties with tribes, providing instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic near frontier settlements. Schools were funded through contracts with missionary societies, benevolent societies, and Indian tribes, with the total reaching into the hundreds by the Civil War. After the war, the U.S. government established a federal Indian school system, with schools funded, constructed, and operated by the DOI's BIA. In 1869, the Board of Indian Commissioners recommended the establishment of government schools and teachers, leading to Congress passing the first general appropriation for Indian education in 1870. In 1870, Congress passed the first general appropriation for Indian schools not provided for under treaties. The BIA created both boarding and day schools, including off-reservation industrial boarding schools. BIA schools were chiefly elementary and vocational schools, with an organizational structure for BIA education established in the late 1800s. The education of Alaska Native children was assigned to DOI's Office of Education in 1885. After 1910, the BIA started transitioning Indian children to nearby public schools and closing BIA schools. Congress provided some funding for public schools educating Indian students, leading to more Indian students attending public schools than BIA schools by 1920. The shift to public schools for Indian students increased from 1900 to 1975, with the Snyder Act authorizing BIA programs in 1921 and the Johnson-O'Malley Act simplifying reimbursement for public schools educating Indian students in 1934. In the 1920s and 1930s, the BIA expanded its schools' grade levels to secondary education and shifted towards local day schools. The curriculum also included Indian culture and vocational education. Responsibility for Alaska Native education was transferred to the BIA in 1931. Federal funding for Indian education began in 1953 with the Impact Aid program, which pays public school districts to educate Indian children in federally impacted areas. In the 1950s and 1970s, changes to the Impact Aid law increased funding for education in federally impacted areas, particularly for children on Indian lands. Additional non-DOI funding for Indian education was provided through amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1966, leading to the Indian Education Act of 1972. The Indian Education Act of 1972, now known as ESEA Title VI, established the Office of Indian Education (OIE) to make grants to local educational agencies with Indian children. This marked a shift towards greater Indian control of federal Indian education programs, including the ability for Indian tribes and tribal organizations to contract to operate their BIA schools under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. The Education Amendments of 1978 and the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 allowed tribal school boards to operate BIA schools, promoting Indian control in education. The Indian Education Act of 1972 initiated this shift towards greater tribal involvement in federal Indian education programs. The 1972 Indian Education Act and subsequent legislation mandated greater tribal involvement in public school programs, requiring consultation with Indian parents and communities. This shift towards Indian control in education was further supported by the Education Amendments of 1978 and the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988. Since the 1960s, the BIA school system has seen a decrease in the number of schools due to consolidation and closures. The number of BIA-funded schools dropped from 233 in 1930 to 180 in 1986 before rising to 185 by 1994, currently standing at 183. Congress has limited the number of BIA schools and their grade structure since the 1990s. Approximately 48,000 Indian students have been educated at BIA schools in the last 15 years. The Secretary of the Interior established the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) to oversee BIA education programs for Indian students. BIE schools serve a small percentage of Indian students, while the majority attend public schools. Data on Indian students vary across federal programs, with different eligibility criteria. Federal Indian education programs have eligibility criteria based on the political status of the students' tribal membership or descent. The BIE school system serves students who are members of federally recognized Indian tribes or at least one-fourth degree Indian blood descendants. The JOM program serves students in public schools who are at least one-fourth degree Indian blood. Many BIE Indian students have less than one-fourth Indian blood. The BIE school system serves federally recognized Indian tribes or their descendants, while the ED ESEA Title VII-A programs serve a broader range of students including state-recognized tribes, Alaska Natives, and those identified as Indian by the Secretary of the Interior. Public school districts need a minimum number of eligible Indian students to receive ESEA Title VII grants, which are administered by the ED. The ESEA Title VII grants are administered by ED, which is also the source of data on ESEA Title VII students. The Impact Aid program funds public schools on \"Indian lands\" or for federally connected children, regardless of their ethnicity. The educational environment and achievements of BIE students and American Indian/Alaska Native students are reported by ED's National Center for Education Statistics. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) publishes reports on AI/AN students' characteristics and academic achievements based on race/ethnicity data. The data may include students who identify as AI/AN but are not eligible for federal Indian education programs. NCES data does not accurately represent the Indian student population served by federal programs. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) funds schools and dormitories for eligible Indian students. In 2014, the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) began restructuring to increase tribal capacity in operating schools and improving educational outcomes. The new structure includes a director in Washington, DC, oversight through three Associate Deputy Directors (ADDs), and fifteen Education Resource Centers (ERC) reporting to the ADDs. The BIE-funded school system consists of day and boarding schools and dormitories. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) school system includes day and boarding schools, with dormitories for students. BIE-funded schools offer elementary or secondary classes and are located on or off Indian reservations. Schools may be K-8, K-12, or K-6, and may be operated directly by BIE or by tribes through grants or contracts. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) funds 169 schools and 14 peripheral dorms, with the majority being tribally operated. Some schools operate through cooperative agreements with public school districts, and three BIE schools in Maine receive state funding. Additionally, there are eight charter schools co-located at BIE schools. Congress has limited the expansion of BIE schools and dorms due to concerns about diminishing funding for existing schools. Congress has restricted the growth of BIE schools and dorms, as well as co-located charter schools, through annual appropriation acts. However, starting in FY2012, restrictions have been loosened, allowing for the funding of grades 1-6 at Jones Academy in July 2012. In July 2012, BIE began funding grades 1-6 at Jones Academy in Hartshorne, OK, previously funded as a dormitory. Funding for an additional grade was approved in 2014 for Shoshone-Bannock Junior High. In FY2015, BIE authorized satellite locations for language and cultural programs, such as the Pine Grove Satellite Learning Center in Minnesota. The Pine Grove Satellite Learning Center in Minnesota was opened by a school in Minnesota using broadband to serve Indian children in the BIE school system. BIE-funded schools and dorms cater to around 48,000 Indian students from nearly 250 tribes in 23 states, with most schools having 200 or fewer children. The majority of BIE schools and students are concentrated in Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota. There are no BIE schools or students in Alaska as directed by Congress. On average, students in BIE schools score below students in public schools on the NAEP assessment. For example, on the 4th grade 2013 NAEP reading assessment, BIE school students scored an average of 181 while public school students scored an average of 221. Approximately 1.0% of public school students in fall 2013 were AI/ANs, with 80% of AI/AN students living in 16 states, including Oklahoma, Arizona, California, and New Mexico. In 2014, a high percentage of AI/AN children lived in poverty and required services for disabilities. The percentage of AI/AN students served under IDEA was highest among all racial/ethnic groups. Additionally, 12% of 16- through 24-year-old AI/AN students were not enrolled in school and lacked a high school credential. The 2015 NAEP results show that AI/AN students score lower than white and Asian/Pacific Islander students but similar to black and Hispanic students. Federal Indian education programs support AI/AN students in public, private, and BIE-funded schools, with BIE providing 75% of funding for BIE schools. The BIE provides 75% of funding for BIE-funded schools, with ED providing the remainder. BIE programs and key statutes are summarized, including the authorization for federal Indian programs. Congress passed this act to provide support for education and other Indian programs. The Snyder Act was passed to authorize the activities of the BIA, allowing for broad interpretation of Indian programs. ISDEAA allows tribes to manage BIE-funded education programs through self-determination contracts or self-governance compacts. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) allows tribes to take control of BIE-funded schools through contracts or compacts. Only one BIE school, Miccosukee Indian School in Florida, is currently funded this way. The act covers various aspects of Indian education, including academic standards, funding allocation, personnel, facilities, and grant programs. The Tribal Control of Schools Act (TCSA) authorizes BIE grant programs for tribally operated schools, including administrative cost grants, early childhood development program grants, and grants for tribal departments of education. Grant schools are preferred over ISDEAA contracts for Indian control of schools. BIE-funded schools are funded through various programs, with appropriations for a fiscal year used to fund the following school year. The Indian School Equalization Program (ISEP) is a formula-based grant program that allocates congressional appropriations for BIE-funded schools' operating costs. ISEP funds support basic and supplemental educational programs for Indian students, including tuition payments for out-of-state students at Sevier Public Schools in Utah. The Indian School Equalization Program (ISEP) allocates funds based on a formula that considers student average daily membership (ADM), residential-living status, grade levels, gifted and talented students, language development needs, supplemental education programs, and school size. The final figure, called the \"weighted student unit\" (WSU), is used to determine each school's allocation proportionate to the national average WSU. Part of the ISEP funds are set aside before allocation under the funding formula. The Indian School Equalization Program (ISEP) allocates funds based on a formula considering student average daily membership (ADM), residential-living status, grade levels, gifted and talented students, language development needs, supplemental education programs, and school size. Part of ISEP funds are set aside for program adjustments, contingencies, and appeals. Program adjustments have funded safety and security projects, behavior intervention programs, targeted education projects, police services, and parental participation projects. The FOCUS program supported at-risk students by providing technical assistance on effective teaching practices. BIE funds an extensive student transportation system for day and boarding students, covering buses, fuel, maintenance, and bus drivers. The BIE's student transportation funds cover buses, fuel, maintenance, and driver salaries for day and boarding students. The funds are distributed based on commercial transportation costs and bus miles driven, with additional weight for unimproved roads. Additionally, the early childhood development program provides grants for preschool Indian students and their parents, focusing on early childhood education and parenting skills to improve employment opportunities. In SY 2015-2016, 2,129 adults and 2,265 children were served by grants distributed among tribes and organizations with a minimum tribal size of 500 members. These grants cover administrative and indirect costs for tribally operated TCSA-grant schools, encouraging tribes to take control of their schools. Administrative cost grants are formula-based, with a minimum grant of $200,000, to assist with costs not covered by other BIE funds. The FY2016 appropriations fully funded statutorily determined grant amounts without reductions for BIE-funded school facilities. The program covers operating expenses like utilities, supplies, and maintenance for 24 months. Funds also support preventive and routine maintenance for school buildings and equipment. In FY2012, appropriations for facilities maintenance were transferred from the BIA Construction account to the BIE account. The Education Program Enhancements receive targeted improvements and interventions, such as supporting BIE reorganization efforts and developing partnerships with tribally controlled colleges. The Residential Education Placement program ensures eligible Indian students with disabilities receive appropriate education services. The BIE provided various services including therapy, counseling, and substance abuse treatment to institutionalized students in SY2008-2009. The Juvenile Detention Education program funded educational services for children in BIA-funded detention facilities. The Secretary can grant funds for tribal education departments to coordinate educational programs. Funds have been awarded since FY2015 to promote tribal control of BIE-funded schools and improve academic success. The Johnson O'Malley (JOM) program provides financial assistance to meet the educational needs of eligible Indian students in public and private schools. BIE contracts with tribes, tribal organizations, states, and public school districts to distribute funds for JOM services, with most funds being distributed through tribal contractors. Eligible Indian students are those with at least one-quarter degree Indian blood recognized by the BIA. Most JOM funds are distributed through tribal contractors, with funds used for supplemental programs like tutoring, academic support, books, supplies, Native language classes, cultural activities, and more. Funds can be used for general school operations if a public school district cannot meet state educational standards without them and has at least 70% eligible Indian students. BIA funds repair, improvement, and construction activities for BIE schools and facilities. The BIA funds repair, improvement, and construction activities for BIE schools and facilities, including the maintenance of employee housing units. Projects can be administered by the BIA or tribes under specific agreements. The BIA uses various indices and plans to prioritize projects and guide expenditures, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards. In FY2007-FY2016, BIA and BIE spending on elementary-secondary education and construction increased by 10% in nominal dollars but decreased by 5% in constant FY2016 dollars. Educational programming appropriations for BIE elementary-secondary programs rose by 26% in nominal dollars over the same period. In FY2007-FY2016, BIA and BIE spending on elementary-secondary education and construction increased by 10% in nominal dollars. The increase is mainly due to higher appropriations for ISEP and Tribal Grant Support Costs, and transferring appropriations for facilities maintenance from the BIA Education Construction account to the BIE Elementary-Secondary Education account. BIA education construction appropriations have decreased by 33% in nominal dollars, from $205 million in FY2007 to $138 million in FY2016, primarily because of lower appropriations for school and facility construction. The U.S. Department of Education provides funding specifically for Indian elementary and secondary education to both public and BIE schools, with the majority going to public schools and related organizations. The U.S. Department of Education provides specific assistance for Indian education, separate from its general assistance to elementary and secondary education nationwide. This funding flows through various programs authorized under acts like the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) amendments will be effective for AY2017-2018 for these programs. The U.S. Department of Education provides specific assistance for Indian education through programs authorized under acts like the ESEA and IDEA. Some general ED programs have set-asides for BIE schools, while others may specifically include Indian students or mention them as a target of assistance. BIE schools are often included in the definition of local educational agency in the ESEA and IDEA, allowing them to receive funding from many ED programs. Title I, Part A of the ESEA provides formula grants to LEAs for disadvantaged children, offering supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high numbers of low-income families. ESEA reserves funds for outlying areas and DOI, with DOI funds allocated for BIE schools and out-of-state Indian students in public schools under BIE contracts. Formula grants are also authorized for states under ESEA. The ESEA authorizes formula grants to states for the development and implementation of state assessments and standards under Title I-A. Title I-B, amended by ESSA, provides a 0.5% set-aside for BIE. Title II-A program, also amended by ESSA, allocates 0.5% of appropriations for programs in BIE schools. Title III, Part A authorizes formula grants to states for programs and services for English learners and immigrant students to achieve English proficiency and academic success. The Title IV, Part B program under ESEA provides formula grants to states for activities that support student academic achievement during non-school hours. A set-aside of no more than 1% of appropriations is allocated for the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) to benefit Native American and Alaska Native children in school. Eligible entities include Indian tribes, educational authorities, Native Hawaiian organizations, BIE schools, and consortia of BIE schools. States award competitive subgrants for before- and after-school activities that promote student success. The program allocates up to 1% of Title IV-B appropriations for the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) and outlying areas. The Secretary of Education determines the portion for the BIE. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 1 of the ESEA authorizes formula grants for supplementary education programs for Indian students. Eligible entities include LEAs, Indian tribes, organizations, consortia, and BIE schools. LEAs must have at least 10 Indian students or 25% Indian enrollment to qualify, with exceptions for certain regions. Applications must be approved by a local committee. The Indian Education programs authorize competitive grant programs for innovative services and professional development for Indian students. National programs include grants for education planning, development, and the National Advisory Council on Indian Education. Title VI, Part C of the ESEA authorizes competitive grants for Alaska Native organizations and cultural entities for supplemental education. Title VII of the ESEA, as amended by ESSA, authorizes Impact Aid Basic Support Payments to provide financial assistance to school districts affected by federal property ownership or activities, including those with a significant number of students residing on \"Indian lands.\" Grants are available for Alaska Native organizations and cultural entities to support educational programs for Alaska Native students, parents, and teachers, covering areas such as curriculum development, student enrichment, professional development, family literacy, cultural exchange, and dropout prevention. Impact Aid funds are distributed to Alaska Native entities and public lands designated for Indian use. The funds are used for operating costs, special education, and facilities. Indian children must participate equally in educational programs, and consultation with parents and tribes is required for children on \"Indian lands.\" Some BIE schools also receive Impact Aid funding. The Impact Aid funding supports educational programs for Indian children, with about 113,000 students on Indian lands used to determine allocations. It is the largest Indian education program by funding amount. Additionally, Part B of the IDEA provides grants to states for free appropriate public education for children with disabilities, with funds used for various educational services and personnel. The Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 (P.L. 109-149) limits the DOI set-aside to the prior-year amount increased for inflation. In FY2016, the DOI set-aside is 0.79%. Section 611(h) of the IDEA allocates funds to BIE schools for special education and tribes for early identification of children with disabilities. Part C of the IDEA provides grants for early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities. Section 643(b) reserves 1.25% of state-grant appropriations for DOI to distribute to tribes for early intervention services coordination. Title VII, Part B of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act authorizes the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, providing assistance to ensure homeless children have equal access to education. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act authorizes grants to support career and technical skills development. The Native American Career and Technical Education Program (NACTEP) receives a 1.25% set-aside from the Education Department (ED) for eligible entities such as Indian tribes, tribal organizations, Alaska Native entities, and BIE schools. ED Indian education funding primarily supports public schools, with a significant portion allocated to BIE schools. Funding for the ED Indian education program showed a steady increase from FY2007 to FY2012, with a 6% decline thereafter, excluding additional appropriations from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Funding for the ED Indian education program increased steadily from FY2007 to FY2012, reaching $1.084 billion, followed by a 6% decline in FY2013 due to sequestration. Funding rebounded to a 10-year high in nominal dollars in FY2016 at $1.119 billion, excluding ARRA funds. In constant FY2016 dollars, total spending on elementary-secondary education decreased by 1% over the same period. Impact Aid is the largest program, with BIE set-asides from ESEA programs like IDEA Part B and Title I-A being the second-largest funding stream. Other programs for Alaska Natives, career and technical education, early childhood education, and English language acquisition make up about 8% of the total funding provided for Indian education. Issues in Indian education include poor academic outcomes, desire for greater control, impact of ESEA on BIE schools, poor school facilities, and allocation of funds. The federal government is working to improve academic achievement through initiatives like Executive Order 13592. The federal government, through initiatives like Executive Order 13592, is working to improve academic outcomes for American Indian and Alaska Native students by promoting tribal self-determination in education. Congress has also supported efforts to address issues in Indian education, including allocating funds for tribal self-determination in public schools and increasing Indian and tribal influence in education policies. Congressional committees have held hearings on the condition of Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) school facilities and required BIE to address the reallocation of Johnson O'Malley funds. There are significant gaps in educational outcomes for Indian students in BIE schools and American Indian/Alaska Native students in public schools compared to other students. The federal government has a unique and continuing trust relationship with Indian people for the education of Indian children. Calls have been made to increase native language instruction to improve academic performance and cultural relevance. Language, culture, and identity are intertwined and important to tribal identity. Native language instruction is important for tribal identity. Congress has expanded program authorities and funds for this purpose. Research on the effectiveness of native language instruction is inconclusive. Some studies suggest bilingual instruction can improve English reading proficiency, while others show no impact. Studies have limitations, and more research is needed. The review found no significant difference in English reading outcomes between bilingual and English-immersion instruction. Native language immersion students achieved higher scores in English and math assessments. Federal programs support native language acquisition, such as ESEA Title III-A English Language Acquisition. The ESEA Indian Education program supports Native American language programs and bilingual projects to improve English proficiency. Funds are used for training traditional leaders and cultural experts to assist Indian teachers with native language and cultural mentoring. The program also supports Native American and Alaska Native Language Immersion Schools and Programs. The ESEA Title VI-A-3 and VI-C programs support Alaska Native language immersion schools and programs, emphasizing cultural diversity and language preservation. The Department of Health and Human Services also provides grants for Native American language preservation. The BIE introduced a native language policy framework for BIE-operated schools in 2015. The policy aims to integrate Native language instruction with existing standards. DOI, ED, and HHS signed a memorandum to promote Native language instruction. Substance abuse is a significant issue in Native communities, affecting students' learning abilities. American Indians or Alaska Natives have the highest rate of substance dependence compared to other groups. This environment impacts Indian students in BIE and public schools. The Office of Inspector General found concerns regarding violence prevention policies at BIE schools, with a high percentage of students carrying weapons on campus. Recommendations were made to establish safety policies, improve security measures, and make safety a criterion for maintaining operating grants and contracts. The Office of Inspector General found concerns regarding violence prevention policies at BIE schools, with a high percentage of students carrying weapons on campus. Recommendations were made to establish safety policies, improve security measures, and address safety as a criterion for maintaining operating grants and contracts. Follow-up inspections in 2014 highlighted the need for improvement in emergency preparedness, security plans, and violence prevention training for staff and students. The ED has also addressed the overrepresentation of American Indian/Alaska Native students in out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, emphasizing the negative educational consequences and providing resources to schools on administering discipline without discrimination. BIE schools face challenges in defining an effective academic accountability system. The BIE schools face school-specific issues such as defining academic accountability, school construction, and insufficient grant funding. Reports like the Meriam Report in 1928 and the Kennedy Report in 1969 highlighted underfunding, poor educational outcomes, and ineffective internal organization within the BIE school system. Education was not the highest priority for the BIA according to the 1969 report. The 1969 report identified issues within the BIA, including a lack of centralized authority, clear chain of command, and educational expertise among administrators. Subsequent assessments in 1992, 1999, and 2012, along with reports from the Government Accountability Office since 2013, highlighted fragmented administrative structures, poor coordination, and inadequate resources in BIE schools. The BIE lacks staff and resources for school oversight, with inadequate training and procedures. Federal administration is complicated by statutory provisions like ISDEAA and TCSA. BIE administers TCSA grants for schools, while BIA administers ISDEAA contracts for various funding streams. Tribal consultations support self-determination and may enhance operations. Several options are being considered to address long-standing administrative and organizational issues in BIE schools. One option is to transfer BIE schools or students to states with established governance systems, similar to the transfer of BIA-funded schools in Alaska. AI/AN students in public schools show higher academic achievement than BIE students, but still score lower than white and Asian/Pacific Islander students. Some stakeholders suggest transitioning BIE schools to tribally operated charter schools. Some stakeholders propose transferring BIE schools to tribally operated charter schools or to the Department of Education (ED) for better educational outcomes. The Administration and Congress are exploring reorganizations to address these issues, aiming to centralize or decentralize authority and improve educational options. The Department of the Interior (DOI) ordered a restructuring of the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) in 2014 to address issues such as tribal control, student achievement, and communication. The reorganization aims to provide more support to tribally operated BIE schools for effective teaching, resource allocation, and community involvement. The Department of the Interior reorganized the Bureau of Indian Education to align the budget with expected outcomes. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved the Reforming American Indian Standards of Education Act to create an independent Indian education agency within DOI. DOI was instructed to reorganize Indian affairs so that all education functions are administered by the BIE. The ESEA, as amended by ESSA, requires DOI to develop regulations for BIE school standards, assessments, and accountability. The BIE announced the Accountability Negotiated Rulemaking Committee in January 2017 to address inappropriate regulations. Tribal governing bodies or school boards can submit proposals for alternate standards, assessments, and accountability systems consistent with ESEA Section 1111. The Miccosukee Tribe and Navajo Nation had alternative plans approved for previous academic years, with final regulations expected for AY2017-2018. Their ability to continue using alternative systems in the future will depend on waiver requirements. The BIE school facilities in AY2017-2018 and beyond will depend on waiver requirements set by negotiated rulemaking. These facilities have many old buildings with deficiencies, some in poor condition not meeting health and safety standards. Reports show these conditions impact learning and enrollment. GAO and DOI identified weaknesses in facility management, including lack of information, inadequate procedures, staffing, training, oversight, controls, and communication. BIA is responsible for school construction and facility replacements. The BIE school facilities face significant challenges, with deficiencies in old buildings impacting learning and enrollment. The estimated cost to replace, repair, construct, and improve these facilities is over $1.3 billion. In 2011, the EPA settled with BIA and BIE over alleged violations of waste, water, air, toxics, and community right-to-know laws. The original settlement with BIA and BIE in 2011 addressed violations in schools and water systems, requiring corrective actions and implementation of environmental practices. The agreement was modified in 2014 to include more facilities. Congress has mandated DOI to address ongoing facility needs and unsafe conditions. The No Child Left Behind Act established requirements for DOI to address school facility needs and distribute funds accordingly. In 2012, the BIA published a catalog of facilities and renovation formulas. In 2012, the BIA addressed school facilities needs by publishing a catalog of facilities and renovation formulas. Congress directed the BIA to develop replacement school priority lists, with a new list of 10 schools published in 2016. The FY2016 appropriations act funded replacement of the last two schools on the 2004 list. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized Qualified School Construction Bonds for construction, rehabilitation, or repair of public school facilities. Treasury allocated $200 million in 2009 and 2010 to DOI for Indian tribal governments. Treasury allocated $200 million in each of 2009 and 2010 to DOI for Indian tribal governments to construct or repair BIE-funded schools. However, as of May 2014, no tribe had utilized the program due to high risk factors. Suggestions to address poor facilities at BIE schools include additional funding for maintenance, public-private partnerships, and the establishment of a DOI-based unit for proper management. Indian education issues affecting public schools include the JOM freeze and the participation of Indian parents and tribes. JOM funds are distributed based on a count of Indian students and average per-pupil operating costs, with student counts frozen since FY1995. Efforts have been made to transfer JOM allocations to tribal priority allocations for more control and flexibility in funding use. The BIA froze JOM funds in FY1995 based on student counts, leading to the JOM freeze. Efforts to count current students are underway, but data collection on student needs and outcomes has ceased due to the freeze. The BIA froze JOM funds in FY1995 based on student counts, leading to the JOM freeze. Efforts to count current students are underway, but data collection on student needs and outcomes has ceased due to the freeze. Pre-1995 contractors can receive funding based on their 1995 student count regardless of the number of students served. Tribes have flexibility in managing funds through tribal priority allocation (TPA). Tribes receiving JOM as base funding depend on it as a stable funding source. BIE has been directed to count eligible students for JOM program and improve fund distribution methodology. Indian parents and tribes have increased participation in the education of Indian students. JOM, Impact Aid, and Indian Education formula grant programs require consultation with Indian stakeholders. Since FY2012, the ESEA Indian Education Programs have awarded demonstration grants to partnerships between tribes or tribal education departments (TEDs) and states, LEAs, or BIE schools to increase student achievement and cultural relevance of education. There is interest in increasing the role of Indian tribes in public schools, which may raise sovereignty, accountability, collective bargaining, and property ownership issues and impact non-Indian students. The Tribal Education Departments National Assembly has proposed allowing tribal consultation in education programs. The Tribal Education Departments National Assembly has proposed allowing tribal education departments to operate public schools, particularly those on or near reservations and with large enrollments of tribal children, funded under ESEA Title VI to increase cultural relevance and tribal influence."
