    "content": "The William D. Ford Direct Loan program is the main federal student loan program under the Higher Education Act of 1965. It offers loans to students and parents to finance education expenses, including four types of loans. The program is administered by the Office of Federal Student Aid within the U.S. Department of Education, with a loan portfolio of approximately $1.3 trillion. The Direct Loan program was established in 1993 to streamline the student loan delivery system, replacing the FFEL program. FFEL program involved private lenders and guaranty agencies, while Direct Loan program aimed to simplify the process. The FFEL program involved multiple parties from private and public sectors, with concerns about its monitoring and borrower/school burden. The Direct Loan program was meant to replace FFEL gradually but the transition was repealed in 1998. Both programs ran concurrently for nearly two decades until the SAFRA Act terminated new FFEL loans in 2010, shifting to the Direct Loan program where the government provides loans directly to students and families. The federal government serves as the banker for Direct Loans, providing loans to students and families using federal funds. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) within the Department of Education administers the program, ensuring integrity and providing support to institutions of higher education involved in Direct Loans. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) administer Direct Loans, verifying borrower eligibility, performing need analysis, and originating loans. Loan Servicers handle loan servicing, payments, and borrower communication. Private Collection Agencies (PCAs) are hired for loan collection services. Private Collection Agencies (PCAs) are nonfederal entities hired to collect payments on defaulted federal student loans. This report focuses on the statutory and regulatory provisions for the Direct Loan program, outlining FSA's role in developing administrative processes. It follows the lifecycle of a Direct Loan, highlighting key processes. The Direct Loan program is administered by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), which oversees the Title IV federal student aid programs. The program follows a lifecycle from application to repayment, with processes subject to regular updates. FSA is responsible for implementing policies and procedures for the program. The FSA, as a performance-based organization, is responsible for implementing policies and procedures for the Direct Loan program. PBOs are results-driven organizations with clear objectives and measurable goals to improve performance and transparency. The FSA, a performance-based organization, operates with greater discretion like private-sector companies. It manages administrative functions for federal student aid programs under the HEA Title IV, with the Secretary of Education retaining policy development responsibilities. The FSA is directed by the Secretary but the COO is consulted for regulations and policies. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) organization is responsible for various functions related to the administration of Title IV student aid programs. These functions include collecting, processing, and transmitting data, defining technical specifications, providing customer service and training, and ensuring program integrity. The Secretary may assign additional functions as needed. This report will focus on key functions related to student aid delivery, specifically the Direct Loan program. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) organization oversees the procurement and operation of Title IV processing systems, contracting for student loan servicing, and appointing a Student Loan Ombudsman to assist borrowers with loan disputes and issues. The Ombudsman helps resolve discrepancies, loan balances, payment issues, consolidation options, service quality, default status, and other loan-related matters. The Ombudsman assists borrowers with loan disputes, discrepancies, payment issues, and consolidation options. They cannot make binding decisions, accept complaints about grants, or replace formal dispute resolution channels within the Department of Education. This section discusses key aspects of Direct Loan program administration from FAFSA submission to loan disbursement. Key parties involved include FSA, IHEs, and third-party servicers. The Direct Loan program involves IHEs assessing students' financial need, packaging aid, disbursing funds, providing counseling, and reporting to NSLDS. Third-party servicers may also handle administrative duties. Students must apply for aid using FAFSA annually. The FAFSA is used to determine eligibility for Title IV aid and calculate expected family contribution. The EFC reflects financial resources expected to be used for the cost of attendance. FSA develops and maintains the FAFSA according to HEA specifications. Individuals typically submit the FAFSA online using income data from the previous tax year. In AY2017, the FAFSA will be available three months earlier, using income data from the tax year two years prior (PPY). The processing cycle will be 21 months, allowing applicants to submit the FAFSA starting on October 1. The FAFSA processing cycle will be 21 months, allowing applicants to submit the form between October 1, 2016, and June 30, 2018. FSA and IHEs play significant roles in processing the FAFSA, with FSA contracting for information technology systems and IHEs verifying student eligibility. The Central Processing System (CPS) processes the FAFSA, determining student eligibility for aid and calculating the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The Central Processing System (CPS) processes the FAFSA by verifying student information, linking tax data, calculating Expected Family Contribution (EFC), checking for errors, and providing Student Aid Reports (SAR) and Institutional Student Information Records (ISIR) to students and designated institutions. The Institutional Student Information Records (ISIR) are received by the IHE, which then verifies FAFSA information, adjusts data values, calculates student aid need, and packages aid awards. Verification is required to review FAFSA data accuracy, with potential items including adjusted gross income and household size. The CPS may select specific items for verification on applications. The CPS selects specific items on applications for verification, and IHEs must verify items they suspect are inaccurate. Around one-third of Title IV applicants are selected for verification annually by CPS. IHEs must request additional documentation for verification, and cannot disburse federal student aid before verification is completed if inaccuracies are suspected. IHEs have discretion to establish additional verification requirements. IHEs have the authority to withhold federal student aid until verification is complete. They calculate and determine aid eligibility, package aid, make disclosures to borrowers, disburse funds, and follow up as needed. Aid packaging is guided by eligibility requirements and student need. Eligibility for Title IV aid programs is based on student need, determined by the difference between cost of attendance and expected family contribution. HEA Section 472 defines allowable costs for the cost of attendance, with individual institutions determining specific amounts. Expenses like room and board may vary based on rental market rates, especially in high cost-of-living areas. The EFC is calculated using income and asset information provided on the FAFSA to determine the amount of financial resources expected from students and their families. IHEs' financial aid administrators then determine the types and amount of aid offered to students, starting with eligibility for a Pell Grant. Unmet need is calculated based on the remaining amount after the Pell Grant is awarded. After a Pell Grant is awarded, an IHE calculates unmet need and offers other forms of student aid based on various factors. Direct Loans, including Direct PLUS Loans, must not exceed the student's COA. There are statutory limits on the amount of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans a student can receive. An IHE must offer a Direct Subsidized Loan before a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and specific regulations guide the packaging of student aid. An IHE must offer a Direct Subsidized Loan before a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan before a Direct PLUS Loan. Students cannot receive a Direct Subsidized Loan for more than 150% of the program length. Financial aid packages are determined by the IHE and communicated to students through various means. Professional judgment can be used in special circumstances to adjust data affecting Title IV aid eligibility. Professional judgment can be used by Financial Aid Administrators (FAAs) to adjust data values for Title IV aid eligibility, including the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) or Cost of Attendance (COA). This authorization allows FAAs to respond to unforeseen situations, but cannot waive general eligibility requirements or circumvent regulations. FAAs must document the reason for using professional judgment, and any adjustments are only valid for the award year at the institution. Dependency overrides can also be used to classify a dependent student as independent for Title IV purposes. To receive federal student aid, a borrower must sign a master promissory note (MPN) containing loan terms and conditions. The MPN includes deferment, forbearance, discharge benefits, and consequences of default. Institutions must use the MPN as required by HEA Section 432. They can choose a multi- or single-year MPN option. Single-year MPNs limit disbursements to one year. IHEs can choose between using a single-year or multiyear MPN for Direct Loans. Single-year MPNs allow loans for one academic year, while multiyear MPNs allow loans for up to 10 years without needing a new MPN each year. Borrowers must confirm acceptance of a new Direct Loan for subsequent academic years. IHEs can originate Direct Loans after confirming borrower eligibility. After confirming borrower eligibility, an IHE submits student's information to FSA's COD system for processing. COD accepts origination records, allowing IHEs to request funds from FSA's G5 system for disbursement to borrowers. An FAA may use professional judgment under HEA Section 479A. An FAA under HEA Section 479A can use professional judgment to refuse or reduce a loan based on the borrower's ability to repay. Before disbursing Direct Loan funds, an IHE must provide disclosures and entrance loan counseling to borrowers. The amount and disbursement details of Title IV federal student aid must be disclosed to the student or parent for Direct PLUS loans. Prior to disbursing Direct Loans, institutions of higher education (IHEs) must provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the source of funds (subsidized or unsubsidized), the right to cancel all or part of the loan, and the procedures for doing so. IHEs using a multiyear Master Promissory Note (MPN) must also provide borrowers with a Plain Language Disclosure (PLD) developed by FSA, which includes information on loan terms, total balance owed, projected monthly payments, and other loan-related details. Prior to disbursing Direct Loans, institutions of higher education (IHEs) must provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the source of funds, the right to cancel all or part of the loan, and procedures for doing so. IHEs using a single-year MPN are not required to provide the PLD to borrowers, as borrowers complete a new MPN for each subsequent loan period. Entrance counseling is required before the first disbursement on a Direct Loan, providing information on loan terms, borrower rights, and responsibilities. The entrance counseling for Direct Loans at IHEs includes information on loan terms, borrower rights, repayment obligations, consequences of default, and options for financial assistance. IHEs can use FSA's online counseling tool or develop their own counseling methods. Disbursement is the process of distributing aid to borrowers, which can be done through various methods such as online, in-person, or with worksheets and exercises. IHEs must verify borrower eligibility before disbursing funds, which can be credited to the student's account or paid directly to the student or parent borrower. IHEs have discretion in scheduling disbursement of Title IV funds, but must do so promptly, following cash management regulations. Schools typically use the advance payment method to request funds after borrower eligibility verification. The school can request aid funds from the G5 system to disburse to students. If FSA has concerns about the school's compliance with Title IV requirements, they may require alternative cash management methods. Origination fees are charged to borrowers for Direct Loans to help cover costs. The borrower is responsible for repaying the entire amount of the loan borrowed, not just the amount disbursed. Origination fees for Direct Loans are deducted from the borrowed amount, with fees set at 1% for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and 4% for PLUS Loans. Recent budget sequestrations have led to increased origination fees. For loans disbursed between October 1, 2016, and October 1, 2017, fees are 1.069% for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans and 4.276% for PLUS Loans. In addition to aid eligibility and awarding, IHEs have responsibilities like returning funds, providing exit counseling, and reporting enrollment info to ED. Instances requiring return of Title IV aid include overpayments due to borrowing errors or early withdrawal. The return of Title IV funds depends on various circumstances, such as aid disbursement and student withdrawal. Overpayments can be resolved by reducing subsequent disbursements or notifying the loan servicer for outstanding funds. The return of Title IV funds depends on circumstances like aid disbursement and student withdrawal. Institutions must provide exit counseling to Direct Loan borrowers, covering repayment plans, debt management, and borrower rights. IHEs must report various information to ED regarding Title IV aid programs and student aid eligibility, using the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) to track and report on federal student aid records. The NSLDS includes details on student loans borrowed, loan originators, and servicers, and is maintained by an FSA contractor. Enrollment data for students who received Title IV aid must be reported to NSLDS. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) oversees the administration of Title IV student aid programs, including the Direct Loan program. They ensure that institutions of higher education (IHEs) meet eligibility requirements before participating in the programs. FSA also monitors enrollment information to determine borrower eligibility for loan benefits and repayment status. FSA oversees institutional eligibility requirements for Title IV programs, conducts compliance reviews and audits, and can impose sanctions for program deficiencies. Direct Loans are assigned to a loan servicer after disbursement for administrative functions. After Direct Loans are disbursed to borrowers, FSA oversees loan servicing contracts and monitors servicers. Loan servicers handle tasks like collecting payments, processing deferments, and preventing defaults for Direct Loans. Loan servicers are assigned by FSA to perform administrative functions such as processing payments and communicating with borrowers about their loans. HEA Section 456 allows ED to contract third-party entities for loan servicing tasks, with contracts specifying servicers' responsibilities to meet statutory requirements. Servicers handle specialized tasks like processing disability loan discharges and managing loans eligible for PSLF. Servicers have discretion in meeting statutory requirements for federal student loans, responsible for ensuring borrower loan terms are met. Specific tasks vary, with servicers performing common functions for Direct Loans. Tasks depend on individual circumstances, such as difficulty making payments or seeking loan forgiveness benefits. The section describes loan servicing activities for Direct Loan borrowers, including tasks performed by servicers in special circumstances like delinquency or default. Servicers ensure loan terms are met by providing disclosures before repayment and periodically during repayment. Loan servicing activities for Direct Loan borrowers include processing payments, providing repayment plan options, calculating monthly payments, recertifying borrower eligibility for income-driven plans, collecting payments, processing deferment or forbearance requests, consolidating loans, and reporting loan status to consumers. Loan servicing activities for Direct Loan borrowers include processing payments, providing repayment plan options, calculating monthly payments, recertifying borrower eligibility for income-driven plans, collecting payments, processing deferment or forbearance requests, consolidating loans, reporting loan status to consumers, and carrying out special circumstances tasks assigned by FSA. Some specialized tasks include applying a 6% interest rate cap to eligible borrowers. Loan servicing activities for Direct Loan borrowers involve processing requests for interest rate cap, loan forgiveness, loan discharge, and loan transfers. Delinquency occurs after a missed payment, while default is after 270 days of non-payment. Default is not operational until transferred to FSA's Debt Management. The Direct Loan program treats loans as in default after 360 days of nonpayment, and loan servicers engage in various activities to address delinquency before transferring to DMCS. The federal government assumes the risk of loss through borrower default and is responsible for collecting payments on outstanding federal student loans. The federal government authorizes third-party entities to service federal student loans, including processing deferment and loan cancellation applications. FSA maintains contracts with nine loan servicers for this purpose. Prior to 2009, Direct Loan servicing was handled by a single servicer, while FFEL program loan servicing was managed by various lenders and organizations. In 2009, FSA awarded contracts to four new loan servicers, known as Title IV Additional Servicers (TIVAS), to handle federally held student loans. The SAFRA Act in 2010 required ED to contract with eligible not-for-profit (NFP) servicers for Direct Loans. TIVAS and NFPs operated side by side with different funding sources and contract provisions. TIVAS were compensated with discretionary funds and had performance-based contracts with FSA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 eliminated mandatory funding for NFP servicing contracts with FSA. NFPs are now compensated under discretionary funds like TIVAS. Initially, NFPs were allocated a minimum of 100,000 borrower accounts, with reallocation based on performance. Performance requirements for NFPs were similar but not identical to TIVAS. The performance metrics for NFPs and TIVAS were initially different but later aligned in 2014. NFPs started receiving newly originated loans in January 2015 and competed separately until March 1, 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 directed new student loan accounts to be allocated based on performance, leading to competition between TIVAS and NFPs for new Direct Loans. As of March 1, 2016, TIVAS and NFPs now compete for new Direct Loan allocations based on performance metrics and a single pricing schedule. FSA contracts with federal student loan servicers are performance-based to promote competition and provide the best services to borrowers. Compensation and new borrower accounts are allocated based on FSA-specified metrics. Federal student loan servicers are compensated based on FSA-specified metrics, including a monthly rate for each borrower account in different repayment statuses and bonuses for meeting delinquency reduction benchmarks. Federal student loan servicers are compensated based on FSA-specified metrics, including a monthly rate for each borrower account in different repayment statuses and bonuses for meeting delinquency reduction benchmarks. The compensation schedule incentivizes servicers to keep borrower accounts in active repayment status to avoid delinquency or default. FSA allocates new borrower accounts based on servicers' performance in five metrics, such as customer service satisfaction and the percentage of borrowers in current repayment status. The allocation performance metrics for federal student loan servicers incentivize desirable outcomes like high customer satisfaction by giving greater weight to certain metrics. Loan servicers have discretion in internal processes, but FSA oversees their performance. FSA oversees federal student loan servicers' performance through various mechanisms, including setting goals for allocation and compensation, issuing guidance, conducting monitoring activities, and completing compliance audits. Concerns have been raised about varying levels of customer service, such as difficulties in contacting servicers due to lack of minimum standards for call center hours and inconsistencies in website operations. FSA was directed by Congress to publish a common policies and procedures manual for all Direct Loan servicers by March 1, 2016, to address concerns about inconsistent customer experiences. However, FSA missed the deadline and has not yet published the manual. In preparation for the expiration of current loan servicers' contracts in 2019, FSA has initiated the competitive process for new student loan servicer contracts, aiming to award a contract for a \"single servicing solution.\" The FSA plans to award a contract for a \"single servicing solution\" to provide a unified loan servicing platform for all ED-held loans. Multiple customer service providers would have access to the platform to assist borrowers, allowing them to manage their loans through a single website. Contractors competing for the contract would be evaluated based on their ability to comply with policy directions developed by ED officials, including ensuring borrower access to personalized servicing. The Secretary of Education withdrew policy directions aimed at improving federal student loan servicing, including access to knowledgeable staff and income-driven repayment plans. The impact of this withdrawal on future loan servicing contracts is uncertain. If a borrower defaults on a Direct Loan, actions may be taken to reinstate it and recover payments. The section discusses administrative processes for borrowers who default on Direct Loans. Key parties involved are FSA, DMCS, PCAs, and DRG. DMCS stores debtor information, generates correspondence, and processes payments on defaulted loans. DRG manages FSA's collection efforts and makes initial attempts at collecting on defaulted loans. FSA focuses on collecting payments on defaulted loans through DMCS and Private Collection Agencies. Borrowers are considered in default after 270 days of missed payments, with consequences including full payment demand, credit reporting, and loss of federal student aid eligibility. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) utilizes voluntary and involuntary debt collection options to collect on defaulted Direct Loans. The Default Resolution Group (DRG) and Private Collection Agencies (PCAs) may use various methods to collect payments, with no specific sequence required by statutory or regulatory provisions. The DRG and PCAs use various methods to collect defaulted Direct Loans, including rehabilitation, loan consolidation, and litigation as a last resort. Multiple payment collection options may be utilized simultaneously. The DMCS, DRG, PCAs, and FSA work together to resolve defaulted Direct Loans. DMCS handles debt collection and other functions, while DRG serves as the contact center. If a borrower doesn't take action within 60 days, the loan may be assigned to a PCA for further collection efforts. The FSA may decide not to assign a borrower's account to a PCA if the amount owed is less than $500, in which case the loan remains in DMCS. PCAs may return defaulted loans to DMCS if unsuccessful in collection. DMCS handles debt collection activities, identifies accounts for rehabilitation or administrative resolution, processes payments, and reports loan status to NSLDS. The FSA assigns delinquent Direct Loans to PCAs for debt resolution functions, including determining eligibility for administrative resolutions and involuntary payment methods. Federal statutes and regulations govern ED debt collection. Regulations govern federal debt collection, including ED debt collection through PCAs. The Federal Claims Collections Standards and ED regulations outline collection standards, while the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act sets standards for debt collectors. PCAs have specific tasks outlined in contracts with FSA, with some discretion in completing them. The report provides an overview of the functions performed by PCAs in debt collection tasks. PCAs have discretion in meeting statutory, regulatory, and contract requirements. Their primary function is to collect payments on defaulted Direct Loans, with various options available depending on individual borrower circumstances. PCAs in debt collection tasks focus on determining borrower eligibility for administrative resolutions, such as loan discharge or collection suspension. If these options are not available, PCAs offer voluntary debt resolution options like payment schedules or loan rehabilitation. They may also consider compromising on loan payments based on individual circumstances. PCAs in debt collection tasks focus on negotiating with borrowers, locating and contacting defaulted borrowers, providing information on consequences of default, preparing accounts for litigation, and returning accounts to FSA if unable to convert to active repayment status. FSA may transfer borrower cases to a new PCA or prepare accounts for administrative resolution. They may also refer cases to the Department of Justice for litigation or certify accounts for the Treasury Offset Program. The TOP collects delinquent debts by withholding federal benefits payments. FSA maintains contracts with multiple PCAs for debt collection activities. The FSA currently has contracts with multiple PCAs for debt collection activities, with contracts awarded to seven PCAs in December 2016. Compensation for PCAs is based on performance, with payment either a commission or a flat fee depending on the collection method. Commissions can be up to 15.2% of the total amount collected on a loan. The FSA has contracts with PCAs for debt collection, with payment based on performance. PCAs can receive up to $1,710 per loan rehabilitation and $150 for administrative resolutions. New accounts will be allocated based on performance metrics using the CPME system. The FSA uses performance metrics to allocate new borrower accounts to PCAs. A Base Allocation (BA) score is calculated based on resolved borrowers and dollars collected. PCAs failing to meet a minimum threshold will be ineligible for new accounts. A Service Quality (SQ) score is then calculated, adjusting the BA score based on call counseling compliance and borrower satisfaction. The Adjusted Allocation Score determines new account allocations for each PCA. PCAs failing to meet a minimum SQ score will also be ineligible for new accounts. The FSA uses various tools to oversee PCAs' debt collection activities, including Evaluation Scores calculated quarterly for each PCA. These scores reflect performance compared to other PCAs and are considered along with compliance with laws and borrower interactions. Concerns have been raised about FSA's oversight. The FSA has faced concerns about its monitoring of PCA performance, particularly in phone-call monitoring. The GAO found issues with incomplete reviews of calls and raised concerns about PCAs providing inaccurate information to borrowers. FSA's lack of effective monitoring may lead to missed opportunities for oversight and program improvement. The 2016 PCA contracts may help address some of these issues."
