    "content": "Several protests nationwide have raised concerns about local law enforcement practices, including the use of chokeholds and military-style equipment. Incidents like Eric Garner's death in Staten Island, Freddie Gray's spinal cord injury in Baltimore, and the police response in Ferguson with armored vehicles and military rifles have fueled the discussion. Critics also question the relationship between prosecutors and police departments, pointing out low prosecution rates for officers involved in violent crimes. In Ferguson, a grand jury did not indict the police officer in Michael Brown's shooting death, and in Staten Island, another grand jury did not charge the officer involved in Eric Garner's chokehold. The enforcement of laws for revenue has been criticized for compromising judicial integrity, as seen in a DOJ investigation into Ferguson's police department. Concerns arise over discrimination against minority groups due to these practices. Several Members of Congress have proposed measures to address discrimination by state and local law enforcement and judicial officers, but imposing federal restrictions raises constitutional issues regarding the government's authority over these entities. This report will analyze constitutional principles in relation to legislative proposals and current federal laws that apply to local and state law enforcement agencies. The Constitution constrains local law enforcement and judicial officers to protect individual rights. Most provisions of the Bill of Rights are applicable to states, including protections against unreasonable searches, self-incrimination, fair trials, and cruel punishment. The U.S. Constitution sets a minimum standard for constitutional rights, but state laws can impose stricter regulations on police. The federal government can influence local police behavior through funding programs like the Community Oriented Policing Statute (COPS) and the Edward Byrne grant. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program awards funds to state and local governments to combat crime, distributed based on violent crime rates and population. Funding can be used for law enforcement, prosecution, prevention, and education programs. Recipients must not discriminate based on race, religion, or sex in employment or funded activities. Private rights of action can be pursued for enforcement, and the Attorney General can take legal action against governments engaging in discriminatory practices. The federal government can enforce requirements by revoking funding from state or local governments that violate provisions under the JAG and COPS programs. Criminal charges can be brought against agents involved in bribery if the government entity receives over $10,000 of federal funds. The Death in Custody Reporting Act conditions federal grants on states reporting deaths in police custody to the Attorney General. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits racial discrimination in federally funded programs, with agencies monitoring compliance and terminating funding for violations. Private individuals can also enforce the statute's provisions through legal action. The federal government can bring criminal charges against individuals who violate civil rights under the Constitution or laws of the United States. This includes charging law enforcement officers for excessive force. The government can also sue state and local law enforcement agencies for patterns of conduct that violate constitutional rights, leading to consent decrees for policy changes. The DOJ can bring criminal charges against individuals for violating civil rights. Consent decrees can be imposed on law enforcement agencies for policy changes. Local and state law enforcement officers may face civil liability for violating individuals' rights. The liability of municipalities and individual government officials for civil rights violations is limited. Municipalities are only liable for their own illegal acts, not those of their employees. To establish liability, plaintiffs must show that official municipal policy or widespread practices caused the constitutional injury. Qualified immunity protects government officials from civil damages unless they clearly violated a statutory or constitutional right. Proposed changes to federal law aim to address police misconduct. Proposed changes to federal law aim to address police misconduct by conditioning the receipt of federal funds by local law enforcement agencies on the adoption of certain policies, such as acquiring body-worn cameras, using special prosecutors in police-related cases, conducting racial bias training, punishing officers for violent crimes, prohibiting racial profiling, and ending funding for agencies that engage in misconduct. The proposed changes to federal law aim to address police misconduct by conditioning the receipt of federal funds on the adoption of certain policies, such as prohibiting racial profiling, ending the receipt of military-type equipment by local law enforcement, and forming task forces to deter discrimination. Other proposals include making the enforcement of laws for revenue a civil rights violation, prohibiting chokeholds, and enforcing laws against racial profiling by law enforcement agents. The federal government's powers are limited by the Constitution, which enumerates specific authorities in various areas like tax collection. The federal government's authority is limited by the Constitution, with Congress having the power to collect taxes, regulate commerce, and declare war. States have a general power of governing, known as police power, allowing them to regulate property, operate police forces, and establish schools. Congress can also make laws necessary to carry out its enumerated powers. The Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact laws that are convenient or useful for the exercise of its enumerated powers, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. This broad power does not require statutes to be absolutely necessary but must be rationally related to implementing a constitutionally enumerated power. Congress can enact criminal laws and toll limitations periods for state-law claims to further its enumerated powers. The Supreme Court has the power to establish lower federal courts and ensure they exercise the judicial power of the United States fairly and efficiently. It also has the responsibility to declare laws unconstitutional if they undermine the government structure established by the Constitution. The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Congress the authority to violate other constitutional principles, and the Tenth Amendment limits Congress from commandeering state governments. Any proposals to address local law enforcement at the federal level must align with constitutionally enumerated powers. At the federal level, issues must align with constitutionally enumerated powers or the Necessary and Proper Clause, with authority reserved to states otherwise. Congress can disperse funds to states under the Spending Clause for the \"general Welfare,\" with conditions attached. Failure to comply can lead to fund termination, enforced by federal agencies or the DOJ. Spending Clause legislation can also authorize enforcement. Congress can disperse funds to states under the Spending Clause for the \"general Welfare,\" with conditions attached. Spending Clause legislation can authorize private rights of action to enforce the terms of the statute, including monetary damages for intentional violations. Congress may enact legislation to ensure proper use of federal funds. Section 666 of Title 18 imposes federal criminal penalties on bribery by officials of state and local governments receiving over $10,000 in federal funds. The Supreme Court upheld the statute allowing Congress to impose conditions on federal funds dispersed to states under the Spending Clause. The Court ruled that corruption does not have to be directly linked to federal funds to affect the federal interest, allowing for criminal charges under the statute. Additionally, the Court upheld provisions of the Hatch Act that restricted partisan political activity for state employees funded by federal money. Congress can indirectly achieve objectives through Spending Clause legislation, imposing conditions on federal funds to states. The power is limited by restrictions outlined in South Dakota v. Dole, including that conditions must be related to the \"general welfare\" and not violate separate constitutional provisions. Courts are advised to defer to Congress's judgment on spending power legislation. The Supreme Court emphasizes that courts should defer to Congress's judgment on Spending Clause legislation, especially regarding the imposition of conditions on federal funds to states. The Court requires clear notice for states to be held liable for violations of these conditions, treating them as contractual agreements between the states and the federal government. The Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975 conditions funding for states on specific requirements. In Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, the Court ruled that the \"bill of rights\" section did not create enforceable legal obligations on states due to vague language. States can challenge conditions on federal funds or penalties for non-compliance. The Court has required \"clear notice\" for imposing conditions on states receiving federal funds, but it's unclear if this applies to remedies for state non-compliance. Accepting federal money may impose conditions different from enforcement options. The Court has allowed conditions on federal funds that aren't strict restrictions, as seen in South Dakota v. Dole where states had to raise the legal drinking age or lose 5% of highway funds. The Supreme Court has ruled that conditions attached to federal funds must be directly related to the main purposes for which the funds are expended, such as safe interstate travel. However, these conditions cannot induce states to engage in unconstitutional activities, like discrimination based on race. Spending Clause legislation must also comply with the Tenth Amendment, prohibiting the commandeering of state governments or coercing states into participating in federal programs. The Supreme Court has ruled that conditions attached to federal funds must be directly related to the main purposes for which the funds are expended, such as safe interstate travel. In Dole, the Court considered financial inducements that could be coercive but deemed a 5% loss of federal highway funds as mild encouragement. However, in NFIB v. Sebelius, the Court invalidated provisions of the Affordable Care Act that required states to expand Medicaid or risk losing funding, stating that the new conditions represented a significant shift and must be unambiguous. The Supreme Court ruled that conditions on federal funds must be directly related to their main purposes. In NFIB v. Sebelius, the Court found that threatening to terminate significant grants to pressure states into policy changes was coercive. The Court deemed the threat of losing over 10% of a state's budget for Medicaid expansion as economic coercion, leaving states with no real choice. There are proposals to regulate local law enforcement by attaching conditions to federal funds. Several proposals to regulate local law enforcement by attaching conditions to federal funds are unlikely to raise concerns regarding Congress's Spending Clause power. For example, providing new funds for law enforcement to purchase body-worn cameras or establishing task forces for cooperation between officers and communities would not impose undue coercion on states. The Supreme Court has not clearly defined the \"relationship\" requirement for conditions on federal funds under the Spending Clause. Some proposals suggest conditioning the receipt of federal funds by law enforcement agencies on new requirements, such as racial bias training or policies against racial profiling. One proposal suggests conditioning federal funds on policies prohibiting racial profiling and appointing special prosecutors in police-related shootings. Congress's purpose might justify these requirements to prevent misuse of funds and ensure impartial law enforcement. The proposals seek to impose new conditions on federal funds, including penalties for non-compliance. Chief Justice Roberts indicated in NFIB that past adjustments to programs were permissible, but new expansions must be unambiguous to meet requirements. The proposals aim to impose new conditions on federal funds, potentially constituting coercion. Chief Justice Roberts suggested that adjustments to existing programs are permissible, but new expansions must be unambiguous. Title VI bars racial discrimination by recipients of federal funds, new conditions on federal funds may impose training obligations, ban specific police tactics, and require the appointment of a special prosecutor in cases of violent crimes by police officers. These conditions may be seen as broader requirements than in the past, but the funds at risk for non-compliance appear to be more of a \"mild encouragement\" rather than coercion. In NFIB, the Court ruled that Congress cannot penalize states by withholding existing Medicaid funding for not participating in a new program. In contrast, states have a voluntary choice to accept new conditions for federal funds. The total federal funds at risk in Dole was $614.7 million for highways, while $233 billion was dispersed to states in 2010 under Medicaid. In FY2014, approximately $280 million was distributed under the JAG program. The JAG and COPS programs received a total of $420 million in federal funds, lower than the Medicaid expansion in NFIB. States have the choice to adopt new conditions for receiving funds, making it unlikely that Congress has imposed coercive financial inducements. Another proposal suggests federalizing crimes of violence by law enforcement officers, which may stretch legislation justified under the Spending Clause. The Court examined a statute criminalizing bribery by officials of state and local governments receiving federal funds over $10,000 per year, determining it was not a condition on fund receipt but a means to combat corruption. Congress can impose conditions on state use of federal funds under the Spending Clause. The Court examined a statute criminalizing bribery by officials of state and local governments receiving federal funds over $10,000 per year, determining it was not a condition on fund receipt but a means to combat corruption. Congress can impose conditions on state use of federal funds under the Spending Clause. However, a statute criminalizing behavior of third parties, even if they are officials of entities that receive federal funds, may not be considered a condition on fund receipt. The case of Sabri involved the criminalization of the conversion of public funds into personal gain, which could be seen as regulating law enforcement officials in their official capacity. This could potentially subject police officers to federal criminal liability, requiring separate constitutional authority other than the Spending Clause. Congress has authority under the Spending Clause to disperse funds for the general welfare and ensure they are spent properly. This authority may not extend to federalizing crimes of violence by local and state officers unless it is related to the federal interest in the use of funds. The federal government's interest in banning discrimination could serve as a precedent for such conditions on fund receipt. The federal government has an interest in ensuring that federal funds are not used for committing crimes of violence against individuals. Congress has passed legislation barring discrimination based on race, sex, disability, and age by recipients of any federal funds. The Supreme Court has not clearly defined the \"relationship\" required for conditions on fund receipt, but has upheld legislation barring discrimination in the past. In Sabri, the Court found that Congress has power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to oversee the use of taxpayer dollars appropriated under federal funds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that disability discrimination by recipients of federal money \"fritters away\" federal funds, aligning with Congress's goal of preventing transportation funds from facilitating disability discrimination. This decision supports the idea that federalizing crimes of violence by police officers could be upheld as a condition on state and local government use of federal funds. The Supreme Court has identified three areas where legislation regulating local law enforcement might be supported by the Commerce Clause, as states have primary authority to criminalize local conduct. Congress cannot punish felonies generally, but can regulate foreign and interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has identified three areas where Congress may regulate under the authority of foreign and interstate commerce: regulating the \"channels\" of interstate commerce, regulating the \"instrumentalities\" of interstate commerce, and regulating activities with a substantial relation to interstate commerce. This includes criminalizing the theft of property in interstate shipment and the local cultivation of controlled substances. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress can regulate intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana under the Commerce Clause to prevent interference with the interstate market. This power has limits, as shown in United States v. Lopez where the Court invalidated a law related to gun-free school zones. In United States v. Lopez, the Court invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, stating it exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. The government's argument linking violent crime to the national economy was rejected as the statute lacked a connection to economic activity. The Court emphasized the need for a jurisdictional element to ensure interstate commerce impact. The Court in United States v. Morrison invalidated a provision of the Violence Against Women Act, stating that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause by relying on a \"but-for causal chain\" to regulate violent criminal conduct. This ruling prevents Congress from regulating non-economic crimes based on their impact on interstate commerce. The Court ruled that Congress cannot regulate non-economic, violent criminal conduct solely based on its effect on interstate commerce. In Jones v. United States, the Court narrowly interpreted a statute to avoid addressing whether Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause authority, leading to the vacating of a conviction for arson of a non-commercial private residence. The Court has noted the difficulty in distinguishing between economic and non-economic activity, stating that economics refers to the production, distribution, and consumption of commodities. It has upheld a statute criminalizing local marijuana cultivation due to its connection to an interstate market. However, the Court has made it clear that regulating non-economic, violent criminal conduct solely based on its impact on interstate commerce may not be valid legislation under the Commerce Clause. The Court has clarified that certain activities, such as possession of a gun in a school zone and gender-motivated violence, are not considered economic activity. This extends to crimes of violence committed by law enforcement officers, which may not fall under economic activity. To be constitutionally sound, proposals to regulate violent crimes by police officers may need a jurisdictional element to limit their application. The Court has clarified that certain activities, such as possession of a gun in a school zone and gender-motivated violence, are not considered economic activity. This extends to crimes of violence committed by law enforcement officers, which may not fall under economic activity. To be constitutionally sound, proposals to regulate violent crimes by police officers may need a jurisdictional element to limit their application. Federal statutes criminalize behavior related to interstate commerce, while proposals to ban racial profiling or chokeholds by law enforcement agents without a connection to federal funds or the Fourteenth Amendment may face constitutional challenges. Congress's power under the Commerce Clause to ban municipalities from enforcing laws for revenue purposes is a complex issue. The law must be limited to activities involving interstate commerce or justified as regulating economic activity that affects interstate commerce. The operation of a municipality's revenue stream, used for purchasing goods and services and paying salaries, could be considered economic activity. A court would then assess if Congress has a rational basis for concluding that such activity substantially impacts interstate commerce. The Court has been deferential to Congress's determination that economic activities have a connection to interstate commerce, as seen in Perez v. United States where a federal criminal statute outlawing loan sharking was upheld. Even if Congress can regulate an activity under the Commerce Clause, it cannot violate state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has rejected commandeering challenges when federal legislation regulates states directly, but a federal law banning state and local officials from executing the law in a particular manner may raise constitutional concerns. Proposals to bar state and local officials from enforcing the law in a manner intended to raise revenue have been discussed, but no formal bill has been introduced yet. A comprehensive analysis of such a proposal is premature. Several congressional proposals may address police misconduct by imposing civil or criminal liability on individuals who engage in prohibited conduct. Legislation without ties to federal funds could be supported by Congress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Congress has previously imposed liability on individuals who violate constitutional rights or privileges under color of law. Congress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allows for the enactment of legislation to deter violations of rights guaranteed under the Constitution. This includes imposing civil liability for deprivations of rights under federal law through 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Eleventh Amendment limits suits for damages against states, but Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The statutes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 18 U.S.C \u00a7 242 provide a method for addressing deprivations of federal rights under the Constitution. These statutes incorporate constitutional law by reference and focus on the deprivation of separate constitutional rights. Police misconduct proposals often target specific practices. Several proposals aim to address police misconduct by identifying specific practices as civil rights violations under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 242, such as chokeholds and using laws for revenue. These proposals would need constitutional authority to withstand challenges, as they must show that the conduct violates federal statutory rights or constitutional clauses like Due Process or Equal Protection. Some aspects of these proposals may already be protected by the Constitution and could be subject to legal challenges. Certain proposals may be protected by the Constitution and challenged through Section 1983 or Section 242 litigation. Claims can be made under Section 1983 against police officers for using chokeholds as excessive force and for racial profiling. The Supreme Court allows injunctive relief in some cases to stop unlawful police practices. Congress can enforce the Fourteenth Amendment beyond just prohibiting unconstitutional conduct. Congress has the authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment by prohibiting a broader range of conduct, even if not explicitly forbidden by the Constitution. This includes enacting prophylactic legislation to prevent unconstitutional behavior. However, this power is limited to regulating state and local governments, not private individuals, and cannot change the substance of the underlying right being enforced. For example, Congress cannot use this power to expand protections for religious expression. The Supreme Court has emphasized the need for congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented and the means adopted to that end when Congress seeks to enforce constitutional protections. This analysis is easier when Congress aims to enforce rights subject to more rigorous judicial review. The courts will find congruence and proportionality between the protected right and the remedy provided. Courts consider the scope of the constitutional right and the weight of unconstitutional behavior before enacting prophylactic legislation. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the Court justified unprecedented remedies due to widespread deprivation of constitutional rights. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the Court justified unprecedented remedies for widespread deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from the country's history of racial discrimination. In contrast, in Kimel v. Board of Regents, the Court invalidated a provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act due to lack of evidence of unconstitutional discrimination, indicating that broad prophylactic legislation was unnecessary. The necessary quantum of evidence to sustain legislation is not clearly indicated by the Court, but generally, the greater the evidence of widespread violations of a constitutional right, the more likely the record will support prophylactic legislation. Prophylactic legislation is supported by evidence of unconstitutional conduct, national surveys, and judicial decisions. However, studies of violations in a single state, isolated examples, and lack of specific findings may not be sufficient. The standard for evidence required remains unclear, with conflicting conclusions from the \"congruency and proportionality\" test. The validity of prophylactic legislation under Section 5 depends on the relationship between the evidence and the legislative record. The validity of prophylactic legislation under Section 5 depends on the severity of the constitutional violation and the nature of the remedies imposed. For example, legislation banning chokeholds by law enforcement officers aims to deter excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Courts reviewing such legislation consider the importance of fundamental rights and history of discrimination. Courts reviewing prophylactic legislation for Fourth Amendment excessive force claims consider the objective reasonableness standard from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. Congress may face challenges in proving a history of constitutional violations, especially when the underlying right is not subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. Evidence of widespread use of chokeholds in violation of the Fourth Amendment would likely be necessary to support such legislation. The congressional record must show a clear link between police use of chokeholds and constitutional violations to justify criminal liability. Banning chokeholds entirely may be seen as excessive, as they can be necessary in certain situations. Criminal liability for officers is a severe measure, with alternative remedies like damages or injunctions available. The severity of criminal liability for violations of Fourth Amendment rights may not always be proportional. The Constitution requires fair procedures even in civil cases, with a due process protection against personal interests influencing adjudication. For example, due process was violated when a judge imposed fines that funded his compensation and city budget. The judge's compensation was derived from fines, which affected the city budget. Due process was violated when fines were imposed that funded the judge's compensation and city budget. The decisionmakers' position must not offer a temptation to forget the burden of proof. Congress must show that its remedy is proportional to the violation. The congressional record highlights unconstitutional enforcement of laws by individuals with personal interests. Barring law enforcement for revenue raises questions on the proportionality of Congress's remedy. The Court rejected a due process challenge to fines funding a mayor's salary, as it did not affect the outcome of cases. Proposals to ban fines for revenue could impact similar situations. The proposal to ban fines for revenue-raising purposes may raise concerns about the disproportionate scope of such a measure and its potential impact on equal protection under the law. Violations of the Equal Protection Clause could occur if enforcement activities target minority communities, leading to discriminatory effects. Congress may consider barring law enforcement for revenue as a remedy to address these issues. Congress may need to demonstrate a history of constitutional violations to support legislation banning enforcement of laws for revenue-raising purposes in order to protect equal protection rights. Discrimination based on race, subject to heightened scrutiny, may lower the burden for such legislation. However, there must be a clear link between the remedy imposed and the constitutional right being protected. A proposal targeting minorities specifically is a narrower remedy compared to a blanket ban on such enforcement activities. A narrow remedy targeting minorities in legislation against racial profiling by law enforcement officers is more likely to be considered proportional to the constitutional violation. Plaintiffs must show discriminatory effect and purpose to prove a violation. Proposal would ban law enforcement from using race, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation in selection. The proposal prohibits law enforcement agencies from using race, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation in selecting individuals for investigation, except in certain circumstances. Evidence of a disparate impact is considered prima facie evidence of a violation, potentially expanding rights under the Equal Protection Clause. The proposal aims to expand rights under the Equal Protection Clause by prohibiting law enforcement agencies from using certain criteria in investigations. The remedy's scope may be disproportional to the underlying constitutional violation, pending Congress's record review."
