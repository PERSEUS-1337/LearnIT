    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Global Forest Restoration Investment Tax Credit Act\" and introduces a new section for a Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Global Forest Restoration Investment Tax Credit Act introduces a Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit for eligible taxpayers investing in approved projects. The credit is based on the amount of carbon sequestered in the project and the percentage of total investment represented by the taxpayer's contribution. The Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit limits the credit amount to 50% of the taxpayer's investment in the project. There is also an annual limitation on the total credit allowable for all eligible taxpayers investing in the project. The Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit limits the credit dollar amount allocated to projects approved by the implementing panel to $250,000,000 per calendar year. Allocation must be made by the end of the year in which the project proposal is approved. Eligibility is determined by the taxpayer and the implementing panel. The Carbon Sequestration Investment Tax Credit allows taxpayers to claim a credit for carbon sequestration projects if they have not elected certain provisions of the International Carbon Conservation Act. A recapture of the credit may occur if a recapture event happens during the 30-year project period, increasing the tax for that year by the credit recapture amount. The credit recapture amount is determined by a recapture percentage based on when the recapture event occurs during the 30-year project period. The recapture percentage is 100% if it happens in the first 10 years, 66 2/3% in the second 10 years, 33 1/3% in the third 10 years, and 0% thereafter. The recapture event for a carbon sequestration project triggers a recapture percentage based on the violation of project terms, adoption of defeating practices, or disposal of ownership interest. The implementing panel determines the attribution of events to the project, with exceptions for events outside the taxpayer's control. Tax liability increases only for credits used, not carried forward or back. The basis of investment in a carbon sequestration project is reduced by any credit received. No tax credits can be used to determine the amount of any credit under this chapter. No charitable deduction is allowed for contributions certified by the implementing panel. The International Carbon Conservation Act requires certification to the Secretary for investments in carbon sequestration projects by eligible taxpayers. The implementing panel certifies the amount of the investment credit, recapture events, and recapture amounts annually. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this process. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for the International Carbon Conservation Act, including limits on subsidized investments, prevention of abuse through related parties, and reporting requirements. The carbon sequestration investment credit will be added to the general business credit under the Internal Revenue Code. Unused credit deductions will also be addressed.
