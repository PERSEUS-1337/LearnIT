    "content": "Most states provide Medicaid payments to cover the costs of training new doctors in teaching hospitals and programs. Medicare and Medicaid programs recognize two components of Graduate Medical Education (GME) costs: direct graduate medical education (DGME) and indirect graduate medical education (IME). In 2007, CMS proposed a rule to eliminate federal reimbursement for both DGME and IME under Medicaid, arguing that GME payments are not authorized in the Medicaid statute. The Obama Administration withdrew a rule that aimed to eliminate federal reimbursement for Graduate Medical Education (GME) costs under Medicaid. Intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) are used by some states to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid costs. Certain IGTs are allowed for funding the state share of program costs. Federal law protects states' ability to use funds derived from state or local sources for Medicaid. The federal law protects states' ability to use funds from state or local taxes for Medicaid costs. Some states have programs where hospitals or nursing homes pay the Medicaid state share to draw down additional federal matching funds. A CMS rule clarified allowable IGTs for financing Medicaid costs and imposed limits on reimbursements for government-owned providers. The CMS rule imposed limits on Medicaid reimbursements and established documentation requirements for certified public expenditures. Opponents argued that the rule overstepped CMS's authority and could shift costs to states. A federal court found the rule was improperly promulgated due to violating a congressional moratorium. The court vacated the CMS rule for violating the congressional moratorium on finalizing the proposed rule. Provider-specific taxes are used by states to fund Medicaid, with states collecting funds from providers and claiming federal matching funds. The federal matching funds claimed from provider-specific taxes in Medicaid can be used to raise payment rates, fund program portions, or for non-Medicaid purposes. Taxes must meet federal laws and regulations, including being broad-based, uniform, and not involving \"hold harmless\" arrangements. In 2008, CMS issued a rule to revise tax program thresholds for federal reimbursement. The 2008 CMS rule revised tax program thresholds for federal reimbursement, clarified hold harmless arrangements, established permissible health care services for provider taxes, and removed obsolete language. Opponents raised concerns about consistency, clarity, and exceeding authority. The rule took effect on April 22, 2008, with a moratorium until July 1, 2009, prohibiting CMS from implementing more restrictive provisions. The final rule included provisions that were more restrictive than those in effect on February 21, 2008, with exceptions for statutorily required changes. CMS later delayed enforcement of certain changes to hold harmless provisions in the provider taxes rule for one year to assess the impact and ensure proper implementation of Medicaid rehabilitation services. Both the executive and legislative branches have addressed this benefit, with proposed administrative changes to reduce Medicaid rehabilitation expenditures. The proposed rule aimed to clarify Medicaid rehabilitation benefits, but faced opposition over concerns of creating administrative barriers and limiting access to mental health services. Critics argued it could reduce funding for community-based services, leading to increased reliance on institutional care for individuals with disabilities. Congress imposed a moratorium to prevent the HHS Secretary from finalizing the rule. The Obama Administration withdrew a proposed rule on Medicaid rehabilitation benefits due to various factors, including opposition from Congress, complexity of issues, public comments, and the need for flexibility in exploring options. Case management services help Medicaid beneficiaries access medical services, with targeted case management focusing on specific groups or geographic areas. The Bush Administration proposed changes to reduce Medicaid TCM expenditures, leading to new statutory language in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Secretary of HHS issued regulations in 2007 to clarify case management definitions and control federal outlays. This rule applied to all case management services, including TCM and waivers, to avoid excessive spending. The proposed rule aimed to reduce Medicaid TCM expenditures and clarify case management definitions to control federal outlays. Opponents argued it was too restrictive and could lead to cuts in TCM services. A moratorium was placed on the rule until July 1, 2009, to prevent more restrictive restrictions on case management services. The moratorium on the interim final rule related to case management services was lifted on July 1, 2009. Changes were made to address concerns about restricting beneficiary access and limiting state flexibility in delivering case management services. Public schools must provide special education services for children with disabilities under IDEA. Medicaid can cover health-related services for children with disabilities in public schools, but improper payments have been a concern. The HHS OIG and GAO found abuse and overpayments in Medicaid claims for school services, leading to a final rule in December 2007 to restrict federal Medicaid payments for school-based activities. In December 2007, CMS issued a final rule restricting federal Medicaid payments for school-based administrative activities and certain transportation services for school-age children. Opponents argued that this rule would limit access to needed healthcare for children and falsely assumed that health care administrative activities by school personnel are inefficient. Congressional and administrative actions have since impacted this rule. The Obama Administration rescinded the school-based administration/transportation rule in June 2009 due to concerns about adverse consequences. CMS is now following policies from before the December 2007 rule, as outlined in the May 2003 Medicaid School-Based Administrative Claiming Guide. The May 2003 Medicaid School-Based Administrative Claiming Guide provides guidance on school-based administrative claiming and school transportation. Medicaid outpatient hospital services are a mandatory benefit, including preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services directed by a physician or dentist. States use various reimbursement methods for services in outpatient hospital departments and clinics. The Bush Administration's proposed rules would have limited the scope of Medicaid outpatient services in hospital facilities. The proposed rule aimed to restrict Medicaid outpatient services in hospital facilities to those recognized by Medicare, potentially impacting supplemental payments to qualifying hospitals and federal matching funds for programs providing diagnostic and treatment services for individuals under 21. The Obama Administration rescinded a rule in 2009 that would have limited Medicaid outpatient services in hospital facilities, citing concerns about the availability of covered services for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Obama Administration rescinded a rule in 2009 that would have limited Medicaid outpatient services in hospital facilities, citing concerns about the availability of covered services for Medicaid beneficiaries. CMS had assumed that services removed from the outpatient hospital benefit category would be shifted to other benefit categories, but comments on the rule suggested this may have been difficult due to state funding and payment complexities. The Bush Administration had issued seven rules restricting Medicaid coverage and payments in 2007 and 2008, with some policies mandated by congressional changes. Various interest groups had both supported and opposed these rules, with one rule being vacated by a federal court and Congress imposing moratoria on six regulations. The Obama Administration has taken action on six regulations, withdrawing, rescinding, or delaying enforcement. The future of these rules is uncertain, and further changes may occur. This report will be updated accordingly."
