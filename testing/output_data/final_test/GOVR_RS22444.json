    "content": "The debate over telecommunications reform includes the issue of \"net neutrality,\" which aims to ensure equal access to the Internet without discrimination. The definition of \"net neutrality\" is not universally agreed upon, but it generally involves preventing network owners from controlling consumer usage or discriminating against content providers. This debate has become a focal point in the regulation of broadband access as the industry evolves. The debate over net neutrality in broadband regulation focuses on the potential discriminatory behaviors of broadband providers, such as controlling access and pricing, and favoring network-owned content. Regulatory actions in 2005 further fueled the net neutrality debate by classifying broadband services as Title I information services. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's ruling in 2005 that cable modem and telephone company Internet access services are classified as Title I information services, subjecting them to a less stringent regulatory framework. The FCC classified cable modem and telephone company Internet access services as Title I information services, exempting them from Title II regulation. However, they are still subject to FCC regulatory authority under Title I. The FCC also outlined four principles to promote open and interconnected internet access. Consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice, connect legal devices that do not harm the network, and have competition among network providers, application/service providers, and content providers. FCC Chairman Martin did not call for codification but stated they will be incorporated into policymaking activities. For example, conditions for mergers included commitments to comply with FCC's Internet policy statement. AT&T agreed to adhere to net neutrality requirements for two years to gain FCC approval for its merger with BellSouth. AT&T agreed to uphold significant net neutrality requirements for two years as part of its merger with BellSouth. The FCC ruled that Comcast violated net neutrality principles by selectively blocking peer-to-peer connections, which interfered with users' rights to access lawful content. Comcast was ordered to stop blocking peer-to-peer connections by the end of 2008, with no monetary penalties imposed. Comcast has filed an appeal in the U.S. DC Court of Appeals. The FCC released a notice of inquiry in April 2007 on broadband industry practices, seeking comments on various issues including the possibility of amending the Internet policy statement to include a new principle of nondiscrimination. The FCC issued public notices in January 2008 related to network management, including the Comcast ruling, and held public hearings on broadband network management practices. As Internet use expands to include video, online gaming, and voice services, network operators are prioritizing traffic to ensure uninterrupted data streams. This prioritization may benefit consumers by ensuring faster delivery and quality of service, but has also sparked debate among stakeholders. The prioritization of traffic by network operators has raised concerns about potential abuse of power and limitations on competition. If a multi-tiered Internet emerges where content providers pay for different service levels, smaller providers may struggle to afford equal access. This could lead to decreased consumer choice and increased costs if fees for premium access are passed on to consumers. The potential for abuse is reduced in a competitive marketplace. In a competitive marketplace with multiple broadband providers, the potential for abuses like blocking access to content or charging unreasonable fees is significantly decreased. Consumers and content providers can switch to other providers, leading to a decrease in market share and profits for the offending provider. Some policymakers believe more specific regulatory guidelines may be necessary to protect the marketplace despite the FCC's ability to regulate broadband services. Some believe more specific regulatory guidelines may be needed to protect the marketplace from potential abuses, but there is no consensus on what these should entail. Others argue that existing laws and FCC policies are sufficient to address anti-competitive behavior. The debate over net neutrality and the need for legislation to ensure access to broadband networks has become a focal point. Opponents of specific Internet network access mandates claim it goes against the policy of keeping the Internet free from regulation and could have negative consequences. Opponents argue that imposing specific Internet network access mandates is unnecessary and could hinder the expansion of broadband facilities. They claim that such regulations would discourage network providers from investing in new networks and limit their ability to innovate. They believe that existing providers have already committed to upholding FCC policy principles and that there is no widespread behavior justifying the need for additional regulations. Opponents argue against specific Internet network access mandates, stating that regulations could hinder broadband expansion and innovation. They believe existing providers are committed to FCC policy principles and that additional regulations are unnecessary. Proponents of net neutrality legislation argue for its necessity, citing the potential for anti-discriminatory behavior and the FCC's existing authority to address violations. Proponents of net neutrality legislation argue that without regulation, Internet access providers could become gatekeepers, favoring large businesses and hindering competition. They emphasize the need for a national policy to ensure the openness of the Internet and promote broadband expansion. Supporters of net neutrality legislation advocate for a unified regulatory framework to protect Internet benefits and promote broadband expansion. They argue that current enforcement methods are slow and costly, especially for small businesses. The 110th Congress discussed net neutrality within the context of telecommunications reform, with bills introduced by advocates like House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Markey and House Judiciary Chairman Conyers. In 2008, House Judiciary Chairman Conyers introduced H.R. 5994, a bill addressing anticompetitive practices by broadband providers following a hearing on net neutrality. A stand-alone net neutrality measure (S. 215) was introduced in the Senate Commerce Committee. No further action was taken in the 110th Congress, and no new net neutrality measures have been introduced in the 111th Congress. House Subcommittee Chairman Boucher is working with providers to find common ground on network management practices. The net neutrality issue has been addressed within the economic stimulus package through H.R. 1 (P.L. 111-5), requiring NTIA and FCC to establish nondiscrimination and network interconnection obligations for grant participants in the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. The FCC's broadband policy principles from 2005 are the minimum obligations to be imposed, but NTIA has not yet issued these requirements."
