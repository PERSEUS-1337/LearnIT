    "content": "The Act is titled \"International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking\" and includes sections on findings, definitions, the Angel Watch Center, sense of Congress provisions, enhancing standards for trafficking elimination, assistance to foreign countries, and rules of construction. Congress enacted Megan's Law in 1996 after the tragic abduction, sexual assault, and murder of 7-year-old Megan Nicole Kanka by a convicted sex offender. This law aimed to help states monitor sex offenders and protect children. In 2006, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act was passed to establish a national system for registering and notifying the public about convicted sex offenders. The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child sex trafficking and pornography is a global issue, with an estimated 1.8 million children worldwide being victims each year. Child sex tourism involves traveling to engage in sexual activity with children in foreign countries, contributing to child exploitation and trafficking. Sex tourists from the United States target children in significant destination countries for child sex tourism. Cooperation between US and foreign governments is crucial to identify and track child-sex offenders traveling internationally. Foreign authorities expect reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders traveling to their countries in exchange for providing information to the US. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" and does not provide any additional information. The term \"Center\" refers to the Angel Watch Center established under section 4(a). A \"child-sex offender\" is an individual convicted of a child-sex offense as defined in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. A child-sex offender means an individual convicted of a specified offense against a minor, as defined in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, including kidnapping, false imprisonment, solicitation to engage in sexual conduct, use in a sexual performance, solicitation to practice prostitution, and video voyeurism. A child-sex offender is someone convicted of offenses like possession, production, or distribution of child pornography, criminal sexual conduct involving a minor, and any conduct that is a sex offense against a minor. This also includes offenses described in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. The term \"jurisdiction\" in this Act refers to states, territories, and other U.S. territories. The limitations on consensual sexual conduct for child-sex offenses are the same as those for sex offenses under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. The term \"minor\" refers to an individual under 18 years of age, including the United States Virgin Islands and federally recognized Indian tribes as specified in the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. SEC. 4. ANGEL WATCH CENTER. The Angel Watch Center, established within ICE, is headed by the Director of ICE and collaborates with CBP. It consists of designated analysts and program managers to carry out specified activities. The Angel Watch Center, under ICE and CBP, conducts activities such as receiving information on travel by child-sex offenders, maintaining relevant information, and establishing review processes for notification to destination countries. The United States Marshals Service's National Sex Offender Targeting Office provides required information for these activities. The National Sex Offender Targeting Office provides information on travel by child-sex offenders to the Angel Watch Center for notification to destination countries and offenders. The Angel Watch Center notifies destination countries and child-sex offenders of impending international travel, with the Secretary of Homeland Security making efforts to provide notice prior to the offender's arrival. The Angel Watch Center notifies destination countries and child-sex offenders of impending international travel, with exceptions for cases where notice conflicts with ongoing investigations or poses a risk to the offender's well-being. The Angel Watch Center notifies destination countries and child-sex offenders of potential travel restrictions, including possible denial of entry, through electronic or telephonic communication. The authority for notification terminates at the end of the offender's registration period. The Angel Watch Center notifies destination countries and child-sex offenders of potential travel restrictions, including denial of entry, through electronic or telephonic communication. The Center establishes a mechanism to receive complaints from affected offenders and engages in consultations with organizations and governments interested in preventing child sex tourism and international sexual exploitation. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State may provide technical assistance to foreign authorities to participate in the international sex offender travel notification system. SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS PROVISIONS. The sense of Congress is for the President to negotiate agreements with foreign governments to enhance the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, including setting up systems for reporting child exploitation and notifying the US of child-sex offenses committed abroad. The President should request foreign governments to notify the US when a US citizen is involved in a child-sex offense abroad. SEC. 6 amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to include severe forms of trafficking related to sex tourism. SEC. 7 encourages the President to provide assistance to foreign countries for programs to identify and notify child sex offenders. SEC. 8 provides rules of construction. SEC. 8 clarifies that the Department of Justice's jurisdiction under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act remains unchanged. It also ensures that the Angel Watch Center can still notify about sex offenders and offenses as specified in the Act."
