The monthly pay used for computation in such cases will be based on a higher pay grade than usual. The amendment to Section 8133 of title 5, United States Code, provides additional compensation for public safety officers who die as a result of a line of duty injury. The monthly pay used for computation will be based on the highest pay grade in effect at the time of service. SEC. 2. CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. Section 8341 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to provide survivor benefits for public safety officers who die in the line of duty. The computation of survivor annuity will use a higher pay grade than usual. The subsection clarifies that the computation of survivor benefits for public safety officers will use the highest pay grade in effect at the time of service. SEC. 3. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM. Sec. 8446 of title 5, United States Code, allows for computations of survivor annuities for public safety officers who die in the line of duty. The average pay used in the computation is based on the employee's basic pay rates. Sec. 8446 of title 5, United States Code, specifies that the average pay for survivor annuities of public safety officers is determined using a pay grade one level higher than the grade that would otherwise apply. This does not affect computations if the original pay grade was the highest at the time of service. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE; EXCEPTION. This section pertains to computations based on the death of a public safety officer who dies as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty. The amendments made by this Act apply to deaths occurring on or after the enactment date, with an exception for individuals entitled to compensation as survivors of a Federal public safety officer who died on or after January 1, 1974. They can have their compensation recomputed within 12 months of the enactment date. Any recomputation of compensation or annuity under this subsection shall be effective as of the commencement date. Lump-sum payments for adjustments to compensation or survivor annuity payments are payable in a lump-sum payment, funded by appropriations from general funds in the Treasury. In paragraph (3), payments are limited if the appropriated amount is less than the total payable amounts. Reductions are proportionate for benefits under different chapters. A Federal public safety officer is defined as an employee under specific sections of the United States Code. The Act specifies regulations for benefits under different chapters of title 5, United States Code, with the Secretary of Labor responsible for chapter 81 and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management for chapters 83 and 84."
