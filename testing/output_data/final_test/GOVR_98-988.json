    "content": "The House of Representatives rules and practices on quorums and voting are based on constitutional provisions. A majority constitutes a quorum for business, and a smaller number can adjourn or compel absent members. Voting requires yeas and nays to be recorded if desired by one fifth of those present. This report focuses on how the House interprets and implements these provisions, covering important rules and common practices. The House of Representatives rules require a simple majority of members, or 218 Representatives, to be present on the floor during business. However, it is common for only a few members to be present during debates, with 218 members typically only present during electronic voting or quorum calls. This inconsistency raises questions about the quorum requirement. The House of Representatives often conducts business in the Committee of the Whole, which allows for more flexible debate and amendment rules. This committee, unlike other House committees, includes all Representatives and is created by House rules. The Committee of the Whole in the House of Representatives is unique as all Representatives are members and it meets on the House floor. This committee has its own quorum requirement of 100 Members, not the majority of the House. A quorum is always presumed present unless proven otherwise, whether the House is meeting as a whole or in Committee of the Whole. The Speaker or chair of the Committee of the Whole cannot initiate a quorum count, it is only done in response to a Member's assertion. A quorum is always presumed present unless challenged by a Member, with strict rules on when this challenge can be made. The House's quorum and voting procedures are closely linked, with a Member's right to challenge a quorum only during a vote. The House's rules define business for quorum purposes as limited to voting, making it impractical for all Representatives to be present throughout each session. Record votes, including those to override a presidential veto, are typically done using the electronic voting system. The Constitution mandates that votes to override a presidential veto must be determined by Yeas and Nays. House Rules specify procedures for record votes on various motions, including closing conference committee meetings. The Speaker puts questions to a vote following specific guidelines outlined in House Rules. The House Rules specify procedures for record votes, including securing division and record votes. If a recorded vote is requested and supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum, the vote shall be taken by electronic device. In the House, votes are conducted by voice initially, with members calling out \"aye\" or \"no.\" The chair then announces the result, and if unchallenged, the decision is final. The vote is valid even if only a few members participate, and a quorum is presumed present. In the House, votes are initially conducted by voice, with members calling out \"aye\" or \"no.\" The chair then announces the result, and if unchallenged, the decision is final. Any Member can demand a division vote after a voice vote, where members stand to show their support or opposition. The chair then counts the members and announces the result, with individual positions not recorded. A division vote is valid even if less than a quorum is present. In the House, votes are initially conducted by voice, with members calling out \"aye\" or \"no.\" A small number of Members can determine the outcome of either kind of vote, as not all Members may participate. Before the final result is announced, any Member can request a record vote using the electronic voting system, giving Members time to come to the floor and record their votes individually. The House conducts votes using an electronic voting system, with three ways to secure a vote: objection for lack of quorum, one-fifth of a quorum ordering a recorded vote, or one-fifth of those present ordering yeas and nays. The Constitution allows for yeas and nays to be recorded at the request of one-fifth of those present. The House conducts votes using an electronic voting system, with three ways to secure a vote: objection for lack of quorum, one-fifth of a quorum ordering a recorded vote, or one-fifth of those present ordering yeas and nays. A vote by the yeas and nays, also known as a record vote, is taken electronically unless the system is temporarily inoperative. If needed, the clerk of the House would call the roll of Members as per Rule XX. In the House, a yea-and-nay vote can be ordered by one-fifth of Members present, or any Member can compel an electronic vote using Rule XX. This rule ensures a quorum is present for the vote. Clause 6(b) of the House rules states that a call of the House will be initiated if a majority of Members present decline to vote on a pending question, allowing the Speaker to declare a quorum and proceed with the vote. Members can object to the vote if they believe a quorum is not present. The Member can challenge the validity of a vote by invoking the quorum requirement. The Speaker will count to determine if a quorum is present, and if so, the point of order is overruled. If the Member still wants a recorded vote, they can request the yeas and nays or invoke Rule XX for a recorded vote with support from one-fifth of a quorum. When a quorum is present, a recorded vote can be requested with support from one-fifth of a quorum, which is 44 Members. The vote will be taken electronically, regardless of whether it is a yea-and-nay vote or a recorded vote. If a quorum is not present, the Speaker will order an electronic vote on the question. An electronic vote is ordered under Rule XX when a quorum is present, deciding a question and demonstrating quorum presence. The Speaker can postpone votes under Rule XX, rarely needing to bring in absent Members. When the Speaker postpones a vote due to a lack of quorum, the point of order is considered withdrawn. The Speaker will then put the question to a vote again, starting with a voice vote. Members can request a recorded or yea-and-nay vote, with the vote taken electronically if there is a second. The right to demand \"the Yeas and Nays\" applies to the House and Senate, but not the Committee of the Whole. There is no constitutional right for one-fifth of Members present to insist on a vote in the Committee of the Whole. Before 1970, votes in Committee of the Whole were not recorded, but the 1970 Legislative Reorganization Act changed this by allowing recorded votes. These recorded votes are now equivalent to yea-and-nay votes in the House, although the procedures for obtaining them differ slightly. Clause 6(e) of House Rule XVIII outlines the requirements for securing a record vote in Committee of the Whole. In Committee of the Whole, a recorded vote can be requested by at least 25 Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner under House Rule XVIII. Members can request a recorded vote before the final result of a voice or division vote is announced, ensuring at least 24 others support the request. The chair can postpone the vote if the floor is not crowded, waiting for more Members to be present. In Committee of the Whole, a recorded vote can be requested by at least 25 Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner under House Rule XVIII. The chair must first address a point of order regarding the absence of a quorum, which consists of 100 members. If a quorum is present, a recorded vote is ordered if 25 members support the request. If a quorum is not present, an immediate quorum call may be ordered. If the request is for a recorded vote on an amendment, the chair may postpone the vote, in which case the point of order of no quorum is considered withdrawn. In the Committee of the Whole, if a recorded vote is requested by at least 25 members, a quorum call may be ordered to establish the presence of a quorum. Unlike in the House, where a quorum call and recorded vote are combined, in the Committee of the Whole, they are separate processes. In the Committee of the Whole, a quorum call may be followed by a recorded vote on the amendment or motion. Representatives usually have at least 15 minutes to vote or record their presence, with the time often extended to allow more Members to be recorded. The Speaker or chair of the Committee of the Whole may close a vote after 15 minutes, but sometimes allows more time for Members to arrive. Electronic votes often last 20 minutes or longer. The chair's discretion in deciding when to close a vote can benefit the majority party. In close votes, the vote may be closed after 15 minutes if the majority is in favor. However, electronic votes are not closed when Members are present in the chamber. Alternatively, the chair may extend the vote beyond 15 minutes if more time is needed to reverse a losing vote. During electronic votes or quorum calls, Members can change their votes or record their presence before the chair announces the result. Requests to correct the Congressional Record on electronic votes are not entertained. Members who miss a vote can announce how they would have voted. Members who miss electronic votes can announce their vote from the floor or submit a signed statement. They may also be allowed less than 15 minutes to vote in certain circumstances. The Speaker has discretion to reduce voting time. The Speaker has the discretion to reduce voting time for electronic votes in the House from 15 minutes to five minutes in certain circumstances, ensuring that Members have an adequate opportunity to vote. The intention to exercise this discretion is announced in advance, with the first vote being 15 minutes and the second, if ordered, being five minutes. This allows Members to be informed and prepared for the voting process. Clause 9(b) of Rule XX directs that notice of five-minute voting shall be issued prior to the first vote in a series \"to the maximum extent practicable.\" The Speaker has the discretion to defer votes on certain questions when an electronic vote has been ordered or when a point of order has been made against a voice or division vote due to a quorum issue. The Speaker's authority applies to various voting scenarios, including adopting resolutions, passing bills, agreeing to amendments, and motions related to House proceedings. When an electronic vote is ordered on certain questions, the Speaker may postpone the vote to a later time on the same legislative day or within two legislative days. The postponed votes are taken in the order they were scheduled, starting with a regular 15-minute vote. Subsequent votes may be shortened to five minutes each if no interruptions occur. The Speaker has the authority to postpone and cluster electronic votes on motions to suspend the rules, allowing for five-minute votes if no interruptions occur. This helps avoid multiple electronic votes at short intervals, especially on Mondays or Tuesdays when many Members are returning to Washington. The Speaker can also schedule votes later in the week to be back-to-back, with only the first vote in the series taking at least 15 minutes. The Chair of the Committee of the Whole can reduce electronic vote time to two minutes in certain circumstances, such as immediately after another vote or during a quorum call. The Chair can also postpone and cluster votes on separate amendments to a bill, with the votes taken one after the other later in the proceedings. If supported by enough members, a recorded vote can be taken by electronic device. The Chair of the Committee of the Whole can reduce vote time to two minutes in specific situations. Votes on pending amendments can be clustered with at least 15 minutes for the first vote and five minutes for each succeeding vote, as long as no interruptions occur. If votes on amendments are postponed, the Chair can determine the timing for subsequent votes. When the House resolves into the Committee of the Whole, vote time can be reduced to two minutes for Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner to have an adequate opportunity to vote on pending amendments. This provision allows for quick votes in situations like when amendments are postponed and scheduled for later in the day or the next day. A recorded vote can be requested in the Committee of the Whole by a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner. When the House resolves into the Committee of the Whole, a recorded vote can be requested on an amendment. The chair may announce a quorum call and reduce the time for the amendment vote to two minutes. This allows for quick votes in the Committee of the Whole. In the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, a quorum is constituted when 100 members are present. Quorum calls are now uncommon as proceedings are typically postponed until a series of amendment votes is expected. The key rule governing attempts to secure the presence of a majority of Representatives on the floor during a meeting of the House is clause 7 of Rule XX. The Speaker may not entertain a point of order that a quorum is not present unless a question has been put to a vote. A call of the House shall not be in order after the previous question is ordered unless the Speaker determines by actual count that a quorum is not present. The constitutional quorum requirement in the House of Representatives allows a Member to object to a vote if a quorum is not present. The Speaker can only initiate a quorum call at their discretion. If a quorum is not present, an automatic roll call vote is ordered. The purpose of a quorum call in the House is to secure the presence of Members, not to require attendance of all Members. Once a quorum responds to the call, further efforts to secure attendance are dispensed with unless the Speaker decides otherwise. This rule also applies in Committee of the Whole, where the quorum is set at 100 Members. Rule XVIII sets the quorum in Committee of the Whole at 100 Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner. The chair can authorize notice quorum calls and two-minute votes on amendments. A point of order on no quorum can only be made in Committee of the Whole after a vote has been called. Members do not have the right to insist on a quorum during general debate. During general debate, a point of order on no quorum can be made in Committee of the Whole under specific conditions. If a quorum call or recorded vote has occurred, a Member can raise a point of order on the absence of a quorum only during the voting process. If the House fails to meet the quorum requirement, legislative business cannot continue until a quorum is present, forcing the House to either adjourn or take necessary steps to secure a quorum. The House has two options when facing a quorum issue: adjourn or take steps to secure attendance. Clause 5(a) of Rule XX allows a majority of at least 15 Members to compel absent Members to attend. The House can proceed without a quorum due to constitutional authorization. The situation in Committee of the Whole is similar. The Chair has announced the absence of a quorum in Committee of the Whole, no further business may be conducted until a quorum is established or the Committee rises. A quorum is not required in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for adoption of a motion that the Committee rise, but is necessary to adopt a motion to report a measure for final passage in the House. The Constitution states that a majority of each House shall constitute a quorum to do business, defined as a majority of the whole number of Members elected, sworn, and living. In the event of a catastrophe, it may be difficult to determine if a Member is alive or dead, affecting the adjustment of the House's total number. Even if a Member is incapacitated or unable to attend, they still count towards the quorum. To address this issue, in 2005, the House modified Rule XX to prepare for situations where a large number of Members are missing or incapacitated, making it challenging to establish a quorum for Congress to act. The rule establishes a method for determining a \"provisional quorum\" in case of catastrophic events when a majority of Members elected, sworn, and living are missing. Four steps must be taken to establish the House is without a quorum due to catastrophic circumstances before a new number required for a quorum is determined based on the provisional number of the House. Based on House Rule XX, a motion to compel absent Members to attend requires a majority vote of at least 15 Members. If adopted, Members must present themselves for a call of the House, recorded by the Clerk. If not adopted, further steps are taken to establish a quorum in catastrophic circumstances. If a motion to compel absent Members is not adopted due to lack of support or fewer than 15 Members in favor, the House can still proceed to establish a quorum in catastrophic circumstances. This involves a call of the House over 72 hours, with the Speaker able to order the call or entertain a motion for it. If a quorum is not achieved after 72 hours, further steps can be taken to address the lack of quorum due to catastrophic circumstances. After the call of the House is closed, the Speaker, along with the majority and minority leaders, can receive a \"catastrophic quorum failure report\" from the Sergeant at Arms (or designee) stating that the House cannot establish a quorum due to catastrophic circumstances like an attack, natural disaster, or contagion. The report must include the number of vacancies, a list of former Representatives whose seats are vacant, incapacitated Representatives, those incapable of attending, and those not accounted for. The Speaker, in consultation with party leaders, announces a report prepared by the Sergeant at Arms regarding the House's quorum status in catastrophic circumstances. The House is not considered without a quorum until a second extended call is completed, which can be ordered under specific procedures. The House establishes a quorum in catastrophic circumstances by determining a provisional number of Members who respond to a 24-hour call. A majority of the provisional number constitutes a quorum for conducting business, with adjustments made for late arrivals or Member changes. The catastrophic quorum failure report must be updated daily. The quorum failure report must be updated each legislative day, meaning each time the House reconvenes. The Speaker must provide these updates to the House. Concerns were raised about the constitutionality of the catastrophic quorum rule during the consideration of H.Res. 5. The Speaker declined to address the constitutional point of order, stating that the House determines the constitutionality of a proposal through voting. The House voted on H.Res. 5 and its new quorum procedure, with a vote of 220-195 in favor. There may be a challenge to the rule's constitutionality, but it's uncertain if a Member has standing to do so. The Speaker is not required to vote in most cases, except in certain circumstances. The House Parliamentarian notes that Members are expected to vote on each question unless they have a personal or pecuniary interest. The Speaker has stated that it is up to the Member, not the Chair, to determine if they have a conflict of interest. Rule XXIII states that Members convicted of certain crimes should refrain from voting. Voting is considered an individual right. Members are expected to vote on each question unless they have a personal or pecuniary interest. The House prohibits \"ghost voting\" and emphasizes that voting is an individual right that cannot be delegated. All decisions are made by simple majority vote on the House floor. The House rules require different voting thresholds for various purposes. A simple majority vote is needed for most decisions, while a two-thirds vote is required for specific matters like expelling a Member or overriding a presidential veto. Additionally, certain House rules mandate a two-thirds or three-fifths majority for other purposes, such as suspending the rules or considering a special rule on the same day it is reported."
