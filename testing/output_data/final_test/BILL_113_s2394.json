    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sage Grouse Protection and Conservation Act\" and includes measures for the protection and conservation of the Greater Sage-Grouse. The \"Sage Grouse Protection and Conservation Act\" defines terms such as covered western state, National Forest System land, public land, and sage grouse species. The \"Sage Grouse Protection and Conservation Act\" defines the Secretary as the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public land. It also defines a statewide plan as a conservation and management plan for sage grouse species in a covered western State. Secretarial participation in the state planning process is required within 30 days of a covered western State initiating a statewide conservation and management plan for sage grouse protection and recovery. The Secretary must provide the Governor of a covered western State with a commitment to participate in sage grouse recovery efforts, designate representatives from relevant departments, and share scientific data within 60 days of receiving a notice from the State. The Secretary must provide relevant scientific data and personnel from Department of the Interior or Department of Agriculture agencies to assist the State in developing a statewide plan for sage grouse species and habitat. The Governor of a covered western State must submit a notice inviting the Secretary to participate in the plan within 2 years. The State must submit a 10-year sage grouse conservation plan to the Secretary for review. The Secretary will assess if the plan is likely to conserve the sage grouse species and its habitat to the point where protections under the Endangered Species Act are no longer necessary. The Secretary must approve or endorse the statewide plan within 120 days of submission. After receiving the plan, all actions related to listing sage grouse species under the Endangered Species Act will be placed on hold for at least 10 years. The statewide plan must be approved by the Secretary within 120 days. All actions related to listing sage grouse species under the Endangered Species Act will be paused for 10 years.

The State's statewide plan must be approved by the Secretary within 120 days. Any proposed action under the National Environmental Policy Act in a covered western State cannot be denied based solely on sage grouse species if it aligns with the State's plan. The Secretary must give effect to existing statewide plans approved before the enactment of this Act. The State's statewide plan must be approved by the Secretary within 120 days and cannot be denied solely based on sage grouse species if it aligns with the plan. Statewide plans approved before the enactment of this Act must be given effect."
