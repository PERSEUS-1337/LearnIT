    "title": "SB 374",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 20209.14 of the Public Contract Code is amended to specify that the article will be in effect until January 1, 2017, and repealed thereafter. It applies only to transit operators starting project solicitations before January 1, 2015. Transit operators starting solicitations after that date are subject to Chapter 4. Section 22161 is amended to provide definitions for this chapter. For this chapter, \"best value\" is defined as a value determined by evaluating objective criteria such as price, features, functions, life-cycle costs, experience, and past performance. The determination may involve selecting the lowest cost proposal meeting the agency's interests and project objectives, choosing the best proposal for a set sum, or a tradeoff between price and other factors. Design-build entity refers to a legal entity capable of providing licensed contracting, architectural, and engineering services for a project. Construction subcontract is a subcontract awarded by the design-build entity for work on the project. Design-build is a project delivery process where both design and construction are procured from a single entity. The \"design-build team\" includes the design-build entity, general contractor, and other contractors for electrical, mechanical, and plumbing work. A \"local agency\" refers to cities, counties, special districts, transit districts, and other regional agencies responsible for transit projects. The San Diego Association of Governments is mentioned in the San Diego Regional Transportation Consolidation Act. For a local agency defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (f), a \"project\" includes construction of buildings, county sanitation wastewater treatment facilities, and park/recreational facilities, but excludes other infrastructure like streets, highways, public rail transit, or water resources facilities. If the agency operates wastewater, solid waste, or water recycling facilities, a \"project\" also encompasses construction of regional and local facilities for these purposes. (2) For a local agency defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), a \"project\" includes construction of regional and local wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste facilities, water recycling facilities, or fire protection facilities. \n(3) For a local agency defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (f), a \"project\" refers to a transit capital project starting solicitation on or after January 1, 2015, excluding state highway or local street projects. The Legislature recognizes the unique responsibilities of the San Diego Association of Governments as the consolidated transportation agency with capital project implementation responsibilities, including transit infrastructure design and construction. This special law aims to align SANDAG with other agencies with transit development responsibilities. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution. The costs incurred by local agencies or school districts will be due to creating a new crime, eliminating a crime, changing penalties, or changing the definition of a crime."
