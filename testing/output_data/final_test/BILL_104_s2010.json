    "content": "The \"Community Protection Initiative of 1996\" allows qualified current and former law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms, exempting them from state laws prohibiting it. The \"Community Protection Initiative of 1996\" permits qualified law enforcement officers and former officers to carry concealed firearms, overriding state laws. The section prohibits possession of firearms on Federal property but does not supersede state laws that grant broader rights for carrying concealed firearms or allow private entities to restrict firearms on their property. The document issued by a public agency to a qualified law enforcement officer or former officer identifies them as such. A qualified law enforcement officer is authorized to engage in criminal law activities, while a qualified former law enforcement officer is one who retired from service without mental disability. A qualified law enforcement officer must have a nonforfeitable right to retirement benefits, not be separated due to disciplinary action preventing firearm carrying, meet state training requirements for firearms and concealed weapons, and not be prohibited by federal law from receiving a firearm. A qualified law enforcement officer is defined as an officer authorized to carry a firearm in the line of duty, meeting agency requirements for firearms, and not subject to disciplinary actions preventing firearm carrying. Qualified current and former law enforcement officers are allowed to carry concealed firearms under section 926B."
