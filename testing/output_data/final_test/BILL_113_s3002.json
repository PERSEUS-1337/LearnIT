    "content": "The Act titled \"Guarding Our Great Lakes Act\" establishes an Aquatic Invasive Species Control Zone at Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois. The Act establishes measures to prevent the transfer of aquatic invasive species, focusing on Asian carp, through the Brandon Road Lock and Dam. Construction of improvements, including an engineered channel, is required to prevent the upstream transfer of invasive species. The Act requires measures to prevent the transfer of aquatic invasive species, specifically Asian carp, through the Brandon Road Lock and Dam. This includes changing the Mississippi River direction, adding structures for invasive species control, and implementing electric dispersal barriers. The Chief of Engineers must provide Congress with a cost estimate and completion schedule within 6 months. Other measures involve collaboration between various agencies for environmental protection. The United States Coast Guard, EPA Administrator, and other relevant agencies must implement measures to prevent the transfer of Asian carp and other aquatic invasive species at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam on the Illinois River. This includes monitoring, testing new control technologies, implementing strategies, and developing best practices. The Chief of Engineers, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Geological Survey may acquire real estate for implementing measures to prevent aquatic invasive species transfer. They will coordinate with Governors of several states in this effort. The entities involved in preventing aquatic invasive species transfer include various states such as Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as organizations like the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee, the Great Lakes Commission, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative, and other relevant government entities. SEC. 3. ACTIONS RELATED TO PERMANENT PREVENTION OF AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES TRANSFER BETWEEN THE GREAT LAKES AND MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASINS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will coordinate with Illinois, Chicago, and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District to construct flood mitigation and water quality measures on the Chicago Area Waterway System to prevent the transfer of aquatic nuisance species between the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. This includes combining infrastructure with the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan and ensuring flood mitigation in the Chicago vicinity. The Administrator will coordinate with local entities to construct flood mitigation and water quality measures on the Chicago Area Waterway System to prevent the transfer of aquatic nuisance species. This includes ensuring water quality protection in the Great Lakes, maintaining watercraft traffic, and prioritizing efforts to prevent the transfer of high-risk aquatic invasive species. The Administrator will consult with the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee in carrying out these measures. The Administrator will consult with the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee and may delegate parts of the project to non-Federal entities. They will work to identify cost-share partners and the Federal share of project costs can be up to 100 percent. A report must be submitted within 18 months of enactment. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 18 months of enactment, detailing progress and future actions under this section."
