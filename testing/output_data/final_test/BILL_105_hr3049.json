    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1997\" and it involves the adjustment of status of certain Haitian nationals. The \"Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1997\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible Haitian nationals to lawful permanent residence, with specific criteria and deadlines outlined. The \"Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1997\" allows eligible Haitian nationals to apply for adjustment of status despite previous deportation orders. If the application is granted, the deportation order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains enforceable. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status under the \"Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1997\" must meet specific criteria, including filing for asylum before December 31, 1995, being physically present in the United States for at least 1 year, and not exceeding 180 days of absence. The Attorney General allows aliens with final deportation orders to seek a stay based on an application. During proceedings, aliens can't be removed if they raise eligibility for adjustment of status, unless the application is denied. The Attorney General may authorize an alien to work in the US while their adjustment of status application is pending, and if the application exceeds 180 days without a denial, employment authorization must be granted. Additionally, spouses and children can have their status adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident by the Attorney General under certain conditions. The alien must be a national of Haiti and the spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The alien must apply for adjustment of status while physically present in the US and meet all other eligibility requirements for an immigrant visa. The alien must be a national of Haiti and related to a lawful permanent resident. They must apply for adjustment of status while in the US and meet immigrant visa eligibility requirements. Continuous physical presence is required, with absences not exceeding 180 days. Administrative review rights are provided by the Attorney General. The alien must be a national of Haiti and related to a lawful permanent resident to apply for adjustment of status under this section. The Attorney General's determination on status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. The Secretary of State is not required to reduce immigrant visas when an alien is granted permanent residence. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of status adjustment under this section. The Attorney General's powers in enforcing immigration laws are not affected by this Act. Eligibility for permanent residence under this section does not prevent an alien from seeking status under other laws."
