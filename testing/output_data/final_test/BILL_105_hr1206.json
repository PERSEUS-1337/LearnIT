    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Brownfield Cleanup and Redevelopment Act\". The Congress finds that older abandoned or under-used commercial and industrial sites, known as brownfields, are often overlooked for redevelopment due to contamination from past activities. Reuse of these sites requires assessment and cleanup, adding costs and uncertainties to the process. This leads to loss of tax revenues and job opportunities, deteriorating the urban environment. State voluntary cleanup programs have been successful in addressing environmental contamination by allowing individuals to respond voluntarily to hazardous substance releases at low and medium priority facilities. These programs streamline regulatory requirements, leading to timely and cost-effective cleanups. Enhancing these programs through Federal-State partnerships and legal finality can further improve cleanup processes and remove unnecessary federal requirements for certain permits. The Act aims to ensure the quality of State brownfield cleanup and redevelopment efforts by setting Federal criteria for State voluntary cleanup programs. It also provides certainty by exempting eligible brownfield facilities remediated through certified State programs from certain Federal laws. SEC. 3. CERTIFICATION OF STATE VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAMS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must establish certification criteria for State programs for voluntary cleanup of eligible facilities within one year of this Act. States meeting the criteria will be certified to conduct cleanup programs instead of Federal programs under certain environmental acts. The Administrator must certify State programs within 120 days of receiving adequate information. The Administrator will work with States to ensure their cleanup programs meet certification criteria. Annual meetings will be held to discuss program status. If a State fails to meet criteria, the Administrator will assist in remedying the deficiency. Certification may be withdrawn if the deficiency is not resolved promptly. The State voluntary cleanup program must meet certification criteria, including eligibility requirements for facilities and public participation in cleanup plans. Withdrawal of certification will not affect approved cleanups. The State voluntary cleanup program must ensure public input, technical assistance, resources for cleanup, oversight, and certification of completion for eligible facilities. (e) Eligible Facilities are low- or medium-priority environmental hazards in the State that hinder timely use, redevelopment, or reuse due to contamination. These facilities are limited in scope and easily assessable, excluding those with abatement actions under specific environmental acts or federal response actions. Facilities eligible for action under section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 include those on the National Priorities List, requiring permits under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, land disposal units with closure requirements, and facilities in need of corrective action. Facilities eligible for action under section 104 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 include those subject to corrective action under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, facilities eligible for assistance under the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, and facilities owned or operated by the US government. Under a State voluntary cleanup program certified under this section, the State may modify procedural permit requirements to expedite the cleanup if conducted in compliance with the certified program. The Administrator has the authority to take actions under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 for facilities in State voluntary response programs to determine if they qualify for listing on the National Priorities List."
