    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Energy High Energy and Nuclear Physics Authorization Act of 1994\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"CERN\" as the European Organization for Nuclear Research, \"construction\" as all activities necessary for project completion, \"conventional construction\" as civil works and infrastructure, \"Department\" as the Department of Energy, and \"Large Hadron Collider project\" as a specific project. The term \"Large Hadron Collider project\" refers to the project at CERN, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations for High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics activities of the Department includes specific amounts for fiscal years 1996 to 1999. Funds can be used for projects like the B-factory and Fermilab Main Injector. No funds are allocated for the Large Hadron Collider project until international agreements are in place. Authorization of appropriations for High Energy Physics and Nuclear Physics activities from 1996 to 1999 includes specific amounts for each fiscal year. Funds can be used for projects like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. No funds are authorized for the operation of the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. Additionally, there is a limitation on major construction projects exceeding $100,000,000 unless specifically authorized. Limitation on major construction projects exceeding $100,000,000 unless specifically authorized. SEC. 4. THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER PROJECT. The Secretary will negotiate with CERN for US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project, ensuring fair cost allocation, limits on US contributions, cost control systems, and projected timelines for design, construction, and operation. The Secretary will negotiate with CERN for US participation in the Large Hadron Collider project, ensuring fair cost allocation, limits on US contributions, cost control systems, and projected timelines for design, construction, and operation. This includes technical goals, milestones, reconsideration of US participation if milestones are not met, and conditions of access for scientists. The Act does not preclude the President from entering into negotiations for international science agreements. SEC. 5. OPERATING PLAN.\n\nWithin 30 days of an Act appropriating funds for high energy or nuclear physics activities, the Secretary must submit a plan to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The plan should outline operations adjusted to reflect the appropriated amounts.\n\nSEC. 6. LONG-RANGE PLANNING AND GOVERNANCE. The Secretary must contract an independent organization to review the governance of the Department's high energy and nuclear physics programs, including a performance review of management policies, staff allocation, and funding balance. The review will also evaluate the application of regulations to the laboratories. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 9 months detailing the review of the Department's high energy and nuclear physics programs, including recommendations for implementation. The Secretary and the Director of the National Science Foundation will jointly prepare a long-range plan for these programs. The Secretary and the Director of the National Science Foundation will jointly prepare a long-range plan for Federal high energy and nuclear physics programs every two years. The plan will include a list of research opportunities, analysis of research facility relevance, and optimal balance among facility operations, construction, and research support. The Secretary and the Director of the National Science Foundation will prepare a biennial long-range plan for Federal high energy and nuclear physics programs. The plan will include schedules for research programs, coordination with the international community, and an explanation of any modifications from previous plans. The Secretary will transmit a copy of the original plan to Congress. The Secretary and the Director of the National Science Foundation will prepare a biennial long-range plan for Federal high energy and nuclear physics programs, including schedules for research programs and coordination with the international community. The plan will be submitted with the President's annual budget request to Congress for each subsequent fiscal year ending in an odd number. The budget requests will distinguish between capital expenditures and other activities for high energy and nuclear physics programs."
