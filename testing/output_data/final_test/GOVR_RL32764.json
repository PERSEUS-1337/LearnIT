    "content": "The legal debate surrounding climate change has seen a significant increase in litigation in recent years, with 118 lawsuits and petitions filed by the end of 2008. This surge in legal action is attributed to the lack of action by Congress and the executive branch during the George W. Bush Administration. However, there are indications that the pace of new filings may be slowing down during the Obama Administration. The court cases, both decided and pending, arise in eight different contexts. The surge in climate change litigation has slowed down during the Obama Administration, with court cases arising in eight different contexts including the Clean Air Act, federal wildlife statutes, federal energy statutes, and federal information statutes. The surge in climate change litigation has slowed down during the Obama Administration, with court cases arising in eight different contexts including federal information statutes like the National Environmental Policy Act. These cases explore the use of statutes to compel government analysis and dissemination of information about climate change, as well as common law tort theories such as nuisance. Other areas of focus include federal preemption of state regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, state utilities laws related to coal-fired power plants, and the coverage of climate change liabilities by general liability insurance policies. The report covers harms and liabilities caused by climate change, addressing eight areas of litigation. It mentions known cases, both decided and pending, and explores international law arguments for inducing GHG emission reductions. Some Members of Congress were concerned in the late 1990s about the Clinton Administration EPA regulating GHG emissions without Senate approval. The Protocol may have provided a legal basis for emissions restrictions before ratification, leading to enactments barring EPA's implementation of the Kyoto Protocol without approval. The second claim of authority involves regulating GHG emissions independently under the CAA, confirmed by the Supreme Court for mobile sources. In 1998, an EPA memorandum stated that CO2 qualifies as an \"air pollutant\" under the CAA, but further steps are needed for regulation. In 1998, an EPA memorandum concluded that CO2 qualifies as an \"air pollutant\" under the CAA, but further steps are needed for regulation. Despite legal experts arguing EPA's authority to regulate CO2, the agency declined to take further action due to congressional opposition and economic uncertainties. In 2003, a lawsuit was filed by three Northeast states (MA, CT, ME) in Massachusetts v. Whitman to force EPA to list CO2 as a \"criteria pollutant\" under the CAA, citing EPA's previous indications that CO2 emissions contribute to climate change. This legal action challenged EPA's stance on regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit filed by three Northeast states in Massachusetts v. Whitman aimed to compel EPA to classify CO2 as a \"criteria pollutant\" under the CAA, arguing that CO2 emissions endanger public health and welfare. The suit was later dismissed to focus on challenging EPA's denial of regulating GHG emissions from motor vehicles, leading to the Supreme Court's Massachusetts v. EPA decision. Other active suits seek EPA regulation of GHG emissions through NSPSs under the CAA. The EPA is facing lawsuits to regulate GHG emissions through NSPSs under the CAA, following the Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA. The first NSPS suit was New York v. EPA, focusing on CO2 emissions from steam generating units. Some argue that EPA must set NSPSs for GHGs emitted from stationary sources. In 2006, EPA rejected a demand to promulgate NSPSs for GHG emissions from new stationary sources, citing lack of authority. The case was severed and titled New York v. EPA, then remanded for further proceedings after the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. Other NSPS suits involve oil and natural gas production and refining. Plaintiffs in WildEarth Guardians v. Johnson invoke the CAA citizen suit provision to force EPA to perform alleged nondiscretionary duties under the NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants provisions. The lawsuit focuses on EPA's failure to review and revise the NSPS for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production category since 1985. In 2008, a petition was filed challenging EPA's revisions to NSPS for petroleum refineries, arguing that EPA failed to determine whether GHGs from refineries endanger public health and welfare. The lawsuit, now styled as American Petroleum Institute v. EPA, has been consolidated with other cases and is on hold as EPA considers petitions for administrative action. The recent NSPS suit, Environmental Integrity Project v. U.S. EPA, seeks to compel EPA to review and potentially revise its NSPS for nitric acid plants, including for nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent GHG. Efforts are being made to impose CO2 emission limits on specific proposed facilities, mostly coal-fired power plants, as part of a broader campaign. Environmental groups are using the CAA citizen suit provision to enforce the \"new source review\" requirement for GHG emissions at a manufacturing plant in Oregon. The plant is accused of potentially emitting harmful gases without the required permit, including HCFC-142b, a potent GHG. The court ruled that the plaintiffs have standing to sue, despite the indirect climate change impacts of the emissions. In Massachusetts v. EPA, standing was granted despite shared injury and incomplete relief sought. Sierra Club has brought proceedings regarding new source review permits for CO2 emissions. The key issue is whether BACT is required for CO2 emissions from major emitting facilities in PSD areas. The CAA mandates BACT for all pollutants regulated under the Act. The focus is on when CO2 and other GHG emissions must comply with BACT requirements. The pivotal question is when CO2 and other GHG emissions become \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA. In the first case, Sierra Club objected to a PSD permit for a coal-fired power plant, but the petition was denied. In the second case, involving a new waste-coal-fired unit at a power plant, Sierra Club's argument about CO2 BACT limits was rejected by the Board. The Board remanded the permit to Region 8 to reconsider imposing a CO2 BACT limit, as EPA has not issued a regulation requiring actual control of CO2 emissions. The Board suggested that the EPA define \"subject to regulation under this Act\" due to the significance of the issue. The EPA Administrator issued a memorandum in December 2008, defining which pollutants trigger new source review in PSD areas. The regulation excludes CO2 until EPA promulgates a regulation covering CO2 emissions. Sierra Club petitioned for review of the memorandum, which was granted by the Obama Administration in February 2009. In a February 2009 EAB appeal, Sierra Club challenges a permit issued to Northern Michigan University for a new boiler at the heating plant. The Board directed the Michigan agency to consider applying a BACT limit to CO2 emissions. Another EAB appeal involved Desert Rock Energy Co., LLC, where environmental groups and New Mexico challenged an EPA Region 9 permit for new construction. The EPA Region 9 permit allows construction of a new 1,500-megawatt coal-fired power plant within the Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico. In January 2009, Region 9 withdrew the portion of its permit decision on CO2 limitations for additional analysis. State courts have been involved in deciding whether BACT must be applied to CO2 in PSD areas, with one court ruling in Friends of the Chattahoochee, Inc. v. Couch case. The court ruled that CO2 is \"subject to regulation\" under the Clean Air Act, citing examples of regulations addressing CO2. The BACT requirement applies to pollutants without a separate numerical limitation. Another court case challenges a state-issued PSD permit for a coal-fired power plant in Montana. The court ruled that CO2 should be regulated under the Clean Air Act, as per the BACT requirement for pollutants. EPA denied a petition to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles in 2003. In 2003, EPA denied a petition to regulate CO2 and other GHG emissions for their climate change impacts, leading to a lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit. The Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that Massachusetts had standing to bring the claim and that EPA has authority to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. The majority held that Massachusetts had standing to bring the claim and EPA has authority to regulate motor vehicle GHGs under section 202. The phrase \"in his judgment\" does not allow EPA to exercise discretion against regulating based on policy considerations. The ruling in favor of petitioners was forecast early in the majority opinion by its opening sentences highlighting the rise in global temperatures and carbon dioxide concentration. The Court found that petitioners had two factors in their favor: the CAA authorizes challenges to agency action unlawfully withheld, and a litigant has a procedural right in such cases. The Court found that Massachusetts had standing to bring the claim based on its status as a sovereign state and owner of shore land affected by global-warming-induced sea level rise. Despite the unique position of the petitioners, the Court still conducted a traditional standing analysis. The Court ruled that Massachusetts had standing to bring the claim due to its ownership of shore land affected by sea level rise. The Court emphasized that even a small reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, though not significant globally, is sufficient for standing purposes. The Court found that Massachusetts had standing to bring the claim based on ownership of shore land affected by sea level rise. The remedy sought, EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, was deemed likely to slow or reduce climate change, satisfying redressability. The Court briefly addressed CAA issues, stating that the CAA's broad definition of \"air pollutant\" cannot be reconciled with EPA's actions. The Court rejected EPA's argument that GHGs are not included as air pollutants under the CAA. It also dismissed EPA's claim that vehicle GHG emissions were excluded due to fuel economy standards falling under a different statute. The majority concluded that EPA's discretion is limited to determining if an air pollutant endangers public health or welfare. The Court ruled that EPA must take action in response to a petition regarding greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. EPA's reasons for not regulating GHG emissions were deemed irrelevant, and the focus should be on whether there is enough information to make an endangerment finding. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit opinion and remanded the case. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit opinion and remanded the case regarding EPA's denial of the section 202 petition on GHG emissions. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Scalia dissented, arguing about standing and agency policy preferences. The Court's decision left EPA with three options regarding regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit opinion and remanded the case regarding EPA's denial of the section 202 petition on GHG emissions. The Court left EPA with three options for regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions, including making a finding that emissions endanger public health or welfare, determining that emissions do not meet that prerequisite, or deciding that climate change science is too uncertain to make a finding. The EPA's rejection of the petition was partly based on scientific uncertainty expressed in a 2001 National Research Council report on climate change. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit opinion on EPA's denial of the section 202 petition for GHG emissions regulation. The decision allows EPA to consider policy when writing regulations after an endangerment finding. CAA section 202 does not impose strict criteria on GHG emission standards. President Bush requested CAA regulations for vehicle GHG emissions by 2008, following the Massachusetts v. EPA case. EPA could set voluntary standards or tie them to CAFE standards for fuel economy. In response to the Massachusetts v. EPA case, EPA proposed an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in early 2008, addressing the full range of ramifications throughout the Clean Air Act. Petitioners requested the D.C. Circuit to order EPA to comply with the Supreme Court's remand, but the court denied the request in June 2008. EPA then issued a notice the following month. The court denied the request in June 2008. The EPA issued a lengthy ANPR in response to the question of regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, warning of potential economic impacts. The Obama Administration EPA later issued a proposed endangerment finding in April 2009, with emission standards for GHGs to follow. The Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA has implications beyond its four corners, improving the prospects of litigation to restrict GHG emissions from stationary sources. Efforts to compel EPA regulation of stationary source GHGs are already underway, with potential coverage under the CAA's new source review permitting program. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA has implications for regulating GHG emissions from stationary sources and mobile sources. Rulemaking petitions are seeking EPA regulation of GHGs from various types of mobile sources, including fuels, nonroad engines, aircraft, and rebuilt heavy-duty highway engines. The decision may also impact climate change litigation due to its discussion of standing. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA has implications for climate change litigation, particularly regarding standing. A recent D.C. Circuit panel limited the scope of the decision to state plaintiffs, impacting other climate change cases. The decision has also been used to dismiss a nuisance action on \"political question\" grounds. The Supreme Court's authority over GHG emissions has implications for federal common law claims. The Marine Mammal Protection Act allows for incidental takings of marine mammals under specified conditions. Environmental groups challenge an \"incidental taking\" rule authorizing the take of polar bears and Pacific walrus for five years resulting from oil and gas activities in Alaska. Plaintiffs argue the rule violates the MMPA by permitting more than a \"negligible\" impact on the species. The district court dismissed the suit, stating the determination of negligible impact by the Fish and Wildlife Service was reasonable. An appeal has been filed. The lawsuit challenges an \"incidental taking\" rule allowing the take of polar bears and Pacific walrus in Alaska due to oil and gas activities. The district court found the impact reasonable based on the administrative record. An appeal has been filed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits the \"take\" of listed species and requires federal agencies to ensure actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitats. Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with wildlife agencies to determine the impact of their actions on listed species or habitats. This consultation results in a biological opinion that either approves the action or suggests alternatives to avoid harm to the species. In a specific case, environmental groups challenged a biological opinion related to water project operations in California. The court found that the biological opinion on State Water Project Operations Criteria and Plan was arbitrary and capricious for ignoring data on climate change that could harm the Delta smelt and its habitat. The opinion assumed historical hydrology patterns for the next 20 years, which studies on climate change effects did not support. The Center for Biological Diversity has challenged NMFS biological opinion for failing to address the effects of climate change on salmon and trout species. CBD is filing petitions to list animals as endangered due to climate change impacts on their habitat, with some successful listings already. This could lead to court challenges on whether substantial GHG sources violate ESA protections for species. The Center for Biological Diversity has successfully petitioned for the listing of several species as threatened or endangered due to climate change impacts on their habitat. This includes the staghorn coral, elkhorn coral, polar bear, black abalone, Kittlitz's murrelet, penguins, and the American pika. The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned for the listing of various species as threatened or endangered due to climate change impacts on their habitat. This includes seabirds, penguins, the American pika, seals, walruses, and storm-petrels. The question arises whether operating fossil-fuel-fired power plants violates section 9 by causing harm to these species through GHG emissions and climate change effects on their habitat. The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned for the listing of various species as threatened or endangered due to climate change impacts on their habitat, including seabirds, penguins, the American pika, seals, walruses, and storm-petrels. The question arises whether operating fossil-fuel-fired power plants violates section 9 by causing harm to these species through GHG emissions and climate change effects on their habitat, potentially requiring an incidental take permit and section 7 consultation. The causal link between power plant emissions and habitat harm is a key consideration. The FWS issued a \"special rule\" for the polar bear under ESA section 4(d) to ensure GHG emissions are irrelevant to the ESA. Lawsuits challenging the polar bear listing and the \"special rule\" were consolidated in 2008. FWS and NMFS amended section 7 consultation regulations to keep the ESA and GHG emissions separate. The Obama Administration allowed the Secretary of the Interior and Commerce to withdraw the polar bear special rule and consultation regulations within 60 days. The withdrawal was made on May 4, 2009, reinstating the previous version of the regulations. This streamlined withdrawal authority was exercised solely for the consultation regulations, resolving lawsuits challenging the amended rule. The lawsuits challenging the amended rule were dismissed on May 14, 2009, after the withdrawal of the polar bear special rule and consultation regulations. In Center for Biological Diversity v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 11 states and environmental groups attacked a 2006 rule on corporate average fuel economy standards for light-duty trucks. The court found NHTSA's use of cost-benefit analysis to determine the standard as arbitrary and capricious. The court found NHTSA's cost-benefit analysis for determining the CAFE standard arbitrary and capricious, as it did not include the benefit of carbon emissions reduction, which was deemed the most significant benefit. The court remanded the CAFE standard back to NHTSA to include a monetized value for carbon emission reduction in its analysis. CBD also filed a petition for review of NHTSA's rule for model year 2011 vehicles. The petition for review of NHTSA's rule for model year 2011 vehicles is unclear on whether climate change concerns are underlying the suit, but it seems likely given a recent court decision rejecting climate change arguments in a different case. The court found that petitioners lacked standing in Massachusetts v. EPA, but had procedural rights standing. Their OCSLA claims failed as Interior was not required to consider global environmental impact. Despite climate change claims, the Leasing Program was vacated and remanded on other grounds. Climate change litigation under NEPA focuses on government disclosure of environmental information. NEPA requires consideration of environmental impacts through assessments and statements, but does not mandate choosing the least impactful option. The key issue is plaintiffs' standing to sue, potentially influenced by the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. The standing issues in climate change litigation under NEPA have been influenced by the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. Courts have found it difficult to determine standing, especially in the D.C. Circuit, and have generally accepted that climate change impacts must be considered in an EIS. Massachusetts v. EPA addressed substantive-rights standing, not procedural-rights standing, but the analyses often overlap. In City of Los Angeles v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., the D.C. Circuit addressed standing issues in climate change litigation under NEPA. The majority found that petitioners had standing based on the potential climate change impacts of NHTSA's decision not to prepare an EIS for a one mpg rollback in fuel economy standards. One judge in dissent argued for a more precise causal showing. One judge in the majority found NHTSA's explanation for the increase in carbon dioxide emissions inadequate within the context of global warming. The petition was denied as the other majority judge ruled in favor of the agency. The City of Los Angeles standard for global-warming-based standing was short-lived, with a new requirement for procedural-rights plaintiffs to show a procedural omission will likely cause a specific injury. In Foundation on Economic Trends v. Watkins, the standing bar was raised during litigation. Plaintiffs argued for \"informational standing\" based on NEPA requirements for evaluating climate change impacts. They relied on D.C. Circuit decisions to support their claim. Plaintiffs in a lawsuit relied on D.C. Circuit decisions for informational standing, but the court limited standing during the case. An individual plaintiff's complaint about potential harm from climate change was rejected for not meeting the causation requirement. The court emphasized that there is no exception for global warming in standing requirements. The court found that petitioners had procedural rights standing but their NEPA claims were deemed unripe as no lease sales had occurred yet. Despite the dismissal of climate-change-related claims, the court vacated and remanded the Leasing Program on other grounds. The challenge in Sierra Club v. U.S. Department of Agriculture involved the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utility Service's use of low-interest loans for new coal-fired power plants and the lack of environmental analysis before approving business agreements for a project in Kansas. In 2002, environmental groups sued federal agencies for failing to comply with NEPA in overseas projects involving oil and gas extraction, power plants, and GHG emissions causing climate change in the US. The district court ruled that plaintiffs had standing. In 2005, the district court found plaintiffs had standing due to relaxed standards in the Ninth Circuit for showing standing in cases alleging procedural violations. The court stated emissions from projects supported by defendants could threaten plaintiffs' interests. In 2007, the court ruled that defendants did not need to prepare a programmatic EIS for energy projects they finance. The case was settled in 2009 with agreements to consider GHG emissions of supported projects. In Border Power Plant Working Group v. Dep't of Energy, plaintiff challenged environmental assessment for permits to build electricity transmission lines connecting new power plants in Mexico with Southern California grid. Court found plaintiff had organizational standing and agreed assessment was inadequate for not discussing CO2 emissions. The court decision in Center for Biological Diversity v. NHTSA found NHTSA's environmental assessment for its CAFE rule on light-duty trucks inadequate due to insufficient analysis of the rule's cumulative impacts from greenhouse gas emissions. Petitioners included 11 states and four environmental groups. The United States did not contest standing in this case. The court found NHTSA's environmental assessment for its CAFE rule on light-duty trucks inadequate due to insufficient analysis of the rule's cumulative impacts from greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act did not limit NHTSA's duty to assess environmental impacts like climate change. The court emphasized the need for evaluating the incremental impact of CO2 emissions on climate change in light of other past, present, and foreseeable actions. The court also stated that an Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared if substantial questions are raised regarding significant environmental impact. In Center for Biological Diversity v. Kempthorne, environmental groups challenge a Fish and Wildlife Service rule allowing incidental take of polar bears and Pacific walrus by oil and gas activities in the Beaufort Sea. Plaintiffs argue that the environmental assessment did not adequately consider the effects of climate change on the species and their habitat, leading to a court order for a full Environmental Impact Statement. The accusation is that direct harms to polar bears and walruses from oil and gas activities will worsen due to climate change impacts in the Arctic. A court ruled in April 2008 that the impacts of these activities in the Beaufort Sea do not meet the threshold for requiring environmental assessments. An appeal has been filed. In another case, petitioners disputed the adequacy of an EIS for a railroad construction proposal. The court found it \"irresponsible\" for the Board to approve a large railroad construction project without considering the potential increase in coal consumption and its effects, including climate change. In another case, plaintiffs challenged Department of Agriculture regulations easing restrictions on importing cattle from Mad Cow Disease regions, arguing that the environmental assessment was inadequate. Plaintiffs in Canada challenged Department of Agriculture regulations on importing cattle from Mad Cow Disease regions, citing inadequate environmental assessment. GHG-related suits under state \"little NEPAs\" have also been filed, such as General Motors Corp. v. California Air Resources Bd., involving delayed compliance with GHG emission standards. The argument presented is that GHG emissions regulation has environmental downsides in addition to benefits. The lawsuit in San Bernardino County in 2007, under California's NEPA-like statute, required addressing climate change in the General Plan update. California settled the lawsuit, leading to the county preparing a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan. Conservation groups withdrew their suit after the county agreed to wildlife habitat mapping and wildfire research. This case signifies a new frontier in climate change litigation, focusing on local land use plans. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 mandates the creation of a United States Global Change Research Program to study global environmental changes that could impact Earth's ability to sustain life. The Program includes regular scientific assessments and revised Research Plans submitted to Congress every three years. Scientific assessments must be submitted to the President and Congress at least every four years. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 requires regular scientific assessments and revised Research Plans to be submitted to the President and Congress every three years. Assessments must be submitted at least every four years, with the latest assessment due in May 2008. In a specific case, the Bush Administration was found to have unlawfully withheld required action, leading to court-ordered deadlines for publication and submission. The court also addressed standing and a motion to intervene by Members of Congress. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requires federal agencies to disclose documents to the public upon request. In 2006, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) requested records from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) related to climate change. CREW sued under FOIA to obtain all responsive records. The case is currently on hold as CEQ works to comply. Allegations surfaced that political appointees in the Bush Administration edited CEQ reports to downplay climate change. In 2006, the House Committee on Government Reform requested documents on CEQ's edits of climate change materials. A report with findings was issued in 2007. The potential for diverse plaintiffs and defendants in common law tort litigation related to climate change injuries is significant. The potential for diverse plaintiffs and defendants in common law tort litigation related to climate change injuries is significant. Possible plaintiffs include homeowners affected by rising sea levels or increased storm activity, nonowner users of natural resources, and state attorneys general. Possible defendants include companies that produce fossil fuels, entities that emit greenhouse gases, and companies that manufacture products that create greenhouse gas emissions. Despite several climate-change-related tort cases being filed, all court decisions so far have failed due to lack of standing. In 2004, eight states and New York City sued five electric utility companies for their contribution to climate change through CO2 emissions. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to cap and reduce emissions, invoking federal and state common law of public nuisance. The lawsuit filed by states and New York City aims to protect state-owned property and public health from the effects of climate change. Land trusts also filed a similar suit, adding a private nuisance claim. Defendants tried to dismiss the actions on various grounds, but the case was decided on a single threshold issue. Defendants in private GHG litigation challenge federal common law cause of action for climate change, citing Supreme Court directives and CAA regulations. They also dispute plaintiffs' standing to sue based on lack of demonstrated injury in fact. Defendants in private GHG litigation argue that plaintiffs lack standing to sue for climate change damages due to the absence of demonstrated injury in fact and causation. They also challenge the federal common law cause of action, citing Supreme Court directives and CAA regulations. The dismissal motions in Connecticut and Open Space Institute were ruled on by the district court, which dismissed the cases on political question grounds. The court found that the GHG cases involved policy determinations beyond judicial discretion, leading to their dismissal. The court dismissed GHG cases in Connecticut and Open Space Institute on political question grounds, stating climate change issues are for the legislature, not the courts, to resolve. Nuisance law ambiguity may have hindered plaintiffs' cause. California filed a similar nuisance action in 2006 against automobile manufacturers for climate change impacts, seeking monetary damages. The court dismissed GHG cases in Connecticut and Open Space Institute on political question grounds, stating climate change issues are for the legislature, not the courts, to resolve. California filed a similar nuisance action in 2006 against automobile manufacturers for climate change impacts, seeking monetary damages. In California v. General Motors Corp., the court emphasized the need for an \"initial policy determination\" by the political branches due to the complexity of the climate change issue and the global warming debate. An appeal to the Ninth Circuit is pending. The Native Village of Kivalina in Alaska sued oil and energy companies for contributing to climate change, causing coastal erosion and the need for relocation. They invoked federal common law and state laws for public nuisance and civil conspiracy claims. The lawsuit alleges that certain oil, coal, and chemical companies misled the public about global warming, leading to a public nuisance. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for property damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, attributing it to the companies' greenhouse gas emissions. They claim negligence, nuisance, trespass, and fraud, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The lawsuit alleges that oil and coal companies disseminated misinformation about global warming, leading to property damage from Hurricane Katrina. Plaintiffs made claims against their insurance and mortgage companies, but the district court dismissed the action for lack of standing. The court also found some claims nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine. An appeal to the Fifth Circuit is pending. The question of federal law preempting state regulation of GHG emissions mainly concerns mobile sources. The CAA does not intend to preempt state air pollution controls on stationary sources, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act does not set fuel economy standards for stationary sources. Some argue that state regulation of stationary-source GHGs is preempted due to federal authority over foreign policy. California has enacted limits on GHG emissions from stationary sources, which has not been challenged. Preemption is more common for mobile sources. The Clean Air Act (CAA) preempts states from setting emission standards for GHGs from mobile sources, including CO2, methane, and hydrofluorocarbons. The Supreme Court has clarified that \"air pollutants\" under the CAA include GHGs. States are generally preempted from regulating mobile-source GHG emissions, except for California, which can request a waiver from EPA. California can request a waiver from the EPA to set emission standards for GHGs from mobile sources. In 2005, California requested a waiver for its GHG emissions regulations, which were the first in the nation to call for limits on GHG emissions from mobile sources. The California Air Resources Board adopted regulations in 2004 targeting CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbon emissions. The EPA set greenhouse gas emission requirements for vehicles starting in 2009, with reductions each year through 2016. California requested a waiver for this, but the EPA Administrator intended to deny it in 2007. Legal challenges followed, with a suit in the D.C. Circuit involving California, other states, and environmental groups. The California Air Resources Board and President Obama requested EPA to reopen the waiver-denial matter in 2009. Litigation over preemption of state GHG regulation of mobile sources is significant, with non-CAA preemption claims being pressed. If successful, these claims could prevent California and other states from implementing mobile-source standards even if EPA's regulations are in place. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) preempts states from adopting laws related to federal fuel economy standards, arguing that improving gas mileage is the only way to reduce GHG emissions. This could prevent California and other states from implementing mobile-source standards even if EPA's denial of the waiver is reversed. The court ruled that the state regulation of auto GHG emissions is related to federal emission standards, making it invalid. Non-CAA preemption suits brought by auto interests are pending in federal circuits with states that have adopted GHG controls on vehicles. Two decisions from Vermont and California reject preemption theories, viewing the relationship between state GHG standards and federal statutes as an interplay rather than a preemption question. The court found that the relationship between the Clean Air Act waiver authority and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) provisions was one of overlap, not conflict. Despite determining that preemption doctrine did not apply, the court conducted a preemption analysis and concluded that Vermont's greenhouse gas (GHG) standards were not preempted by EPCA or an intrusion on U.S. foreign policy authority. An appeal is pending. In a separate decision, the district court in Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. v. Goldstene also addressed similar issues. In Inc. v. Goldstene, a district court rejected claims that California's regulation of GHG emissions from cars and trucks was precluded by EPCA or preempted as an intrusion of state law on federal authority. The legal theories in this case are similar to those in Rhode Island suits challenging the state's adoption of California standards. Recently, the district court held that claims of auto manufacturers and trade associations were barred by collateral estoppel, as these parties had already litigated similar issues in other cases. In another preemption case, Rhode Island auto dealers were deemed viable plaintiffs, allowing the case to proceed. New Mexico's adoption of California GHG standards is challenged in Zangara Dodge, Inc. v. Curry. The first climate-change decision involving state statutes was Matter of Quantification of Environmental Costs, which required the state's public utilities commission to determine environmental cost values for energy generation methods. In 2000, the City of Seattle set a goal to meet its electricity needs with no net greenhouse gas emissions. The city-owned electric utility offset its GHG emissions by paying others to reduce theirs, making it the first large electric utility in the country to eliminate its contribution of harmful greenhouse gas emissions. In Okeson v. City of Seattle, ratepayers challenged the utility's purchase of GHG offsets, arguing it was not authorized by the state's utility enabling act. The Washington Supreme Court agreed, stating that the offset contracts were not within the act's purposes. Another case involved environmental intervenors opposing a permit for a coal-fired facility in South Dakota, which was ultimately granted by the public utilities commission and upheld by the state supreme court. The state supreme court upheld the commission's decision that the added CO2 from a facility did not pose a \"serious\" threat to the environment. In contrast, a permit for coal-fired power plants was initially denied in Kansas but later granted after the agency invoked emergency powers due to CO2 emissions endangering health. In 2007, the agency denied a permit for coal-fired power plants in Kansas due to CO2 emissions posing a substantial endangerment. Despite legislative attempts to bypass this decision, Governor Sebelius vetoed laws that would have excluded CO2 emissions from evaluation. Sunflower Electric Power Corp. filed suits alleging equal protection and Dormant Commerce Clause violations in response to the permit denial. Sunflower Electric Power Corp. filed a lawsuit claiming a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause due to the denial of a permit for coal-fired power plants in Kansas. A deal was eventually reached allowing one plant to be built, leading to the dismissal of the federal suit. Additionally, there is a lawsuit regarding insurance coverage for climate change-related liabilities. The company seeks a declaratory judgment to determine if it is obligated to provide defense or indemnity coverage to the energy company in a lawsuit brought by the Village of Kivalina. The insurer argues that the policy only applies to accidents, the injuries began before the insurance policies, and the pollution exclusion conditions have not been met. Climate change poses a long-term challenge to the insurance industry. The Kyoto Protocol may involve wealthy nations assisting developing countries with climate change adaptation costs. There is a question of whether major GHG emitting nations can be sued internationally for climate change effects. The International Court of Justice could potentially handle climate change claims through specific treaties. The International Court of Justice could potentially handle climate change claims through specific treaties, such as Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation treaties. Other options include advisory opinions, international arbitral forums, and specialized dispute resolution systems. One example is a fisheries conservation agreement under the UN Law of the Sea Convention to address the impact of climate change on fish stocks. The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law and the Trail Smelter arbitration decision provide principles for addressing claims of GHG-caused injury. These principles emphasize a nation's duty to prevent significant environmental harm to other states. Claimants face challenges in linking climate change to specific impacts. The hurdles faced by claimants in linking climate change to specific environmental harms and attributing responsibility to the United States are significant. Only one international law action related to climate change has been filed against the United States, by a group representing the Inuit in the Arctic. In 2005, a petition was filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights alleging that the United States violated the human rights of the Inuit through its failure to restrict greenhouse gas emissions. The Inuit petitioned the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 2005, claiming that the United States violated their human rights by not restricting greenhouse gas emissions. The petition sought recommendations for corrective measures, but was rejected in 2006 without reasons given. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights rejected a petition from the Inuit in 2006 without giving reasons. However, a hearing was held in 2007 on the issue of climate change and human rights. Five petitions were also submitted to UNESCO regarding World Heritage Sites impacted by climate change. The petitions submitted to UNESCO regarding World Heritage Sites impacted by climate change include Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, Sagarmatha National Park, Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, Huascaran National Park, and the Great Barrier Reef. The United States is obligated to protect its cultural and natural heritage as a party to the World Heritage Convention. The World Heritage Committee acknowledged the petitions in 2006 and emphasized using existing mechanisms to address climate change threats. Additional petitions to list sites on the danger list have since been filed. A petition titled \"The Role of Black Carbon in Endangering Sites Threatened by Glacial Melt and Sea Level Rise\" highlights the vulnerability of World Heritage Sites to climate change, specifically mentioning high latitude and high altitude glaciers and low-elevation sites. It lists 15 sites that should be placed on the danger list, with Waterton-Glacier being the only site in the United States mentioned. No international law claims have been brought by low-lying nations at risk of sea level rise. Sea level rise predicted to affect 600 million people on low-lying Pacific islands and southeast Asia. Climate change lawsuits aim to keep the issue prominent and hold GHG emitters accountable, despite limited success in obtaining judgments. Climate change lawsuits face challenges in holding GHG emitters accountable due to reluctance to impose costly measures on minor contributors. However, recent court decisions show a shift towards government consideration of climate change, with standing becoming less of an issue for environmental plaintiffs. The Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA is expected to improve plaintiffs' prospects in climate change lawsuits. Causation and allocation of damages among defendants are key challenges in these cases. In private-remedy actions for climate change issues, legal challenges arise due to imposing liability for harms that are distant in time and place from the pollution sources. This issue is similar to the problem of acid rain, where cause and effect are separated by long distances. Some states in the US have adopted their own GHG emission regulations due to existing legal hurdles and resistance to regulatory approaches by the George W. Bush Administration. Several states in the United States have implemented their own GHG emission controls, with 23 states joining regional initiatives. Some states have also considered emissions trading with Europe. Additionally, at least 40 states and Canadian provinces have formed a Climate Registry to support reporting schemes. California and the United Kingdom have signed an agreement to implement market-based mechanisms and collaborate on research. Internationally, an unsuccessful Inuit petition was noted. The report highlighted various efforts to address GHG emissions, including state-level controls in the US and international collaborations. Legal actions, such as potential lawsuits over cap-and-trade systems and rising sea levels, were also mentioned as emerging strategies. The report mentioned state-level controls and international collaborations to address GHG emissions. Legal actions, like lawsuits over cap-and-trade systems and rising sea levels, are emerging strategies that may prompt government response to climate change. Litigation and unilateral state actions are seen as temporary solutions to push the national government to act comprehensively."
