    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teri Zenner Social Worker Safety Act\". Congress finds that 2 million American workers are victims of job-related violence annually, with a significant portion occurring in the fields of health care and social services. A study revealed that 70 percent of front-line child welfare workers have experienced violence. Front-line child welfare workers often face violence or threats in their line of duty, with 90% experiencing verbal threats, 30% physical attacks, and 13% threatened with weapons. Social service workers in the public sector are 7 times more likely to be victims of violent assaults compared to those in the private sector. States like California, New Jersey, and Washington, along with the National Association of Social Workers, have implemented safety programs and guidelines for worker protection. Social workers and case workers face job-related violence, impacting individuals, families, clients, and communities in the United States. There is a need to raise awareness and prevent violence in the field of social services to protect these dedicated individuals and reduce the severity of injuries. The Social Worker Safety Grant Program aims to address job-related violence faced by social workers and case workers in the United States. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants to States for safety measures for social workers and professionals working with at-risk populations. Funds can be used for safety equipment, training, facility improvements, and pepper spray for self-defense. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants to States for safety measures for social workers and professionals working with at-risk populations. This includes providing pepper spray for self-defense, cultural competency training, de-escalation strategies, mental health training, educational resources on safety measures, and other activities determined by the Secretary. States seeking a grant must submit an application with required information. Each grant application must describe the agencies receiving funding, the specific activities sought, and include a program budget. Applicants must assure evaluation of safety measure effectiveness. Priority is given to applicants with the greatest need and those assisting multiple agencies. The Secretary ensures quality assurance and cost-effectiveness in grant awards. The Secretary establishes guidelines for cost-effective and quality safety measures funded under this section. Technical assistance may be provided to grant recipients for planning and implementing safety measures. States receiving grants must submit a report within 2 years, including an assessment of funded activities, training opportunities for social workers, and strategies to address threats to social workers. The non-Federal share for safety measures in State grants is 50 percent. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014 for this Act."
