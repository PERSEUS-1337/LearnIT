    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Get the Lead Out of Schools Act\" and includes provisions for school testing, notification, and a grant program. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include testing and notification requirements for public water systems serving schools, with a focus on lead levels in drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act now requires public water systems to notify relevant authorities if lead levels in school drinking water exceed the established limit. Additionally, a School Lead Testing and Remediation Grant Program is defined for eligible entities like local educational agencies or State agencies. The Administrator will establish a grant program for eligible entities to test and remediate lead contamination in school drinking water. Grant funds can be used to cover testing costs conducted by approved entities. The grant program allows for testing and replacing lead pipes, fittings, and fixtures in schools with high lead levels in drinking water. Up to 5 percent of funds can be used for administrative costs related to testing and remediation. Guidance and information on the program will be made publicly available. As a condition of receiving a grant under this program, eligible entities must follow EPA guidance on reducing lead in drinking water in schools and make this information publicly available. Eligible entities receiving grants must publicly share results of lead testing in school drinking water and notify relevant organizations."
