    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 15146 of the Education Code is amended to allow bonds to be issued and sold by the governing board of the school district or community college district. The method of sale must be approved in a public meeting with reasons stated. The governing board of a school district or community college district must disclose the method of sale selected for issuing bonds, the identities of bond counsel, underwriter, and financial adviser, estimated costs of bond issuance, and details of bonds with compounding interest. When selling bonds with compounding interest, the resolution must be publicly noticed on two consecutive meeting agendas. The agenda item should include an analysis of the total cost of compounding interest bonds, a comparison to current interest bonds, and the reason for recommending compounding interest bonds. The governing board of the school district or community college district must disclose the costs of bond sales, present actual cost information at public meetings, and submit a summary to the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission. All necessary information and reports on bond sales must be submitted to the Commission in compliance with the Government Code. The bonds may be sold at a discount not to exceed 5 percent and at an interest rate not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by law, following competitive bid regulations. The governing board of the school district or community college district must sell the bonds by a specified date. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are deposited in the county treasury for the designated school district or community college district's building fund. The funds can only be used for the intended purposes and cannot be invested outside the county treasury. Any premium or accrued interest received is deposited into the interest and sinking fund of the district. The governing board of a school district or community college district may deposit up to 2 percent of bond proceeds in a costs of issuance account separate from other funds. These funds can only be used for authorized costs of issuance upon the board's order. The remaining balance of bond proceeds not used for authorized costs of issuance may be transferred to the county treasury for the building fund of the school district or community college district. The governing board of the school district or community college district may deposit proceeds of bond sales in the interest and sinking fund in the amount of the annual reserve permitted by Section 15250 or a lesser amount as determined by the board. This deposit is a proper charge against the building fund. The governing board of the school district or community college district may deposit proceeds of bond sales in the interest and sinking fund for up to two years to cover the interest due on that series of bonds. This deposit is a proper charge against the building fund."
