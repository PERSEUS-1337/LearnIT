    "content": "The 112th Congress prioritized federal R&D funding amidst concerns about the federal debt and budget deficits. The U.S. government supports a wide range of research for national defense, health, environment, and energy security, aiming to advance knowledge, develop workforce, and enhance innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. The federal government plays a crucial role in funding R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. Congress defines the nation's R&D priorities and faces challenges in balancing R&D investment with increased pressure on discretionary spending. President Obama's proposed FY2012 budget included $147.911 billion for R&D, a 0.5% increase over FY2010. Adjusted for inflation, the request represented a 2.2% decrease. The funding prioritized physical sciences and engineering in line with the America COMPETES Act. President Obama proposed increased funding for R&D agencies in the Reauthorization Act of 2010, aiming to boost R&D investment to over 3% of the GDP. However, actual appropriations fell short of authorized levels. President Obama's proposal for increased R&D funding in the Reauthorization Act of 2010 aimed to boost investment to over 3% of GDP, but actual appropriations fell short. Concerns were raised about the potential harm of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding, following the rapid expansion of biomedical research infrastructure after the NIH budget doubled in FY2003. After the NIH budget doubled in FY2003, there was rapid growth in university faculty hiring, students pursuing biomedical degrees, and grant applications to NIH. However, the agency's budget fell each year in real terms from FY2004 to FY2009, leading to interruptions and cancellations of research, decreased student interest in graduate studies, and reduced employment prospects for biomedical researchers with advanced degrees. NIH Director Elias Zerhouni highlighted the challenges faced by early- and mid-career scientists in obtaining grants. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by inconsistencies in reporting among agencies, making it difficult to accurately track R&D agency figures. The President's FY2012 budget request included a proposal for a Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund, receiving $3 billion over seven years from electromagnetic spectrum auctions. The WIN funds were intended to support research, test beds, and applications development for advanced wireless technologies in various sectors like public safety, Smart Grid, telemedicine, and distance learning. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund of $3 billion over seven years from spectrum auctions to support research and development in advanced wireless technologies. However, Congress did not establish the WIN Fund for FY2012. Federal R&D funding for FY2010, FY2011, and FY2012 was primarily allocated to six agencies, with the Department of Defense receiving the largest share at 51.8%. The President's FY2012 budget proposed significant increases in R&D funding for various agencies, including DOE, HHS, NSF, NASA, and DOC. DOD R&D funding would have been reduced under the budget request. In the FY2012 budget request, DOD R&D funding would have been reduced by $3.969 billion (-4.9%), USDA R&D by $461 million (-17.7%), Department of Veterans Affairs R&D by $144 million (-12.4%), and EPA R&D by $11 million (-1.9%). President Obama's FY2012 request included $32.895 billion for basic research, up $3.498 billion (11.9%) from FY2010; $33.182 billion for applied research, up $3.383 billion (11.4%); $79.414 billion for development, down $3.891 billion (-4.7%); and $2.420 billion for facilities and equipment, down $2.218 billion (-47.8%). In FY2012, NASA funding for the ISS was categorized as research instead of facilities and equipment. Federal R&D funding is divided into basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research, with the Department of Health and Human Services, mainly NIH, contributing over half of all federal funding for basic research in the President's FY2012 budget request. In contrast to basic research funded by NIH, industry is the primary funder of applied research in the United States, with HHS being the largest federal funder. Industry also provides the majority of funding for development, while DOD is the primary federal agency funder of development. Federal R&D funding includes multiagency efforts like the National Nanotechnology Initiative. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in 2006 to increase federal funding for physical sciences and engineering research by doubling funding over 10 years for targeted accounts at NSF, DOE, and NIST. Congress authorized substantial increases for these targeted accounts under the America COMPETES Act in 2007. In 2010, Congress passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358) which authorized appropriations levels for targeted accounts for FY2011-FY2013. The funding for these accounts fell below targets set by previous acts, with FY2011 funding approximately $1.101 billion less than authorized. This slower pace of funding growth set a trajectory to double over 16 years from the FY2006 level, longer than initially envisioned in the 2007 America COMPETES Act. In FY2012, President Obama sought increased funding for targeted accounts, but fell short of the requested amounts. For example, funding for NSF was $7.033 billion instead of the requested $7.767 billion. Similarly, funding for core laboratory research at NIST was $567.0 million instead of $678.9 million. Additionally, funding for construction of research facilities at NIST was $55.4 million instead of $84.6 million. Funding for DOE's Office of Science was $5.416 billion, as requested by President Obama. President Obama sought to double funding for basic research at ACI agencies over a 10-year period, but budget constraints have raised questions about the feasibility of this goal. The FY2012 budget request reiterated the intention to double federal investment for these agencies, although the timeframe was not specified. The Administration's September 1, 2011, Mid-Session Review acknowledged that the doubling goal for key research and development agencies would be delayed due to new funding levels. Aggregate budget authority for targeted accounts is projected to remain flat through FY2015, with a slight increase in FY2016. Figure 1 illustrates funding for agencies as a percentage of their FY2006 level, comparing actual and authorized appropriations to different doubling rates. President Obama's FY2012 budget request included funding for three multiagency R&D initiatives. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) received $1.697 billion in FY2012, $150 million below FY2011 levels. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program received $3.739 billion in FY2012, essentially the same as FY2011. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) received $2.427 billion in FY2012, $21 million below FY2011 levels. In December 2011, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74), which included nine regular appropriations bills totaling $2.448 billion, $206 million less than President Obama's request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) included nine regular appropriations bills totaling $2.448 billion, $206 million less than President Obama's request. Additionally, Congress completed action on the Education, Legislative Branch, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, State Department, and Foreign Operations Appropriations Acts in November 2011. Obama signed the bill into law two days later, amending an earlier appropriations act to provide funding for agencies at 1.503% below FY2011 levels. Congress passed two bills extending agency funding for FY2012. The report analyzes R&D funding in federal departments and agencies receiving over 98% of federal R&D funding. The report analyzes R&D funding in federal departments and agencies that receive over 98% of federal R&D funding. Annual appropriations for these agencies are provided through 8 of the 12 regular appropriations bills. Congress supports research and development in the Department of Defense primarily through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriation. The Department of Defense receives funding for research and development primarily through its Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriation. This funding supports the development of military hardware, software, and technology. Additionally, RDT&E funds are also appropriated in other parts of the defense bill, such as the Defense Health Program and the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. These programs receive funding for medical research and healthcare delivery to DOD personnel and their families. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program in the defense appropriations bill supports the destruction of lethal chemical agents and munitions to prevent future risks and costs. The National Defense Sealift Fund backs the procurement, operation, and maintenance of the naval reserve fleet and U.S. flagged merchant fleet. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund includes RDT&E funds but lacks a specific RDT&E line item. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, which administers RDT&E funds, does not have a specific RDT&E line item. The funding for RDT&E is tracked by the office but not reported. RDT&E funds are also requested and appropriated separately for efforts in the Global War on Terror and Overseas Contingency Operations. The funds are typically allocated to specified Program Elements in Title IV and are accounted for separately. The Obama Administration includes OCO funds in the regular budget, not emergency supplementals. Additional OCO funds may be requested if needed. GWOT/OCO-related requests include funds for various transfer funds like the Iraqi Freedom Fund, Afghan Security Forces Fund, and others. Congress makes a single appropriation into these funds and authorizes transfers at the Secretary's discretion. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Congress established a new Military Intelligence Program Transfer Fund, granting the Secretary authority to transfer funds for RDT&E. The Obama Administration requested $75.325 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E and $397 million in OCO RDT&E for FY2012. Additionally, $100 million was requested for DOD's share of the Wireless Innovation Fund to expand coverage and usage of wireless networks. DARPA was to manage the fund. The House did not establish the WIN fund for FY2012, instead voting to appropriate $72.993 billion for Title IV RDT&E. This included reductions to various major programs such as the Army's Patriot/MEADS and Manned Ground Vehicles programs, the Air Force's National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environment Satellite and Rocket System Launch programs, and the Office of the Secretary's Precision Tracking Space System and Prompt Strike Capability. The House appropriation was $2.432 billion below the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $71.034 billion for Title IV RDT&E, with major program decreases including the Army's Warfighter Information Network, Manned Ground Vehicle, and Logistics and Engineering Equipment. DARPA's budget request was reduced by $100 million, while the House made no mention of DOD's involvement in the Wireless Innovation Fund. The Senate committee recommended cuts to various defense programs, including the Manned Ground Vehicle and Logistics and Engineering Equipment. They also reduced funding for the Air Force's National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environment Satellite and the Next Generation Refueling Aircraft. Additionally, they cut the Chemical Biological Defense Engineering and Manufacturing program but increased funds for the Air Force Weather Satellite Follow-on program and other initiatives. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Congress approved $72.431 for Title IV RDT&E, providing full funding for various defense programs including the Army's Patriot/MEADS and the Missile Defense Agency's Prompt Strike Capability. The Senate did not agree with the House cuts and made reductions to programs such as Logistics and Engineering Equipment, Prompt Strike, Precision Tracking Space System, and Chemical Biological Defense Engineering and Manufacturing. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Congress approved reduced funding for various defense programs, including the termination of the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environment Satellite program and a reduction in the Manned Ground Vehicle program by $435 million. The Rocket Launch System and Next Generation Refueling Aircraft were fully funded. Congress also cut DARPA's RDT&E request by $166 million but approved increases for programs such as U.S.-Israeli Cooperative R&D, Next Generation Bomber, Rapid Innovation Program, and Weather Satellite. The Administration requested additional RDT&E funding for the Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and National Defense Sealift Fund for FY2012. The Administration requested funding for various defense programs, including RDT&E for the Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and National Defense Sealift Fund. The House and Senate approved different amounts for these programs in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The House appropriated $437 million for OCO-related RDT&E, supporting much of the Administration's request. They provided $10 million less for the Air Force's Unmanned Endurance UAV program but allocated $50 million for the Air Force's Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Innovation program. The Senate recommended $582 million for OCO-related RDT&E, with a $105 million increase due to transferring Navy's MQ-4 UAV Title IV funding. Congress allocated $526 million for OCO-related RDT&E in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, including transfers and increases for specific programs. The Air Force received a $50 million increase for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance innovations. RDT&E funding is allocated to military departments and DOD agencies for various research activities. Budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 focus on basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, while activities 6.4 and 6.5 support the development of specific weapon systems. The FY2012 Title IV baseline S&T funding request was $12.246 billion, supporting the development of new technologies and science for specific weapon systems. Congressional policymakers emphasize the importance of S&T funding for maintaining U.S. military superiority and advancing commercial technologies. In FY2012, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $12.438 billion for Science and Technology (S&T) funding, with basic research receiving special attention, especially from universities. DOD's basic research budget is smaller compared to NIH or NSF, but over half is allocated to universities, making a significant contribution to certain areas of science. In FY2012, the Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $2.116 billion for basic research, with increases for university research and specific programs like Army and Navy research centers. In FY2012, Congress allocated $20 million for Navy competitive university research, $8 million for Navy nanotechnology research, and $12 million for Air Force cybersecurity research. The Department of Homeland Security requested $1.528 billion for R&D programs, including $1.176 billion for the Directorate of Science and Technology, $332 million for the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and $20 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The House bill proposed $889 million, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.076 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $984 million for R&D programs in FY2012, with $668 million for S&T, $289 million for DNDO, and $28 million for Coast Guard RDT&E. The S&T Directorate, headed by the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, received $1.176 billion in the Administration's request, including funding for Laboratory Facilities and Research, Development, and Innovation, with a focus on radiological and nuclear R&D. The House bill provided $539 million for S&T, with $106 million allocated for Research, Development, and Innovation. It also allocated $75 million for Laboratory Facilities, half of the requested amount for NBAF construction. The bill rejected the proposed transfer of radiological and nuclear R&D activities from DNDO. The Senate-reported bill provided $780 million for S&T, with $440 million for Research, Development, and Innovation. It approved the transfer of activities from DNDO. The committee emphasized the need for S&T to make focused, high-return investment decisions. The final appropriation for S&T was $668 million, including $266 million for Research, Development, and Innovation and $50 million for NBAF construction. The proposed transfer from DNDO was denied, leading to a reorganization within the S&T Directorate in late 2010. This reorganization aimed to streamline operations and create more robust partnerships. The new strategy for S&T includes more robust partnerships, fewer but larger projects, and a focus on technology transition. The House and Senate committees criticized the new budget structure for lack of transparency and accountability. The construction of NBAF may lead to increased congressional oversight. The FY2012 budget projected $691 million for NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning. Congress authorized DHS to use Plum Island sale receipts for costs, but the value was overestimated. DNDO requested $332 million for FY2012 for nuclear detection efforts. The Administration requested $332 million for DNDO for FY2012, the same as the FY2011 appropriation. The request included no funds for Transformational R&D, proposed to transfer to the S&T Directorate. Systems Acquisition saw an increase to $84 million, with $37 million for radiation portal monitors and $27 million for the Securing the Cities program. The House bill provided $337 million for DNDO, rejecting the transfer of Transformational R&D to the S&T Directorate. The FY2012 budget for DNDO was $289 million, with $40 million allocated for Transformational R&D. The radiation portal monitors program received $7 million, and $22 million was designated for Securing the Cities, including $2 million for a new city. In recent years, DNDO has focused on testing and analyzing Advanced Spectroscopic Portals (ASPs) for procurement and deployment. DHS decided in February 2010 to no longer use ASPs for primary screening but will continue testing them for secondary screening. Despite the FY2012 request for 44 ASPs, DNDO will only deploy 13 ASPs and end the program as originally planned. The House committee report expects DNDO not to deploy ASPs without certification, while the Senate denies the request to procure and deploy 44 ASPs. The conference report cancels the requirement for ASP certification and directs DHS to notify appropriations committees of any successor program. The global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO remains a congressional interest, with programs in development and assessment across various mission areas. The Department of Homeland Security's strategic plan for investments under the global nuclear detection architecture was identified in the enacted bill. The DNDO's mission includes developing a domestic system for nuclear and radiological detection. Congress may need to review the proposed transfer of DNDO's research activities to the S&T Directorate. The DNDO's funding for Systems Acquisition was reduced in FY2010, leading to end users seeking funding for radiation detection equipment. However, the FY2012 request included funding for ASPs and human-portable radiation detectors for various agencies. The reasons for this policy change were not provided in budget justifications for FY2011 and FY2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided NIH with $30.8 billion in total discretionary funding. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided NIH with $30.8 billion in total discretionary funding, which was virtually unchanged from the FY2011 level. The Obama Administration had requested $31.8 billion for NIH, an increase of $1.062 billion (3.3%) over FY2011. Congressional bills recommended slightly different funding amounts, with the Senate proposing $30.6 billion and the House proposing $31.8 billion. The NIH consists of multiple institutes and centers (ICs) that focus on specific diseases and research areas. Congress provides separate appropriations to 24 of the 27 ICs, the Office of the Director, and a Buildings and Facilities account. Funding for NIH primarily comes from the annual appropriations bill for Labor/HHS, with additional funding for Superfund-related activities from the Interior/Environment appropriations bill. NIH receives discretionary budget authority from Labor/HHS appropriations bills. Additional funding comes from the Interior/Environment appropriations bill for specific programs like diabetes research and the National Library of Medicine. Congress has also allocated funds for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria from NIH's budget in recent years. The total funding available for NIH activities, including transfers, is known as the program level. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside redistributes funds among PHS and other HHS agencies for assessing federal health programs and improving them. The set-aside was capped at 2.5% in FY2010 and proposed to increase to 3.2% in FY2012. NIH, with the largest budget among PHS agencies, is affected by this budget tap. In FY2012, the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside increased to 3.2%. NIH, with the largest budget among PHS agencies, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds. The FY2012 President's Budget Request focused on implementing a new translational medicine program and emphasized advanced technologies, comparative effectiveness research, and support for young investigators. NIH proposed creating the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics by abolishing the existing National Center for Research Resources (NCRR). The FY2012 budget proposed transferring programs from NIH to NCATS, including the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program. NCATS was also planned to incorporate the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) to support the development of high need cures. The ACA authorized $500 million for FY2010 and subsequent fiscal years for the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) to support high need cures. NIH proposed $100 million for CAN in FY2012 to accelerate the development of these cures. NIH also emphasized technologies to accelerate discovery in its plans for FY2012. The NIH aims to increase understanding of complex diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, develop more effective therapies, and enhance the evidence base for health care decisions through comparative effectiveness research. They also support young scientists through programs like the NIH Director's New Innovator Award and the NIH Director's Early Independence Program. In FY2012, NIH requested $8.4 million for the Early Independence Program, allowing researchers to skip postdoctoral training and start independent research. Over 80% of NIH funds support research through grants, contracts, and awards, with $16.9 billion allocated for competitive research project grants, representing 53% of the proposed budget. This would fund 36,852 RPG awards, including 9,158 competing RPGs. In FY2012, NIH requested an increase in funding for research training stipends and other funding mechanisms. This included a $13 million increase for the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards program, allowing for 16,831 full-time training positions. Additionally, support for research centers would increase by $42 million to $3.036 billion, and R&D contracts would see a $151 million increase to $3.245 billion. In FY2012, the NIH requested a $151 million increase in funding for R&D contracts, bringing the total to $3.245 billion. The NIH intramural research program would gain $94 million for a total of $3.382 billion. The Office of the Director would see a large increase of $118 million for a total of $742 million, with an additional $76 million for Buildings and Facilities. The NIH Common Fund, supporting research in emerging areas, would receive $557 million, up $14 million from the previous year. In FY2012, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $30.5 billion for NIH, a decrease of $190 million from the previous year. The committee also proposed $80 million for NIH in the Interior/Environment appropriations bill. The committee approved the creation of NCATS but provided lower funding than requested. The NCATS appropriation included $20 million for the Cures Acceleration Network. The NIH funding for FY2012 was a topic of discussion among committees. The House Appropriations Committee introduced a bill providing $31.7 billion for NIH, an increase of $1,160 million (3.8%) over FY2011. The bill did not include the creation of NCATS or the elimination of NCRR. Additionally, $79 million was allocated for NIH in the Interior/Environment appropriations bill. The NIH funding for FY2012 was a topic of discussion among committees. The final conference agreement enacted in P.L. 112-74 gave NIH $30.769 billion in discretionary budget authority, with specific allocations for various programs and activities. In FY2012, NIH received $30.769 billion in discretionary budget authority, $299 million more than in FY2011. The appropriations did not require NIH to transfer funds to the Global HIV/AIDS Fund. Congress approved NIH's plan to create NCATS, abolish NCRR, and distribute programs accordingly. Funding for the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside was maintained at 2.5%. In FY2012, NIH received a $299 million increase in funding. The funds were allocated to various areas, including boosting the Buildings and Facilities account, specific increases for CAN and IDeA, and proportionally distributed among all institutes, centers, and the Office of the Director. Detailed instructions were given on the implementation of NCATS in the explanatory statement accompanying the conference report. The conferees provided detailed instructions for the implementation of NCATS, emphasizing its role in re-engineering therapeutics development. They directed NCATS to facilitate partnerships between researchers, industry, and government to accelerate the commercialization of new therapies. Funding for two NCATS programs was specified in the bill: $488 million for the CTSA program and up to $10 million for the Cures Acceleration Network. NIH was instructed to further study the use of CAN authority and evaluate other related activities. Concerns were raised about the informal reorganization of NCATS/NCRR and the lack of involvement of the Scientific Management Review Board. The conferees criticized NIH for not involving the Scientific Management Review Board in evaluating proposals, emphasizing the need to learn from the creation of NCATS for future reorganizations. They also stressed the importance of supporting the extramural research community and increasing funding for new research projects. Additionally, the Institutional Development Awards program received a $50 million increase, and NIH was urged to broaden eligibility criteria for research grants. Finally, NIH was directed to conduct a trans-NIH review of processes. The Administration requested $14.447 billion for Department of Energy (DOE) R&D in FY2012, a 24.4% increase from the previous year. The final appropriation was $11.904 billion, with $5.416 billion allocated to the DOE Office of Science, aiming to double its funding as part of a plan initiated in 2006. The Office of Science, part of the Department of Energy, received $4.889 billion in FY2012, with funding authorized by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The budget included allocations for six major research programs, including new energy innovation hubs for materials and fuels. In FY2012, the DOE Office of Science received $4.889 billion, with funding authorized by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. The budget included allocations for six major research programs, with significant increases in funding for foundational genomics research, high energy physics, and fusion energy sciences. Operations at the Tevatron facility in Illinois ended during FY2011, and the U.S. contribution to ITER was proposed to be reduced to $105 million. Despite schedule delays for ITER, DOE budget documents stated that costs were manageable within the project's total cost range. The House, Senate, and final bills in Japan may cause delays. They all provided less funding than requested for basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research, and nuclear physics. $20 million was allocated for a new energy innovation hub, and the requested amount for an existing hub. The final appropriation for ITER was not more than the requested amount. The request for DOE national security R&D saw a 12.3% increase from the previous year. The House bill allocated $3.725 billion for national security R&D, with less funding for naval reactors and weapons certification than requested. The Senate bill provided even less for naval reactors and directed DOE not to fund a specific experiment for advanced weapons certification. The final appropriation for naval reactors was between the House and Senate amounts. For contractor pension liabilities, the final bill included a total of $224 million, the same as the request. The request for DOE energy R&D was $4.856 billion, up 59.2% from FY2011. Most energy efficiency and renewable energy subprograms were to increase by between 50% and 200%, with the exception of R&D on hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, which were to increase by just 2.5%. The request included no funds for natural gas technologies or unconventional fossil energy technologies. The request for nuclear energy was a 4% increase from FY2011. The request proposed to increase the funding of ARPA-E more than threefold, to $650 million. The final bill included $650 million for ARPA-E, $2.731 billion for DOE energy R&D in the House bill, and $2.755 billion in the Senate bill. The final bill provided more funding for ARPA-E and energy efficiency and renewables compared to the House and Senate bills, but still less than the initial request. The final appropriation for ARPA-E, energy efficiency, renewables, and nuclear energy was between the House and Senate bills. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering, established as an independent federal agency in 1950. The NSF is a primary source of federal support for U.S. university research, especially in mathematics and computer science, and federal STEM education programs. The President's FY2012 budget request for the NSF was $7.767 billion. The President's FY2012 budget request for the NSF was $7.767 billion, with a $961.1 million increase over the FY2011 level. The distribution of the requested increase was consistent with existing funding allocations. P.L. 112-55 provided $7.033 billion to the NSF in FY2012, which was $227.2 million more than FY2011 but $733.9 million less than the President's request. In FY2012, P.L. 112-55 shifted 1.0% of NSF's budget to research and construction activities from education and agency operations. The congressional debate focused on the \"doubling path\" policy to increase support for research in physical sciences and engineering. The current status of the doubling path is discussed in detail in this report. The report discusses the current status of the doubling path in the \"Presidential Initiatives\" section, focusing on funding challenges and grant management issues at the NSF. Inspector General Allison C. Lerner highlighted staffing constraints affecting grant compliance, attributing the problem to budget growth. Research and Related Activities (RRA) is the largest account at the NSF, serving as the primary source of R&D grants and funding. The Research and Related Activities (RRA) account at the NSF is the largest source of R&D grants and funding. The Administration requested $6.254 billion for RRA in FY2012, with a focus on research in cyber-infrastructure, clean energy, nanotechnology, robotics, and sustainability. P.L. 112-55 provides $5.719 billion for RRA in FY2012, allowing transfers to the Foundation's construction account and reimbursement for U.S. Antarctic program support. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the RRA account by $91.5 million (1.7%) over the FY2011 level, while the Senate initially proposed a reduction. The conference report on H.R. 2112 endorsed Administration-proposed reductions to RRA programs in FY2012, except for the Radio Astronomy program. It also supported planned NSF activities in advanced manufacturing. The NSF received $165.6 million for cybersecurity research and $150.9 million for the EPSCoR program in FY2012. The EPSCoR program aims to enhance research competitiveness in states with low federal funding rates. The NSF was encouraged to sustain investments in neuroscience, offer innovation prizes, balance access to scientific data, and support astronomy activities and scientific facilities. The NSF's FY2012 budget includes plans to independently evaluate the EPSCoR program, which aims to enhance research competitiveness in states with historically low federal funding rates. Other accounts supporting R&D at the National Science Foundation include MREFC and EHR. The MREFC budget request for FY2012 saw a significant increase, funding projects like NEON and OOI. No new MREFC funds were requested for the Alaska Region Research Vessel or IceCube Neutrino Observatory in FY2012. The MREFC account received $167.1 million in FY2012, $50.0 million more than FY2011 and $57.6 million less than the Administration's budget request. The NSF may transfer up to $50.0 million from RRA to MREFC. The conference report prioritizes near completion projects and raises concerns about construction funding management. Funding is allocated for ongoing projects like Atacama Large Millimeter Array and OOI, with the option to fully fund OOI or start NEON using transferred funds. The President requested $911.2 million. The President requested $911.2 million for EHR in FY2012, a $50.2 million increase over the FY2011 level. The FY2012 request aimed to shift the EHR portfolio towards graduate support. The Administration proposed program changes in EHR, including reorganization and elimination of programs. P.L. 112-55 provided $829.0 million for EHR in FY2012, $32.0 million less than FY2011. The conference report on H.R. 2112 endorses the Administration's proposed terminations and reductions in EHR, except for proposed reductions to the Math and Science Partnership and Robert Noyce Scholarship programs. It also adopts FY2011 funding levels for NSF's Broadening Participation at the Core programs and provides $20.0 million more than the requested level of funding for the Federal Cyber Service: Scholarships for Service program. Both H.Rept. 112-169 and S.Rept. 112-78 urge the NSF to ensure that GRF applicants are not rejected for reasons unrelated to the merits of their proposed research. The Administration requested a $58.3 million increase for the NSF's Agency Operations and Award Management account in FY2012. The funding also included a new NSF headquarters and increases for the Office of the Inspector General and the National Science Board. P.L. 112-55 provided $299.4 million for the AOAM account, $14.2 million for the OIG, and $4.4 million for the NSB, with a focus on enhancing accountability. The Administration's FY2012 budget request proposed funding for NSF-wide investments in NITRD, NNI, and SEES portfolios. The request included $1.258 billion for NITRD, $456.0 million for NNI, and $998.2 million for SEES. Congressional funding bills for FY2012 did not specify funding for these accounts. Additionally, the Administration proposed eliminating six NSF programs. The Administration's FY2012 request proposed eliminating six NSF programs to redirect funds to other Foundation accounts. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) aims to increase U.S. companies' competitiveness through industrial development and technological advances diffusion. NIST research supports U.S. commerce, technological progress, and product reliability. The final FY2012 appropriation for NIST totals $750.8 million, 25.0% below the Administration's request. Support for research and development increases 14.0% to $567.0 million. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program receives $128.4 million, the same as FY2011. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program receives $128.4 million in FY2012, which is 10.0% less than the budget request. No funding is provided for the Technology Innovation Program (TIP), the Baldrige National Quality Program, or the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia (AMTech). The construction budget is $55.4 million, 20.7% less than FY2011. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $1.001 billion in funding for NIST, a 33.4% increase over the FY2011 appropriation. In FY2012, the MEP program would have received $142.6 million, an 11.1% increase from FY2011, while TIP funding would have increased to $75.0 million, a 67.4% rise. Baldrige program support would have decreased to $7.7 million, and a new program, AMTech, would have been funded at $12.3 million. Construction budget would have increased by 21.0% to $84.6 million. H.R. 2596 would have provided $700.8 million for NIST, 6.6% below FY2011, and 30.0% below the President's request. Funding for STRS would have increased by 3.9% to $517.0 million, while MEP funding would have remained the same as FY2011 at $128.4 million. Construction funding would have decreased by 20.7% to $55.4 million. Construction funding for NIST in FY2012 saw a 20.7% decrease from FY2011 and was 34.5% below the budget proposal. The consolidated appropriations bill would have funded NIST at $680.0 million, 2.9% below the previous amount, and 32.1% below the Administration's request. Funding for the STRS account totaled $500.0 million, 3.2% below the previous figure, and 26.4% less than the budget request. Under the ITS account, $120.0 million would be provided for the MEP program, 6.5% less than recommended and 15.8% less than the Administration's budget figure. No funding was provided for TIP. Funding for NIST's extramural programs, including the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Technology Innovation Program, has been a source of contention. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed establishing an additional extramural program, AMTech, which some Members of Congress have questioned. This approach of providing federal funds to industry for developing \"pre-competitive generic\" technologies has faced skepticism, leading to significant reductions in appropriations. The federal budget pressures have led to cuts in NIST activities like the ATP and MEP. ATP was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program in 2007. Funding for TIP and AMTech was not provided in the FY2012 appropriations. Increases in spending for NIST laboratories have been minimal. The Administration aimed to double funding for innovation research at NIST over 10 years as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. In April 2009, President Obama aimed to double the budget of key science agencies, including NIST, over 10 years. However, the timeframe for doubling slipped to 11 years in his FY2011 budget. While the FY2012 appropriations did not increase support for NIST, there was a substantial 14.0% increase in funding for R&D under the STRS account. NOAA conducts scientific research in various areas and was created in 1970 by Reorganization Plan No. 4. The reorganization aimed to unify environmental activities and monitor the environment. NOAA's R&D focuses on climate, weather, air quality, and ocean resources. FY2012 funding was $580.6 million, 7.7% less than FY2011. R&D accounted for 11.9% of NOAA's total budget. Funding included $406 million for research, $37 million for development, and $137 million for equipment. Administrative structure evolved into five line offices. NOAA's administrative structure has evolved into five line offices reflecting its diverse mission. The President's FY2012 request aimed to establish a Climate Service line office, but it was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012. OAR is the primary center for R&D within NOAA, with a proposed funding of $175.1 million. The President's FY2012 request proposed funding OAR R&D at $175.1 million, a significant reduction from the FY2011 level. However, the final budget did not include a Climate Service line office, and OAR retained its R&D funding. In 2012, OAR R&D activities and equipment were funded at $348.1 million, with $281.9 million for research and development and $66.2 million for equipment. The NOAA Research Council developed the NOAA 5-Year Research Plan for 2008-2012, identifying six key research challenges. The NOAA 5-Year Research Plan for 2008-2012 identified six key research challenges focused on ecosystem processes, biodiversity, climate variability, observing systems, severe weather warning times, and uncertainties in analysis and predictions. The Administration requested $16.637 billion for NASA R&D in FY2012, with the final appropriation being $15.850 billion. The increase in funding was possible due to the retirement of the space shuttles, which were classified as operational expenses. The last shuttle flight was completed in July 2011. In FY2012, NASA's Science budget saw a 2.0% increase from the previous year. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) project faced delays and cost overruns, with a revised total cost of $8.835 billion and a projected launch date in 2018. The House committee recommended $4.499 billion for Science, while the Senate committee recommended $5.100 billion, with a cap on JWST development costs at $8 billion. The final appropriation for Science was $5.090 billion. The final appropriation for JWST was $5.090 billion, with a cap on development costs at $8 billion. The Government Accountability Office was directed to assess the program continuously. Aeronautics received $569 million, with increases for specific research topics. Funding for hypersonics was reduced, focusing on foundational research. The House committee supported NASA's proposed shifts in emphasis, while the Senate committee recommended $501 million. The final appropriation for Aeronautics was $570 million. The Senate committee recommended $501 million for Space Technology, but the final appropriation was $570 million. The Administration requested $1.024 billion, with half allocated to Crosscutting Space Technology Development (CSTD). The House committee recommended $375 million for Space Technology, expressing concerns about NASA's proposal to significantly increase the program's size over two fiscal years.

In FY2012, transportation services for space shuttles will be obtained under contract with international partners and commercial providers. The final appropriation for the ISS was $2.830 billion. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's research and education activities are funded through four organizations. The Administration's FY2012 request included $2.594 billion for these activities. The final appropriations for FY2012 provided $2.533 billion for these activities. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) received $1.095 billion in FY2012, slightly below the FY2011 enacted level. ARS focuses on food and fiber production, new product development, biocontrols for pest management, and support for USDA programs. In FY2012, the ARS received $1.095 billion, $38.6 million below FY2011, and $43.1 million below the request. The conference report supports closing 12 research labs at 10 locations and redirects funding from discontinued projects to research priorities like biobased products, biofuels, crop production, and disease control. The FY2012 appropriation includes support for research on new varieties of feedstocks, healthier foods, and non-traditional agents. Funding is also allocated for research at Regional Biofuels Feedstocks Research Centers and for developing sustainable management systems to improve food production. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) was established in the 2008 farm bill to support larger and longer-term research efforts related to agriculture viability. NIFA is responsible for fostering partnerships between federal and state agricultural research components. NIFA distributes funds to various agricultural research institutions, including 1862 land-grant institutions, 1890 historically black colleges and universities, 1994 tribal land-grant colleges, and Hispanic-serving institutions. Funding is provided through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants. The FY2012 appropriation for NIFA is $1.202 billion, slightly lower than the previous year. Conferees disagreed with the Administration's proposal to terminate extramural research.

The FY2012 appropriations for the Department of the Interior included $846.8 million for research and development, exceeding the President's request. DOI provided detailed information on R&D funding levels for each agency and program areas in January 2012, but noted changes in USGS disciplines and R&D baselines. Funding levels, differences, and percentage changes provided are internally consistent but may differ from previously published data. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has the largest R&D budget among DOI agencies, with approximately 80% of total DOI R&D funding in FY2012. USGS received $1.068 billion for FY2012, which was $14 million above the House Committee on Appropriations' draft. All USGS funding is provided through the Surveys, Investigations, and Research (SIR) account. USGS R&D is conducted under seven activity/program areas funded by $675.5 million in FY2012. Funding for four areas was cut, while three areas saw an increase in funding compared to FY2011. In FY2012, USGS R&D funding increased in several areas: Water Resources by $12.2 million (11.0%), Core Science Systems by $29.7 million (58.8%), National Geospatial Program by $34.7 million, and Ecosystems by $0.4 million (0.3%). The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement received the second largest increase at $63.3 million. Other agencies like the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service also received funding increases in FY2012. The Fish and Wildlife Service received $48.5 million for R&D in FY2012, $1.5 million more than in FY2011 but $1.5 million less than the request. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funds research activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control laws. EPA's scientific research is mainly funded through the Science and Technology (S&T) appropriations account, with a transfer from the Hazardous Substance Superfund for research on cleaning up contaminated sites. Prior to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, EPA and other agencies were operating under continuing resolutions for FY2012 funding. The EPA S&T account received $818.0 million for FY2012, which was $22.3 million below FY2011. This funding represented 9.7% of the total $8.46 billion for the agency in FY2012. The FY2012 enacted appropriations for the EPA were more than recommended in the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies FY2012 Appropriations bill, but less than the amounts recommended in a draft released by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. Funding priorities and regulatory actions, including EPA scientific research and Clean Air Act controls on emissions, were central to the debate on FY2012 appropriations. Controls on emissions of greenhouse gases and efforts to address pollutants from various industries were key topics of debate during oversight of EPA's funding levels. Congressional concerns were raised during hearings and markup of EPA's FY2012 appropriations, with authorizing committees addressing regulatory actions through legislation. P.L. 112-74 included provisions on Clean Air Act regulatory actions and greenhouse gas restrictions. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations law (P.L. 112-74) included provisions on Clean Air Act regulatory actions, greenhouse gas emission reporting, Clean Water Act permitting for silvicultural activities, and addressed EPA actions. The conference report (H.Rept. 112-331) contained extensive language on specific EPA actions in place of certain proposed provisions. The FY2012 Consolidated Appropriations law (P.L. 112-74) included provisions on Clean Air Act regulatory actions, greenhouse gas emission reporting, and Clean Water Act permitting for silvicultural activities. The conference report (H.Rept. 112-331) contained detailed language regarding specific EPA actions, including modifications to EPA's policies for conducting assessments under the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) and reorganization of budget presentation for certain program activities. Newly revised program areas within the S&T account include Clean Air and Climate, Research: Air, Climate and Energy, Research: Chemical Safety and Sustainability, and Research: Sustainability and Healthy Communities. The FY2012 enacted amounts showed variability compared to proposals and FY2011 enacted amounts. There was a decrease in enacted levels due to a 0.16% across-the-board rescission. A $23.0 million transfer from the Superfund account in FY2012 was $3.8 million less than in FY2011. Activities funded in the S&T account include research by non-federal entities receiving EPA grants and research conducted by the agency at its own facilities. The EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) manages R&D activities at EPA headquarters and laboratories, as well as external R&D. The S&T account funds EPA's R&D activities, research grants, and applied science and technology activities. It incorporates elements of former accounts like EPA Research and Development, Salaries and Expenses, and Program Operations. Comparisons before and after FY1996 are challenging due to differences in the scope of activities included in these accounts. The Office of Management and Budget reports historical and projected budget authority amounts for R&D at EPA, but it is challenging to compare before and after FY1996. Some Members of Congress and stakeholders have raised concerns about the adequacy of funding for scientific research at EPA. Some policymakers, scientists, and environmental organizations are concerned about the decrease in federal funding for scientific research. There are debates about the use of \"sound science\" in federal agency regulations and how scientific research informs federal policy. EPA's scientific justifications for rules have been questioned due to data quality, lack of transparency, and peer review issues. The FY2012 appropriations under P.L. 112-55 are final. The Department of Transportation received $944 million for research and development under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, which was $271 million less than the President's request. The Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration accounted for most of the department's R&D funding. The final FY2012 funding for FAA R&D was $367 million, $50 million less than the President's request. The request for $190 million for Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) in FY2012 was mostly unchanged from the previous year. $77 million was allocated for the NextGen R&D portfolio, focusing on alternative fuels for general aviation to reduce environmental impact. Additionally, $35.8 million was requested for the Environmental and Energy program, including NextGen research. Final FY2012 funding for FHWA R&D was $411 million, $137 million less than the President's request. The FY2012 request for FHWA R&D funding was $548 million, a $95 million increase over FY2010. Highway Research and Development funding would have increased. In FY2012, funding for Highway Research and Development would have increased to $200.0 million, up $33.7 million (20.3%) from FY2010. Intelligent Transportation Systems R&D funding would have increased to $96.1 million, up $14.8 million (18.1%) from FY2010. The ITS Multi-modal Research Program and Competitive University Transportation Center Consortia would each have received $20 million in FY2012. State Planning and Research program R&D funding would have grown to $206.4 million in FY2012, up $23.4 million (12.8%) over FY2010."
