    "content": "The new task of Personality-Captions aims to create engaging captions by incorporating controllable style and personality traits. A large dataset of 201,858 captions conditioned over 215 traits was collected and released. Models combining sentence representations with Transformers trained on dialogue examples and image representations with ResNets trained on social media images achieved state-of-the-art performance on COCO and Flickr30k datasets. Online evaluations confirmed the engaging nature of the captions. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of machines being able to capture human interest by displaying emotion and personality in communication. It highlights the focus on function in machine learning studies, such as image captioning and visual question answering, and emphasizes the need for engaging communication grounded in images. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of standard image captioning tasks in conveying engaging and effective captions. It contrasts the factual descriptions typically generated by machines with the engaging captions preferred by humans. The curr_chunk introduces the concept of incorporating personality into image captions to make them more engaging for human readers. It highlights the creation of a new dataset, PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS, with 201,858 captions, each conditioned on one of 215 personality traits. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of incorporating various personality traits into image captions to make them more engaging for humans. It introduces a new dataset, PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS, with 215 different personality traits, showing that these captions are more engaging than traditional ones. The model architecture developed can understand image content and provide engaging captions simultaneously. The curr_chunk discusses building strong models for image captioning by leveraging state-of-the-art modules from vision and language domains. They use a ResNeXt architecture for image representations and a Transformer sentence representation for text. Their generative model achieves a new state-of-the-art on caption generation, while their retrieval architecture, TransResNet, achieves the highest hits@1 score on the Flickr30k dataset. They adapt these architectures to the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS task by conditioning the input image on personality traits, resulting in strong performance. In experiments on COCO BID5 and Flickr30k BID52 datasets, models were compared, including generative and retrieval-based ones. The focus was on understanding image content rather than natural human communication. Personalized captions for readers based on user features were not addressed in this work. Our work focuses on a general set of personality traits in caption generation, not on humor or style modeling like other research directions. Our models are trained on the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS dataset with 215 traits and \u223c200,000 images, providing a larger and more diverse dataset compared to previous works. Our work, trained on the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS dataset with 215 traits and \u223c200,000 images, focuses on human communication in image grounded conversations. Human evaluations are conducted to measure engagingness, and we utilize the latest advancements in image and text encoders for improved image captioning performance. The PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS dataset contains (image, personality trait, caption) triples with 215 traits categorized into positive, neutral, and negative classes. Examples of traits not used include allocentric, insouciant, flexible, earthy, and invisible. The study used a randomly selected set of images from the YFFC100M Dataset to create training, validation, and test sets. Annotators were asked to write engaging captions for the images based on a randomly assigned personality trait. The personality trait described the author of the caption, not the content of the image. The models used were trained on 3.5 billion Instagram pictures following a specific procedure. The authors provided the weights of their trained model, ResNeXt-IG-3.5B, which embeds images in a 2048-dimensional vector. They re-implemented state-of-the-art methods for image captioning and extracted image features with dimensions of 7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 2048. Personality traits were also incorporated by learning an embedding for each trait. The SHOWTELL model uses personality traits as embeddings concatenated with decoder inputs. Image features are reduced to a 512-dimensional vector and fed into a LSTM model. The SHOWATTTELL model incorporates attention-derived image features into the LSTM cell node. The UPDOWN model is used as described in previous work. A two-stage training strategy is employed, optimizing cross-entropy loss first and then using policy gradient with REINFORCE to optimize the non-differentiable reward function. During inference, beam search is applied. During inference, beam search (beam size=2) is used to decode captions. A retrieval architecture called TransResNet is defined to project image, personality, and caption into the same space using respective encoders. Image and personality representations are combined after encoding, while captions are encoded using a Transformer architecture. The text discusses the use of Transformer architecture in two sizes for training models, either from scratch or pretraining. Pretraining involves initializing word vectors or the entire encoder using a next-utterance retrieval task on a dataset of dialogs. The system is then initialized with the weights of the candidate encoder for training on the task. The text discusses training models using Transformer architecture, either from scratch or pretraining. Pretraining involves initializing word vectors or the entire encoder using a next-utterance retrieval task on a dataset of dialogs. The system is then initialized with the weights of the candidate encoder for training on the task. The candidate encoder is trained on the task, and a simple bag-of-words encoder is also considered for comparison. The architecture TransResNet is used for retrieval models, where the final combination score is computed based on input image, personality trait, and candidate caption. Training involves passing a set of scores through a softmax and maximizing the log-likelihood of correct responses. The overall TransResNet architecture is tested on traditional caption datasets and PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS to evaluate factual description and engaging caption generation. Generative models like SHOWTELL, SHOWATTTELL, and UPDOWN are assessed along with image encoders ResNet152 and ResNeXt-IG-3.5B on the COCO caption dataset. Performance metrics like BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and SPICE are compared to state-of-the-art models, showing consistent results with ResNeXt-IG-3.5B features. Our best model (UPDOWN) using ResNeXt-IG-3.5B features outperforms state-of-the-art models in BID1 Retrieval Models. The TransResNet retrieval architecture shows significant improvements with ResNeXt-IG-3.5B and Transformer-based text encoding compared to ResNet152 and bag-of-words approaches. Our best models, utilizing Transformer-based text encoding, outperform state-of-the-art models in caption generation. Pretraining the text encoder significantly improves performance, with our model achieving a CIDEr score of 22.0 by incorporating personality traits. The importance of modeling personality in this task is highlighted by the results. The study focuses on modeling personality in a new task called PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS, which aims to capture how humans respond to images in a more diverse way compared to standard image captioning tasks. Human evaluation is conducted in addition to automatic evaluations. The effectiveness of different configurations of the retrieval model, TransResNet, is also compared in terms of R@1 scores on the test set of PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS. The impact of using the image encoder trained on billions of images is considerable in the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS task. The best model achieved 53.5% with conditioning on personality traits, outperforming other variants. Transformer text encoders also outperformed bag-of-word embeddings encoders in retrieval model performance. Pretraining for Transformers showed better results when pretraining the whole network rather than just word embeddings. Example predictions of the best model, TransResNet (ResNeXt-IG-3.5B), are provided in the study. Using 500 random images from the YFCC-100M dataset, captions were obtained through various methods for human evaluation. Annotators compared captions pairwise, choosing the \"more engaging\" one. Results showed that captions conditioned on personality traits were preferred over traditional neutral captions. The study compared captions conditioned on personality traits to traditional neutral captions, finding the former to be significantly more engaging. The best-performing models were compared to human-authored personality-conditioned captions, showing the importance of image features in enhancing engagement. TransResNet with ResNext-IG-3.5B image features outperforms the UPDOWN model, achieving a winrate of 80.1%. The study focuses on creating models that understand image content and provide engaging captions for humans, utilizing the latest advances in image and sentence encoding. The models achieve state-of-the-art results on COCO for caption generation and introduce a new retrieval architecture, TransResNet, with the highest hits@1 score on the Flickr30k dataset. Additionally, the models are conditioned on controllable personality traits using the PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS dataset to enhance engagement. Our best system can produce captions close to human performance in engagement, with the possibility of superhuman performance in the future. Detailed results for caption retrieval performance on COCO Captions using different pretraining methods are shown in Table 7. Table 8 shows the retrieval model performance on Flickr30k using different pretraining methods. The models compared include UVS, Embedding Net, sm-LSTM, 2WayNet, VSE++, DAN, and GXN. The results indicate the effectiveness of pretraining with text encoders or word embeddings. The study compared human preferences for captions with and without personality cues. Overall, unconditioned captions were slightly favored. However, when positive personalities were included, annotators preferred captions with personality cues. In contrast, for negative or neutral personalities, unconditioned captions were preferred. The study compared human preferences for captions with and without personality cues. Unconditioned captions were slightly favored overall. However, when positive personalities were included, annotators preferred captions with personality cues. Diversity in captions was observed, with more engaging and diverse personality traits in captions generated through their method. A model was constructed to predict personality traits in comments, showing more diversity in personality types in engaging captions compared to traditional image captions. The study compared human preferences for captions with and without personality cues. Unconditioned captions were slightly favored overall, but when positive personalities were included, annotators preferred captions with personality cues. The classifier assigned personalities to human-generated captions, showing more diversity in engaging and diverse personality traits compared to traditional image captions. The ultimate test of generative and retrieval models on PERSONALITY-CAPTIONS was performed using human evaluations. Comparing them using automatic metrics is challenging due to the different optimization of retrieval methods and generative models. The comparison of generative and retrieval models on COCO caption using automatic metrics like BLEU, CIDEr, SPICE, and ROUGE-L scores is presented. Additionally, human judgments on captions with personality cues are discussed, showing a preference for positive personalities. The curr_chunk talks about the beauty of flowers and the desire to grow them, specifically mentioning pink and purple flowers. It also hints at giving them as a gift."
