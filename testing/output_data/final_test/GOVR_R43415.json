    "content": "In 2008 and 2012, TransCanada applied for a Presidential Permit to build the Keystone XL Pipeline, transporting crude oil from Canadian oil sands and the Bakken region to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The State Department evaluates such projects based on national interest factors, including energy security. The State Department evaluated the Keystone XL Pipeline project based on energy security, foreign policy, and environmental impacts. An environmental impact statement was prepared, identifying direct and indirect impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions. President Obama took action on the project in June 2013. The Obama Administration rejected TransCanada's application for a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline in November 2015, citing concerns about its impact on climate change and carbon pollution. The Obama Administration rejected TransCanada's application for a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline in 2015, citing concerns about its impact on climate change. In 2017, the Trump Administration signed executive actions to revisit the application, and the State Department issued a Presidential Permit for the project, stating it would serve the national interest. The 2017 Determination for the Presidential Permit regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline is based on the 2014 FEIS and new communications with the Canadian pipeline company. It acknowledges the environmental impacts and dynamic nature of topics like GHG emissions and market analysis. The 2017 Determination also addresses concerns about climate change by noting global actions taken since the 2015 rejection of the project. The 2017 Determination for the Presidential Permit regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline is based on the 2014 FEIS and new communications with the Canadian pipeline company. It acknowledges the environmental impacts and dynamic nature of topics like GHG emissions and market analysis. The decision to approve the proposed Project at this time would not undermine U.S. objectives in addressing climate change. The report examines the findings of the 2014 FEIS with respect to GHG emissions assessments of the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline project. The assessment of GHG emissions from the production and use of crude oils transported through the pipeline depends on various factors, including data availability, industry activities scope, modeling assumptions, and secondary considerations like global oil markets and policy impacts. Different estimates are derived based on these factors. The State Department conducted an assessment of GHG emissions from Canadian oil sands deposits, specifically focusing on the Keystone XL Pipeline project. The assessment includes analysis of emissions from construction, operation, and transport options, regardless of the permit application outcome. The State Department assesses GHG emissions from the Keystone XL Pipeline project, including direct and indirect emissions from construction, operation, and transport options. This includes emissions from fugitive releases, land use changes, fuel use, and off-site electricity generation. Indirect life-cycle GHG emissions from oil sands crudes are also considered, covering the full emissions profile from extraction to end-use combustion. The FEIS reports estimates for the incremental indirect life-cycle GHG emissions of oil sands crudes compared to other crudes it may displace in U.S. refineries. The project would emit 0.24 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents during construction and 1.44 MMTCO2e per year during normal operations for the production, refining, and combustion of 830,000 bpd of oil sands. The proposed pipeline would emit 147 to 168 MMTCO2e per year from the production, refining, and combustion of 830,000 bpd of oil sands crude. The incremental life-cycle GHG emissions for oil sands crudes transported through the pipeline are estimated to be 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO2e per year. Approval or denial of the project is unlikely to impact oil sands extraction or demand for heavy crude oil in the US. The findings in the FEIS are similar to those in the DEIS released in March 2013. The FEIS findings are similar to the DEIS, with changes in methodology and data presentation. The State Department calculates 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO2e annually for GHG emissions from oil sands transported by the proposed project using a life-cycle assessment method. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates environmental impacts of a product, like the climate change implications of petroleum. LCAs track carbon dioxide and GHG emissions from extraction to combustion, expressed as CO2e per unit of fuel. The State Department uses various studies to assess emissions intensity of oil sands, including Jacobs Consultancy 2009 and TIAX LLC 2009. The State Department uses various studies to assess emissions intensity of oil sands, including Jacobs Consultancy 2009, TIAX LLC 2009, U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) 2008, and NETL 2009. These studies highlight that oil sands require more energy-intensive activities to extract due to their heavier and more viscous nature. Additionally, oil sands have higher carbon, sulfur, and heavy metal content, requiring more processing to yield consumable fuels by U.S. standards. Each study uses different parameters and data, resulting in varying estimates of GHG emissions intensities from oil sands production and use. The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) conducted studies on oil sands crudes, comparing their GHG emissions intensity to a baseline value for transportation fuels in the US. The emissions estimates for different oil sands production techniques ranged from 101-120 gCO2e/MJ LHV gasoline, with oil sands crudes found to be more GHG intensive than other heavy crudes. The FEIS determined that oil sands crudes would emit 17% more GHGs than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the US in 2005. The total life-cycle emissions from transporting 830,000 barrels per day of oil sands crude through the proposed pipeline is estimated to be approximately 147 to 168 MMTCO2e per year. The FEIS compares the GHG emissions of Canadian oil sands crudes to reference crudes available to Gulf Coast refineries, reporting that oil sands crudes have higher emissions. The incremental GHG emissions from oil sands crude transported through the proposed pipeline are estimated to be 1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO2e per year. The FEIS reports that incremental emissions from the proposed pipeline are equivalent to a small percentage of total U.S. annual emissions. The reported emissions do not consider market dynamics and represent the potential increase in GHG emissions if the project is approved. The FEIS examines market scenarios and concludes that approval or denial of the proposed pipeline is unlikely to impact oil sands production in Canada. It also calculates construction emissions of 0.24 MMTCO2e and operational emissions of 1.44 MMTCO2e/year. The State Department does not include operational estimates in the total life-cycle GHG emissions for the project. The FEIS compares operational GHG emissions from the project to various transportation alternatives and reports that the no action alternatives have higher emissions. The GHG emissions assessment and crude oil market analysis in the FEIS are models that consider variables and uncertainties to arrive at estimates. The State Department relies on third-party sources for data on GHG emissions of oil sands crudes, leading to variations in reported findings. Life-cycle assessments are used to compare emissions of different hydrocarbon resources, but retain uncertainties due to complex fuel life-cycles and analytical design features. The NETL 2009 LCA provides specific parameters and input for estimating emissions of oil sands crudes. The NETL 2009 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for oil sands crudes has specific design parameters and input assumptions, with data dating back to 2005. Critics of the Keystone XL Pipeline point out exclusions in the LCA, while proponents highlight recent advances in energy efficiency and GHG mitigation technologies in Canadian oil sands production. Alberta's government has also implemented policies to reduce GHG emissions from oil sands production. The curr_chunk discusses initiatives associated with oil sands production, such as a mandatory GHG intensity reduction program, a fund for clean energy investment, and funding for carbon capture and sequestration facilities. Proponents believe these advances may align oil sands' GHG emissions intensity with other reference crudes. However, assessing the life-cycle GHG emissions intensities of reference crudes faces uncertainties due to data quality and transparency issues. The difficulty in accessing necessary data from the field can impede meaningful comparisons between emissions factors for Canadian oil sands crudes and reference crudes. Changes in emissions factors over time may impact their respective GHG emissions, with conventional oil seeing increased emissions from recovery techniques while oil sands surface mining maintains a relatively constant energy intensity. Exploration for new oil reservoirs continues, potentially commercializing both greater and lesser emissions-intensive resources. The State Department's analysis on Canadian oil sands leaves open the determination of which reference crudes would be displaced at Gulf Coast refineries. Different LCAs have varying assumptions on the impact of Canadian oil sands development on global crude production, with NETL suggesting that resources from Venezuela or Mexico may be displaced first, but ultimately Saudi Light could be backed out of the global market by increased Canadian oil sands production. Many factors such as economics, geopolitics, and trade issues could influence this displacement. Many factors, including economics, geopolitics, and trade issues, could influence global petroleum production balance and incremental GHG emissions. Various market forecasts from organizations like the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, National Energy Board, and International Energy Agency analyze crude oil prices, production volumes, refinery inputs, and consumer demand to assess the impact on oil sands development until 2035-2040. Forecasts assume a \"business-as-usual\" scenario for Canadian oil sands producers reacting based on normal commercial incentives. The State Department's FEIS models different scenarios based on supply-demand assumptions and pipeline constraints, including potential higher-than-expected U.S. supply, lower-than-expected U.S. demand, and higher-than-expected oil. The forecasts assume projects will proceed as planned and adequate takeaway capacity will be available to oil sands producers. The FEIS calculates the effects of not constructing adequate pipeline takeaway capacity as a \"counterfactual\" scenario. The FEIS predicts steady to rising global oil prices, decreasing production costs, and continued demand in U.S. Gulf Coast refineries for oil sands crudes. If the proposed pipeline is denied, the market would respond by adding comparable transport capacity over time, minimizing the impact on oil sands development. The FEIS predicts steady to rising global oil prices, decreasing production costs, and continued demand in U.S. Gulf Coast refineries for oil sands crudes. Approval or denial of crude oil transport projects is unlikely to significantly impact demand. The State Department supports this analysis with projections on refinery capacity and oil imports. The FEIS predicts that U.S. tight oil production drop-off by the mid-2020s would dissuade Gulf Coast refiners from switching to lighter crudes. Analysts argue that increased transport of oil sands crudes could optimize operating capacity at Gulf Coast refineries and increase GHG emissions. Domestic light oil production is displacing imported light crudes and heavier crudes in the market. The displacement of imported light and heavy crudes in the market could impact North American petroleum infrastructure, including refinery inputs, transport capacity, and production facilities. The State Department notes proposed pipeline projects from Canada to the U.S., with potential impacts on oil sands crudes use in U.S. refineries and GHG emissions. The State Department examines scenarios for transporting new production of oil sands crudes by rail and other non-pipeline options, citing feasibility based on past evidence. Commercial demand for oil sands crudes in Gulf Coast refineries could be met by rail if new pipelines are delayed. Some analysts are skeptical of rail's ability to accommodate all new production in the oil sands. Some analysts are skeptical of rail's ability to handle all new oil sands production due to infrastructure limitations. The International Energy Agency warns that the lack of pipelines like Keystone XL could lead to price discounts and slow sector growth. Other market analyses predict short to medium-term reductions in oil sands expansion. The State Department reviews \"breakeven prices\" for oil sands projects to assess the impact of supply costs. A long-term increase in supply costs raises the breakeven price, potentially leading to decreased production and investment. Third-party reports are referenced to evaluate the likelihood of this scenario. The State Department reviews supply costs for new oil sands projects, reporting costs ranging from $65-$100 per barrel. Revenues to oil sands producers are likely to remain above long-run supply costs at prices above $75 per barrel. Transport penalties and supply cost increases could impact investment decisions, but baseline production projections are expected to be met. The FEIS models different scenarios combining supply-demand assumptions and pipeline constraints. Some scenarios show rail delays impacting system capacity in the short term, while others suggest pipeline constraints could reduce oil sands producers' prices by up to $8 per barrel. One scenario predicts that benchmark crude oil prices of $65-$75 per barrel, along with increased transportation costs, could significantly affect oil sands production levels. The FEIS does not provide numerical estimates for GHG emissions based on market scenarios. It suggests that oil sands production would be unaffected by market conditions, implying negligible incremental GHG emissions from the proposed pipeline. The FEIS reports that the annual operational emissions for the \"no action\" alternatives are 28%-42% greater than for the proposed project. The March 2013 DEIS estimated the incremental cost of rail over pipeline as $5 per barrel, with a 2%-4% decrease in oil sands production levels, and an incremental GHG emission reduction of up to 5.3 MMTCO2e annually. The debate over the Keystone XL Pipeline extends beyond direct environmental impacts. The debate over the Keystone XL Pipeline extends beyond direct environmental impacts, with a focus on its effect on Canadian oil sands development and U.S. energy policy. The FEIS analyzes the GHG emissions of the proposed pipeline, estimating up to 27.4 MMTCO2e per year more than current crudes, equivalent to emissions from 5.7 million vehicles or 7.8 coal-fired plants. The FEIS analyzes future market projections for oil sands crudes, predicting stable to rising global oil prices, diminishing transportation constraints, decreasing production costs, and continued demand for heavy crudes in U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. Approval or denial of the proposed pipeline is unlikely to impact Canadian oil sands development significantly, as other transport options can accommodate projected growth. Life-cycle GHG emissions from oil sands production and consumption would occur regardless of the transportation method used. Some analysts question the inevitability of Canadian oil sands expansion due to financial challenges and market uncertainties. They argue that alternative transportation methods may impact greenhouse gas emissions differently. The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline could significantly impact oil sands expansion if key variables differ from projections, such as lower oil prices, higher rail costs, and competition from shale oil. Any decrease in development could slow global GHG emissions growth by allowing time for energy-efficiency strategies and climate policies. Some stakeholders believe the approval or denial of the Keystone XL Pipeline could set a precedent for U.S. energy policy, signaling a shift away from fossil fuels towards lower-carbon energy technologies. They argue that the decision represents a long-term commitment to a carbon-based economy and its greenhouse gas emissions. Some stakeholders believe that meaningful action on climate policy is slowed or stalled in Congress, courts, and regulatory agencies, leaving single-action initiatives on infrastructure permits as the only outlet for a low-carbon energy policy. There is opposition to the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, with concerns that it may set a precedent for future infrastructure projects not being held accountable for their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Others see the project as part of revitalizing the energy production sector in North America and argue for U.S. policy support. Members of Congress are divided on the Keystone XL Pipeline project, with some supporting it for energy security and economic benefits, while others have concerns about its potential health and environmental impacts. They advocate for U.S. policy to support investment in North American energy infrastructure to enhance national security and shift supply to reliable allies like Canada. Congress has oversight over the project due to federal environmental statutes. The Keystone XL Pipeline project has oversight from federal environmental statutes governing its construction."
