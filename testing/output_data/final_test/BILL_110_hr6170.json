    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2008\" and includes definitions for clarity. The \"Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2008\" defines \"clean coal-derived fuel\" as fuel derived from US coal resources and processed at a facility capturing carbon dioxide emissions. It also defines \"covered fuel\" in the Act. The \"Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2008\" defines \"covered fuel\" as aviation fuel, motor vehicle fuel, home heating oil, and boiler fuel. It also defines \"small refinery\" as a refinery with a daily crude oil throughput not exceeding 75,000 barrels. The Clean Coal-Derived Fuel Program is defined in the \"Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2008\" as covering aviation fuel, motor vehicle fuel, home heating oil, and boiler fuel. The Clean Coal-Derived Fuel Program, as defined in the \"Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2008,\" requires the President to promulgate regulations within a year to ensure that covered fuel in the US meets clean coal-derived fuel volume requirements. Compliance provisions will apply to refineries, blenders, distributors, and importers. The Clean Coal-Derived Fuel Program regulations aim to ensure that fuel produced from clean coal facilities meets greenhouse gas emission standards comparable to gasoline. The regulations do not limit where clean coal-derived fuel can be used in the US or impose per-gallon usage requirements. The regulations will align with existing program structures and compliance requirements. The final regulations for the renewable fuel program, established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, outline reporting requirements. The applicable volume for calendar years 2015 through 2022 is determined according to a specified table. The renewable fuel program regulations set out reporting requirements for clean coal-derived fuel volumes from 2015 to 2022, increasing annually from 0.75 to 6.0 billion gallons. For 2023 and beyond, volumes are subject to specified conditions. For calendar year 2023 and beyond, the President will determine the applicable volume of clean coal-derived fuels based on a review of the program's implementation from 2015 to 2022, considering factors like energy security, production rates, and other impacts. For calendar year 2023 and beyond, the applicable volume of clean coal-derived fuels will be determined by the President based on factors like job creation, rural economic development, and the environment. The volume calculation involves multiplying the estimated gallons of covered fuel sold with a ratio of 6 billion gallons of clean coal-derived fuel. The Energy Information Administration provides estimates of covered fuel volumes projected to be sold in the US for each calendar year from 2015 to 2021. The President determines applicable percentages based on these estimates by November 30 of each year from 2015 to 2022. The President determines the clean coal-derived fuel obligation for the following calendar year to ensure compliance with requirements. The obligation applies to refineries, blenders, and importers, expressed as a volume percentage of covered fuel sold in the US. The President adjusts the applicable percentage for clean coal-derived fuel to prevent redundant obligations and account for small refineries using clean coal fuel. Volume conversion factors are assigned to specific types of clean coal-derived fuel for compliance with requirements. The President adjusts the applicable percentage for clean coal-derived fuel to prevent redundant obligations and account for small refineries using clean coal fuel. Volume conversion factors are assigned to specific types of clean coal-derived fuel for compliance with requirements. Clean coal-derived fuels are considered equivalent to diesel fuel based on energy content. The President, in consultation with the Secretary, implements a credit program to ensure market transparency for the sale and trade of credits. Waivers for clean coal-derived fuel requirements can be granted by the President, Secretary, and EPA Administrator on petition by one or more States. The President, in consultation with the Secretary and EPA Administrator, can grant waivers for clean coal-derived fuel requirements based on economic or environmental harm or extreme circumstances. State petitions for waivers must be approved or disapproved within 90 days. Small refineries are temporarily exempt from clean coal-derived fuel requirements until 2018. The Secretary must submit a study by December 31, 2013, to determine if compliance is feasible. Waivers granted by the President under certain conditions will terminate after 1 year but can be renewed after consultation with relevant authorities. Small refineries may petition the President for an extension of exemption if compliance with clean fuel requirements would cause disproportionate economic hardship. The exemption can be extended for at least 2 additional years. Small refineries can petition the President for an extension of exemption due to economic hardship. The President must consider study findings and economic factors when evaluating petitions, and must act on them within 90 days. Small refineries can opt-in to requirements by notifying the President of their waiver. The small refinery can waive the exemption by notifying the President. Civil penalties may be imposed for violations of regulations, with a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day of violation plus the economic benefit gained. Penalties are collected through civil enforcement. The Secretary or designated officer can assess and collect civil penalties for violations of regulations. District courts have jurisdiction to restrain violations, award relief, and compel information. Actions are brought in the name of the United States. Subpoenas can be issued in the action. Subpoenas for witnesses can apply in any district court. This section takes effect on January 1, 2016."
