    "title": "AB 2298",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 70615 of the Government Code is amended to set a $25 fee for appeals to the superior court on various administrative decisions. This includes appeals on administrative fines, parking violations, fare evasion penalties, and gang database placements. Additionally, Section 186.34 of the Penal Code is amended to define a \"shared gang database.\" The amended Penal Code defines a \"shared gang database\" as a database accessible to local law enforcement agencies containing personal information designating individuals as suspected gang members. It must comply with federal regulations and excludes certain types of information. The Penal Code defines a \"shared gang database\" as a system like CalGang, retaining records of individuals' gang activity. Law enforcement agencies using this database must submit annual reports to the Department of Justice with specific information by ZIP Code, agency, race, gender, and age. The Department of Justice requires law enforcement agencies to report annually on the number of persons in the shared gang database, additions, removal requests, granted removals, and automatic removals. These reports are posted on the department's website starting February 15, 2018, and annually thereafter. Local law enforcement agencies using a shared gang database must notify individuals before designating them as suspected gang members, associates, or affiliates, providing written notice to minors and their parents or guardians unless it compromises an investigation or safety. The notice must describe the process for contesting the designation in the gang database and provide the reason for the designation. Individuals, including minors, can request information from law enforcement about their status in the database and which agency made the designation. Requests must be in writing. If a person is designated as a suspected gang member in a shared gang database, the requester can ask for the basis of the designation to contest it. The law enforcement agency must provide this information within 30 days, unless it compromises an investigation or the safety of a minor. Subsequent to the notice of designation as a suspected gang member, the person or their parent can contest it by submitting written documentation to the local law enforcement agency. If the agency determines the person is not a suspected gang member, they will be removed from the shared gang database and provided with written verification. If the request for removal is denied, the person can appeal the decision. A person listed in a shared gang database can appeal their designation within 90 days by filing a limited civil case in superior court. The agency must be served with a copy of the appeal within the specified timeframe. The appeal process for a shared gang database designation is limited to the agency's statement of basis and documentation provided by the appellant. If the court finds insufficient evidence of gang affiliation, the person's name must be removed from the database. The fee for filing a notice of appeal is set by Section 70615 of the Government Code. The court will inform the person of the appearance date either by mail or personal delivery. Regardless of the appeal outcome, the court will keep the fee, but if the court rules in favor of the person, the fee will be reimbursed by the agency. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made according to the Government Code."
