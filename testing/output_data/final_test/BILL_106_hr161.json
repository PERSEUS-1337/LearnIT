Restricting Medicaid liens and estate recovery for long-term care services if individual had long-term care insurance benefits for at least 3 years within a 5-year period. The amendments made by this section prohibit States from seeking adjustment or recovery of medical assistance paid on behalf of an individual if a lien cannot be imposed. Effective date applies to adjustments initiated after enactment of the Act. SEC. 2. Treatment of carryovers and long-term care insurance under flexible spending arrangements. The text discusses the allowance of carryovers and permitted reimbursement of long-term care insurance premiums under flexible spending arrangements. It also mentions the repeal of income inclusion for long-term care insurance. The maximum reimbursement available to a participant in a flexible spending arrangement can be increased by a carryover amount, which is the excess of the maximum reimbursement from the previous year over the actual reimbursement received. The carryover amount in a flexible spending arrangement cannot exceed the total premiums paid for coverage for the participant in the current and preceding year. Reimbursement for long-term care insurance premiums and health insurance premiums during unemployment does not affect the arrangement's status or the participant's gross income. The tax code allows for reimbursement of long-term care insurance and medical insurance premiums for the taxpayer and their family members under certain conditions, such as after separation from employment for a specified period. The tax code allows reimbursement of long-term care and medical insurance premiums for the taxpayer's family members upon full-time employment. Definitions include spouse, children under 19, and parents or stepparents. The term 'medical insurance' covers medical care as defined in the tax code. A flexible spending arrangement is a benefit program that reimburses specified expenses within set limits. The maximum reimbursement available for coverage under a plan is limited to less than 500 percent of the coverage value. This limit applies to insured plans based on the underlying coverage. Flexible spending arrangements in a plan do not affect its status as a cafeteria plan, even if they increase reimbursement amounts or include premium payments as reimbursable expenses. The amendment made by this section applies to years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
