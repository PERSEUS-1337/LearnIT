    "content": "The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) aims to address feedstock supply challenges in the cellulosic biofuels industry by providing support for biomass availability. The industry faces obstacles due to the lack of a consistent biomass supply, leading to a \"chicken and egg\" dilemma where investors are hesitant to invest in processing plants without proven technology success, and producers are reluctant to grow dedicated biomass crops without nearby biofuels plants. BCAP offers annual & establishment payments, matching payments, and project areas to facilitate the development of a cellulosic biofuels industry. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) supports the cellulosic biofuels industry by providing payments and project areas. U.S. ethanol production grew rapidly from 2001 to 2011, mainly from corn starch. Concerns about using corn for ethanol led to a shift towards second-generation biofuels based on non-food crop biomass. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the 2008 farm bill aimed to promote the use of second-generation biofuels, including cellulosic biofuels. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was established to support the production of eligible biomass crops for bioenergy conversion and assist with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation. The 2014 farm bill extends BCAP through FY2018 with modifications and new funding. Enrolled land eligibility is expanded to include expiring CRP or ACEP easement contracts. Residue from crops receiving Title I payments is eligible, with exclusions for whole grain from a Title I crop, bagasse, and algae. One-Time Establishment Payments are limited to 50% of establishment cost, not exceeding $500 per acre. CHST Matching Payments are capped at $20 per dry ton. The 2014 farm bill extends BCAP through FY2018 with modifications and new funding. Payments are capped at $20 per dry ton for a two-year period, with CHST funding now available for technical assistance. USDA will submit a new BCAP report to Congress on best practices. BCAP provides financial assistance to owners and operators of agricultural and private forest land for establishing, producing, and delivering biomass feedstocks. This assistance includes establishment and annual payments for perennial crops, as well as CHST matching payments for eligible material owners. BCAP offers two payment types - annual/establishment and matching - with different eligibility requirements, payment rates, and contract lengths. These payments aim to incentivize producers to invest in dedicated biomass crops for bioenergy production within designated project areas. Establishment payments can cover up to 50% of the costs for establishing perennial crops, including woody biomass, within approved project areas. BCAP annual payments support up to 15 years of woody crop production and 5 years of non-woody crop production, assisting with the risk of shifting from traditional crops. Payments are per-acre based on market rental rates determined by FSA, similar to CRP. They may be reduced based on harvest/collection value and matching payments. The BCAP program provides payments for eligible crops delivered to biomass conversion facilities for various purposes, with reductions based on the type of conversion. Only private agricultural and non-industrial private forest lands are considered eligible for BCAP payments. Federal and state-owned lands are ineligible, as well as lands enrolled in conservation programs like CRP. Producers within selected BCAP project areas are eligible for annual and establishment payments after entering into a BCAP contract. Producers with established eligible crops cannot receive an establishment payment but remain eligible for annual payments. The project sponsor can also receive payments if the land is eligible and not government-owned. The 2008 farm bill defines \"eligible crop\" for payments. The 2008 farm bill defines \"eligible crop\" for annual and establishment payments under BCAP as renewable biomass, excluding invasive or noxious plants. Algae is considered an eligible crop but not an eligible material. BCAP contracts vary in length depending on the type of crop. Payments under BCAP vary in length depending on the type of crop: 5 years for non-woody perennial crops and 15 years for woody perennial crops. Participants must have an active conservation plan addressing environmental concerns. Agreements between USDA and project area sponsors specify support for eligible crop production for bioenergy conversion. CHST matching payments assist agricultural activities under BCAP. BCAP's matching payments support the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of biomass for bioenergy production. The payments provide incentives for delivering underutilized biomass to qualified conversion facilities, with contracts lasting two years and payments up to $20 per ton. This aims to remove existing biomass that may not be profitable to collect. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) supports the collection and transportation of biomass for bioenergy production. Eligible material must be harvested directly from the land and can include invasive and noxious species. Biomass conversion facilities convert renewable biomass into various products and must enter into an agreement with USDA to qualify for BCAP. Land ownership is not a limiting factor for receiving matching payments. According to the USDA final rule, eligible material for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) can be harvested from various types of lands, including National Forest System, Bureau of Land Management, nonfederal, and tribal lands. Material owners must be approved by FSA before delivering to biomass conversion facilities for matching payments. Private land material owners can be landowners, operators, or biomass facility owners, while public land owners need permits or agreements with the appropriate agency. Federal government entities are not eligible. Eligible material for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) includes renewable biomass, excluding certain materials like crops eligible for Title I payments, animal waste, food waste, yard waste, algae, and bagasse. Woody material collected outside of contract acreage for existing market products is also ineligible to prevent resource diversion. Invasive and noxious species are considered eligible material. The final rule for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) states that eligible material must be collected directly from the land, separated from high-valued products, and collected according to an approved plan to prevent high-value products from receiving matching payments. Agreements for matching payments can be made between USDA and biomass conversion facilities, with obligations including providing purchase lists, receipts, and fair market value payment for eligible materials. BCAP assistance is available for establishing and producing biomass crops in designated project areas. Eligible material owners must notify FSA after delivery to a biomass conversion facility for payment based on tonnage delivered. BCAP matching payments are limited to $1 per dry ton equivalent, not exceeding $20 per ton, with payment terms lasting no more than two years. Participants in the BCAP program can receive financial and technical assistance, along with annual payments, to establish specified biomass crops in project areas designated by proposals submitted to the USDA's Farm Service Agency. Sponsors of project areas can include various entities like biomass conversion facility owners, government agencies, schools, and NGOs. Interested parties should contact their FSA state office for more information on submitting a proposal. Upon designation of a project area, eligible producers can enroll land into the program. The BCAP program requires project area sponsors to submit proposals with details like eligible land description, list of crops, commitment from biomass conversion facility, and evidence of facility equity. Proposals are sent to FSA state office for recommendation. If project spans multiple states, it is submitted to the national office. Project proposals for the BCAP program are evaluated based on specific criteria, including crop volume, economic impact, local producer participation, environmental impact, and crop variety. Eligible proposals can receive annual and establishment payments for producers within the project area. Producers in designated BCAP project areas may enroll land to grow eligible biomass crops and receive annual and establishment payments. Biomass production must adhere to approved conservation plans to address resource concerns. BCAP was authorized funding through the 2008 farm bill until 2012, with funding provided by USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) received virtually unlimited funding from the CCC until its authority expired in 2012. Actual outlays depended on participant numbers and eligible biomass crops. Congress imposed spending caps as outlays exceeded expectations, with nearly $300 million paid out to projects in 31 states under the 2008 farm bill. This was significantly more than the initial projections of $36 million by the CBO. No outlays were made in FY2008 as the program was not yet operational. Program costs for BCAP totaled $2.1 million in FY2009 and increased to $248 million in FY2010 due to CHST matching payments. Congress limited the program's authorization to $552 million for FY2010 and $112 million for FY2011. FSA suspended CHST matching payments in response to reduced funding, leading to a decline in outlays to $24.3 million in FY2011. In FY2012, Congress limited mandatory funding for BCAP to $17 million, with actual outlays at $15.9 million. BCAP, along with other bioenergy programs, expired in FY2012 but was extended through FY2013 with discretionary funding of $20 million authorized for FY2013. The 2014 farm bill authorized $25 million annually for BCAP from FY2014 to FY2018, with projected outlays of $99 million for FY2014-FY2018. In FY2015, Congress limited funding to $23 million. USDA's FSA administers BCAP and provides program information on its website. President Barack Obama directed the Secretary of Agriculture to accelerate biofuel production, including CHST assistance for biomass conversion facilities. USDA's NOFA for CHST matching payments raised concerns about market competition with wood manufacturing industries and was terminated in February 2010. USDA terminated NOFA on February 3, 2010, and published a proposed rule for BCAP on February 8, 2010. The BCAP interim rule was issued on October 27, 2010, implementing the full program. FSA suspended CHST matching payments through FY2011 due to funding reductions. The last deadline for project area proposals was September 23, 2011, and as of June 2012, 11 BCAP project areas were selected. USDA published an interim rule on September 15, 2011, amending the BCAP regulation to prioritize limited program funds for project area activities. Funding for establishment and annual payments in project areas is given priority to ensure a continuous supply of biomass. Matching payments for CHST will only be funded if resources are available after funding project area applications. The interim rule allows prioritization among project area proposals if eligible requests exceed available funding. USDA was required to submit a report on best practice data from BCAP participants by June 18, 2012, and issued a Notice of Funds Availability for BCAP in June 2014, allocating $12.5 million for matching payments and technical assistance activities for FY2014. In FY2014, USDA allocated $12.5 million for technical assistance activities related to BCAP. No funding was available for crop establishment or new project areas in 2014. Final regulations to implement changes to BCAP from the 2014 farm bill were announced in December 2014. Initial concerns about feedstock eligibility and slow development of cellulosic biofuels were addressed by the 2014 farm bill. Defining eligible materials and crops under BCAP was contentious in the early years of implementation. Issues around eligible crops under BCAP have lessened over time, but concerns remain about invasive species being used as energy crops and the slow growth of the cellulosic biofuels industry. Some worry that certain grasses could cause economic and environmental harm despite efforts to prevent it. In early 2010, some manufacturing and nursery industries noticed a price increase for raw materials like wood shavings, wood chips, and sawdust. This was linked to CHST matching payments, offering a federal payment match for materials delivered to biomass conversion facilities. The incentive of up to $45 per ton led material owners to sell to biomass facilities rather than manufacturers or nurseries using the same materials for products like composite panels and mulch. Renewable biomass from public lands is subject to restrictions to prevent it from being used for higher-value products. In response to the initial reaction to CHST matching payments, USDA expanded the restriction on renewable biomass from public lands to also include biomass from private sources. As a result, all biomass material that could be used for higher-value products is now considered ineligible under USDA's final rule, regardless of whether it is from public or private land. Additionally, USDA's final rule now requires that eligible material be directly harvested from the land to enforce the division between higher-value products. In 2010, USDA implemented new requirements for eligible materials for matching payments, specifying that they must be directly harvested from the land, separated from higher-value products, and not classified as such by USDA. For example, wood chips collected directly from the land are eligible, while those collected after delivery to pulp and paper facilities are not. Similarly, corn cobs separated from corn kernels in the field and collected as residue are also considered eligible for matching payments. Some industries oppose CHST matching payments, questioning sustainability. Biomass industry prefers BCAP annual and establishment payments for longer-term support. In its final rule for the BCAP program, USDA re-prioritized program funds to emphasize annual and establishment payments over CHST matching payments. The 2014 farm bill lowered the maximum CHST payment rate to $20 per ton to discourage preference away from existing uses. Concerns remain about USDA's ability to differentiate between high-value product material and renewable biomass material in the future. The fungible nature of wood may continue to create competition between wood-based products and renewable energy production. The BCAP program under USDA has revised eligibility criteria for materials and crops, with a focus on annual and establishment payments over CHST matching payments. Concerns have been raised about the potential conflict with practices to limit invasive species, but some see it as an incentive for eradication efforts. The program distinguishes between eligible material and crops, with a majority of facilities in the mature wood products industry participating. The USDA's BCAP program has revised eligibility criteria for materials and crops, focusing on annual and establishment payments. Invasive and noxious species are excluded as crops but can be eligible materials under CHST matching payments. Concerns have been raised about the inclusion of these species, but the final rule addresses this by imposing restrictions on removal and transportation during reproductive periods. The USDA's BCAP program has revised eligibility criteria for materials and crops, focusing on annual and establishment payments. Invasive and noxious species are excluded as crops but can be eligible materials under CHST matching payments. Removal costs for spreading invasive species are outside the scope of BCAP and subject to state and federal laws. Ideal biomass crop traits are similar to invasive grasses, with species like giant miscanthus and black locust considered eligible energy crops. Some are concerned about non-sterile varieties becoming invasive. Some are concerned about non-sterile varieties becoming invasive and noxious, potentially causing economic and ecological damage. USDA's final rule does not distinguish between sterile and non-sterile varieties, raising concerns about unintended consequences. The BCAP FPEIS highlights issues with introducing genetically engineered species and non-native varieties as biomass crops, emphasizing the need for thorough environmental evaluation to prevent the spread of invasive species. In 2009, concerns arose about \"black liquor\" qualifying for CHST matching payments under BCAP due to its renewable material status. Black liquor is a waste product from paper production used for energy. The 2007 EISA expanded the alternative fuel excise tax credit to include fuels for non-transportation industries, benefiting paper companies using black liquor for energy. Paper companies used black liquor for energy and added diesel to qualify for biofuel tax credits, costing taxpayers over $4 billion in 2009. The health care bill disqualified black liquor for the tax credit in 2010. USDA's final rule states black liquor is an industrial waste by-product and not eligible under BCAP. Supporters argue that black liquor should be eligible, as it does not need to originate directly from the land according to the 2008 farm bill definition of \"eligible material.\" The 2014 farm bill clarified the definition of \"eligible material\" for BCAP as renewable biomass harvested directly from the land. BCAP aims to establish new biomass crops for bioenergy production and increase the collection of underutilized biomass. This includes incentivizing biomass removal from areas where it is not currently profitable, such as hazardous wildfire fuels and invasive species, for renewable energy conversion. The BCAP program aims to utilize biomass for renewable energy production, including crop residue. Federal conservation programs support practices that retain crop residue on the land for environmental benefits. However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact of removing crop residue for bioenergy production on soil health and the environment. The potential development of a cellulosic-based ethanol industry is hindered by slow progress in cellulosic conversion technology from laboratory to commercial scale. Dedicated biomass crops like switchgrass and hybrid poplars are favored for their quick regrowth and lower resource usage compared to traditional field crops. Concerns remain about the increased need for fertilizers and water to boost yields for economic viability. The slow progress in commercializing cellulosic-based ethanol production is a concern due to its perceived high cost compared to corn-based production. The U.S. ethanol industry is facing challenges with the \"blend wall\" limiting ethanol's share in gasoline fuels. Despite this, the abundance of low-cost cellulosic plant material in the U.S. makes it an attractive feedstock. The 2014 farm bill provides financial incentives to promote advanced biofuels, including cellulosic feedstocks, through programs like BCAP. The BCAP program supports the production of cellulosic feedstocks and aims to kick start the U.S. cellulosic biofuels sector. Despite government support, the sector has been slow to develop until recently with the startup of commercial-scale facilities. EPA has had to reduce cellulosic biofuel mandates due to the slow progress. The EPA has had to significantly reduce cellulosic biofuel mandates set by Congress for 2010-2014, due to budget constraints and reduced funding. This has increased uncertainty for future investments in the sector."
