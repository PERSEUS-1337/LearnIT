    "content": "Congress has a long-standing interest in Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to develop directed energy (DE) weapons, with rigorous congressional oversight on past and current programs like the U.S. Navy's Laser Weapon System (LaWS). The Congressional Directed Energy Caucus was established in 2011 to oversee DOD DE activities, focusing on U.S. Army weapons-related DE programs showing promise in addressing threats to ground forces. Congressional oversight could include programmatic developments, timelines, and authorization and appropriations issues. Directed-energy (DE) weapons are systems using concentrated electromagnetic energy to incapacitate, damage, disable, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, and personnel. Directed-energy warfare (DEW) involves the use of DE weapons to incapacitate or destroy adversary equipment and personnel, as well as protect friendly assets and retain use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Weaponized DE systems are becoming more prevalent and powerful, forming a significant part of electronic warfare missions. Directed-energy (DE) weapons, such as High Energy Lasers (HELs) and High Powered Microwaves (HPMs), have the potential to change warfare and impact U.S. national security. DE weapons can act as both sensors and weapons, reducing the sensor-to-shooter timeline to seconds. Airborne HELs could revolutionize air combat by engaging ballistic missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and other airborne platforms. Stealthy unmanned combat aerial vehicles could also utilize HELs. Directed-energy (DE) weapons like High Energy Lasers (HELs) and High Powered Microwaves (HPMs) have the potential to revolutionize warfare. They can be used on unmanned combat aerial vehicles for precision strikes against heavily defended targets and to defend U.S. aircraft against SAMs. DE weapons could enhance U.S. air dominance by improving suppression of enemy air defense operations and rapidly locating and attacking mobile SAM systems. Additionally, DE weapons could be effective in missile defense and boost-phase defense against enemy ballistic missiles. Directed-energy (DE) weapons, particularly High Powered Microwaves (HPMs), offer a cost-effective solution against enemy ballistic missiles, decoys, and maneuverable warheads. They can preempt enemy use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and target buried or hardened WMD facilities without harming civilians. DE weapons enhance precision strike capabilities, disrupt power generation, and address asymmetric strategies like using civilians as shields. Directed-energy (DE) weapons, such as High Powered Microwaves (HPMs), can disrupt power generation and distribution, target military infrastructure, provide limited space control, and protect space-based assets. They could also be used offensively to deny adversaries the use of space assets and damage enemy satellites. The impact of DE weapons on international relations is uncertain due to ongoing technological developments. Early DE weapon applications will likely be tactical and defensive, such as missile defense or counter rocket, artillery, and mortars (C-RAM) applications. Some argue that these weapons could offer non-offensive means of responding to threats, potentially stabilizing international affairs. However, if DE weapons become more common and effective, their impact on military operations and international relations could grow. DE weapons represent a transformative capability in various military domains. DE weapons could fundamentally alter combat, putting nations at a military disadvantage. Incorporating DE weapons on U.S. aircraft could nullify investments in tactical fighters and SAMs, leading to a potential arms race. DE weapons could impact international relations and U.S. foreign policy, especially in space control, where they could be used defensively and offensively against enemy satellites. The ability to exert space control offensively with Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) could impact military balances and future conflicts. The weaponization of space is controversial, with concerns about attacks on space-based assets. The United States, as a major user of space for national security, is vulnerable to such attacks. DEWs are not defined under international law, raising concerns about their use in space. Selected international legal regimes apply to Directed Energy Weapons (DEW), including Protocol IV of the CCW which prohibits the use of laser weapons designed to cause permanent blindness. DEW are not defined under international law, raising concerns about their use in space. New applications for DE weapons could potentially cause casualties considered \"excessively injurious\" under the CCW, but they may be seen as more humane than conventional weapons due to their accuracy. Lower-power nonlethal uses for HELs and HPMs should also be considered. It is important for the DOD and the Army to ensure that new DE weapons programs comply with Protocol IV of the CCW to avoid being deemed \"excessively injurious.\" The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the testing and deployment of nuclear weapons and WMDs in space, reflecting international opposition to the militarization of space. The use of directed energy (DE) weapons in space is seen as a way to enhance missile defense and protect U.S. space-based assets. There is a concern that nations with DE weapons could gain a significant military advantage, leading to potential international efforts to regulate their use. Despite the potential benefits of DE weapons, there are also concerns about their impact on warfare and the need to comply with international regulations. Some experts believe that directed energy weapons could provide nations with unmatched military dominance, while others argue that these weapons have consistently failed to meet expectations. In 2016, Under Secretary of Defense Frank Kendall cautioned that there are serious limitations to the effectiveness of directed-energy weapons in combat, including power requirements and operational challenges. Solid-state lasers, more compact than chemical lasers, only require electricity to operate but generate significant heat. Developing cooling technologies for them could enhance their military utility. DASA (R&T) oversees Army Science and Technology. The Army Science and Technology (ASA[ALT]) oversees all Army S&T investments, including Directed Energy (DE) within the Lethality Portfolio. DE is just one aspect of the portfolio, which also focuses on fire support, air defense, close combat, and weapons enablers. The major S&T commands under the Lethality Portfolio are RDECOM at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, and ASMDC in Huntsville, AL. RDECOM includes ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal, AMRDEC in Huntsville, and ARL in Adelphi, MD. The Lethality Portfolio Director, ASA (ALT), manages the S&T investments. The Lethality Portfolio Director at ASA (ALT) in Adelphi, MD oversees S&T efforts related to Directed Energy (DE) and coordinates with DOD and other advanced technology organizations like DARPA and JIDO. The Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) program, initiated in 1996, aimed to develop a laser system for shooting down rockets and mortar shells, with Northrop Grumman as the primary U.S. contractor. The THEL program employed radar and a chemical laser to shoot down rockets and shells. It successfully intercepted multiple targets during testing but was ultimately cancelled in 2006 due to setbacks and cost overruns. The MTHEL program, an extension of THEL, aimed to develop a more mobile version in collaboration with Israel by 2008. Northrop Grumman and Israeli firms collaborated to build a more mobile version of THEL by 2008, focusing on reducing size and weight. The Army shifted to solid-state lasers powered by diesel generators. Raytheon developed the nonlethal Active Denial System in 2002, using millimeter wave energy to repel individuals without injury. The Army has explored the development of Solid State Active Denial Technology (SS-ADT) for crowd dispersal and security missions. It uses 95 GHz millimeter radio frequency waves and is claimed to present minimal health risks. Various High-Power Microwave (HPM) systems have been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan to counter IED attacks. The Army's Armament, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) took over the Air Force Research Laboratory's \"Max Power\" program in 2017 to destroy IEDs on the battlefield. A Max Power prototype was tested in Afghanistan for nine months, used in 19 combat missions with convoys across IED-infested roads. The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command is developing laser technologies for Army programs, including the High Energy Laser Division pursuing HEL technologies through HEL TVD and MMHEL paths. The Army is developing two paths for High Energy Laser (HEL) technologies - HEL TVD and MMHEL. HEL TVD involves a 100 kilowatt-class laser on a truck for C-RAM and SHORAD capabilities. Plans are to build and demonstrate it in FY2021 and FY2022. MMHEL integrates a 50 kilowatt-class laser on a Stryker combat vehicle for SHORAD support, with development ongoing from FY2018 to FY2021. The Army is developing High Energy Laser (HEL) technologies, including the MMHEL system mounted on a Stryker combat vehicle with a 5 kilowatt laser. The HELMTT program involves a 50 kilowatt laser mounted on a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) for data collection and future HEL development. Additionally, the U.S. Special Operations Command successfully tested an Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopter outfitted with a laser in June 2017. The Army successfully tested an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter outfitted with a laser in June 2017, hitting a target from a rotary-wing aircraft for the first time. They are using the test to understand interactions between the aircraft, laser, and target. The Army plans to incorporate Directed Energy (DE) technology in their next-generation combat vehicle for active protection and laser weapons to replace traditional mounted weapons, providing 360-degree protection from incoming rounds or UAVs. The goal is to field Army units with this new combat vehicle by 2035. The Army aims to field a next-generation combat vehicle with Directed Energy (DE) technology by 2035. To meet this goal, advancements in laser weapons technology are crucial by 2025. Other nations like Russia, China, and Israel are also developing DE weapons for various applications. The Soviet Union started experimenting with lasers in the 1950s and 1960s, focusing on ground-based systems to destroy ballistic missiles. During the Cold War, the Soviets experimented with mounting lasers on tanks and antiaircraft vehicles to disrupt enemy optics and targeting systems. Currently, Russia is developing a Directed Energy weapon capable of destroying guidance systems in aircraft and precision-guided missiles, as well as disrupting GPS signals and destroying communication equipment and satellites. This weapon can be mounted on vehicles, ships, and aircraft. Russia is developing a Directed Energy weapon to disrupt enemy systems and communication equipment. They also plan to mount lasers on aircraft and UAVs with greater attack capabilities. Chinese military experts believe DE weapons will dominate the battlefield in the next 30 years. China's military is focusing on the concept of \"Informatization\" which combines Big Data, artificial intelligence, and directed energy weapons. They are actively working on space-based laser weapons and have demonstrated capabilities in ground-based lasers. China's Ministry of National Defense released a video of a new laser-based air defense weapon with a 4-kilometer range to defeat drones. China is also developing naval lasers, including for the PLA Navy's Type-055 cruiser. In 2014, China introduced the WB-1 microwave active-denial system, similar to the U.S. system. In 2017, China made a breakthrough in high-power microwave weapons, potentially undermining advanced U.S. missiles. China is diligently working on developing a new weapon system that could undermine advanced U.S. missiles and enhance its anti-access/area-denial capabilities. This weapon could be used as an anti-satellite weapon or integrated with missiles to overcome enemy air defenses. China aims to dominate the next phase of warfare for a geostrategic advantage over other nations. The United States' military advantage from developing Directed Energy (DE) weapons may be short-lived as China is already advancing in space-based laser antisatellite programs and developing High Energy Laser (HEL) and High Power Microwave (HPM) weapons. Israel has a laser antisatellite program and is developing HEL and HPM weapons. The IDF first used lasers for target designation in 1982. The Nautilus program started in 1996 to shoot down rockets, artillery, and mortar shells. The Iron Dome program replaced lasers with interceptor rockets. Iron Dome claims a 90% success rate but is costly. Israel initiated its Iron Beam program in early 2014. Israel initiated its Iron Beam program in early 2014 to use a high-kilowatt laser to destroy short-range rockets, artillery, mortars, and UAVs. The IDF plans to deploy Iron Beam with Iron Dome, but the timeline is unknown. The Army's HPM initiatives lack public programmatic detail, with a focus on peer and near-peer threats and modernization priorities. Understanding these initiatives could benefit Congress in oversight and authorization roles. The Army is looking into leveraging HPM technologies from other branches and industry for potential programs. The Air Force is actively involved in HPM development with the CHAMPS system, which could disable electronic systems in enemy airspace. The Army's HPM intentions are not publicly detailed, focusing on peer threats and modernization priorities. The U.S. military, including the Army, is exploring High-Power Microwave (HPM) technologies for potential programs. Other countries are also developing Directed Energy (DE) weapons like HPM and High-Energy Laser (HEL) systems. If potential adversaries deploy effective DE weapons, it could impact the U.S. military's capabilities. Congress may need to assess if adversary DE systems are inferior, comparable, or superior to U.S. systems. If potential adversaries deploy effective DE weapons, it could impact the U.S. military's capabilities, particularly in ground combat. The U.S. Army is exploring integrating higher-power lasers on ground vehicles for operational mobile capabilities. The U.S. Army is looking to integrate higher-power lasers on ground vehicles for operational mobile capabilities, with plans to develop SHORAD/C-RAM capabilities after FY2022. Questions arise regarding the timeline for fielding these systems, their intended use, and the development of tactics and procedures. The Army is considering developing tactics for ground-based directed energy weapon systems, including the integration of these systems into existing formations. There are debates about the practicality and operational impact of these weapons, with challenges such as power generation and cooling systems. The Army is facing challenges in developing ground-based directed energy weapon systems, including cooling systems, overcoming attenuation, and limited ranges. Other concerns include susceptibility to countermeasures and potential collateral damage. There is a need to ensure DE weapons can effectively destroy enemy vehicles and aircraft. In 2017, a task force was established to examine the consolidation of the Army's efforts in this area. The Army is establishing a new Modernization Command to consolidate its modernization process. This includes reviewing potential reallocation of functions from existing commands and agencies. The new command is expected to be operational in the summer of 2018. Congress may need to consider oversight of the Army's Directed Energy (DE) portfolio and weapons-related efforts under this new command. The establishment of a new Army Modernization Command may lead to the reallocation of functions related to the Lethality Portfolio, including fire support, air defense, close combat, and weapons enablers. This could impact ongoing and planned Army Directed Energy efforts. Organizations like RDECOM, USASMDC, ARDEC, AMRDEC, and ARL may be affected by the new command. Army weapons-related Directed Energy efforts are progressing towards becoming programs of record, potentially playing a role in future force protection and counter rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) initiatives. The Army's Directed Energy (DE) efforts are progressing towards becoming programs of record, with potential roles in force protection, counter C-RAM, and SHORAD operations. Questions arise regarding the acquisition of DE systems, their integration into existing units, and the associated resource requirements. Developing comprehensive resource requirements for DE weapon systems will establish a total program cost for the Army. The Army's Directed Energy (DE) efforts are moving towards becoming programs of record, with potential roles in force protection, counter C-RAM, and SHORAD operations. Comprehensive funding profiles for Army DE-related programs are crucial for policymakers to make decisions on capabilities, modernization, force structure, and resource allocation. The Army has shifted focus to peer and near-peer threats, long-range precision fires, and air and missile defense. Congress has supported DOD and Army DE efforts through legislation like the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 114-328) mandated the designation of a senior Department of Defense official responsible for directed energy weapons development. Within 180 days of enactment, the Secretary of Defense must appoint an official to lead the development and demonstration of directed energy technologies, including creating a strategic plan for their integration into acquisition programs. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act mandated the appointment of a senior official to oversee the development and fielding of directed energy weapons capabilities. This official is responsible for coordinating efforts across military departments and engaging with defense and private industries to accelerate the development of directed energy technologies. The senior official designated under the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act is responsible for providing technical advice and support to entities in the Department of Defense for exercises and demonstrations related to directed energy weapons. They also coordinate with military departments to define requirements for directed energy capabilities addressing warfighting capability gaps. The Secretary of Defense ensures availability of information for this purpose. The High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office of the Department of Defense is now the Joint Directed Energy Transition Office, assisting the senior official designated under the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act in coordinating departmental directed energy efforts and accessing relevant information. The Secretary may allocate funds for research, technology development, and support for directed energy systems. The Congressional Directed Energy Caucus urged the Secretary of Defense to appoint a senior official for the development of directed energy weapon systems. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act designates the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering as the official responsible for developing and demonstrating directed energy weapons. This aims to standardize technical requirements and accelerate technology development for acquisition programs. The Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 is amended to establish a program for prototyping and demonstrating directed energy weapon systems to maintain military superiority. The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering will lead this program to counter potential adversaries' technological advantages. The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering will lead a program for developing prototypes and demonstrating operational utility of high energy lasers and high powered microwave weapon systems. Guidelines will be issued for the program, including criteria for funding applications and priorities for fielding prototype directed energy weapon system technologies. The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering will lead a program for developing prototypes and demonstrating operational utility of high energy lasers and high powered microwave weapon systems. Funding for the program may only be used for advanced technology development, prototyping, and demonstrations managed by the Department of Defense with a focus on technology transition and military utility. Applications for funding will be solicited annually from military departments, defense agencies, and combatant commands. The program led by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering focuses on developing prototypes and demonstrating the operational utility of high energy lasers and high powered microwave weapon systems. Funding for the program is designated for advanced technology development, prototyping, and demonstrations managed by the Department of Defense, with an emphasis on technology transition and military utility. The program may enter into contracts for prototyping or commercialization of technologies, with restrictions on funding related to congressional earmarks or directed spending items. The Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering has up to $100,000,000 available for fiscal year 2018 to allocate to military departments, defense agencies, and combatant commands for a program focused on directed energy weapons. The Under Secretary must develop a strategic plan and submit it to congressional defense committees before allocating half of the funds. The FY2017 and FY2018 legislative provisions for DOD include designating a senior official for DE efforts, formulating a DE strategy, accelerating activities, and establishing a prototyping program. This may impact Army DE programs and require adjustments to management approaches for DE weapons. High Energy Lasers (HELs) are highlighted as a type of DE weapon. High Energy Lasers (HELs) are a type of Directed Energy (DE) weapon that produce narrow beams of monochromatic light for precise energy focusing. HELs come in three primary types: chemical lasers, solid-state lasers, and free electron lasers. These lasers require target tracking, laser pointing, thermal management, and beam control systems to effectively deliver laser energy to targets over operational distances. Chemical lasers are currently the only DE systems capable of achieving the power needed to intercept targets like ballistic missiles. High Energy Lasers (HELs) are Directed Energy (DE) weapons that produce precise beams of light for targeting. Chemical lasers have been the basis for DOD's most mature HEL concepts, using exothermic reactions to create lasing medium. Solid-State Lasers (SSLs) are also used in military applications, with low-power versions found in consumer products. Solid-State Lasers (SSLs) are utilized in various military applications, including target range finders, imagers, target designators, and the DOD's Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) defensive system. SSLs use ceramic or glass-like solids as their lasing media. Free Electron Lasers (FELs) accelerate electron beams to near light speed in accelerator rings and can tune their beams to different wavelengths for better transmission in maritime environments. FELs are of interest to the Navy for their potential to interdict hardened targets like ballistic missile reentry vehicles. High Powered Microwaves (HPMs) are large and inefficient weapons that emit short pulses of microwave radiation at high output levels. These weapons could target specific locations or degrade electronic components over wider areas. The effects of HPM applications range from disrupting electronic systems to physically damaging systems not shielded against the electromagnetic fields. Unlike lasers, HPM beams cannot be tightly focused, leading to a decrease in energy over distance. High Powered Microwaves (HPMs) emit short pulses of microwave radiation at high output levels, with a decrease in energy over distance. HPM weapons could affect all unshielded electronic systems within their beam spots, imposing operational limitations compared to longer-range laser weapons. Radio-frequency weapons propagate bursts of energy at microwave or lower frequencies to disable or destroy electronics, but they are not truly \"directed\" energy weapons. High Powered Microwaves (HPMs) are a form of directed energy weapons that emit short pulses of microwave radiation. However, there are uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of HPM weapons due to the absorption of microwaves by moisture in the air and the difficulty in predicting the damage they could cause. Countermeasures such as surrounding sensitive electronics with a Faraday cage can mitigate the impact of HPM weapons. The classified nature of most Department of Defense (DOD) HPM programs hinders public and academic examination of these programs. The lethality of a laser weapon is determined by power level, wavelength, and optical dimensions, which are traded off in designing an integrated system. Shorter wavelengths allow for less power or smaller optical dimensions while still achieving desired lethality, but atmospheric turbulence effects are more pronounced. The lethality of laser weapons is determined by power level, wavelength, and optical dimensions. Shorter wavelengths allow for achieving desired lethality with less power, but atmospheric turbulence effects are more pronounced. Higher power or larger optics can achieve the same effect at longer wavelengths with less degradation from turbulence, but there are limits dictated by physical laws. High power output can lead to beam degradation and exceed optical system tolerances, resulting in system failure. The high-power microwave \"bomb\" (HPM) is a significant offensive application of directed energy likely to be available in the near-term. An HPM weapon uses explosive charge to create a pulsed-power source for disrupting electronic systems. It can attack multiple targets simultaneously, even when turned off, by damaging electronic circuits and components. The only defense is complete isolation from energy sources. HPM weapons use electromagnetic pulses to disrupt electronic systems from a distance, offering reduced collateral damage and tunable effects on the target. Common military applications include detection, targeting, medical treatment, and communications. HELs are used for ground-based defense against rockets, artillery, and mortars. High-Power Microwave (HPM) weapons disrupt electronic systems with electromagnetic pulses, offering precise effects on targets. Directed Energy (DE) weapons, like High-Energy Lasers (HEL), have features such as beams traveling at the speed of light, unaffected by gravity or atmospheric drag, enabling accurate and rapid target engagement. High-Energy Lasers (HEL) weapons offer precise and customizable effects on targets, allowing for surgical strikes with minimal collateral damage. They are cost-effective compared to conventional munitions, making them a viable option for intercepting threats. High-Energy Lasers (HEL) weapons offer cost-effective precision targeting capabilities, with the ability to conduct repetitive engagements over time. They can also serve as sensors, detecting, imaging, tracking, and illuminating targets. However, HEL weapons have constraints such as power dissipation in adverse weather conditions and the limitation of traveling in straight lines. High-Energy Lasers (HEL) weapons have limitations in adverse weather conditions and cannot shoot beyond their visual horizon. Power requirements and heat generation constrain the type of platform needed for HEL weapons. Mounting HELs on ground combat vehicles is a challenge due to size and power constraints. Hand-held laser weapons face difficulties in power generation and cooling requirements. High-Power Microwave (HPM) weapons can disrupt electronic devices and destroy electronic targets. High-Power Microwave (HPM) weapons can destroy electronic targets and cause discomfort to humans. They have the potential to limit collateral damage and friendly fire casualties, making them attractive in non-lethal situations. However, HPM beams have constraints such as limited focus compared to lasers, decreased energy over distance, and the need to shield friendly systems to avoid collateral damage. Conductive materials can also absorb HPM beams, reducing their effectiveness."
