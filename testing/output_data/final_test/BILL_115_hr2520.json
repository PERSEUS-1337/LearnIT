The BROWSER Act of 2017 requires providers of covered services to give clear and conspicuous notice of their privacy policies to users.

The notice must be persistently available, and providers must inform users of any material changes to their policies. A provider of a covered service must give users advance notice of any material changes to their privacy policies, which should be clear and conspicuous. Users must be given the option to opt-in or opt-out based on the sensitivity of their information. (a) Opt-In Approval Required for Sensitive User Information. A provider must obtain opt-in approval from a user to use sensitive information. (b) Opt-Out Approval Required for Non-Sensitive User Information. A provider must obtain opt-out approval from a user to use non-sensitive information, unless they choose to obtain opt-in approval instead. (c) Limitations and Exceptions. Providers may use user information without user consent in certain circumstances.
