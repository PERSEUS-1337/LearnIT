It is divided into three titles: Emergency Assistance for Crop and Livestock Feed Losses Due to Disasters, Market Loss Assistance, and Administration. The Agriculture Disaster and Market Loss Assistance Act of 1998 ensures fair distribution of assistance to producers who suffered crop and livestock feed losses. The Secretary of Agriculture determines eligibility criteria and payment rates for assistance. The Agriculture Disaster and Market Loss Assistance Act of 1998 provides assistance for crop and livestock feed losses through various programs such as payments under the Agricultural Market Transition Act, crop insurance indemnities, and emergency loans under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. SEC. 102. CROP LOSS ASSISTANCE. The Secretary administers a program providing emergency financial assistance to producers on a farm who incurred losses from crop disasters. Assistance is available for losses in the 1998 crop or multiyear losses in 1998 and preceding crops of a commodity. Assistance is provided under either subsection (b) or (c). Assistance is available for crop losses due to quantity, quality, or severe economic losses from damaging weather. All crops are covered for losses due to disasters. The Secretary will not discriminate against producers with crop insurance and encourages future participation. The Secretary may use funds to provide premium refunds or assistance to purchasers of crop insurance for their 1998 insured crops. Producers who have not purchased crop insurance for 1998 must agree to purchase it for the subsequent 2 crops. Liquidated damages may apply.
