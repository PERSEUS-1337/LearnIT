Congress finds that every minute, one woman dies from pregnancy-related complications, with 95% of these deaths occurring in Africa and Asia. For every woman who dies, 15 to 30 women survive but may experience chronic disabilities, such as obstetric fistula. This condition is a life-shattering hole formed between the bladder and vagina or rectum and vagina after prolonged obstructed labor, leading to chronic incontinence for the woman. Pregnancy at an early age can lead to obstetric fistulae and permanent incontinence, with high maternal mortality rates in Ethiopia due to various factors like food taboos, poverty, early marriage, and complications from FGM. Treatment for obstetric fistula is limited, with only one hospital in Addis Ababa performing over 1,000 operations a year. Obstetric fistula is a condition that affects women who survive obstructed labor, resulting in stillborn babies and physical, social, and emotional trauma for the mother. Symptoms include incontinence, frequent infections, infertility, and a foul odor, leading to stigmatization in many communities. Fistula is a hidden problem among marginalized women in remote areas, often left untreated due to social isolation and lack of awareness. Adolescents are at higher risk of complications during childbirth leading to fistula due to limited access to healthcare and other risk factors. There are over 2 million women living with fistula, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases annually. Many suffer in silence without seeking treatment. Fistula has been eradicated in developed regions but remains a significant issue in marginalized communities. Obstetric fistula is preventable through trained medical attendants during labor, access to emergency care, delaying early marriage, education, and family planning. Surgical repair by trained surgeons has a success rate of 90% and costs around $300. The UNFPA launched a global Campaign to End Fistula in 2003. The Campaign to End Fistula supports projects in over 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, identifying the problem, developing strategies, and implementing activities to prevent and treat fistula. The US Government provided $21.5 million in 2001 and allocated $25 million in 2006 to UNFPA. The US Government allocated $25,000,000 for UNFPA to support maternal health initiatives in over 79 countries. In 2001, additional funding of $600,000 was pledged to address reproductive health care needs of Afghan refugees. Congress showed bipartisan support for voluntary contributions to UNFPA. The US allocated $34,000,000 for UNFPA in 2002, but the funds were not used. A delegation sent by the President to investigate UNFPA in China found no evidence of coercive abortion practices. The US allocated $34,000,000 for UNFPA in 2002, but the funds were not used. A delegation found no evidence of UNFPA supporting coercive abortion practices in China. Despite the delegation's recommendation to release the funds, the Administration eliminated funding for UNFPA. The United States authorizes $34,000,000 annually for voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) specifically for preventing and treating obstetric fistula."
