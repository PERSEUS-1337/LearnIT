    "content": "Wheat is grown in many countries across North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The top wheat-producing countries include China, India, the United States, Russia, Canada, and Australia. The United States is a leading wheat exporter, producing all major wheat classes such as hard red winter, hard red spring, soft red winter, hard white, soft white, and durum. Different wheat varieties are used for specific products like bread, noodles, crackers, and pastries. Wheat is the principal food grain grown in the United States, with a substantial portion used as feed grain. Local market demand and quality determine wheat prices, with traditional, higher-protein wheats commanding a premium. Wheat competes with other cereals for consumer consumption and with coarse grains in livestock feed markets. The U.S. wheat crop is heavily reliant on exports, with white wheat and HRS wheat being major players in export markets. Flour millers are the main users of wheat domestically, sourcing based on location and quality attributes like protein content and baking performance. Price premiums and discounts based on quality differences influence buyer preferences. Other wheat processors include breakfast food, pet food, and feed manufacturers. Wheat can also be used directly in feed rations. In 2007, Australia, the United States, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and some countries of the former Soviet Union experienced reduced wheat production and quality due to severe drought, freeze damage, heavy rains, and dry weather. This led to decreased wheat and corn crops in southeastern Europe, forcing EU livestock producers to import wheat and feed grains. Canada and Ukraine also faced smaller wheat crops due to poor weather conditions. In 2007, Canada and Ukraine experienced reduced wheat crops due to poor weather conditions, leading to export restrictions by Ukraine and Argentina to control food price inflation. The EU's wheat exports slowed as wheat replaced corn for feed. Only the United States, Russia, and Kazakhstan had large volumes of wheat available for export, with Kazakhstan also planning to slow export pace due to declining supplies. In late 2007, U.S. wheat export sales were strong despite higher prices and record-high ocean freight rates. Importers, including low- and middle-income countries, continued to purchase wheat even as prices rose, fearing future scarcity and higher prices. U.S. wheat export shipments in 2007 exceeded expectations every month, rising during the winter, spring, and summer months when they typically decline. In August and September, U.S. wheat export volume spiked to over 4 million tons as prices reached record highs. Outstanding export sales indicate future shipments will remain high despite price fluctuations. Global wheat stocks are projected to hit a 30-year low by July 2008 due to years of consumption surpassing production. The U.S. faces the lowest ending wheat stocks in nearly three decades due to decreased planted area and production. The surge in export demand has led to projections for the lowest ending wheat stocks since 1947. Prices for high-protein spring wheat have risen faster than prices for ordinary-protein wheats. Market concern about a large U.S. spring wheat crop being produced has increased, leading to record high prices for HRS wheat. In 2008, HRS wheat prices reached a record high of $24 per bushel. Prices for soft white wheat have also increased due to limited supplies from Australia. The decline in U.S. wheat planted area over the past 40 years has led to higher prices. China and other Asian countries are competing for dwindling supplies of white wheat, pushing prices up. The development of short-season corn and soybean varieties in the Northern Plains has reduced traditional wheat areas. High corn and soybean prices, driven by corn-based ethanol production, are causing wheat prices to rise in order to compete for planted acres. USDA projects an increase in planted acreage for wheat and soybeans in 2008, while corn plantings are expected to decline slightly. USDA projects a slight decline in corn plantings and a 13% increase in U.S. wheat production. Global wheat plantings and output are also expected to rise substantially. This will lead to lower international demand for U.S. wheat and allow domestic wheat stocks to rebuild, causing wheat prices to decline from their early 2007 peaks. Higher production is expected to facilitate the return of prices to the $4 to $5 per bushel range. The rise in agricultural prices, along with high oil prices, has led to increased food inflation in the United States and globally. U.S. food prices rose by 4% in 2007, the highest one-year increase since 1990. Prices for cereals and bakery products also saw a 4.4% increase. The USDA predicts food price inflation for 2008 to be between 3% to 4%, with bakery goods expected to rise by 5.5% to 6.5%. Despite sharp increases in commodity prices, economists believe fuel costs have played a larger role in food price inflation. Retail food prices are less volatile than farm-level prices and tend to rise by a fraction of the change in farm prices due to various costs involved in the production process. High commodity prices impact international markets differently based on import dependence. Import-dependent developing countries face greater food security risks due to the higher cost of imported commodities. The overall impact of higher food prices on consumers depends on the proportion of income spent on food. Low-income consumers are more affected by food price increases as they spend a larger portion of their income on food. This can lead to hardship, especially in developing countries that rely on food imports. Humanitarian groups are concerned about the impact of higher grain prices on global hunger, with the United States providing international food aid as a major response. In 2006, the United States provided $2.1 billion in food aid to 65 countries, delivering over 3 million metric tons of agricultural commodities, with more than half going to Sub-Saharan Africa. Rising food prices affect the amount of commodities that can be purchased through fixed annual appropriations for food aid."
