    "content": "Deep neural networks struggle with scarce data and quick task adaptation. Recent meta-learning work aims to train a meta-learner on similar tasks for generalization. Proposed generic meta-learner architectures use temporal convolutions and soft attention for information aggregation and pinpointing. In extensive meta-learning experiments, the Simple Neural AttentIve Learner (SNAIL) achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks in supervised and reinforcement learning. Meta-learning aims to enhance learning by training on a distribution of related tasks, enabling quick adaptation and improved performance with limited data. Meta-learning involves training a meta-learner on a distribution of similar tasks to learn a strategy that generalizes to unseen tasks. Recent meta-learning methods show improved performance but may be hand-designed for specific applications, lacking flexibility to adapt to a wide range of tasks. Meta-learning requires a flexible meta-learner with an expressive model architecture to learn various strategies across different domains. A proposed model architecture, Simple Neural Attentive Learner (SNAIL), combines temporal convolutions and causal attention to improve the meta-learner's ability to aggregate contextual information and pinpoint specific details from past experiences. SNAIL is evaluated on benchmarked meta-learning tasks like Omniglot and mini-Imagenet datasets, as well as multi-armed bandits and tabular tasks. SNAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance in various domains, outperforming domain-specific methods. Meta-learning aims for generalization across tasks, with each task defined by inputs, outputs, loss function, transition distribution, and episode length. The meta-learner's goal is to minimize expected loss with respect to its parameters. The meta-learner's objective is to minimize expected loss with respect to its parameters by optimizing over tasks sampled from a training distribution. During testing, it is evaluated on unseen tasks from a similar distribution. The approach aims for universality and versatility in both supervised and reinforcement learning domains. The approach of using dilated 1D convolutions over the temporal dimension allows for more direct access to past information compared to traditional RNNs, enabling more sophisticated computation on a stream of inputs. Soft attention, as used by BID28, allows models to pinpoint specific information from a potentially infinite context by treating it as an unordered key-value store. This approach contrasts with dilated 1D convolutions, which provide access to past information but have limitations in scaling to long sequences due to exponential dilation rates. Soft attention lacks positional dependence, which can be undesirable in reinforcement learning scenarios. SNAIL is a model in reinforcement learning that combines temporal convolutions and attention to provide high-bandwidth access over past experiences without constraints. By using attention at multiple stages, SNAIL can learn what information to pick out and create a feature representation that is easier to train. SNAIL architectures, like LSTM or GRUs, are easier to train and can process entire sequences in a single forward pass. The model combines temporal convolutions and attention for high-bandwidth access to past experiences in reinforcement learning. It can efficiently handle supervised settings by receiving input sequences of example-label pairs and making predictions based on previous labeled data. SNAIL architectures, similar to LSTM or GRUs, can process sequences in a single pass. They combine temporal convolutions and attention for accessing past experiences in reinforcement learning. The model handles supervised settings by receiving input sequences of example-label pairs and making predictions based on previous labeled data. In reinforcement-learning scenarios, it outputs action distributions based on observations, actions, and rewards, maintaining memory across episodes. The architecture uses building blocks applied to input matrices, with the option of employing convolutional networks for image inputs. The SNAIL architecture, similar to LSTM or GRUs, processes sequences in a single pass by combining temporal convolutions and attention. Techniques like batch normalization, residual connections, and dense connections have been found to improve the expressive capacity and training speed of SNAILs. No specific choice of residual/dense configurations was deemed essential for good performance. A dense block applies a single causal 1D-convolution with dilation rate R and D filters, using a gated activation function. Meta-learning, pioneered by Naik & Mammone in 1992, explores the tradeoff between performance and generality in recent approaches. BID5 experimented with LSTM for algorithmic tasks but found them inadequate. They then developed a more sophisticated RNN architecture with an LSTM controller coupled to an external memory bank for improved performance. Meta-learning has evolved with the introduction of memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) that outperform LSTMs. BID19 compared LSTM and MANN meta-learners for few-shot image classification, highlighting the limitations of LSTM. Specialized neural network architectures like Siamese networks and attention kernels have shown promise in few-shot classification tasks. Approach to BID30 based on Euclidean distance metrics is effective for classification but not suitable for reinforcement learning. Meta-learning aims for a learner not limited to a specific problem type. BID0 and BID14 explored learning to optimize with a meta-learner using gradients of the learner for optimization. Their LSTM-based meta-learner learned a gradient-based optimization strategy, but its superiority over existing methods is uncertain. Optimizers are superior to SGD-based methods. Ravi & Larochelle (2017) introduced a LSTM meta-learner for few-shot classification, with a convolutional-network-based classifier as the traditional learner. The meta-learning algorithm involves training the initial parameters of the traditional learner for fast gradient-based adaptation, while the LSTM meta-learner is trained as an optimization algorithm for meta-learning tasks. BID3 explored a case where the meta-learner is restricted to using ordinary gradient descent, resulting in equivalent performance to the more complex models. BID15 investigated a refined weight update scheme for minor performance enhancements in few-shot classification. These methods are domain independent. SNAIL introduces a generic architecture for meta-learning that can learn algorithms exploiting domain-specific task structures. BID2, BID31, and BID3 explored meta-learning in reinforcement-learning domains using traditional RNN architectures. BID3 also experimented with fast adaptation of policies in continuous control tasks. In Section 5.2, SNAIL is benchmarked against MAML and LSTM-based meta-learners on tasks considered by these works. SNAIL is compared to MAML and LSTM-based meta-learners on various meta-learning tasks. The study aims to understand SNAIL's performance across different tasks, its scalability with high-dimensional inputs and long-term dependencies, and its effectiveness in few-shot classification scenarios. Omniglot and mini-ImageNet datasets are used as standard benchmarks for few-shot image classification in supervised meta-learning. Omniglot dataset contains black-and-white images of handwritten characters from 50 languages, with 1632 classes and 20 instances per class. Mini-ImageNet dataset has 84x84 color images from 100 classes with 600 instances per class. Data augmentation techniques were applied to create new classes. The evaluation involves sampling N classes and K examples per class for the N-way, K-shot problem. The study tested SNAIL on 5-way Omniglot, 20-way Omniglot, and 5-way mini-ImageNet datasets by training on episodes with K shots chosen randomly from 1 to 5. The loss function was the average cross-entropy between predicted and true labels on the (N K + 1)-th timestep. The SNAIL and embedding network were trained end-to-end using Adam BID11. Table 1 displays the results of SNAIL on 5-way and 20-way Omniglot, as well as 5-way mini-ImageNet datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. A number of ablations were conducted to analyze SNAIL's performance, showing high classification accuracies across different tasks. Reinforcement learning presents unique challenges compared to supervised learning, such as long-term temporal dependencies and the need to balance exploration and exploitation. SNAIL's performance was evaluated on various domains in meta-RL to assess its ability to learn RL algorithms. In meta-RL, RL algorithms are evaluated on four different domains: multi-armed bandits, tabular MDPs, and visual navigation tasks. The agent must balance exploration and exploitation in each domain to optimize its performance. The curr_chunk discusses the use of meta-learning in deep RL tasks, specifically focusing on simulated locomotion tasks with complex dynamics but narrow task distribution. It compares a SNAIL model with LSTM and MAML meta-learning baselines. The optimal strategy involves task identification rather than traditional RL algorithms. The curr_chunk introduces MAML, a method for training policy parameters to achieve maximal performance after one gradient update on a new task. It discusses conducting ablation experiments and training meta-learners using TRPO with GAE. The true utility of a meta-learner lies in learning specialized algorithms for specific task distributions. The curr_chunk discusses the meta-learner's ability to learn specialized algorithms for specific task distributions, demonstrated in visual navigation and continuous control domains. In bandit experiments, the meta-learner outperforms the Gittins index oracle by providing a discrete probability distribution over arms. In bandit experiments, a meta-learner can outperform the Gittins index oracle for smaller N by choosing to exploit sooner. Testing was done with different combinations of N and K values, with results reported in Table 3. Training MAML was computationally expensive for larger N values, so those results were omitted. The best performing method was highlighted in Table 3, along with others whose performance was not statistically significantly different. In bandit experiments, meta-learners can outperform the Gittins index oracle by exploiting sooner. Testing with different N and K values showed varying results. MAML training was computationally expensive for larger N values. The best method was highlighted in Table 3, along with others whose performance was not significantly different. The meta-learners interacted with MDPs with 10 states and 5 actions, following a normal distribution for rewards and flat Dirichlet distribution for transitions. Input included one-hot encodings of state and action, previous reward, and termination flag. PSRL BID24 is a Bayesian method estimating belief over MDP parameters. In bandit experiments, meta-learners can outperform the Gittins index oracle by exploiting sooner. The meta-learners interacted with MDPs with 10 states and 5 actions, following a normal distribution for rewards and flat Dirichlet distribution for transitions. PSRL BID24 is a Bayesian method estimating belief over MDP parameters. For each of the N episodes, it samples an MDP from the current posterior and acts optimally for the rest of the episode. Different algorithms like OPSRL BID17 and UCRL2 BID10 were tested, with -greedy acting optimally against the MAP estimate according to the current posterior. Performance was normalized by the value iteration upper bound, with N values ranging from 10 to 100. In experiments with simulated robots, SNAIL and LSTM learning curves are compared for different tasks involving a planar cheetah and a 3D-quadruped ant. The robots have to run in a specific direction or at a certain velocity, with rewards based on velocity magnitude or goal achievement. Observations include joint angles and velocities, with actions being joint torques. BID3 trained policies on four task distributions for ant and cheetah, using 20 episodes (40 for ant) of 200 timesteps each. SNAIL and LSTM were trained on these tasks without updating parameters at test time. Two episodes were enough for meta-learners to adapt to a task. Performance did not improve with longer unrolling. Oracle policies were trained separately for each task, showing average performance in Figure 4. The average performance of oracle policies for each task distribution is shown as an upper bound on a meta-learner's performance. MAML applies a general-purpose strategy to a distribution of tasks, while SNAIL and LSTM specialize themselves based on shared task structure. SNAIL can exploit common task structure to perform optimally within a few timesteps. SNAIL was evaluated on a challenging navigation task in a maze using visual inputs. The agent received first-person images and could take actions like step forward or turn left/right. Training and test datasets were created with randomly generated mazes. Agents received rewards for reaching the target and were encouraged to reach it faster. SNAIL agent explores maze in first episode and goes directly to goal in second episode. SNAIL solves mazes the fastest and improves the most. SNAIL agent solves mazes the fastest and improves the most from the first to second episode using a simple neural attentive learner (SNAIL) architecture. This architecture combines temporal convolutions and causal attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance on meta-learning tasks in supervised and reinforcement learning. SNAIL architecture, designed for meta-learning, could excel in sequence-to-sequence tasks like language modeling or translation. Future work may explore training a meta-learner with lifelong memory to learn faster and generalize better. The SNAIL architecture used for both Omniglot and mini-Imagenet tasks, with a specific sequence length formula for the N-way, K-shot problem. The SNAIL architecture used specific sequence lengths for N-way, K-shot problems in Omniglot and mini-Imagenet tasks. Different network architectures were used for each dataset to prevent underfitting and make better use of SNAIL's expressive capacity. The SNAIL architecture used a deeper embedding network to prevent underfitting. A smaller version of the ResNet BID6 architecture was used, with ablations conducted to investigate the contribution of different components to SNAIL's performance. Both TC and attention layers were found to be essential for maximal performance, with the combination yielding the best results. Using only TC layers resulted in similar 1-shot performance but worse 5-shot performance compared to the full model. In Section 3, it was discussed how temporal convolutions have coarser access to inputs farther back in time, even at sequence length 26. SNAIL's improved performance is not solely due to the deeper embedding network. Ablations conducted on the few-shot classification task showed that both temporal convolutions and attention are essential for optimal performance. Replacing SNAIL with stacked LSTM with varied layers and sizes yielded 78.1% and 90.8% accuracy on 1-shot and 5-shot tasks in 5-way Omniglot dataset, but was unsuccessful on miniImagenet. SNAIL with shallow mini-Imagenet embedding achieved 45.1% and 55.2% accuracy on 5-way mini-Imagenet in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks. MAML BID3 overfits with 30.1% and 75.2% accuracy on 1-shot mini-Imagenet. SNAIl, a generalization of BID30, experimented with multiple parallel reads and achieved equivalent performance on 5-way and 20-way Omniglot datasets. On 5-way mini-Imagenet, it reached 49.9% and 63.9% accuracy in 1-shot tasks. On 5-way Omniglot, SNAIL achieved 98.8% and 99.2% accuracy in 1-shot and 5-shot tasks. Feature representation analysis showed 65.1% and 67.1% accuracy for Euclidean distance and 67.7% and 68.3% for cosine on 5-way Omniglot. The strategy learned by SNAIL appears more sophisticated than distance metrics. In investigating SNAIL sensitivity to architectural design choices, random permutations of components were sampled. Architectures with 13 layers were trained on 5-way Omniglot, achieving 98.62% \u00b1 0.13% and 99.71% \u00b1 0.08% for 1-shot and 5-shot tasks. The classification strategy learned by SNAIL was explored in terms of dataset transferability between domains. The transferability of the algorithm and feature representation learned was tested by freezing SNAIL weights from Omniglot and re-learning an embedding for mini-Imagenet, achieving 50.62% and 62.34% on 1-shot and 5-shot tasks. Reversing the process with mini-Imagenet weights led to 98.66% and 99.56% accuracy on Omniglot. Combining embeddings from both datasets with a SNAIL model achieved 98.5% and 99.5% accuracy on 5-way Omniglot tasks. These results indicate strong transferability of the learned features. The algorithm and feature representation learned by SNAIL show strong transferability. Future work could involve learning embeddings for multiple datasets in an unsupervised manner with distributional constraints. For reinforcement learning, the total trajectory length is determined by the number of timesteps. The architecture used for multi-arm bandits and tabular MDPs includes fully connected layers shared between the policy and value function, followed by specific blocks for each function. The architecture for reinforcement learning tasks includes fully connected layers shared between policy and value function, with specific blocks for each function. Attention blocks were found to have no impact on bandit problems, but were crucial for learning to solve MDPs. Image observations are preprocessed using a convolutional architecture with two layers. The architecture for reinforcement learning tasks includes fully connected layers shared between policy and value function, with specific blocks for each function. For the policy, TCBlock and AttentionBlock were used, while for the value function, TCBlock was utilized. Trust-region policy optimization with generalized advantage estimation was employed for training. Hyperparameters were adjusted for different tasks, with potential for further tuning to improve performance. An SNAIL agent without attention layers was also considered. When applied to the bandit domain, the TC-only model performed as well as a complete SNAIL due to the task's simplicity. However, it struggled in the MDP domain, indicating the need for a more sophisticated algorithm. The results are compared with other agents in a table, showing suboptimality in internalizing past experience. A SNAIL agent without TC layers was also evaluated for RL tasks. The SNAIL agent without TC layers, using only attention, struggled to solve bandit or MDP tasks. Despite experimenting with multiple attention blocks and heads, the model's performance was no better than random. The lack of TC layers hindered the agent's ability to process sequential information effectively. TC layers are crucial for allowing the agent to analyze contiguous parts of a sequence and produce a better contextual representation for attention."
