    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preventing Affinity Scams for Seniors Act of 2010\" or the \"PASS Act of 2010\". The Congress recognizes the increasing financial exploitation of the elderly, who are often targeted for their assets. Those with cognitive impairments or disabilities may be especially vulnerable to fraud and scams by both strangers and loved ones. Elderly individuals, especially those with cognitive impairments, are at risk of financial exploitation by caregivers or trusted individuals, leading to theft or fraud. Affinity scams target seniors through trusted relationships, resulting in significant financial losses each year. Elder financial abuse, often linked with other forms of abuse, poses a threat to the health, dignity, and economic security of older Americans. Financial exploitation of elders, often by family members or caregivers, can have devastating effects on the victims. Elder financial abuse leads to emotional distress, increased risk of depression, decreased quality of life, and unnecessary institutionalization. The financial services industry is in a unique position to detect changes in customer patterns that may indicate financial abuse. The financial services industry can detect changes in customer patterns to protect customers and uphold trust relationships with clients. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms including \"affinity scam\" as a fraud targeting seniors, \"financial institution\" as a bank, credit union, or thrift institution, and \"senior\" as an individual aged 65 or older. Financial institutions must educate staff on identifying affinity scams and train them to educate seniors. They must also provide educational materials to seniors on recognizing affinity scams. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection will issue regulations and audit institutions for compliance. SEC. 5. SENIOR PROTECTION ACCOUNTS. Each financial institution must offer seniors a \"senior protection account\" for safeguarding against affinity scams. If a transaction request is flagged as potentially fraudulent, the institution must not process it and conduct an investigation to verify its legitimacy. Financial institutions must notify seniors of potentially fraudulent transactions and conduct investigations to verify legitimacy, especially in cases of affinity scams. If deemed part of a scam, seniors must be informed and the transaction referred for further action. Financial institutions must designate a staff person to handle identifying potentially fraudulent transactions. If a transaction is not part of an affinity scam, the senior must be notified and the transaction processed within 7 business days unless instructed otherwise. Financial institutions must designate a staff person to identify potentially fraudulent transactions, including those possibly part of an affinity scam. Failure to process or refer a transaction to law enforcement as required will not hold the institution liable under any law or regulation. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue necessary regulations, and a tax deduction will be established through regulation. A tax deduction of 0.77 percent of average deposits held in senior protection accounts is established for financial institutions under the Internal Revenue Code. Failure to comply with the regulations will result in civil liability to seniors for actual damages and attorneys' fees. Attorneys' fees are awarded in successful actions to enforce liability under the Act. Financial institutions are prohibited from discriminating against seniors in fees or charges related to implementing the Act. Adding affinity scams targeting seniors to the suspicious transaction reporting requirement. Section 5318(g)(1) of title 31, United States Code is amended to require reporting of suspicious transactions related to possible affinity scams targeting seniors by financial institutions and their personnel. An affinity scam involves a trusted person defrauding a senior by establishing a relationship based on shared interests or values. The term \"senior\" refers to the targeted individual in this type of scam. The term 'senior' in this context refers to an individual who is at least 65 years of age. The Act and its amendments will take effect after a 6-month period from the date of enactment."
