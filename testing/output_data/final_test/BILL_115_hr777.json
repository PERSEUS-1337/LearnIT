    "content": "DEFINITIONS: Administrator refers to the head of the EPA. Mid-level ethanol blend contains 10-20% ethanol for use in gasoline-powered vehicles. The Administrator, through the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development at the EPA, must enter an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences for a comprehensive assessment of mid-level ethanol blends compared to gasoline blends. A report must be submitted to specific committees within 30 days of receiving the assessment results. The assessment under subsection (a)(1) will evaluate the environmental, safety, durability, and performance effects of mid-level ethanol blends on various engines and vehicles, considering scientific evidence and certification fuel impacts. The assessment will evaluate the effects of mid-level ethanol blends on engines and vehicles, identifying gaps in understanding and research needs related to various emissions, durability, diagnostics, fuel efficiency, consumer satisfaction, and catalyst durability. The assessment will identify research needs to ensure existing motor fuel infrastructure is not adversely impacted by mid-level ethanol blends, including examining potential impacts on materials used in pipes and storage tanks. It will also focus on reducing misfueling risks at various points in the distribution and supply chain. The assessment will focus on preventing misfueling by examining mitigation strategies for blender pumps, assessing approved misfueling mitigation plans, and considering recommendations from various organizations regarding fuel pump labeling. Prior to the report submission, any waivers allowing mid-level ethanol blends for motor vehicles will be invalid. No new waivers will be granted until after the report is submitted. The Administrator can use up to $900,000 from EPA funds for science and technology, including research and development, to implement the Act."
