    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Broadening Participation in STEM Education Act\" and includes findings related to STEM education. The Congress finds that STEM education at the undergraduate level is crucial for the US to maintain its global economic leadership. Underrepresented minority groups make up a significant portion of the college-age population but are underrepresented in STEM fields. Despite having an interest in pursuing STEM undergraduate degrees, underrepresented minority students have lower completion rates compared to White and Asian students. Only 22.1% of Latino students, 18.4% of African-American students, and 18.8% of Native American students complete their STEM degrees within 5 years, while White and Asian students have a 33% and 42% completion rate, respectively. In specific STEM fields, underrepresented minorities earned only 13% of all engineering degrees in 2009, despite making up 33% of the college-age population. Underrepresented minority groups make up 29% of the US population, but only 8% of tenure-track science and engineering faculty members at universities are from these groups. Less than 1% of faculty at the top 100 research universities are from underrepresented minorities. This lack of representation can hinder social integration and success for minority students in STEM disciplines. The lack of representation of underrepresented minority groups in STEM faculty positions hinders social integration and success for minority students in STEM disciplines. Connecting students and faculty members from underrepresented minority groups has been successful in increasing the achievement level of these students in STEM fields. The United States faces a demographic challenge in STEM education, with a projected increase in the college-age population from underrepresented minority groups by 2050. If the percentage of underrepresented minority students earning bachelor's degrees in STEM fields does not increase significantly, the US will face a shortfall in the overall number of STEM graduates. The United States may lose its competitive edge in the global economy if citizens of other countries continue to earn STEM degrees, leading to a diminishing comparative advantage in the US STEM workforce. The text chunk discusses foundation support for broadening participation in undergraduate STEM education. The Director awards grants to institutions of higher education for research-based reforms in undergraduate STEM education to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, supporting activities like innovative approaches, mentoring programs, and outreach programs. The Director awards grants to institutions of higher education for research-based reforms in undergraduate STEM education to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students. This includes implementing or expanding outreach programs, faculty development programs, mechanisms to recognize and reward faculty members, and successful reforms to increase the number of STEM students from underrepresented minority groups. Expansion of opportunities for underrepresented minority students in STEM research, including stipends and support for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to participate in instructional activities at various institutions. The selection process for institutions of higher education seeking a grant under this section involves submitting an application to the Director with a description of the proposed reform effort and research findings supporting it. The curr_chunk describes the expansion of a previously implemented reform effort, including data on recruitment, retention, and academic achievement of underrepresented minority students. It also highlights the institutional commitment and support for the proposed reform, as well as existing or planned policies regarding faculty hiring and promotion. The curr_chunk discusses rewarding faculty contributions to improving education for underrepresented minority students in STEM and evaluating the success of proposed reform efforts. The Director will consider the likelihood of success of the reform effort when selecting grant recipients. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of institutional commitment to proposed reform efforts, the impact on institutional culture and policy, sustainability of the reform beyond the grant period, and the inclusion of evaluation and assessment plans. The Director prioritizes applications with senior institutional administrators as principal investigators and ensures grant distribution to various types of higher education institutions. All grants include an education research component for data collection and evaluation of reform efforts. The Director coordinates with relevant agencies to disseminate research results on increasing recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students in STEM education at the undergraduate level. Best practices are shared with higher education institutions, federal agencies, non-federal funders, and the general public. SEC. 4. Foundation support for increasing diversity among STEM faculty at institutions of higher education. The Director will award grants to institutions of higher education for innovative reform efforts to increase diversity in academic STEM careers through recruitment, retention, and advancement of underrepresented minority groups. Grants will be awarded based on merit review and competition, with funds used for activities like data analysis, policy review, and workload distribution improvements to support faculty members from underrepresented minority groups. Activities to support underrepresented minority groups in academic STEM careers include training courses for administrators and search committee members, workshops to share best practices in faculty recruitment and retention, professional development opportunities, and initiatives for undergraduate STEM students. Activities to support underrepresented minority groups in academic STEM careers include awareness programs for undergraduate students, engagement initiatives for exceptional graduate students, and other relevant activities determined by the Director. Institutions seeking funding must submit an application with required information and assurances. The institution of higher education must describe the proposed reform effort for recruiting, retaining, and advancing faculty members from underrepresented minority groups in STEM careers. They should also outline plans for sustaining the reform effort, and detail how its success will be evaluated. The proposed reform effort for recruiting, retaining, and advancing faculty members from underrepresented minority groups in STEM careers will be evaluated for its potential to catalyze institutional change and contribute to the national knowledge base. Grant recipients will be selected based on the likelihood of success in implementing the reform effort, commitment from institution administrators, and the impact on institutional culture and policy. The Director will ensure grants are awarded to various types of higher education institutions based on the value placed on recruiting, retaining, and advancing faculty from underrepresented minority groups, sustainability of reform efforts, and inclusion of evaluation plans in the design. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Director of the National Science Foundation, the Foundation itself, institutions of higher education, and STEM disciplines are defined in this Act."
