The program has expanded to include rural real estate owners, administered by the Rural Housing Service. The Housing Act of 1949 authorized USDA to provide loans and grants for housing improvements to farmers and rural real estate owners. Section 502 of the Act allows USDA to make housing loans for farm owners to construct or repair farm dwellings and other buildings. The report discusses funding issues for the guaranteed home loan program and includes tables showing funding for rural housing programs since FY1980. The Housing Act of 1949 authorized USDA to provide loans and grants for housing improvements to farmers and rural real estate owners. Section 502 of the Act allows USDA to make housing loans for farm owners to construct or repair farm dwellings and other buildings. Amendments over the years expanded the program to include nonfarm properties, previously-occupied dwellings, building sites, and homes on leased land. Today, the Section 502 program offers loans for the purchase or repair of new or existing single-family housing in rural areas, including the purchase of new manufactured homes. The USDA offers two types of home loans: direct loans for borrowers with income levels at or below 80% of the area median, and USDA-guaranteed loans from private lenders. These loans can be used for various housing purposes, including building, repairing, renovating, or relocating homes. Borrowers must have the means to repay the loans but be unable to secure reasonable credit terms elsewhere. There is no downpayment requirement, and the loans are repayable over a 33-year period. At least 40% of the funds must be allocated to families or individuals with incomes below 50% of the area median. The USDA offers two types of home loans: direct loans for borrowers with income levels at or below 80% of the area median, and USDA-guaranteed loans from private lenders. There is no downpayment requirement. Loans are repayable over a 33-year period, with the possibility of extension to 38 years for certain borrowers. Applicants must obtain Certificates of Eligibility from USDA to qualify for Section 502 mortgages. Borrowers' monthly contributions are based on their income and may be adjusted annually. The USDA Section 502 program offers loans for modest housing in rural areas, with cost limits set by each State Office. The program allows moderate income borrowers to obtain guaranteed loans for single-family homes, with income up to 115% of the area median. USDA Section 502 guaranteed loans are available for borrowers with income up to 115% of the area median to purchase homes in rural areas. Priority is given to first-time homebuyers, and borrowers may need to complete a homeownership counseling program. Loans have 30-year terms, fixed interest rates, and can be for up to 100% of the home's appraised value or sales price. Approved lending institutions offer these loans, with specific criteria for affordability. The USDA guarantees loans for refinancing existing Section 502 home loans with fixed interest rates. The property must be owned and occupied by the borrower as their principal residence. The USDA charges a one-time guarantee fee of 2% of the loan amount to the lender, which can be added to the mortgage. The guarantee fee for refinance transactions is 0.5% of the loan amount. The USDA guarantees Section 502 loans at 100% of the loss for the first 35% of the original loan, and 85% for the remaining 65%. The maximum loss payable by USDA is 90% of the original loan amount. No private mortgage insurance is required. There are no restrictions on home size or design, and amenities like garages and central air conditioning are allowed. In-ground swimming pools are permitted if not financed by the loan. Manufactured homes must be new and permanently installed. The lender and servicer for the direct program is USDA. The USDA serves as the lender and servicer for the direct program, while a private lender handles Section 502 guaranteed loans. Income limits are set at 80% of the median income for the direct program and 115% for the guaranteed program. Direct loan borrowers may receive interest rate subsidies, while guaranteed loan borrowers receive market interest rates. Home size restrictions apply to the direct program but not the guaranteed program. Borrowers in the direct program must demonstrate inability to secure credit elsewhere. The Section 504 program under the Housing Act of 1949 provides loans, grants, or a combination for farm dwellings and nonfarm homeowners with low incomes. Eligibility was expanded over the years, with current regulations allowing rural homeowners with incomes of 50% or less of the area median to qualify for USDA direct loans up to $20,000 at a 1% interest rate for home repairs. Homeowners aged 62 or older may qualify for grants of up to $7,500 for needed repairs. Elderly homeowners aged 62 or older may qualify for grants of up to $7,500 for home repairs if they lack the ability to repay the full cost. Depending on their income, they may be eligible for a combination of a loan and grant totaling no more than $20,000. USDA can address complaints about construction defects in Section 502 housing, offering grants to correct the issues within 18 months of completion. The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act amended Section 509 by adding subsection (f) which mandates set asides of some USDA lending authority. USDA is required to designate 100 counties and communities as \"targeted underserved areas\" each fiscal year. 5% of lending authority under Sections 502, 504, 515, and 524 must be reserved for assistance in targeted underserved areas, with priority given to Colonias. Additionally, Housing Application Packaging Grant (HAPG) was created under subsection (f). The Housing Act of 1961 added Section 514 to the Housing Act of 1949, providing loans for farm owners, associations, or nonprofit organizations to create living quarters for domestic farm laborers. Loans are repayable in 33 years at a 1% interest rate. Applicants must be unable to obtain financing elsewhere. USDA provides loans for housing and related facilities for domestic farm labor, available to farm owners, associations, nonprofit organizations, tribes, and government agencies. Applicants must demonstrate a need for farm labor housing, operate on a nonprofit basis, and show inability to provide housing from their own resources or obtain credit elsewhere. The USDA provides loans for farm labor housing to enable affordable rental rates for workers. Exceptions to the \"credit elsewhere\" test can be made for housing needs for migrant farm workers. The Section 516 program allows grants for development costs of farm labor housing. Applicants must have sufficient capital and demonstrate income to cover expenses, improvements, loan payments, and reserves. The USDA provides grants for up to two-thirds of the development cost of farm labor housing, with the possibility of grants up to 90% of the cost. The 1983 Housing Act prioritizes the needs of farm laborers in approving applications, and up to 10% of funds under Section 516 are reserved for nonprofit agencies assisting domestic and migrant farm workers. Nonprofit organizations, Indian tribes, and local or state agencies may qualify for Section 516 grants to provide low-rent housing for farm labor. Applicants must contribute at least 10% of the total development costs, and the housing must fulfill a pressing need in the area. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 expanded the definition of \"domestic farm labor\" to include those who earn a substantial income from agricultural work. USDA provides farm labor housing loans and grants to US citizens or permanent residents who earn income from agricultural work. Priority is given to active farm laborers, followed by retired or disabled farm laborers. Funds can be used for buying, building, or improving housing and related facilities for farm workers, as well as for land improvements. The Senior Citizens Housing Act of 1962 amended the Housing Act of 1949 to provide loans for rental housing for low- and moderate-income elderly individuals. Section 514 loans are available at 1% interest for up to 33 years, while Section 516 grants may cover up to 90% of the total development cost of the project. The law authorized USDA to make loans for rental housing for low- and moderate-income families in rural areas. Amendments expanded eligibility to include all low- and moderate-income families. Loans can also be used for congregate housing for the elderly and handicapped, with a 1% interest rate and 50-year repayment period. Borrowers must show they cannot afford housing without the loan. Rents are restricted, based on project costs and USDA approval. The Housing Act of 1949, as amended in 1987, allows borrowers to set project rents based on debt service and operating expenses. Section 515 housing with low-income tax credits may have occupancy restrictions, but vacant units can be filled by higher-income tenants to maintain financial viability. Section 521 of the Act established an interest subsidy program for low- and moderate-income homebuyers and nonprofit developers. The Housing Act of 1949, as amended in 1987, allows borrowers to set project rents based on debt service and operating expenses. Section 515 and nonprofit developers of rental housing (under Section 515) may obtain loans with interest rates subsidized to as low as 1%. Section 521 was amended in 1974 to authorize USDA to make rental assistance payments to owners of USDA-financed rental housing (Sections 515 or 514) on behalf of tenants unable to pay the USDA-approved rent with 25% of their income. Amendments in the 1983 Housing Act provide that rent payments by eligible families would equal the greater of (1) 30% of monthly adjusted family income, (2) 10% of monthly income, or (3) for welfare recipients, the portion of the family's welfare payment that is designated for housing costs. Borrowers must agree to operate the property on a limited profit or nonprofit basis. The term of the rental assistance agreement is 20 years for new construction projects. The Housing Act of 1949 allows borrowers to set project rents based on debt service and operating expenses. Nonprofit developers may obtain subsidized loans with interest rates as low as 1%. Section 523 allows nonprofit organizations to obtain two-year loans for land development for housing. The interest rate for these loans is 3%. Nonprofit sponsors may also receive technical assistance grants for program development. The program provides funds for technical and supervisory assistance to low-income families building their own homes. Families must contribute 700 hours of labor for each other. Applicants must show a need for self-help housing, ability to carry out responsibilities, and lack of funds from other sources. Moderate-income families may participate if unable to pay for homes built by contractors. TA funds cannot be used to hire construction workers or buy real estate or building materials. Under Section 523, private or public nonprofit corporations can get two-year site loans to purchase and develop land in rural areas for low- and moderate-income families. The land is subdivided into building sites and sold on a nonprofit basis. Sites must be sold to families using the mutual self-help method for home construction, usually financed through the Section 502 program. In 1979, Section 524 was added to provide direct loans for nonprofit organizations and Indian tribes to purchase and develop land for housing low- and moderate-income families. The Rural Housing Amendments of 1983 added Section 533 to the Housing Act of 1949, authorizing USDA to make grants for rehabilitating housing in rural areas owned by low- and very low-income families, rural rental properties, and rural cooperative housing. Applicants must have experience in low-income rural housing development or management. The Rural Housing Amendments of 1983 added Section 533 to the Housing Act of 1949, authorizing USDA to make grants for rehabilitating housing in rural areas owned by low- and very low-income families, rural rental properties, and rural cooperative housing. Applicants must have experience in low-income rural housing development, repair, and rehabilitation; or management indicating the ability to operate a program providing financial assistance for housing repair and rehabilitation. Homes must be located in rural areas and in need of housing preservation assistance. Assisted families must meet income restrictions and have occupied the property for at least one year prior to receiving assistance. USDA can provide grants to eligible public and private organizations to assist homeowners in repairing or rehabilitating their homes. USDA provides grants to assist homeowners in repairing or rehabilitating their homes by offering direct loans, grants, or interest rate reductions. Housing preservation activities include installation and repair of water systems, energy conservation materials, heating systems, electrical wiring, structural supports, roofs, siding, porches, accessibility modifications, and additions to alleviate overcrowding or health hazards. Repairs to manufactured homes or mobile homes are also covered. USDA offers grants for homeowners to repair or rehabilitate their homes, including improvements like painting, paneling, carpeting, air conditioning, landscaping, and kitchen upgrades. Additionally, Section 538 allows borrowers to obtain loans from private lenders for financing. Under the Section 538 program, borrowers can get loans from private lenders for multi-family housing development in rural areas. USDA guarantees to cover losses in case of borrower default. Eligible lenders include those approved by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, state or local housing finance agencies, and members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Eligible lenders for the Section 538 program include those approved by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, state or local housing finance agencies, and members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Lenders must apply to USDA for permission to participate, and eligibility must be verified annually. Eligible borrowers include public agencies, Indian tribes, individuals, partnerships, corporations, LLCs, and trusts, who must meet specific requirements to qualify for the program. Borrowers for the Section 538 program must meet specific requirements, including being in legal compliance with federal debt, being a U.S. citizen or legal resident, and contributing 2% of the loan amount as initial operating capital. Eligible uses of loan proceeds include new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition for special needs, land improvement, and related facilities development. The Section 538 program allows for various eligible uses of loan proceeds, including space costs, professional fees, technical assistance, board education fees, interest on loans, relocation assistance, developers fees, and refinancing applicant debt. However, the program cannot be used for transient or migrant housing, health care facilities, or student housing. Refinancing is not authorized unless approved in advance by USDA. Interest rates must be fixed, with a maximum allowable rate specified annually. To serve low- and moderate-income tenants, at least 20% of loans must receive interest credit subsidy to reduce the effective interest rate. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 added Section 542 to the Housing Act of 1949, providing credit subsidy to reduce interest rates for complexes financed through the USDA Section 515 program. Owners agree to rent only to low-income residents with controlled rates. Rural Housing Vouchers cover the difference between rent contributions and new rates, usable at properties meeting HUD standards where USDA vouchers are accepted. The USDA released a report on the Section 515 program in November 2004, highlighting the lack of reserves and cash flow for necessary repairs and maintenance in the portfolio. The report recommended a revitalization program for USDA projects serving low- and moderate-income families in rural communities. The Multi-Family Housing Preservation and Revitalization (MPR) program was created in response to a report on USDA multi-family housing, aiming to preserve affordable housing for low-income residents without displacing tenants. The program allows for the restructuring of existing loans to extend affordable use. The MPR program aims to preserve affordable housing by restructuring loans through various methods. The Administration proposed no funding for the program in FY2011, arguing that the most cost-effective repairs have been made. Instead, they suggested increasing funding for the Section 515 program. Title VIII of the Housing Preservation and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 would authorize continued funding for MPR, but the bill has not progressed in Congress. The 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions to fund the federal budget at FY2010 levels. The demand for loans insured by FHA, VA, and USDA has increased due to high downpayment requirements in the mortgage market since 2007. The Section 502 guaranteed loan program saw a significant increase in demand, with the number of loans issued rising by 75% in FY2008 and over 111% in FY2009. By March 2010, USDA anticipated exhausting FY2010 funding for the program by April, prompting guidance to lenders on loan processing. The Section 502 loan guarantee program faced funding exhaustion in May 2010. Lenders could resume issuing guaranteed loans, but with the condition that funds were available and Congressional approval for guarantee fees. The 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act provided additional funding for the program and allowed USDA to charge guarantee fees and annual fees to lenders. The Section 502 loan guarantee program faced funding exhaustion in May 2010, but the 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act provided additional funding. Lenders could resume issuing guaranteed loans with the condition of available funds and Congressional approval for guarantee fees. An annual fee of 0.5% of the mortgage balance for the life of the loan was implemented to enable the program to operate without the need for positive credit subsidies in FY2011 and beyond. The latest continuing resolution, P.L. 111-322, funds the program at the FY2010 level until March 4, 2011, or enactment of FY2011 appropriations legislation for USDA."
