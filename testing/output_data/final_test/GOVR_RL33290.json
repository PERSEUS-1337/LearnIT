Federal policies supporting the ethanol industry include tax incentives, import tariffs, and mandates for ethanol use. Questions have been raised about the costs and benefits of ethanol, including its energy yield, impact on petroleum reliance, greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to maintain federal policies. This report focuses on U.S. ethanol production, particularly from corn, and its consumption as a gasoline blending component or alternative to gasoline. The report discusses the costs and benefits of ethanol, including fuel costs, pollutant emissions, and energy consumption. Fuel ethanol is made by fermenting simple sugars and is used as an additive in gasoline to reduce air pollution and prevent engine knock. It can also be used as an alternative to gasoline in specially designed vehicles. Ethanol production is mainly in the Midwest using corn as the main feedstock. Ethanol production in the United States has been encouraged since the 1970s through federal tax incentives and mandates like the renewable fuels standard. Fuel ethanol, mainly produced from fermented simple sugars, is used in blends with gasoline, with 99% consumed as E10 and 1% as E85. This production was initially driven by the need for alternative energy sources in response to oil embargoes. Ethanol production in the United States is primarily from fermented simple sugars, mainly derived from corn. Other sources include wheat, potatoes, and cellulosic materials like switchgrass and sugar cane waste. Corn accounts for 95% of the feedstock used for ethanol production, with the remaining 5% coming from grain sorghum, barley, wheat, cheese whey, and potatoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 3.2 billion bushels of corn will be used to produce 6 billion gallons of fuel ethanol in 2007/2008. During the 2007/2008 corn marketing year, about 6 billion gallons of fuel ethanol will be produced from corn, accounting for roughly 25% of total corn utilization. Ethanol production capacity is expanding rapidly, potentially exceeding USDA's projections. Lower corn prices without the ethanol market could lead to increased corn utilization in other markets, but with lower sales revenue. This could result in higher federal spending on corn subsidy payments to farmers. Dry milling plants process 80% of corn for ethanol, while wet milling plants process the remaining 20%. During ethanol production, corn is processed using grinding or wet milling plants. Enzymes are added to separate fermentable sugars, yeast is added for fermentation, and the alcohol is distilled to fuel-grade ethanol. The ethanol is then dehydrated and denatured for fuel and industrial use. The denaturant for fuel ethanol in the United States is gasoline. Ethanol production is mainly concentrated in the Midwest corn belt, with Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, and Minnesota being the top producers. Ethanol production in the U.S. is mainly concentrated in the Midwest, with roughly 70% of the national output coming from Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota, and South Dakota. This geographic concentration poses challenges for ethanol use on the East and West Coasts due to high shipping costs. However, ethanol consumption is steadily growing on the coasts due to Clean Air Act requirements and renewable fuels standards. For example, California and New York saw their ethanol consumption increase from 5% in 1999 to 22% in 2003. The ethanol industry in the U.S. has seen a shift in production concentration, with California and New York accounting for a growing percentage of consumption. Research on cellulosic ethanol aims to expand production geographically to reduce costs and increase regional agricultural income. The top five companies currently control 42% of production capacity, leading to debates about ethanol tax incentives being seen as \"corporate welfare\". The tax incentives for ethanol production have been criticized as \"corporate welfare\" for large producers, but the industry has seen a decrease in concentration. The FTC found that competition in the U.S. ethanol industry is sufficient, with production capacity expected to grow from 8 to 13 billion gallons per year. The U.S. ethanol industry is expected to grow to 13 billion gallons per year, with consumption increasing from 1.8 billion gallons in 2001 to 6.8 billion gallons in 2007. Domestic production capacity is increasing to meet demand, driven by the renewable fuels standard. Ethanol facilities also produce coproducts like corn oil and distillers grains, which are used as vegetable oil and livestock feed, respectively. In 2004, U.S. ethanol mills produced 7.3 million metric tons. In 2004, U.S. ethanol mills produced 7.3 million metric tons of distillers grains, 2.4 million metric tons of corn gluten feed, 0.4 million metric tons of corn gluten meal, and 560 million pounds of corn oil. Revenue from ethanol byproducts helps offset the cost of corn used in ethanol production. The net cost of corn, ethanol prices, and gasoline prices are key economic factors affecting ethanol production. Higher corn prices reduce profits for ethanol producers, while higher gasoline prices increase profits. Approximately 7 billion gallons of ethanol fuel were consumed in the U.S. in 2007, representing 5% of gasoline consumption that year. The renewable fuels standard mandates 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022, with ethanol expected to meet much of this requirement. Ethanol consumption in 2007 accounted for 4% of gasoline and diesel fuel consumption. Research is ongoing on ethanol-diesel blends for heavy-duty vehicles. Cost remains a barrier to wider ethanol use due to its higher price and lower energy content compared to gasoline. Fuel ethanol has lower energy content per gallon than gasoline, leading to a 2%-3% decrease in vehicle fuel economy with 10% gasohol. Ethanol is useful as an additive in gasoline, meeting oxygenate requirements for cleaner combustion. Ethanol can reduce emissions and replace toxic chemicals in gasoline. Ethanol and MTBE are common oxygenates used in gasoline. MTBE was preferred due to cost and availability, but ethanol has advantages as a sustainable fuel. Substituting one oxygenate for another can result in transitional costs. Ethanol is produced from agricultural products, while MTBE is produced from fossil fuels. Ethanol is a sustainable fuel produced from agricultural products, while MTBE is produced from fossil fuels. Ethanol is biodegradable and can raise the octane rating of gasoline. Concerns exist about ethanol increasing the risk of groundwater contamination by toxic compounds. Ethanol, in forms like E85, can be used as an alternative to gasoline in vehicles. Congress has enacted laws to promote alternative fuels, requiring the purchase of alternative-fueled vehicles. E85 and E95 are considered alternative fuels by the Department of Energy, with a small amount of gasoline added to prevent corrosion and aid ignition. In 2004, approximately 22 million gasoline-equivalent gallons of E85 were consumed, mainly in Midwestern states. There were around six million E85-capable vehicles on U.S. roads in 2006, compared to 230 million gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles. Most flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) operate exclusively on gasoline, with only about 146,000 FFVs fueled by E85. In 2006, there were around 6 million E85-capable vehicles on U.S. roads, with only about 146,000 FFVs fueled by E85. Despite the higher purchase price of alternative fuel vehicles, incentives to expand E85 infrastructure may be successful due to the existing number of FFVs. However, fuel ethanol is often more expensive than gasoline or diesel, and there are limited E85 fueling stations, especially outside of the Midwest. The number of E85 stations in the U.S. has rapidly increased, with 146 stations along the coasts in 13 states. Ethanol's price differential with gasoline is a barrier to its expanded role in fuel consumption. Interest in producing ethanol from cellulosic feedstocks, such as recycled paper and dedicated fuel crops like switchgrass, is growing to reduce production costs. Cellulosic feedstocks like switchgrass are high in cellulose, making them ideal for fuel production. However, the process of breaking down cellulose into simpler molecules is currently expensive. Research is focused on reducing production costs and improving availability of these feedstocks. Advanced ethanol production facilities could potentially produce fuel at a cost of $0.59 to $0.91 per gallon by 2012. Research is focused on reducing production costs and improving availability of cellulosic feedstocks like switchgrass for fuel production. Advanced ethanol production facilities could potentially produce significant amounts of fuel at competitive prices by 2012. President Bush announced an expansion of biofuels research with a goal to make cellulosic ethanol practical and competitive within six years, aiming to reduce Middle East oil imports by 75% by 2025. The Administration sought a 65% increase in funding for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D in the FY2007 DOE budget request. President Bush set a goal to increase renewable and alternative fuels to 35 billion gallons by 2017, requiring breakthroughs in technology for cellulosic ethanol production. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel standard to include advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. The advanced biofuel mandate includes cellulosic ethanol, ethanol from sugar cane, and biodiesel. Ethanol's high price limits its competitiveness with gasoline, but federal and state incentives help reduce the effective price. Rising gasoline prices make ethanol more attractive as a blending component and alternative fuel. The 108th Congress replaced the 5.2 cents per gallon exemption for blenders of gasohol with a 51 cents per gallon income tax credit for pure ethanol used in blending. Ethanol and gasoline prices are competitive when factoring in the tax credit, but ethanol is more expensive on an energy equivalent basis. The use of E85 in flexible fuel vehicles is also mentioned. The use of E85 in flexible fuel vehicles has been associated with improved combustion efficiency, despite a decrease in miles-per-gallon fuel economy. The ethanol industry heavily relies on tax incentives for survival, with critics labeling them as \"corporate welfare\" that encourages inefficient resource use. Elimination of tax exemptions could lead to a significant decline in ethanol production from corn. The tax incentives for ethanol production are criticized as \"corporate welfare\" for encouraging inefficient resource use. The excise tax exemption has cost the Highway Trust Fund billions over the years. Proponents argue that ethanol benefits air quality, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and boosts the agriculture sector. Additionally, ethanol reduces oil imports and improves the U.S. trade balance. The Clean Air Act Amendments and Energy Policy Act have been key in promoting the U.S. ethanol industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made significant changes to the ethanol industry, affecting U.S. markets for gasoline and ethanol. Ethanol was primarily used in gasoline to meet oxygenate requirements for RFG, which reduces vehicle emissions in areas with severe ozone problems. RFG has led to significant improvements in air quality, including reductions in VOC and toxic air pollutant emissions. The EPA reported that the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) program has shown positive results in reducing benzene levels, a known carcinogen. However, the use of oxygenates in RFG has raised concerns as it may lead to increased emissions of nitrogen oxides and VOCs, contributing to ozone formation. The National Research Council suggested that while RFG improves air quality, the impact of oxygenates on ozone formation may be minimal. In some cases, low-level ethanol blends could even increase ozone formation in specific areas. Some argue that oxygenates in gasoline displace dangerous compounds like benzene, but concerns about cost-effectiveness and groundwater contamination from methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) have led to calls to eliminate the oxygen requirement in Reformulated Gasoline (RFG). MTBE is a known animal carcinogen and possibly a human carcinogen, leading to bans in some states. Refiners suggest cleaner, albeit more expensive, gasoline without oxygenates could still achieve environmental goals of the RFG program. The push to remove the oxygenate requirement in Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) raised concerns about compromising air quality gains. Environmental groups feared that eliminating the oxygenate standard would lead to backsliding in toxic emissions reductions achieved in 2001 and 2002. Amendments in P.L. 109-58 require refiners to blend gasoline to maintain these reductions. P.L. 109-58 eliminated the RFG oxygenate standard in 2006, allowing the sale of non-oxygenated RFG. The use of E85 can reduce ozone-forming emissions in urban areas, but also increases acetaldehyde emissions. Ethanol is promoted as a motor fuel to reduce U.S. reliance on oil imports. The use of ethanol as a motor fuel is promoted to reduce U.S. reliance on oil imports. Analyzing the net energy consumption of ethanol involves considering the entire fuel cycle, including energy inputs for production, conversion, and distribution. Studies show that corn-based E10 can reduce fossil energy use by 3% per vehicle mile compared to gasoline, while E85 can reduce it by roughly 40%. However, some studies question the energy balance of ethanol production. Ethanol use may not lead to a significant reduction in fossil energy use due to the energy required for production and running ethanol plants. However, studies show that corn-based ethanol has a slight positive energy balance and can help diminish overall petroleum dependence. Despite displacing gasoline, the energy security benefits of corn-based ethanol are uncertain as it only accounts for a small percentage of gasoline consumption in the United States. The ethanol tax incentive in the United States has not significantly promoted energy security, with ethanol accounting for only 1.5% of energy consumption by volume. Dependency on corn supply poses a risk to ethanol production, as seen in the decline in production due to high corn prices in 1995. Cellulosic ethanol, which requires less fertilizer for production, could offer significant energy balance benefits. Studies suggest that cellulose-based E10 could reduce fossil energy consumption per mile by 8% with technological advancements. Cellulose-based E10 and E85 can significantly reduce fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline. Ethanol combustion results in carbon dioxide emissions, but the growth cycle of feedstock crops can help absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. The growth cycle of feedstock crops for cellulose-based E10 and E85 can act as a \"sink\" to absorb CO2 and reduce fuel-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Studies show that E10 has 1% lower emissions than gasoline, while E85 has 20% lower emissions. Pure ethanol results in 13% lower greenhouse gas emissions, with a 10% reduction using E85. Cellulosic ethanol production reduces fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions due to limited fertilizer use. Advancements in technology could further decrease greenhouse gas emissions with cellulosic E10. The study found that cellulosic E10 could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7% to 10% compared to gasoline, while cellulosic E85 could reduce emissions by 67% to 89%. However, fuel-cycle analyses often overlook changes in land use, which could compromise the overall greenhouse gas benefits of biofuels. Lifecycle analysis shows that corn ethanol only reduces emissions by less than 3% per mile relative to gasoline, while cellulosic biofuels have a 50% reduction. Other studies suggest even smaller reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies show smaller reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to previous findings. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, new biofuel refineries must achieve a 20% reduction in lifecycle emissions to qualify, with advanced biofuels needing a 50% reduction. The EPA is responsible for rating fuels based on their emissions and determining eligibility under the standard. Congressional interest in ethanol fuels has focused on various policies, including the renewable fuel standard, alcohol fuel tax incentives, ethanol imports, fuel economy credits, and biofuels in the Farm Bill. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires motor fuel to contain a minimum amount of fuel produced from renewable sources like biomass, solar, or wind energy. Supporters argue that demand for ethanol creates jobs and has environmental benefits, while opponents believe it would lead to increased fuel prices and artificial demand. President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, requiring the use of renewable fuel to increase over time. The law allowed for flexibility in fuel production through a credit trading system and granted extra credit for ethanol produced from cellulosic feedstocks. Additionally, 250 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol were required to be blended in gasoline. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 significantly expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard, requiring the use of 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, increasing to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The mandate includes a requirement for \"advanced biofuels\" with lower greenhouse gas emissions, leading to increased ethanol production capacity in the U.S. from 3.6 billion to 7.2 billion gallons per year between 2005 and 2008. In 2008, U.S. ethanol production capacity doubled to 7.2 billion gallons per year. EPA established a credit trading system for suppliers to exceed standards, with credits available for purchase. New rules were needed to reflect changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard, including requirements for greenhouse gas emissions reductions for biofuels. Increased ethanol production could lead to higher corn demand and prices, impacting food and animal feed costs. Ethanol distribution may be strained due to reliance on rail transport. Concerns include increased water use, chemical fertilizer, and pesticide use. Gasoline suppliers may face varying quality standards due to federal and local regulations. Gasoline suppliers may encounter different quality standards, known as \"boutique\" fuels, in various regions, leading to potential supply disruptions. The EPA conducted a study on harmonizing standards to mitigate disruptions without significant cost increases or emissions impact. The EPA studied harmonizing fuel standards to prevent supply disruptions without raising costs or emissions. Changes would require amendments to the Clean Air Act, focusing on reducing gasoline formulations. P.L. 109-58 consolidated RFG formulations and limited state fuel blends. Ethanol tax incentives are debated for promoting domestic production and air quality. The motor fuels excise tax exemption was extended through 2010, with concerns over revenue losses being addressed by replacing it with an income tax credit. Ethanol imports are a growing concern due to lower prices in other countries, with most imports subject to a small tariff and an added duty. The duty on imported ethanol, which includes a 2.5% ad valorem tariff and an additional $0.54 per gallon duty, has been a significant barrier to ethanol imports. However, ethanol imports from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries are granted duty-free status under certain conditions. This loophole has been criticized by some stakeholders, including Members of Congress. President Bush signed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, extending the duty on imported ethanol through December 31, 2008. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 mandates Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for motor vehicles. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975 establishes Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for motor vehicles. These standards aim to reduce petroleum consumption and promote energy security. Manufacturers must meet specific fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks. EPCA provides incentives for producing alternative fuel vehicles, such as ethanol vehicles, by offering credits towards meeting CAFE standards. Credits can be used to improve a manufacturer's average fuel economy for both dedicated and dual fuel vehicles. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975 establishes Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for motor vehicles to reduce petroleum consumption. Manufacturers receive credits for producing alternative fuel vehicles, but concerns have been raised about the limited use of alternative fuels in dual fuel vehicles. Supporters argue that incentives are necessary for alternative fuel vehicle production and infrastructure growth. The credits were extended through the 2004 model year by the Department of Transportation (DOT). The Department of Transportation extended credits for producing alternative fuel vehicles through model year 2010, with authority extended through 2014. The 110th Congress is expected to reauthorize farm programs and introduce new ones in a new Farm Bill. The House approved a new farm bill in 2007, focusing on cellulosic energy production and moving away from corn-starch-based ethanol. The Senate passed its version in December 2007, expanding Farm Bill programs and creating tax incentives for cellulosic ethanol. The 2002 Farm Bill programs would be expanded, new tax incentives for cellulosic ethanol created, and studies on biofuel infrastructure required. Fuel ethanol usage is limited but has the potential to reduce petroleum demand. However, the benefits in terms of energy consumption and greenhouse gases are limited, especially with corn-based ethanol. Cellulosic feedstocks offer potential benefits. Cellulosic feedstocks have the potential to improve fuel ethanol benefits by reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, cost-effective technologies for converting cellulose to ethanol are still lacking, leading to support for increased federal R&D. Federal incentives, such as tax incentives and renewable fuels standards, have driven significant growth in the ethanol market, making its price competitive with gasoline. The renewable fuels standard, established in 2005 and expanded in 2007, drives growth in the ethanol market by mandating a yearly increase in renewable fuel in gasoline. Ethanol plays a significant role in meeting this standard, leading to potential price pressures on motor fuel. Interest in eliminating the tariff on imported ethanol may rise due to ethanol supply concerns. Congress continues to assess ethanol's energy, environmental impacts, and effects on U.S. fuel markets as part of discussions on U.S. energy policy promoting alternatives to petroleum. Discussions on U.S. energy policy promoting alternatives to petroleum may continue due to ethanol supply concerns and instability in oil-producing regions."
