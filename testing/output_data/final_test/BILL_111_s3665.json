    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pakistani-American Enterprise Fund Act\". The findings by Congress highlight Pakistan's strong private sector and entrepreneurial spirit, along with efforts to stabilize the economy through IMF support. Establishing an Enterprise Fund in partnership with the US could help sustain reform efforts and empower Pakistani entrepreneurs to create employment opportunities. Pakistan's economy is showing signs of recovery with an increase in manufacturing output and exports. However, foreign direct investment has significantly decreased. Improvements in the business climate are needed to attract more investment and create employment opportunities. Pakistan's private sector is a major contributor to GDP and employment in the country, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) making up nearly 90% of all businesses. SMEs employ 80% of the non-agricultural labor force and contribute around 40% to the annual GDP. However, these enterprises face challenges due to limited access to financial and other resources. Establishing an enterprise fund in Pakistan can help address the shortage of risk capital, caused by global economic crisis and exacerbated by political and security challenges. This fund would reinforce financial institutions, provide investment for SMEs and energy sector initiatives, and improve the investment environment for domestic and international entities. Establishing an enterprise fund in Pakistan could promote private sector growth and incentivize companies to operate within the formal economy. The fund would require businesses to adhere to legal and accounting standards and tax codes, potentially setting a positive example in a country with low tax collection rates. To support the private sector in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the US enacted the SEED Act and FREEDOM Support Act, authorizing $1.2 billion for USAID to establish 10 Enterprise Funds. These funds invested in over 500 enterprises, leveraging $5 billion in private investment and providing development capital in countries with limited supply. The Enterprise Fund, established with $1.2 billion from the SEED Act and FREEDOM Support Act, created over 260,000 jobs and funded $74 million in technical assistance. It is expected to recoup 137% of the original USAID funding. The purpose of the Enterprise Fund, established with funding from the SEED Act and FREEDOM Support Act, is to create jobs, provide technical assistance, and recoup 137% of the original USAID funding. The Act aims to promote the private sector in Pakistan by supporting investments in small- and medium-sized enterprises, the energy sector, and joint ventures with the United States. It also seeks to strengthen the private sector through various measures like loans, equity investments, and training, promote good corporate governance and transparency, and enhance local capital markets.
