    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California enacts Section 832.18 of the Penal Code to establish policies and procedures for downloading and storing data from body-worn cameras worn by peace officers, based on best practices. Law enforcement agencies must consider best practices for the implementation and operation of body-worn camera systems. Establish procedures for downloading and storing data from body-worn cameras, including designating a responsible person, setting download schedules, preventing data tampering, and categorizing videos based on the type of incident captured. Recorded data from body-worn cameras should be stored for a minimum of 60 days for nonevidentiary data, which can be extended for transparency and citizen complaints. Evidentiary data, such as incidents involving use of force or arrests, must be retained for a minimum of two years. (C) Relevant evidence from body-worn camera recordings should be retained for additional time as required by law for criminal prosecutions. The agency should work with legal counsel to establish a retention schedule that complies with laws and preserves evidentiary chains of custody. Access and deletion logs should be kept permanently. Body-worn camera data can be stored on an in-house server or online cloud database managed by a third-party vendor. When using a third-party vendor for data storage, consider factors like vendor reputation, contractual agreements, audit trails for data security, automatic data backups, legal compliance, and technical support capabilities. The use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement agencies requires that all recorded data be owned by the agency, prohibiting unauthorized access or release for personal or public use. Evidentiary data, useful for investigations, must adhere to state evidentiary laws for retention periods. \"Nonevidentiary data, such as incidents not leading to arrest, does not limit public access under the California Public Records Act.\""
