    "content": "The JLTV is a joint Army/Marine Corps initiative to develop future light tactical vehicles to replace HMMWVs. HMMWVs are vulnerable to IEDs, leading to a focus on vehicle survivability. The JLTV program includes Combat Tactical Vehicles (CTV) and Combat Support Vehicles (CSV). The JLTV program includes the Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) and Combat Support Vehicle (CSV). The CTV seats four passengers and has a 3,500 lb. payload capacity with three variants. The CSV seats two passengers, has a 5,100 lb. payload capacity, and comes in one variant. The JLTVs are designed to be mechanically reliable, maintainable, all-terrain mobile, and capable of linking into tactical data nets. Survivability and transportability by ship and aircraft are key design requirements. The Army is responsible for developing the JLTV through its Joint Program Office. The JLTV program, developed by the Army's Joint Program Office in Warren, MI, and Marine Corps PEO LS in Quantico, VA, was approved by the JROC in November 2006. The program moved into the Technology Development Phase in December 2007 after an Acquisition Decision Memorandum was signed. The Army and Marines planned to issue an RFP for the Technology Development Phase. The Pentagon's acquisition executive disapproved the initial RFP for the JLTV Technology Development Phase in October 2007 due to concerns about funding, technical maturity, and shifting requirements. A new RFP was issued on February 5, 2008, with the government aiming to award three contracts for the JLTV TD Phase. Three awards were made on October 28, 2008, totaling $166 million to industry teams including BAE Systems Land and Armaments. Teams including BAE Systems Land and Armaments, General Tactical Vehicles, and Lockheed Martin Systems Integration were awarded contracts for the JLTV Technology Development Phase. Protests were filed against the contract awards, leading to a suspension of work, but the protests were later rejected by the Government Accountability Office. In February 2011, the JLTV Program Office announced a delay in the EMD contract award due to changed Army requirements for under-body protection. The EMD phase was extended to 48 months with two variants planned - a Combat Tactical Vehicle (CTV) and a Combat Support Vehicle (CSV). The Army issued the RFP for the EMD Phase on January 26, 2012, with industry proposals due by March 13, 2012. The Army announced the award of three firm-fixed price JLTV EMD contracts totaling approximately $185 million to AM General, LLC, Lockheed Martin Corporation, and Oshkosh Corporation. The contracts were capped at $65 million each, with a 27-month performance period starting in June 2012. Vendors were required to provide 22 prototypes for testing 12 months after contract award. Target cost for the base vehicle configuration was $250,000 excluding add-on armor kits. The EMD Phase for the JLTV contracts lasted 27 months with initial funding between $28 million and $36 million per contractor. Each team had to deliver 22 prototypes within 12 months for government testing. Unsuccessful bidders were allowed to continue developing JLTV vehicles at their own expense. The Army released the final RFP for JLTV production, with competitors given until February 10, 2016, to submit bids. The winning contractor would build 17,000 JLTVs for the Army and Marines over 8 years. Army units would be equipped with JLTVs in FY2018, with complete acquisition by 2040. Marines would receive their 5,500 JLTVs by FY2022. The Army awarded Oshkosh a $6.7 billion LRIP contract for 16,901 JLTVs, with plans for full rate production in FY2018. The contract included options for the Army to purchase a technical data package for future production runs. Lockheed Martin planned a protest with GAO regarding the award decision on the JLTV program. The Army issued a stop-work order to Oshkosh following the protest. Lockheed Martin informed GAO of its decision to file the JLTV protest with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. GAO closed Lockheed Martin's protest without further action, leading to the Army lifting its stop-work order to Oshkosh. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims denied Lockheed Martin's stop-work request, allowing Oshkosh to continue work on the JLTV contract. Lockheed Martin later withdrew its protest, and the Army placed a $243 million order with Oshkosh Defense for JLTVs and related items. The first JLTVs were delivered in September 2016. The JLTV program experienced delays due to a Lockheed Martin protest, pushing back the Army's IOC to the end of 2019 and the Marine Corps' IOC to FY2020. Despite the delays, the Army ordered 258 JLTVs and 1,727 components in December 2017. Oshkosh Defense had delivered over 1,000 vehicles by October 2016, with soldiers and Marines expected to receive JLTVs for operational use in FY2019. In FY2019, soldiers and Marines are set to receive JLTVs for operational use, with a full-rate production decision expected. The Army plans to use the JLTV for its Light Reconnaissance Vehicle program as an interim solution, but may pursue an original design in the future. Modifications such as additional seats and a larger weapon are being considered to enhance scout platoons' effectiveness and firepower. The Air Force plans to replace HMMWVs with JLTVs in various units, with a goal to eventually replace the entire HMMWV fleet. The Marines aim to increase their JLTV requirement by 65% and acquire additional vehicles as quickly as possible within budget constraints. Marine Corps officials anticipate a formal adjustment to their approved acquisition objective in the next couple of years. The British Army plans to acquire 2,747 JLTVs valued at over $1 billion through the Foreign Military Sales process. The Army and Marines have extended their procurement timelines due to program strategy changes, with total program costs increasing to $28.03 billion. The Marines aim to have JLTVs account for half of their light tactical vehicle fleet by FY2023. The DOD IG report highlighted issues with the JLTV program's test results, specifically in meeting maintenance-related performance requirements. Recommendations were made to address the shortcomings, with the JLTV Program Executive Office committing to equip all JLTVs with the necessary capabilities. The first JLTVs were delivered to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team on January 28, 2019. The first JLTVs were delivered to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team at Ft. Stewart, GA in 2019. Plans call for equipping the team with about 500 JLTVs by March 2019. The Marines began fielding JLTVs at Camp Pendleton, CA in February 2019, with operational capability expected by late summer 2019. DOT&E's FY2018 Annual Report states that JLTV GP, HGC, and UTL variants are effective for combat missions, but the CCWC variant is not as effective due to limitations with engaging threats using TOW missiles. The Army has decided to delay JLTV full-rate production until early summer 2019 to assess options for vehicle design changes suggested by soldiers and marines during testing. This delay could potentially result in a program schedule breach and trigger a Nunn-McCurdy breach if production decision is delayed beyond June 2019. Marine Corps program officials have addressed many problems identified in DOT&E's FY2018 Annual Report. Marine officials have addressed issues identified in DOT&E's FY2018 Annual Report, attributing some problems to budget restrictions. They compared the reliability and maintainability of HMMWVs and JLTVs, noting that JLTVs surpass the required 2,400 miles between operational mission failures during testing. JLTVs are considered less burdensome in maintenance compared to HMMWVs, despite requiring more complex maintenance procedures. The Marines plan to field their first 55 JLTVs by the end of May 2019 to support units at training locations. Operational units, starting with the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines at Camp Lejeune, NC, will receive their first vehicles in July 2019, marking the Marines' Initial Operational Capability. By the end of FY2019, all three Marine Expeditionary Forces will have received some variants of the JLTV. The Army is considering lowering its overall requirement for JLTVs to allocate funding for modernization. The Army plans to cut funding for 93 programs, including the JLTV, over the next five years to free up funding for modernization. They already have 55,000 HMMWVs and 800 ISVs, stating they have more capability than needed. The Army is looking to lower the overall requirement for JLTVs and will determine a new requirement soon. They plan to buy 1,900 fewer JLTVs than originally planned, reducing program funding by nearly $800 million over the FYDP. The FY2020 budget request includes RDT&E and procurement funding requests for the JLTV program. The Inspector General found that the Marine Corps did not show effective test results for the JLTV program, which failed to meet maintenance-related performance requirements. The JLTV Close Combat Weapons Carrier was deemed ineffective for combat and tactical missions due to deficiencies in reliability, maintainability, and crew situational awareness. The missile reload process was noted to be slow and difficult for crews. The missile reload process for the JLTV program is slow and difficult for crews. Military officials are downplaying these issues as minor improvements identified during testing. The Army's decision to delay full-rate JLTV production has significant implications for all services. A detailed examination of the DOD IG's and DOT&E's findings is needed to address identified deficiencies. The potential consequences of a delayed full-rate production decision for the JLTV program should be examined by policymakers. A longer delay could have significant impacts on program schedule, cost, service allocation, fielding plan, training, readiness, and potential Foreign Military Sales. This examination would be useful for program oversight and defense discussions in FY2020. The Army's announcement to reduce its JLTV requirement by 1,900 vehicles raises concerns for Congress regarding the accuracy of the original requirements process. Questions arise about the new fielding plan, operational impact, and potential impact on Reserve Components. It is uncertain if this revised requirement will be final or if further reductions may occur to allocate funding to other programs. The Army's decision to reduce JLTV requirements by 1,900 vehicles raises concerns about the accuracy of the original requirements process and potential impact on Reserve Components. Uncertainty remains about whether further reductions will be made to allocate funding to other programs."
