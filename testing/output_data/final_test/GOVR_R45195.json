Bush ordered a limited military intervention to support a ceasefire and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The U.S. then supported the ECOWAS Mission in Liberia, which later integrated into the U.N. Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). UNMIL completed its mandate in 2018, with the U.S. funding a significant portion of its costs. U.S. relations with the Sirleaf administration were positive, leading to a U.S.-Liberia Partnership Dialogue focused on bilateral development cooperation. Congress has played a role in shaping U.S. relations with Liberia through the appropriations process and hearings. The U.S. has shaped relations with Liberia through appropriations, hearings, and Member visits. Congress has focused on elections, Ebola, and bilateral cooperation, including the House Democracy Partnership program. Development assistance and military reform have been key areas of cooperation, with a focus on infrastructure projects. Development assistance from the United States, through USAID and the State Department, has focused on various sectors in Liberia including infrastructure, health, education, agriculture, and economic growth. Efforts have also been made in democracy and good governance, supporting elections, anti-corruption programs, civil service capacity-building, and military reform. Additionally, the U.S. has aided in building Liberia's criminal justice sector and supported transitional justice efforts. In addition to development assistance in various sectors, the United States has also arrested and prosecuted alleged perpetrators of Liberian civil war human rights abuses. Emergency U.S. assistance during the Ebola epidemic transitioned back to pre-epidemic goals, including post-Ebola health system strengthening. Liberia entered into a Compact with the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2015 for programs focusing on electrical power generation, technical capacity-building, and national road maintenance. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a U.S.-educated former government administrator, was involved in these efforts. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman to be elected president of an African country, focused on transitioning Liberia from post-war recovery to long-term development during her first term. Despite widespread poverty and limited public services, she gained the confidence of foreign aid donors, leading to significant assistance for infrastructure rehabilitation and institutional capacity-building. During Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's tenure as president of Liberia, significant efforts were made to improve infrastructure and state institutional capacity. The national budget saw a substantial increase from $80 million in 2006 to $516 million by the end of her first term. Additionally, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established, with controversial recommendations that were only partially implemented. The Sirleaf administration also received support through the USAID-administered Governance and Economic Management Program (GEMAP) to address fiscal management, corruption, and economic governance. During Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's presidency in Liberia, efforts were made to improve economic governance and judicial capacity.

Corruption within her government was a key focus of criticism, although she herself was not accused of corruption. During Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's presidency in Liberia, criticisms arose over repeated scandals involving officials within her administration, nepotism accusations due to her sons obtaining top government positions, and structural challenges such as low state capacities, corruption, and poor infrastructure. The Ebola outbreak also hindered Liberia's development prospects and economic growth during Sirleaf's second term. Despite mixed domestic views, she had strong support among women and earned domestic praise for certain achievements. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, during her presidency in Liberia, received both domestic and international recognition for her leadership in post-war peacebuilding, socioeconomic growth, and gender equality advocacy. She was awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011. Despite her achievements, she faced criticism for defending the criminalization of homosexuality and corruption under her tenure. Liberia held elections in 2017. Liberia held presidential and House of Representative elections on October 10, 2017, with 20 presidential contenders, including Weah (CDC) and then-incumbent Vice President Joseph Boakai (Unity Party). Weah's running mate was Jewel Howard-Taylor of the National Patriotic Party, linked to former president Charles Taylor. Controversy arose over Weah's alleged ties to Taylor, but Weah denied any private communications. The elections saw a turnout of 1.64 million voters. The October 2017 elections in Liberia had a turnout of 1.64 million voters. George Weah won the presidential runoff with 61.5% of the votes, while his party CDC won 21 out of 73 House seats.

Weah, a former professional soccer player, was born in 1966 in Grand Kru County and has ties to various ethnic groups in Liberia. George Weah, of mixed Kru and Bassa ethnic descent, overcame criticism for his lack of formal education during his 2005 presidential run. He later earned high school and undergraduate degrees in the US. In 2014, he became a Senator for Montserrado County. Known as King George, he is a former UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and amateur musician. Weah's rags-to-riches story, personal philanthropy, and empathy for social bias due to his education background have garnered strong support. Senator Jewel Howard-Taylor, Weah's running mate, faced scrutiny for her ties to Charles Taylor and controversial views on homosexuality. Despite this, she emphasized her own record as an elected official and her multiple higher education degrees. As a Senator, Jewel Howard-Taylor sponsored anti-corruption bills and worked on public service and infrastructure delivery. Weah's policy agenda focuses on education, health, youth empowerment, gender equality, economic growth, peace, governance, and transparency. Weah's administration aims to decentralize government, enhance public sector accountability, and combat corruption. There is potential for a shift towards prioritizing anti-poverty efforts and reducing the influence of a powerful elite. Weah's administration aims to combat corruption and increase exports and agricultural productivity. He has prioritized efforts in food production, infrastructure investments, and reviewing commercial land concessions. Despite challenges, Weah has emphasized the need to combat corruption and has made changes in his administration to address criticisms. Liberia's President Weah faces criticism for not declaring assets, nepotism concerns, and press freedom issues. Economic challenges persist with high joblessness and limited technical skills. Weah has made efforts to combat corruption and improve agricultural productivity. Liberia's economic growth has been uneven and artificially boosted by aid inflows. The country faces challenges in diversifying its economy, developing strong institutions, and ensuring a smooth political transition. Despite nominal GDP growth, extreme poverty remains widespread, and deep-set development challenges persist. Liberia's GDP growth dropped sharply due to the Ebola outbreak, contracting in 2016 before recovering in 2017. GDP per capita remains low at $729 in 2017, despite growth from $224 when Sirleaf took office. The pre-epidemic growth relied on development aid, foreign direct investment deals, and public investment in agriculture. The Sirleaf administration negotiated multi-year deals worth $16 billion, but current FDI stocks are less than half of this amount. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Liberia has focused on mining and agro-forestry, with some oil discoveries. However, investment has been hindered by corruption, weak regulations, and poor infrastructure. Liberia ranks low in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business report. Despite aid for post-war rebuilding, challenges persist in attracting investment. Liberia received $4.6 billion in debt forgiveness in 2010, with positive economic policy marks from IFIs. The World Bank funded 14 projects worth $598 million in late 2017, focusing on infrastructure construction. Agriculture contributed 36% of GDP in 2017 and is a key government development target. The current government in Liberia, like the previous administration, is likely to prioritize agricultural development, supported by the U.S. under the Feed the Future initiative. The State Department's human rights report for 2017 highlighted serious concerns such as extrajudicial killings, police abuse, press harassment, corruption, and lack of accountability for crimes against women and children. Impunity for individuals who committed atrocities is also a significant issue. The report highlighted impunity for individuals who committed atrocities during civil wars and current crimes, corruption undermining public trust, and various human rights violations in Liberia.

Liberia is classified as a Tier 2 Watch List country, with trafficking occurring in various forms such as forced labor in street vending, diamond mines, and rubber plantations. Charles Taylor, a key figure in Liberia's civil wars, formed the National Patriotic Front of Liberia after escaping from prison in Massachusetts. Charles Taylor, a key figure in Liberia's civil wars, formed the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) after escaping from prison in Massachusetts. He launched attacks on state targets in 1989, sparking the first civil war. Taylor was elected president in 1997 after a peace deal ended the conflict. The second war began in 1999 with Liberian rebels based in Guinea and escalated due to political rivalries, poor governance, and human rights abuses under Taylor's administration. The conflict involved Taylor's forces against two rebel groups, causing severe political, economic, and humanitarian crises. Both civil wars in Liberia led to a significant decline in political, economic, humanitarian, and human rights conditions. The conflicts also impacted neighboring countries hosting Liberian refugees and facing aggression sponsored by the Taylor regime. Charles Taylor went into political exile in Nigeria in 2003 to end the second war, but was later arrested in 2006 for war crimes related to supporting rebel groups in Sierra Leone. He was convicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone in 2012. Charles Taylor's son, Roy M. Belfast Jr., was sentenced to 97 years in prison for wartime acts of torture in Liberia. He was the first to be convicted under a U.S. federal statute for torture abroad. Belfast had also been sentenced for passport fraud related to his father's identity. The United States has arrested others for human rights abuses during Liberia's civil wars, often on charges of immigration application perjury. Several individuals have been arrested and sentenced for immigration application perjury charges related to their alleged roles in wartime human rights violations. Mohammed Jabateh and Thomas Woewiyu were sentenced to prison for lying on citizenship application documents. George Boley was deported for his involvement in recruiting child soldiers. Agnes Taylor is set to face trial in the United Kingdom in 2018. Agnes Taylor is scheduled to stand trial in the United Kingdom in 2018 for her alleged involvement in torture during Liberia's civil war. The Liberian Quest for Justice Campaign, supported by groups like Civitas Maxima, is providing legal aid to war victims for justice. Calls for a war crimes tribunal in Liberia have been made, but no trials have occurred yet. Advocates have called for a war crimes tribunal in Liberia, but policymakers have rejected the idea due to opposition from former armed faction leaders. Concerns about a potential return to conflict and other challenges have been raised. The security situation in Liberia was described as generally stable but marred by sporadic incidents in a June 2017 U.N. report. The security situation in Liberia has been generally stable but marred by sporadic incidents due to various factors such as understaffing, lack of resources, clashes between authorities and different groups, ethnic tensions, joblessness, and illicit activities. Mob violence and vigilantism are common, and violent crime and acts of police and military indiscipline also pose challenges. UNMIL played a key role in maintaining security, overseeing disarmament, training civilian security services, and helping reestablish state authority before starting a gradual drawdown in 2011. The UNMIL mission in Liberia, which began in 2011, officially transferred security responsibilities to the Liberian government in mid-2016. Despite concerns about national security capabilities after UNMIL's departure in 2018, Liberia is expected to receive nonsecurity assistance for stability. A peacebuilding plan was submitted to the U.N. Security Council in April 2017, involving various U.N. agencies and institutions to support Liberia. Corruption remains a significant concern in the country. Corruption is a major concern in Liberia, highlighted in reports by Catholic Relief Services/Justice and Peace Commission and Afrobarometer surveys. Concerns include public dissatisfaction with government performance, unemployment, infrastructure, economic management, education, and agriculture. The Catholic Relief Services/JPC study also identified divisions based on regional, ethnic, religious, urban vs. rural, and young vs. old cleavages, as well as challenges to social cohesion from crony capitalism and a weak civic society. Poverty is also a significant issue in the country. The Sirleaf government in Liberia faced challenges with corruption, poverty, and the need for better livelihoods, education, and jobs. Efforts were made to improve transparency and strengthen the rule of law, but corruption remained widespread. The legislature's capacity was reported to be weak despite past efforts to strengthen it. The challenges facing the Liberian legislature include electoral turnover, inexperienced members, accusations of corruption, and institutional obstacles like executive dominance and weak rule of law. The Trump Administration remains committed to supporting democracy, peace, and economic growth in Liberia through ongoing cooperation focused on health system strengthening and socioeconomic development post-Ebola. The U.S. Congress has shown interest in Liberia's post-war development and held hearings on its stability and democratization. Programs like the House Democracy Partnership and U.S.-Liberia Partnership Dialogue focus on enhancing bilateral cooperation in various sectors. Liberian immigration to the United States is also mentioned. The most recent dialogue meeting in early 2017 discussed Liberian immigration to the United States and bilateral aid. USAID and the State Department have provided significant aid to Liberia post-war, including a $257 million MCC Compact. Assistance totaled $91 million in FY2016, $112 million in FY2017, with proposed amounts of $29 million for FY2018 and $43 million for FY2019. Emergency funding of $618 million was allocated for the U.S. Ebola response in Liberia. USAID non-Ebola-related assistance in recent years has focused on economic growth, health, education, democracy, governance, and crosscutting issues. Aid was provided under presidential development initiatives like Feed the Future, Global Health Initiative, President's Malaria Initiative, and Power Africa. Liberia also participates in the U.S. Young African Leaders initiative (YALI). State Department-administered aid has supported capacity-building in law enforcement, military training, and security sector reform. The United States, in cooperation with DOD, supports security sector reform targeting the military in Liberia. The State Department funds UNHCR programs for Ivoirian refugees in Liberia. USAID programs focus on post-war democratic strengthening, electoral processes, legislative capacity-building, fiscal management, public administration transparency, and citizen participation in governance in Liberia. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance (OTA) has been present in Liberia post-war to assist with governance, tax collection, and anti-corruption efforts. They have worked with the Liberia Revenue Authority to address employee corruption and improve security. In 2016, OTA started a program to enhance the Liberia Financial Intelligence Unit's ability to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The MCC signed a $256.7 million compact in 2015 to address key constraints in Liberia. The MCC signed a $256.7 million compact in 2015 to address key constraints in Liberia, focusing on improving access to reliable electricity and road infrastructure. The Compact supports training for power sector technicians, energy sector regulatory capacities, and a nationwide road maintenance system. It also includes the rehabilitation of the Mt. Coffee Hydroelectric Plant. Additionally, the MCC previously supported a Threshold Program focused on education, land access reform, and trade policy. The Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) was created with nearly $250 million in U.S. aid, disbanding the prior military and recruiting new personnel. U.S. support shifted to military-to-military mentoring under Operation Onward Liberty, which concluded in August 2016. Liberia's small Coast Guard was also established with U.S. assistance. The AFL was created with U.S. aid, including support for the Coast Guard. Current security sector reform activities are funded by the State Department, with training and equipment provided through various programs. The DOD has also supported capacity-building for the Liberian Ministry of Defense and provided training for the AFL's military justice capabilities. The AFL has improved its military justice capabilities through various programs, including collaboration with U.S. Africa Command. They have participated in international missions, such as sending troops to Mali for a UN peacekeeping mission. Despite improvements, there have been issues with absenteeism, protests about living conditions, and occasional reports of indiscipline. Liberia is currently at peace with no major security threats, but faces significant development and economic challenges. These challenges include the need to increase job growth, diversify the economy, and address the needs of the disenfranchised youth population. Localized sources of potential unrest include mob violence, competition over resources, and anger over corruption. President Weah's political honeymoon may be short-lived due to the pressing nature of these challenges. President Weah's ability to govern competently, transparently, and accountably will be crucial for gaining support from Liberia's citizens and the international community. He inherits challenges from the previous administration but also benefits from ongoing donor-backed development assistance. The United States is expected to continue supporting Liberia's development trajectory, although with lower assistance allocations than in recent years."
