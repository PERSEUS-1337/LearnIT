    "content": "The Act titled \"Distorting Subsidies Limitation Act of 1997\" is cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that competition among State and local governments for businesses has become common, leading to the use of scarce tax dollars for preferential treatment, which undermines the national economic union. However, competition through general tax policies and public services can promote better service and cost-effective regulation. Federal program grants and tax-exempt municipal bonds are used by State and local governments to attract businesses from other areas, creating economic distortions that only Congress can address. SEC. 3. TAXATION OF VALUE OF TARGETED SUBSIDIES PROVIDED BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. This section introduces a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code that imposes an excise tax on targeted state or local government development subsidies. An excise tax is imposed on individuals benefiting from targeted subsidies provided by state or local governments. The tax amount is calculated based on the value of benefits received during the year. Targeted subsidy is defined as any subsidy designed to encourage a person's trade or business operation. A targeted subsidy is any subsidy designed to encourage a person's trade or business operation in a specific governmental jurisdiction. Subsidies that apply to more than one operation can still be considered targeted if they are not part of general long-term taxing or spending. A subsidy is considered part of a governmental unit's long-term taxing or spending policies only if it is available to all trade or business operations within the jurisdiction without regard to the operation's duration. The term 'subsidy' includes grants, contributions of property or services, and rights to use property or services. The curr_chunk discusses various forms of subsidies provided to taxpayers, including reduced rates on loans, tax reductions or deferrals, guarantees on payments, and use of governmental facilities at lower costs than commercial rates. The curr_chunk discusses tax exemptions for subsidies provided for employee training and education, as well as special rules for subsidies provided to governmental entities. The curr_chunk discusses tax exemptions for subsidies provided to governmental entities and the avoidance of double taxation on targeted subsidies. Amendments are made to the tax code to deny income tax deductions for certain taxes imposed. Chapter 45 imposes an excise tax on state or local government development subsidies, effective for agreements made after 30 days from the enactment of the Act. Section 4 denies tax exemption for interest on bonds providing targeted subsidies. Section 4 amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny tax exemption for interest on bonds used for targeted development subsidies. This amendment applies to obligations issued after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, Section 5 prohibits the use of federal funds for targeted subsidies. The provision prohibits the use of federal funds by State or local governments for targeted subsidies. If funds are misused, the Secretary of the Treasury can take actions to recover the amount used. Effective immediately. This section applies to funds provided after the enactment of this Act."
