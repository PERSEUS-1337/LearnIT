    "content": "The \"Elder Abuse Prevention Act of 2006\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. The number of older Americans facing abuse, neglect, or exploitation is increasing, with many cases going unreported to authorities. As the population of Americans aged 65 and older grows, there is a heightened risk of abuse and exploitation in domestic and community settings. This projected increase in elder abuse cases calls for urgent prevention, reporting, and prosecution measures by Federal and State authorities. Abuse against older Americans, including violent, physical, and sexual assaults, should be vigorously prosecuted by Federal and State authorities. Enhanced penalties and the elimination of parole for offenders convicted of violent sexual offenses against the elderly are necessary deterrents. No parole for sexual offenses against the elderly or sexually violent predators. The State must have laws prohibiting parole for individuals convicted of sexual offenses against the elderly or classified as sexually violent predators. Each State must comply with subsection (a) within 3 years of the Act's enactment, with the possibility of a 2-year extension for good faith efforts. Non-compliant States will lose 10% of allocated funds under Subpart 1 of Part E of title I after the initial compliance period. The State must comply with subsection (a) within 3 years of the Act's enactment, with a possible 2-year extension for good faith efforts. Non-compliant States will lose 10% of allocated funds under Subpart 1 of Part E of title I. Amounts not allocated to a State for non-compliance will be reallocated to compliant States. SEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission is requested to promptly review sentencing guidelines for sexual offenses against the elderly, consider new guidelines or amendments for enhancements, and submit policy recommendations to Congress. The Sentencing Commission is asked to ensure that sentencing guidelines reflect the seriousness of offenses, maintain consistency with other directives, consider circumstances for exceptions, make necessary changes to guidelines, and align with the purposes of sentencing. The United States Sentencing Commission is requested to promptly issue guidelines or amendments within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, following the procedures outlined in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1987."
