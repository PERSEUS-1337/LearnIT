Candidates are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate after intensive hearings. This report focuses on the process of Supreme Court nominations and confirmations since 1900. The process of Supreme Court nominations and confirmations since 1900 has been a concern for Congress, with a focus on the speed of appointments. Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement in 2010, emphasizing the importance of filling vacancies before the Court's summer recess. Justice John Paul Stevens announced his retirement in 2010, emphasizing the importance of filling vacancies before the Court's summer recess. The retirement letter arrived at the White House on April 9, prompting discussions on a potential schedule for considering his replacement. President Obama expressed his desire for a new Justice to be seated by the start of the fall term. President Obama announced his nominee, Solicitor General Elena Kagan, to replace Justice Stevens, urging swift Senate confirmation before the fall term. Senator Leahy predicted confirmation by August 2010 recess, emphasizing the need for a new Justice on the Court. Senator Leahy announced that Elena Kagan's confirmation hearings would begin on June 28, 2010, following a similar timeline to past Supreme Court nominees. The process started 49 days after Kagan's nomination, aligning with historical averages. The appointment process for Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court lasted 118 days, slightly longer than the median duration for Court nominations from 1981-2010. Some phases, like the time between final committee and Senate actions, took longer than previous nominations. For Kagan, there was a 16-day interval between final committee action and Senate confirmation, almost twice the median time for Supreme Court nominations during the same period. The Senate took longer to act on the Kagan nomination compared to previous Supreme Court nominations between 1981 and 2010. The appointment process for Kagan lasted 118 days, longer than Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nomination in 1993. The selection and consideration of the Kagan nomination stretched 21 days beyond Judge Sotomayer's nomination in 2009. Senate timetables for Supreme Court nominations are influenced by various factors. Before the Stevens announcement, the Senate considered a Supreme Court nomination in 2009 when President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor to replace Justice Souter. The President hoped for a swift confirmation before the Court's new term in October. Various timetables were discussed, with the goal of confirming Judge Sotomayor before August 2009. The Senate confirmed Judge Sotomayor in August 2009, after hearings and favorable reports from the Senate Judiciary Committee. This followed President Obama's nomination to replace Justice Souter before the Court's new term in October. In July 2005, retirement announcement marked the first pending Court vacancy since 1994. Judge John G. Roberts, Jr. was initially nominated to replace O'Connor, but that nomination was withdrawn when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Roberts was then nominated and confirmed as Chief Justice in September 2005. Harriet Miers was nominated for the O'Connor vacancy but her nomination was withdrawn. Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. was confirmed to the O'Connor seat in January 2006. When Court vacancies arise, the President and Senate can begin work on nominations immediately. In 2005, Court vacancies led to differing timetables between the President and Senate for nominations. President and Senate proposed their own schedules for Roberts, Miers, and Alito nominations. O'Connor's retirement announcement in July 2005 surprised many. President George W. Bush announced Justice O'Connor's retirement from the Supreme Court, creating the first vacancy in 11 years. The urgency to find a new Associate Justice was heightened due to Chief Justice Rehnquist's failing health. Senate aimed to have the Court at full strength by October. President George W. Bush announced Justice O'Connor's retirement from the Supreme Court, creating the first vacancy in 11 years. The Senate Judiciary Committee staff were ready to review background materials on potential nominees, aiming to have the Court back at full strength by the first Monday in October. President Bush nominated John G. Roberts, Jr., a federal appellate judge, to be the next Associate Justice, with the nomination document immediately sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Roberts was initially nominated by President Bush to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. However, after Chief Justice Rehnquist's death, Roberts was withdrawn for the Associate Justice seat and re-nominated for the position of Chief Justice. The Senate Judiciary Committee quickly cancelled the Associate Justice hearings and began Roberts's Chief Justice hearings. He received a favorable vote from the Judiciary Committee and was confirmed by the Senate on September 29, 2005. Roberts then took his oaths of office at the White House later that day. President Bush nominated Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice, and his appointment was completed in time for the Court to be at full strength for the 2005-2006 term. Justice O'Connor remained on the Court until her successor was confirmed. President Bush nominated Harriet E. Miers to succeed O'Connor as Associate Justice, urging the Senate to promptly review her qualifications. President Bush nominated Harriet E. Miers to succeed O'Connor as Associate Justice, urging the Senate to promptly review her qualifications. Roberts urged the Senate to review Miers's qualifications thoroughly and vote on her nomination promptly. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist called for an expedited but careful process, aiming for a floor vote by Thanksgiving. Confirmation hearings could start as early as November 7, 2005, with Senator Arlen Specter emphasizing thoroughness over a specific timetable. Timing of hearings would partly depend on Miers. Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination as Associate Justice after Senate requested documents about her White House service. President Bush reluctantly accepted her withdrawal and nominated Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to replace Justice O'Connor. President urged Senate to act promptly on Alito's nomination. President Bush nominated Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to replace Justice O'Connor. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist predicted a quick timetable for Senate consideration, while Minority Leader Harry Reid suggested it could last into the new year. Confirmation hearings for Alito began on January 9, 2006, with a committee vote scheduled for January 17, 2006. The full Senate was expected to vote on the nomination on January 20, 2006, with a final floor vote anticipated. The Senate Judiciary Committee postponed the January 17 vote on Alito's nomination to January 24, 2006. Majority Leader Bill Frist announced that the full Senate would begin debate the next day and move swiftly to a final vote before President Bush's State of the Union address on January 31, 2006. The committee reported Alito's nomination in a 10-8 party line vote, and the full Senate confirmed him, 58-42. Timing of events for Supreme Court appointments is influenced by key players like sitting Justices, the President, and Senate leaders. The process of filling Court vacancies involves Justices deciding whether to provide advance notice of retirement to the President. For example, Justice Blackmun informed President Clinton four months before retiring, while Justice O'Connor did not give advance notice to President Bush. The mode of notification varies, with informal conversations or formal letters used. Once the President chooses a nominee, they inform the Senate through public announcement and written transmission. After Justices decide on retirement, the President selects a nominee and informs the Senate through public announcement and written transmission. The nomination process may involve a delay between announcement and formal nomination, as seen in President Reagan's nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. The process of Supreme Court nominations involves hearings by the Judiciary Committee, final committee action, and consideration by the full chamber. Key action dates include when a Justice steps down, the President nominates someone, the Senate Judiciary Committee holds hearings, votes on the nomination, and the Senate confirms the nominee. The process of Supreme Court nominations involves formal and informal decisions by the President and the Senate. While key action dates are important, the speed of decision-making from 1900 to the present is also explored in this report. The analysis focuses on Supreme Court nominations from 1900 to 2010, considering both presidential and Senate decision-making processes. It examines the time taken by both institutions to make decisions and act on nominees, including the historical context and the introduction of public confirmation hearings in the 20th century. The analysis of Supreme Court nominations from 1900 to 2010 focuses on the timing of presidential and Senate decision-making processes. It considers when the President first learned of a vacancy and when the Senate became aware of the President's selection. Historical research reveals instances when a President had advance knowledge of an impending vacancy. Research shows that Presidents often knew about upcoming Supreme Court vacancies well before the public announcement. Data sources included historical newspapers, presidential papers, and consultations with presidential libraries. The dates provided in the report may differ from other sources, emphasizing when the President first learned of a nomination opportunity. The report discusses the process of nominating and confirming Supreme Court Justices, including factors that can affect the timeline. It does not take a stance on alternative methodologies. Vacancies on the Court occur due to death, retirement, or resignation, prompting the need for a new appointment. If the Chief Justice position is vacant, the President may nominate a sitting Associate Justice to fill the role. The President can nominate a sitting Associate Justice to become Chief Justice, creating a vacancy. Justices may resign for new government positions, leading to vacancies. If a nomination fails in the Senate, a new nominee must be selected. Justices have lifetime appointments based on \"good Behaviour.\" Many Justices choose to serve as long as possible, with some dying in office, like Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist in 2005. Since 1954, retirement has been the most common way for Justices to leave the bench, with few resignations. Chief Justice Rehnquist's death in 2005 was the first on the Court in decades, with most vacancies since 1954 due to retirements. Only two Justices have resigned in recent history, one to become a U.S. Ambassador and the other amid controversy. Since 1954, retirement has been the most common way for Justices to leave the bench. A failed nomination for Chief Justice and the process of retirement notification to the President are highlighted. Legislation enacted in 1939 allows for retirement due to permanent disability, with prior cases requiring specific Congressional action for retirement benefits. In 1910, Justice William H. Moody received a pension under such circumstances. President may nominate sitting Associate Justices for Chief Justice vacancy, requiring resignation from Court. Rare scenario, attempted four times from 1900-2009, with three confirmations. In 1986, Reagan nominated Rehnquist as Chief Justice. Justices may also be nominated for other political posts, necessitating resignation. Between 1900 and 2009, three Justices resigned from the Court to pursue other public service roles, such as running for President or becoming a U.N. Ambassador. When a Court nomination fails in the Senate, the President can choose to resubmit the nomination or select a new candidate, starting the process over. Withdrawals and rejections can significantly delay the confirmation of Justices, especially for controversial nominees. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Supreme Court faced a tumultuous period of nominations and rejections. Justice Abe Fortas resigned amidst a scandal, leading to failed nominations for Chief Justice. President Nixon's first two nominees were rejected, with Harry A. Blackmun finally confirmed almost a year later. The report provides a timeline of events related to Supreme Court nominations since 1900, including when vacancies became known to the President, nominee announcements, hearing dates, committee and Senate actions. It also presents the number of days elapsed for various time intervals related to the nomination process. The report presents a timeline of events related to Supreme Court nominations since 1900, including when vacancies became known to the President and the number of days elapsed for different stages of the nomination process. The data show a significant difference in the pace of nominations before and after 1980. The report provides a timeline of Supreme Court nominations since 1900, focusing on when vacancies were known to the President. It highlights specific instances when the President had advance knowledge of naming a new Justice. For example, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement announcement on July 1, 2005, marked the beginning of the process as there was no evidence that President George W. Bush knew beforehand. The timeline of Supreme Court nominations since 1900 focuses on when vacancies were known to the President. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement announcement on July 1, 2005, initiated the process, while Chief Justice Warren Burger informed President Reagan of his retirement on May 27, 1986. Dates in Table 1 mark significant milestones in the nomination process. The Senate's first opportunity to consider the nomination is marked, even informally. Presidents have historically announced decisions publicly, with some cases showing a delay between announcement and formal submission to the Senate. Tables provide details on the duration and median number of days for each stage in the Supreme Court Justice nomination process. During the Supreme Court nomination process, the median number of days for each stage is considered the best measure of central tendency. The median is not influenced by extreme values and represents the \"average\" case. However, political context and historical factors can impact the speed of nominations. Each nomination is unique, and various factors affecting the process are discussed in the report. From 1900-2010, Presidents and the Senate took varying amounts of time to act on Supreme Court nominations and confirmations. The median time for Presidents to announce nominees after a vacancy was 28 days, while the Senate took 23.5 days for final action. The entire process lasted a median of 79 days. Some nominations were fast, occurring immediately after a Justice's departure. The process of Supreme Court nominations and confirmations varied in duration from 1900-2010. Presidents took a median of 28 days to announce nominees after a vacancy, while the Senate took 23.5 days for final action, with the entire process lasting a median of 79 days. Some nominations were swift, while others, like the nomination of Potter Stewart, took longer due to delays in announcement and confirmation. The data shows significant changes in decision-making intervals for Supreme Court nominations since 1981. Presidents now announce nominees quicker after learning of vacancies, taking only 19.5 days compared to 34 days from 1900-1980. The time between nominee announcement and Judiciary Committee hearing has also increased, from 12.5 days to 49 days from 1981-2010. The Senate can be actively working on the nomination before hearings begin. Senators met privately with Judge Roberts before his hearings, pressing for the release of records. Committee and floor action from 1981-2010 took slightly longer than before. The Judiciary Committee took 15 days to reach a decision after starting hearings, with a nine-day interval between final committee and Senate action. Total Senate activity increased after the President's nominee announcement. The nomination-and-confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees took longer after 1980 compared to the previous 80 years, with a median duration of 113 days from 1981-2010 versus 59 days from 1900-1980. Some decision-making elements are known only to Presidents, nominees, and select advisors, while others are more apparent. Each nomination has its unique political context, but certain factors consistently influence the speed of the process. The speed of Supreme Court nominations and Senate decisions can be influenced by factors such as how quickly the President announces a nominee and how the vacancy occurred. Sudden deaths of Justices can lead to quick nominations and confirmations, as seen with Justice Frank Murphy and Thomas C. Clark's 30-day process in 1949. When a Supreme Court Justice unexpectedly dies, the President and Senate may not make nomination and confirmation decisions quickly. For example, President Taft waited 50 days to announce a nominee after Justice Peckham's death in 1909. Retirements and resignations can also give the President time to prepare for a replacement, as seen with Justice Douglas's retirement in 1975. President Ford swiftly announced Justice Stevens' nomination after his retirement in 1975, with Congress confirming him shortly after. In contrast, President Clinton took several months to publicly announce Justice Blackmun's retirement and nominate Judge Breyer, leading to a 209-day process for Breyer's nomination. The nomination process for Justice Breyer lasted 209 days, with decisions made before Blackmun's retirement was public. Congress's schedule, especially Senate sessions, impacts the length of Supreme Court nominations. Vacancies during recess or election years can delay nominations, as seen in 1910 when Chief Justice Fuller died during a five-month break in Congress. President Taft waited to submit a nomination until Congress reconvened. President Taft quickly confirmed former Senator Edward D. White as Chief Justice without referring the nomination to the Judiciary Committee. President Eisenhower resorted to recess appointments three times in the 1950s for Supreme Court vacancies, generating controversy. Three of his nominees first received recess appointments before being confirmed as Justices. President Eisenhower's recess appointments to the Supreme Court in the 1950s caused controversy, leading the Senate to pass a resolution opposing future recess appointments. Recess appointments to lower federal courts have also become rare since the late 1960s. While a President's power to make judicial recess appointments was upheld in 1985, they can still be controversial as they bypass the Senate's \"advice and consent\" role. With criticisms of recess appointments in recent decades and the short duration of contemporary Senate recesses, future Supreme Court recess appointments may be less common. In the 21st century, recess appointments to the Supreme Court are rare due to Congress's year-round schedule and the Judiciary Committee's thorough confirmation hearings. Unlike in the past, where Supreme Court nominations were often handled without hearings, today it is expected for nominees to undergo extensive scrutiny before confirmation. In the past, Supreme Court nominations were often handled without hearings, but now nominees undergo extensive scrutiny before confirmation. Nominees did not regularly testify at their own hearings until 1955. Senate floor consideration can be delayed by weeks or months when the Judiciary Committee holds hearings, especially for controversial nominees. For example, Justice Louis D. Brandeis's nomination in 1916 took 105 days from the start of hearings to final committee action, with the final Senate vote coming eight days later. More recently, the Judiciary Committee took 76 days to hold hearings on Robert H. Bork's nomination after President Ronald Reagan's selection. The Senate custom plays a significant role in the nomination process for Supreme Court Justices, especially when former or sitting Senators are nominated. Nominees with Senate backgrounds have historically been quickly confirmed, often without committee hearings or floor debate. For example, former Senator Edward D. White was confirmed as Chief Justice in less than an hour. Since 1900, several Senators nominated to the Court were swiftly confirmed, while others nominated after their Senate service also had expedited confirmation processes. The Senate tradition of bypassing the Judiciary Committee for Supreme Court nominees who are former or sitting Senators has been tested since 1945. The last former Senator nominated to the Court was Judge Sherman Minton in 1949, whose nomination was referred to the Judiciary Committee. Withdrawn, rejected, or controversial nominations can significantly lengthen the confirmation process. The confirmation process for Supreme Court nominations can be prolonged by controversies and delays in the Senate. For example, Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination in 1987 took 119 days from announcement to rejection. Even successful nominees like Attorney General Harlan F. Stone in 1924 faced setbacks, with his confirmation temporarily delayed. The Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process can be lengthy and affected by controversies and delays in the Senate. Judge Clarence Thomas's confirmation in 1991 took 110 days, including hearings on sexual harassment allegations. Understanding the historical timeline of past nominations can provide insight into future decision-making and preparations. The length of time to nominate and confirm or reject a Justice varies widely, with some Senators emphasizing the need for careful consideration and sufficient hearings. Since 1981, the Supreme Court nomination process has seen a substantial increase in the median duration between the President's announcement of a nominee and the start of Judiciary Committee hearings. This has resulted in the Senate's portion of the process taking longer than the President's, contrasting with the period from 1900-1980. The reasons for lengthy nomination-and-confirmation processes have shifted over the years, with recent decades showing slower decision-making despite Congress being in session longer than in the early 20th century. Since 1981, the Supreme Court nomination process has lengthened, with the Senate taking more time to consider nominees. Political context plays a crucial role in understanding the process, as nominations have become battlegrounds for larger debates. The Senate's careful consideration may contribute to the longer decision-making time despite Congress being in session longer than in the early 20th century. The Senate's scrutiny of Supreme Court nominations has increased since 1981, with longer decision-making processes to counterbalance presidential power. Factors like vacancy circumstances, Senate schedule, and nomination controversy influence the speed of nominations and confirmations."
