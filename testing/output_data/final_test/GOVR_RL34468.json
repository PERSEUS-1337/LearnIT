Despite some years of balance, the gap between imports and exports has grown significantly, reaching $11 billion in 2015. The U.S. trade deficit in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables exceeded $11 billion in 2015, with imports surpassing exports since the mid-1990s. Export gains were significant for fresh fruits like strawberries, peaches, apples, grapes, and vegetables like lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, and potatoes. Imports of fresh citrus, strawberries/berries, tropical fruits (excluding bananas), grapes, peaches/pears, plums/apricots, and apples have increased significantly, leading to a trade deficit in fruits and vegetables for the U.S. Bananas and fresh tomatoes, along with other vegetables like bell peppers, account for roughly half of this deficit. Imports of fresh tomatoes, peppers, and other vegetables, along with tropical fruits, grapes, asparagus, cucumbers, canned fruit, fruit juices, and olives, have contributed to the widening gap in U.S. trade. Mexico, Canada, Chile, the European Union, China, Peru, and Costa Rica were the leading suppliers of fruits and vegetables in 2015. Other major import suppliers included Guatemala, Thailand, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, the Philippines, and Ecuador. The main imported products were tomatoes, peppers, bananas, tropical fruits, potatoes, onions, garlic, cucumbers, melon, citrus, grapes, tree fruit, and fruit juices. The current competitive market and trade conditions for fruits and vegetables worldwide are influenced by various factors such as open U.S. import regime, increased competition from low-cost production, non-tariff trade barriers, counter-seasonal supplies, and market factors like exchange rate fluctuations. The demand for fruits and vegetables is influenced by market factors like exchange rate fluctuations and structural changes in the U.S. food industry. Lower tariffs on U.S. imports compared to exports may explain the slower export growth. The global average tariff for fruits and vegetables is over 50%, while in the U.S., about 60% of tariffs are less than 5%. Japan and the EU have higher tariffs, with over 60% ranging from 5%-25%, and some developing countries have tariffs exceeding 25%. Countries like China, Egypt, India, Korea, and Thailand have high tariffs on fruit and vegetable imports, ranging from 25% to over 100%. Leading import suppliers to the United States benefit from trade preferences, allowing duty-free or reduced tariff entry. This may contribute to rapid import growth, giving an advantage to countries with lower production costs compared to the U.S. The United States imports fruits and vegetables from countries with trade preferences, leading to competition with domestically produced commodities. NAFTA has increased trade between the US, Canada, and Mexico, resulting in higher imports and exports of fruits and vegetables. Notably, imports of tomatoes and fresh peppers from Mexico have seen significant growth. Imports of tomatoes and fresh peppers from Mexico and Canada have increased, accounting for half of all U.S. produce imports. Consumer demand for year-round availability of a wider variety of fruits and vegetables has also influenced imports. Chilean imports, especially fresh fruits and fruit juices, have continued to rise since the U.S.-Chile FTA in 2004. Imports under the U.S.-DR-CAFTA FTA were expected to be limited due to existing duty-free access. Imports under DR-CAFTA have increased, particularly tropical fruits and vegetables. U.S. produce growers have raised concerns about unequal market access, but industry representatives now see benefits in opening up markets for U.S. exports globally. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) investigation reports that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement would benefit the U.S. produce sectors through reduced barriers to trade and improved market access, especially for fruit and vegetable imports from countries like China and Europe with lower production costs. Lower production costs in developing countries like China are mainly due to labor-intensive operations with minimal mechanized inputs. Farm subsidies and government support in EU countries also contribute to lower costs for fruit and vegetable production. Despite higher capital and production technology costs in modernized facilities, per-unit labor costs and overall input costs remain much lower compared to the United States. China has significantly lower production costs for tomatoes, peppers, and citrus compared to the United States. The U.S. faces rising costs for energy, transportation, and labor, with farm labor accounting for a significant portion of expenses. Mechanized harvesting is limited for fragile fruits and vegetables, leading to labor shortages exacerbated by immigration laws enforcement. Increased enforcement of immigration laws is causing labor shortages in some production areas, particularly for harvesting tree fruits and specialty row crops. U.S. produce growers are prioritizing immigrant guest worker programs to address this issue. Higher production costs in the United States are also attributed to stringent regulations, such as workers' compensation requirements and environmental regulations. Studies show that these regulations can be costly to producers, especially in California. In contrast, European fruit and vegetable producers benefit from support programs that offset production costs and enhance competitiveness in global markets. EU subsidies for fruit and vegetable vary by commodity. The EU provides various subsidies for its fruit and vegetable sector, including direct farm payments, export subsidies, and promotional aid. These subsidies benefit commodities like tomatoes, cauliflowers, olives, grapes, and citrus. The total support for the EU's fruit and vegetable sector is estimated at $39 million for the 2012/2013 marketing year. Additionally, the EU wine sector received $809 million in support, which includes product-specific support subject to reduction commitments by the WTO. Comparatively, the U.S. expenditures for fruit and vegetable sectors were minimal. In the United States, fruit and vegetable producers do not benefit from traditional federal farm support programs. However, they may indirectly benefit from government research and farm assistance programs. The EU is implementing reforms to its subsidy program for fruits and vegetables to increase market orientation. Developing countries generally do not directly support their fruit and vegetable production. Some countries have government-funded programs to assist farmers with specific varieties, farming practices, research, and market information. Preferential policies and support at the local government level may include production subsidies or income guarantees. Concerns about unfair competition and support in China's agricultural sectors have been raised. The US has filed a complaint against China for not meeting WTO commitments for rice, wheat, and corn. US fruit producers face competitive market pressures from lower-cost foreign producers. U.S. fruit producers face competition from lower-cost foreign producers and countries with subsidized production. Import injury investigations show concerns about imports being sold below fair market value. Dumping petitions filed since the 1990s include charges against various fruit and vegetable imports, with many resulting in higher tariffs for U.S. domestic producers. Non-tariff trade barriers, such as import and inspection requirements, safety standards, and production regulations, can restrict market access for agricultural products. WTO agreements allow governments to implement trade measures to protect human, animal, or plant health without discrimination. The WTO agreements on food safety and animal/plant health are the SPS and TBT Agreements. SPS focuses on disease and pest protection, while TBT covers technical regulations. Requirements vary by commodity and country, including pest restrictions and post-harvest treatments for produce imports/exports. The U.S. faces barriers to fruit and vegetable exports due to phytosanitary requirements, food safety protocols, and marketing standards. Concerns include disease and pest transmission, chemical residues, and pesticide residues. Annual reports by USTR detail SPS and TBT issues across agricultural commodities and trading partners. The U.S. faces barriers to fruit and vegetable exports due to phytosanitary requirements, food safety protocols, and marketing standards, including restrictions on chemical and pesticide residues, treatment and mitigation requirements, import bans, product specifications, and health risks. Non-tariff barriers to trade, such as phytosanitary restrictions, limit U.S. fruit and vegetable exports to countries like Korea, Mexico, and others. Retailers in some countries also have their own standards and practices for imported produce. In some countries, retailers have specific standards and practices for imported produce, such as the EU's GLOBALGAP for fruits and vegetables. These standards cover various aspects like traceability, recordkeeping, soil management, worker health, and environmental issues. However, U.S. trading partners often cite U.S. phytosanitary requirements as barriers to importing these commodities. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulates fresh produce imports in the United States through phytosanitary certificates and importation rules. The United States regulates fresh produce imports through phytosanitary certificates, importation rules, and inspections. Counter-seasonal U.S. imports of fruits and vegetables come from countries like Chile, Argentina, Australia, South Africa, Mexico, and Central American countries. Imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from countries like Mexico and Central America complement U.S. production. Technological advancements have expanded U.S. production seasons, leading to direct competition with imports for products like tomatoes, peppers, and citrus. Additionally, processed fruit and vegetable imports compete with U.S. processed products year-round. Imports of counter-seasonal fruits and vegetables from countries like Mexico and Central America compete with U.S. processed products year-round, benefiting U.S. consumer demand by ensuring year-round supply, introducing new products and varieties, lowering costs, improving eating quality, assuring food safety, and reducing product losses. For example, imports of fresh tomatoes have led to increased overall demand by introducing new domestic varieties valued for taste, quality, and year-round availability. Similarly, imports of peppers, cucumbers, and sweet onions have increased demand by introducing new colors, mini-varieties, and highly regarded products. Between 1980 and 2010, per capita consumption of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables increased, leading to higher demand. Imports of fruits and vegetables nearly doubled, with some commodities like grapes, asparagus, and garlic seeing significant import gains. Imports of fruits and vegetables, including garlic, have increased significantly since 1980, now accounting for at least 50% of consumption. Concerns about lower prices due to increased imports are present, but producer prices remain strong. Exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the U.S. food industry also impact global agricultural trade. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies makes U.S. exports more competitive and cheaper for importing countries, leading to increased price competitiveness. Conversely, a stronger dollar may make U.S. exports less competitive. The USDA's data shows that the steady depreciation of the dollar since 2002 has likely made U.S. agricultural products more price competitive, but the actual impact on imported product prices depends on exporters and importers. Monetary policies, like China's fixed exchange rate, can also influence export competitiveness. Monetary policies, such as China's fixed exchange rate, can impact export potential by affecting price differences between countries. Factors influencing produce trade include evolving business practices like increased consolidation in retail and shipping, new industry trade practices, and emerging technologies. These factors vary by commodity and marketing channel. Structural changes in the U.S. food industry are influenced by economic and market changes, including increased diversification in supply sourcing and foreign investment. U.S. fruit and vegetable trade is increasingly carried out by multinational companies for various reasons, such as building a global supply base and sourcing lower-cost production. The globalization of the food industry has led to lower-cost production in countries with lower input and technology costs, facilitated by economic integration. Multinational companies play a significant role in international trade, with examples like U.S. companies owning subsidiaries overseas that produce goods using U.S.-exported raw materials. Thailand's canned fruit industry heavily relies on imported fruit from the United States, processed by Dole Food Company, and re-exported back to the U.S. Thailand's competitive advantage lies in cheap labor and technology from Dole. Despite minimal domestic production, Thailand is a leading global exporter of canned peaches, pears, and fruit mixtures. U.S. companies sourcing globally may compete with domestic products, as seen in an import injury investigation by U.S. mushroom processors. General Mills, Inc. imports preserved mushrooms produced overseas under its Green Giant brand, citing reasons such as year-round availability and lower labor costs. Some companies use licensing arrangements with foreign producers to market products under their own labels in the US or other markets. The company's own branded labels are sold in the United States and foreign markets. U.S. produce companies implement global business strategies to meet year-round demand, reduce costs, and build an international customer network. The Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance aims to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops. The 2008 farm bill addressed concerns over trade for fruits and vegetables, leading to expanded support for domestic growers. Historically, these crops have not received the same federal support as main commodities. The bill included new provisions for specialty crops and organic production. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized and expanded programs for specialty crops and organic production, including the Market Access Program (MAP) and Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) to address trade barriers and promote exports. The 2008 and 2014 farm bills included provisions supporting specialty crop sectors such as pest and disease management, market data collection, food safety research, and marketing order amendments. These programs aim to enhance exports and trade for specialty crops. More information on farm bill provisions for specialty crops can be found in CRS Report R42771."
