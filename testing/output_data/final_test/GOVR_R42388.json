    "content": "Congress annually considers appropriations measures for discretionary funding for various activities, such as national defense and education. These measures are subject to the congressional appropriations process, which includes the annual appropriations cycle, the relationship between authorization and appropriation measures, types of appropriations measures, budget enforcement, and rescissions. Congress exercises its power under the Constitution to make appropriations by law. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal employees from exceeding appropriations without authorization. Public funds must be used for their intended purpose. The President plays a role in the appropriations process through approval or veto power. The President's influence in the appropriations process is due to various duties imposed by statute, such as submitting an annual budget to Congress. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have jurisdiction over the annual appropriations measures, with each committee organized into subcommittees responsible for developing funding bills for specific departments and activities. The current appropriations subcommittee structure includes 12 subcommittees covering various areas like Agriculture, Defense, and Homeland Security. The President initiates the annual budget cycle by submitting a budget proposal to Congress, recommending spending levels for federal programs and agencies in the form of budget authority (BA). Congress may extend the deadline for budget submission. Budget authority (BA) is the authority provided by federal law to enter into contracts or financial obligations using federal government funds. It allows for immediate or future expenditures and outlays. For example, a FY2016 appropriations act provided $77,349,000 in new budget authority to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for agency operations, giving them legal authority to make payments for supplies and salaries. Outlays occur when government payments are made, and budget authority must be obligated in the fiscal year(s) funds are available. Budget authority must be obligated in the fiscal year(s) in which the funds are available, while outlays may occur over time. Outlays for activities funded by the institute vary based on completion timelines, such as salaries being paid in the same year as budget authority, and construction project outlays spread over several years. Estimates for outlays are based on historical trends during appropriations discussions, with actual data only available after the fiscal year ends. Each agency provides detailed information after the President submits the budget proposal to Congress. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 requires agencies to provide detailed justification materials to appropriations subcommittees. The budget resolution, a concurrent agreement between the House and Senate, sets budgetary and fiscal policy for five fiscal years. It establishes new budget authority and outlay levels for each year and allocates federal spending among functional categories. The budget resolution allocates federal spending among functional categories and sets budget authority and outlay levels for each function. It also establishes spending ceilings for committees and subcommittees within the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The resolution serves as a guide for budget-related bills but does not become law or provide budget authority. The House and Senate use parliamentary rules to enforce spending ceilings on budget-related bills. Points of order can be raised during House consideration of appropriations measures, while the Senate enforces new budget authority and outlay levels during appropriations bill consideration. The Congressional Budget Act sets April 15 as the target date for adopting the budget resolution, but Congress has frequently missed this deadline in recent years. Congress did not adopt a budget resolution in certain fiscal years, leading to delays in establishing spending ceilings. The Congressional Budget Act prohibits House and Senate consideration of appropriations measures before the budget resolution is completed. The House can consider appropriations after May 15 even without a budget resolution, while the Senate can waive this requirement with a majority vote. If the budget resolution is delayed or not adopted, chambers may resort to deeming resolutions. The appropriations process in Congress can be affected by delays in adopting a budget resolution. To address this, chambers may use deeming resolutions. The timing of appropriations stages can vary, with anomalies occurring in many years. Recently, the Senate has sometimes reported original bills before the House, leading to simultaneous consideration of bills by both chambers. The House Appropriations Committee separately reports the 12 regular appropriations bills to the full House. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees report the 12 regular appropriations bills separately to their respective chambers. The process typically begins in May or June, with the Senate starting floor consideration in June or July. Delays in consideration may result in combining multiple bills into omnibus appropriations measures before enactment. Temporary funding measures, such as joint resolutions, are necessary if regular appropriations bills are not completed before the start of the fiscal year to prevent a funding gap and allow agencies to continue operations. After the President submits the budget, House and Senate appropriations subcommittees hold hearings on agency justifications. Subcommittees may solicit requests from Members of Congress for appropriations bills. House and Senate Appropriations Committees make suballocations and subcommittees draft the regular bills. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees consider subcommittee recommendations separately before reporting bills for further consideration. Prior to floor consideration, the House typically adopts a special rule setting parameters for debate on appropriations bills. The House then considers the bill in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union. The rule on an appropriations bill provides for one hour of general debate, including opening statements by the chair and ranking minority member of the appropriations subcommittee. Amendments to the bill are considered after the debate, with requirements such as germaneness and separation between appropriations and other legislation. The House sets rules for amendments to appropriations bills, including limits on amendments in the account section, spending limits from the budget process, and special rules or unanimous consent agreements. Points of order can be raised if an amendment violates these rules, but waivers can be granted. The House sets additional parameters for consideration of appropriations bills, such as limiting debate on amendments or adopting special rules. After the Committee of the Whole completes consideration, the bill and any adopted amendments are reported to the full House for voting. The bill then moves to the Senate, where it is considered as a substitute to the House-passed bill without special rules for setting parameters. The Senate sets parameters for considering appropriations bills by majority vote, with opening statements made by the chair and ranking minority member of the appropriations subcommittee. Amendments must meet Senate rules, precedents, and budget process requirements. Differences in rules with the House include separate consideration of legislation and appropriations, and enforcement of spending limits. Amendments can be proposed in any order. The House and Senate must approve the same measure in the same form before it can be presented to the President. The Appropriations Committees in each chamber negotiate differences between their versions of appropriations bills, often through a conference committee or an exchange of amendments. The Senate typically passes the House bill with the Senate version attached as a single substitute amendment. The House and Senate resolve differences on appropriations bills through designated conferees who negotiate based on disagreements between the two chambers. Conferees are not allowed to include new directed spending provisions in the conference report. The conference report is finalized when a majority of conferees from each chamber sign it, proposing a new substitute for the bill with an explanatory statement. It cannot be amended in either chamber, and the House typically considers it first for appropriations measures. After the conference report is finalized and signed by a majority of conferees from each chamber, the first chamber may adopt, reject, or recommit it. Once adopted, the second chamber can either adopt or reject the report. If rejected, further negotiations may occur. Both houses must agree on the bill before it can be sent to the President. Rules regarding the conference report's content can be enforced or waived during House and Senate consideration. In the Senate, points of order against the conference report can be waived through unanimous consent or motions to waive. If a point of order is sustained, the report falls, but new provisions can be stricken while the remaining ones are retained for further consideration. The Senate can then send the remaining provisions to the House as an amendment between the houses for further consideration. The House may amend the Senate amendment and send it back for further consideration. If the House agrees to the amendment, it goes for presidential action. The Senate can waive points of order with a three-fifths vote. The President has 10 days to sign or veto a bill, which becomes law if no action is taken. If Congress is adjourned, the President can pocket veto a bill. Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds vote. Authorization measures establish or modify agencies and programs, setting spending limits. Annual and multiyear authorizations require reauthorizations. Authorization measures set spending limits for agencies and programs, requiring reauthorizations when they expire. Congressional rules separate appropriations and authorization measures, with different committees overseeing each. House and Senate Appropriations Committees handle appropriations, while legislative committees like the House Committees on Agriculture and Homeland Security or the Senate Committees on Armed Services and the Judiciary handle authorization measures. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees prohibit unauthorized appropriations and legislation in appropriations bills. Unauthorized appropriations are new budget authority for agencies without current authorization or exceeding authorized limits. Legislation in appropriations measures changes existing law and is under the jurisdiction of legislative committees. House rules forbid unauthorized appropriations and legislation in regular and supplemental appropriations bills. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees prohibit unauthorized appropriations and legislation in appropriations bills. House rules do not allow such provisions in continuing resolutions, while Senate rules restrict the content of amendments to regular bills, supplementals, and continuing resolutions. Senate rules also prohibit legislation in both committee and non-committee amendments. The Senate Appropriations Committee follows rules that restrict non-germane amendments and unauthorized appropriations in Senate bills. The committee typically reports House-passed bills with a committee substitute or offers an original Senate bill as a substitute. Senate rules are less restrictive than the House in allowing unauthorized appropriations in certain situations. The Senate Appropriations Committee follows rules restricting non-germane amendments and unauthorized appropriations in Senate bills. An amendment moved by the committee with legislative jurisdiction or in pursuance of a submitted estimate would not be prohibited. Unauthorized appropriations are rarely raised as a point of order due to the distinction between authorization and appropriation in House and Senate rules. Unauthorized appropriations, if enacted, are generally available for obligation or expenditure. Legislative provisions in annual appropriations acts have the force of law unless specified otherwise. There are three types of appropriations measures: regular bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental measures. Congress may consider 12 regular bills, continuing resolutions, and supplemental measures in a calendar year. The appropriations process involves 12 regular appropriations bills annually, each developed by a subcommittee. These bills contain various budget accounts for department and agency funding. Each account includes similar programs or projects, with some accounts funding only one item. The appropriations process involves 12 regular appropriations bills annually, each developed by a subcommittee. These bills contain various budget accounts for department and agency funding, with each account funding a single program, project, or item. Appropriations measures may also provide transfer authority for agencies to shift budget authority between accounts or funds. Agencies are prohibited from making transfers without statutory authority. Reprogramming allows agencies to shift budget authority within an account without additional statutory authority. Appropriations subcommittees have oversight procedures for reprogramming actions. Congress may combine multiple appropriations bills into omnibus measures for approval. During conference on regular appropriations bills, conferees may create an omnibus appropriations measure by adding final agreements on outstanding bills. Omnibus acts can include full text of each bill or reference them, and may take the form of full-year continuing resolutions. Packaging bills together can efficiently resolve differences within Congress or between Congress and the President. Omnibus measures allow negotiators to make trade-offs between bills, ensuring timely completion of appropriations. Budget authority from regular appropriations expires on September 30, leading to temporary funding through joint resolutions to avoid agency shutdowns. Continuing resolutions (CRs) are used when regular appropriations are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year. Congress and the President typically pass an initial CR to temporarily fund government activities until all regular appropriations bills are completed. CRs generally provide funding at a rate or formula based on the previous fiscal year's levels, with some adjustments. Continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding until regular appropriations bills are passed. Additional CRs may extend funding and sometimes change funding methods. Full-year CRs can also be enacted to continue funding through the fiscal year for multiple regular bills. Supplemental appropriations are additional funding requested by the President and enacted by Congress to address inadequate or untimely resources provided in regular appropriations. They are used for unforeseen needs like disaster response costs, with specific funding for individual accounts. Sometimes included in regular bills or CRs, supplementals are separate from regular appropriations and provide funding based on specific amounts rather than a rate for operations. Budget enforcement for appropriations measures under the congressional budget process has statutory and procedural elements derived from the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA). The BCA imposes limits on discretionary spending each fiscal year through FY2021, while the CBA process provides procedural limits on budget authority for the upcoming fiscal year. The BCA sets separate limits for \"defense\" and \"nondefense\" discretionary spending categories. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) imposes limits on discretionary spending each fiscal year through FY2021. The limits are calculated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and reported with the President's budget submission. If spending exceeds the limits, enforcement occurs through sequestration. Enforcement of spending limits under the Budget Control Act primarily occurs through sequestration, which automatically cancels budget authority through across-the-board reductions of non-exempt programs. Evaluations and necessary sequestration happen at specified times after appropriations measures are enacted, with the first evaluation occurring 15 days after Congress adjourns a session sine die. Discretionary spending limits are also enforceable procedurally through points of order raised under Section 314(f) of the CBA. The Budget Control Act enforces spending limits through sequestration, which cancels budget authority through across-the-board reductions. Section 314(f) prohibits measures that exceed limits, which can be waived by the House or Senate. The budget resolution allocates spending ceilings to House and Senate committees, including the Appropriations Committee, for discretionary and direct spending. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations control spending through appropriations acts. These acts provide budget authority for discretionary programs and direct spending programs, including appropriated entitlements. The Appropriations Committees have limited control over the amount of budget authority provided for entitlement programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have limited control over budget authority provided for entitlement programs. After receiving 302(a) allocations, they subdivide the amount among subcommittees with 302(b) suballocations. These allocations become effective once reported by the committees and may be revised. Spending ceilings from the annual budget resolution apply to appropriations measures for a single fiscal year. The House and Senate may use deeming resolutions if the budget resolution is delayed, providing temporary spending ceilings for appropriations committees. The FY2007 total spending ceilings and 302(a) allocations were set for enforcement purposes. In FY2014 and FY2015, an alternative mechanism for budget enforcement was enacted. This allowed the chairs of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees to establish budgetary levels for their chambers, forming the basis for subsequent suballocations. The restrictions on appropriations associated with the budget resolution are enforced procedurally through points of order that can be raised on the House and Senate floors. Two CBA points of order, under Sections 302(f) and 311(a), enforce the 302(a) allocation to the Appropriations Committees and the 302(b) suballocations to their subcommittees. These points of order apply to committee-reported appropriations bills, certain non-reported appropriations bills, amendments, and conference reports. If an appropriation violates these rules, the legislation or amendment cannot be considered. The 302(f) point of order restricts exceeding committee 302(a) or subcommittee 302(b) allocations in appropriations bills. The 311(a) point of order prevents exceeding total budget authority and outlay ceilings in the budget resolution for the fiscal year. These points of order apply to discretionary spending and amendments proposing additional budget authority are prohibited. The House considers spending measures that could potentially exceed set ceilings. The Fazio Exception exempts legislation if it doesn't surpass committee allocations. New requirements in the 112th through 114th Congresses affect House consideration of appropriations bill amendments. H.Res. 5 (114th Congress) establishes a point of order against amendments proposing a net increase in budget authority. The FY2015 budget resolution established points of order in both the House and Senate to prevent increases in direct spending programs above specified levels. The Senate 302(f) point of order prohibits new budget authority legislation that would exceed the applicable spending ceilings. The Senate 311(a) point of order is similar to the House version but does not have an exception like the Fazio Exception. The FY2015 budget resolution established points of order in both chambers to prevent increases in direct spending programs. Senators can motion to waive these points of order, requiring a three-fifths majority vote. In the House and Senate, a three-fifths vote of all Senators is required to approve a waiver motion for certain points of order. Discretionary appropriations can be exempt from budget enforcement limits through designations provided under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. These designations include emergency requirements, Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, continuing disability reviews, health care fraud and abuse control, and disaster relief. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act allows for designations such as emergency requirements, Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, continuing disability reviews, health care fraud and abuse control, and disaster relief. Emergency requirements provide additional budget authority for unanticipated needs, while OCO/GWOT designation is used for expenses related to overseas operations. Continuing disability reviews and redeterminations budget authority are for activities under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. HCFAC funds can be used for any program at the Department of Health and Human Services. The BBEDCA specifies maximum amounts exempt from spending limits for disaster relief activities under the Stafford Act. Unused designations can be carried over to the following fiscal year. House amendments can strike emergency designated amounts in appropriations measures. In the Senate, amounts designated as an emergency are subject to a point of order under Section 314(e), which can be waived by a three-fifths vote. The House prohibits emergency, OCO/GWOT, and disaster relief designations in general appropriations bills. Rescissions cancel previously enacted budget authority. The President can recommend rescissions to Congress, which are used to cancel budget authority for changed priorities. If Congress does not approve within 45 days, the budget authority must be made available for obligation. Congress can approve, reject, or modify the President's recommended rescissions. For example, in 2005, the President requested rescissions from the Department of Defense. Congress has the authority to approve rescissions to cancel budget authority. In a recent example, Congress rescinded $80 million from the DOD, Operations and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account and $48.6 million from the DOD, Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation, Army account. Rescissions must be enacted into law and can be included in separate measures or appropriations bills."
