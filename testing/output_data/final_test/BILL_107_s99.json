    "content": "The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 2001\" allows for a credit for employer expenses for child care assistance under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Child Care Infrastructure Act of 2001\" provides a tax credit for employer-provided child care expenses. The credit is 25% of qualified child care expenditures and 10% of qualified child care resource and referral expenditures, not exceeding $150,000 per year. Qualified child care expenditure includes costs for property acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, or expansion for child care purposes. The tax credit is available for expenses related to a qualified child care facility, excluding costs for the taxpayer's or employee's principal residence. It also covers operating costs, including training expenses. The tax credit covers expenses for training employees, scholarship programs, increased compensation for employees with child care training, contracting with a child care facility, and reimbursing employees for child care expenses enabling them to work. This excludes costs for the taxpayer's or employee's home and includes operating costs. The tax credit covers qualified child care expenditures for before and after school programs, holiday programs, and camp programs at qualified child care facilities meeting state regulations. Expenses must not exceed the fair market value of care provided. The tax credit applies to qualified child care facilities meeting state regulations, excluding facilities that are the operator's principal residence. To be eligible, enrollment must be open to the taxpayer's employees, and if the facility is the taxpayer's main business, at least 30 employees must be enrolled. The tax credit applies to qualified child care facilities where at least 30% of enrollees are dependents of the taxpayer's employees. The facility must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Qualified child care resource and referral expenditure covers expenses for child care resource and referral services for the taxpayer's employees. The tax credit applies to qualified child care facilities that do not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. If there is a recapture event with respect to a facility, the taxpayer's tax will be increased by a certain percentage. The tax credit for qualified child care facilities may result in an increase in the taxpayer's tax if there is a recapture event, based on the applicable recapture percentage and the decrease in credits for prior years. The recapture percentage is determined from a specific table. The applicable recapture percentage for qualified child care facilities varies depending on the year of the recapture event, starting at 100% in Years 1-3 and decreasing to 0% in Years 11 and thereafter. Year 1 begins when the qualified child care facility is put into service by the taxpayer. A recapture event includes the cessation of facility operation or a change in ownership of the facility. The taxpayer acquiring an interest in a facility can avoid recapture liability if they agree in writing to assume the liability of the previous owner. The acquiring taxpayer will be treated as the taxpayer for recapture liability purposes. The tax for the taxable year will only be increased for credits allowed by this section. The increase in tax under this subsection will not affect credits used to reduce tax liability. No recapture will occur due to a casualty loss if the facility is restored within a reasonable period. The tax credit can be restored by reconstruction or replacement within a reasonable period set by the Secretary. Special rules apply for aggregation, pass-thru in estates and trusts, and allocation in partnerships. No double benefit is allowed, and a reduction in basis may occur if a credit is determined for any property. The basis of property may be reduced by the amount of a credit determined under certain circumstances. If a recapture amount is determined, the basis of the property can be increased by that amount. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow the employer-provided child care credit under section 45E, with no other deductions or credits permitted for this credit. The amendments made by this section allow for the employer-provided child care credit under section 45E, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
