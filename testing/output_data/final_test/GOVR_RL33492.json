    "content": "President Obama announced grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail, including $112 million for improvements to the Northeast Corridor. Congress passed a transportation appropriations act providing $1.565 billion for Amtrak in FY2010. The legislation also allocated $2.5 billion for high-speed rail projects, with Amtrak eligible for funding. Amtrak is required to implement procedures for passengers to transport firearms in checked baggage. Amtrak extended interim CEO Joseph Boardman's appointment indefinitely in December 2009. Congress allocated $1.490 billion for Amtrak in FY2009 and $1.3 billion for capital grants in February 2009. In October 2008, the 110th Congress passed an Amtrak reauthorization bill. Congress passed the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, authorizing nearly $10 billion over five years for Amtrak, including capital and operating grants, debt service, and funding for high-speed rail corridors. This marked a significant increase in funding for intercity passenger rail compared to previous years. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized funding for Amtrak and high-speed rail corridors. It established procedures for proposals and Amtrak's priority over freight trains. Amtrak, created by Congress in 1970, is the nation's main intercity passenger rail service provider. Amtrak, established by Congress in 1970, operates intercity passenger rail service in the United States. Despite being a for-profit corporation, it has not been able to make a profit and has received significant federal assistance. Amtrak employs around 19,000 people and operates 44 routes over 21,000 miles of track, with most of the track owned by freight rail companies. The company owns about 625 route miles of track, including the heavily used Northeast Corridor (NEC). Amtrak operates on heavily used segments of track, with commuter and freight trains making up the majority of traffic on the Northeast Corridor (NEC). The company runs corridor routes under 400 miles and long-distance routes over 400 miles, some of which receive state assistance. Amtrak also provides commuter services under contract with local authorities. Despite the Administration requesting less funding, Congress typically provides around $1.3 billion annually to keep Amtrak operational. Amtrak received $2.8 billion in funding midway through FY2009, bringing the total to $7.9 billion over five years. The Department of Transportation Inspector General stated that Amtrak needs $2 billion annually to restore the system and develop corridor service. A new federal intercity passenger rail strategy is deemed necessary. The current model for intercity passenger service is financially unstable and provides poor quality. Despite efforts to change Amtrak's structure and funding, the system is in a state of disrepair, in debt, and on the brink of collapse. Amtrak has been criticized for its management and performance, leading to the firing of its CEO. Amtrak's new CEO, Alexander Kummant, testified before Congress about the importance of long-distance trains and the growth potential of rail corridors between city pairs of 300-500 miles. He emphasized that developing these corridors would drive Amtrak's future. Congress has included provisions in recent appropriations to bring greater transparency to Amtrak's finances. In FY2003, legislation (P.L. 108-7; 117 STAT 11) aimed to increase transparency in Amtrak's finances and give the Department of Transportation more control over its funding. Amtrak must submit an annual Strategic Plan to Congress, provide monthly financial statements, and receive funding through grants from the Secretary of Transportation. Additional requirements were added in the 2008 reauthorization legislation (P.L. 110-432), including performance improvement plans for long-distance routes and reviews of accessibility compliance. Amtrak runs a deficit of over a billion dollars each year, with long-distance routes being the most unprofitable. In 2004, these routes incurred operating losses of over $600 million. Eliminating long-distance service would only reduce operating losses by about $300 million. Long-distance trains only account for 15% of total intercity rail ridership, with 77% of passengers traveling only portions of the routes. The DOT IG estimated that Amtrak could save between $75 million and $158 million annually by eliminating the highly subsidized sleeper class service from its long-distance trains. Amtrak began restructuring sleeper class service in 2006, expecting to save up to $20 million in FY2007. Amtrak faces major liabilities from deferred maintenance and debt. Amtrak faces major liabilities due to deferred maintenance and accumulated debt, with an estimated $6 billion in backlogged capital maintenance needs. The DOT IG has criticized Amtrak's deferral of maintenance projects, which increases the risk of system failure. Amtrak requires around $1.5 billion to $2 billion in federal support annually for operating and capital needs. Amtrak requires $1.5 to $2 billion in federal funding annually, the highest level ever. Despite cost-cutting measures and increased ridership, expenses remain high. The DOT IG suggests addressing state-supported routes, route restructuring, and labor contracts to reduce federal subsidy. Amtrak's latest labor agreement did not provide flexibility in work rules. Amtrak competes with airlines in labor productivity on corridor routes. Its major cost categories are operating losses of long-distance trains and maintenance costs of the Northeast Corridor. Reducing system size could significantly cut deficits in the long run, but short-term deficits would persist even if long-distance trains were eliminated due to severance payments. Amtrak's interpretation of 49 U.S.C. 24701 requires nationwide service, hindering significant cost reductions. Amtrak's nationwide service is supported by many Members of Congress, with same-route ridership increasing since FY2004. Despite revenue growth, Amtrak still faces deficits, with expenses outpacing revenues. Annual losses have decreased from $1.331 billion in FY2004 to $1.160 billion in FY2008. Amtrak's appropriations are part of the Department of Transportation funding, with Congress providing $1.325 billion for FY2008. President Bush had requested $900 million for Amtrak. Amtrak requested $1.671 billion in funding for FY2008, citing increasing costs such as fuel, healthcare, and wages. The budget did not include $114 million in back pay recommended by the President Emergency Board. Amtrak also highlighted issues with cracking concrete ties on the Northeast Corridor. The contractor is obligated to replace defective ties, but labor costs are not covered. Amtrak's fleet is aging, making rolling stock replacement a priority. Congress allocated $1.490 billion for Amtrak in 2009, with additional funds for state grants. Operating grants include costs from a \"back pay\" agreement. In 2009, Congress allocated $1.490 billion for Amtrak, with additional funding for state grants. Amtrak received $1.3 billion for capital grants, including $450 million for capital security grants. Congress also provided $8 billion for high-speed rail projects, intercity passenger rail projects, and rail congestion relief grants, with Amtrak eligible for grants. President Obama announced grants from this funding, including $112 million for improvements to the Northeast Corridor. Other grants will fund projects like improvements to Amtrak stations and routes not owned by Amtrak. In FY2010, the Obama Administration requested $1.502 billion for Amtrak, including $572.3 million for operating grants and $929.6 million for capital grants. Amtrak's own budget request was $1.84 billion, with Congress providing $1.584 billion. Additionally, Congress allocated $2.5 billion for grants for intercity passenger rail and high-speed rail service, with Amtrak eligible for funding. In June 2009, Amtrak's Inspector General resigned, leading to an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding Amtrak's OIG as an independent agency, separate from Amtrak's appropriation under FRA. This shift was confirmed during the Senate floor consideration of the THUD bill. An amendment was added requiring Amtrak to allow passengers to transport firearms. The amendment added to the bill required Amtrak to allow passengers to transport firearms in checked baggage by March 31, 2010, or risk losing federal funding. Amtrak had prohibited this practice after 9/11 but was given one year to implement procedures for firearm transport. Amtrak's previous authorization expired in December 2002, and reauthorization was delayed due to disagreements over U.S. passenger rail policy. During the reauthorization of Amtrak, Congress considered various options for passenger rail funding, including providing higher levels of funding for expansion, maintaining the current system, focusing on economically justified corridors, reducing funding and network, or eliminating Amtrak altogether. Various combinations of these options were possible. The DOT IG stated that federal funding of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion is needed to prevent service cuts for Amtrak, but more funding is required for system repair and new corridor development. Congress was urged to consider Amtrak's lack of competition, state involvement in service decisions, and the need for infrastructure repair funding. Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott introduced an Amtrak reauthorization bill in the 110th Congress. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg and Senator Trent Lott introduced the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 (S. 294) to provide funding for Amtrak, including operating and capital grants totaling $9.6 billion for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The bill allowed states to use operators other than Amtrak for rail service and created a capital match program with an 80% federal share for new or improved intercity rail service. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 (S. 294) aimed to provide funding for Amtrak, with operating and capital grants totaling $9.6 billion for fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The bill required Amtrak to reduce operating subsidies by 40% over time and expanded the board of directors. S. 294 was approved by the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and passed by the full Senate with amendments. Amendments rejected included limiting per-passenger subsidies and increasing routes for competitive bid. The House version of an Amtrak reauthorization bill (H.R. 6003) was introduced on May 8, 2008, and passed by the House with amendments on June 11, 2008. The bill authorized $6.7 billion in grants for Amtrak for FY2009-FY2013, including capital grants, operating grants, debt service, and ADA compliance. Amendments accepted included requiring Amtrak to publish annual revenue and cost amounts for each route, giving additional consideration to states with limited Amtrak service, and expressing the need to maintain Amtrak as a national passenger rail system. The House bill for Amtrak reauthorization included $1.8 billion for high-speed rail corridors, with one between Washington, DC, and New York City. Private companies would bid for the project, and Amtrak was required to submit a plan for service restoration between New Orleans and Sanford, Florida. The House and Senate bills for Amtrak reauthorization involve the Surface Transportation Board (STB) in resolving disputes between freight railroads and passenger train interests. The Senate bill allows for investigation into on-time performance issues, while the House bill requires non-binding mediation for access to freight railroad right-of-ways for passenger service. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak, providing $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013. This included operating grants, capital grants, grants for debt repayment, and funding for Amtrak's Inspector General. The act also authorized new federal intercity passenger rail grant programs for Amtrak. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013, including operating and capital grants. It also authorized new federal intercity passenger rail grant programs for Amtrak, with funding for facilities, infrastructure, and equipment to improve intercity passenger rail transportation, high-speed rail corridor development, and congestion relief. Total authorized funding for these programs is $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion, and $325 million respectively over FY2009-FY2013. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013. The act directs FRA and Amtrak to jointly develop measurement criteria and minimum standards to measure Amtrak's performance and service quality. It also establishes methodologies for route decisions, cost allocation, and on-time performance investigations. STB may award damages for on-time performance issues and conduct non-binding mediation between parties. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 reauthorized Amtrak with $9.8 billion in funding for FY2009-FY2013. It requires the STB to conduct non-binding mediation between freight railroads and public transit authorities seeking access to freight railroad right-of-ways for passenger service. The act also increased Amtrak's Board of Directors from 7 to 9 persons, including the Secretary of Transportation, the President of Amtrak, and 7 persons appointed by the President."
