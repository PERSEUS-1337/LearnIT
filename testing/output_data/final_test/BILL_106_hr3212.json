    "content": "The Act titled \"International Extradition Enforcement Act of 1999\" requires an annual report on extradition efforts between the United States and foreign governments. The Secretary of State and the Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress by January 1 each year on efforts to extradite individuals held in custody by foreign governments to the United States for major extraditable offenses. The annual report must include information on individuals held in custody by foreign governments for major extraditable offenses like murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault, kidnapping, abduction, false imprisonment, or rape. The annual report must detail individuals held in custody by foreign governments for major extraditable offenses and provide reasons for their non-extradition to the United States along with actions taken to secure extradition. SEC. 3. SANCTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS UNCOOPERATIVE IN EXTRADITION WITH THE UNITED STATES. Prohibition on Development and Security Assistance: Development and security assistance cannot be given to a foreign government identified as uncooperative in extradition efforts with the United States. Development assistance refers to aid under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, while security assistance includes aid under specific chapters of the same Act. The President must oppose any proposal for assistance benefiting uncooperative foreign governments in extradition efforts. Consular officers are prohibited from issuing visas to high-ranking officials identified by the Secretary of State. The President must identify annually uncooperative foreign governments in extradition efforts. High-ranking officials from these countries are prohibited from receiving visas from consular officers. The President must annually identify uncooperative foreign governments in extradition efforts based on various criteria, including failure to extradite US citizens and individuals involved in major offenses. The President must annually report to Congress on foreign governments that hinder extradition processes due to corruption. The President can waive assistance restrictions if it is in the US national interest. Congressional review allows for a joint resolution within 60 days to disapprove a certification by the President regarding a foreign government. If disapproved, funds for development and security assistance are restricted, opposition to multilateral assistance is required, and denial of visas for high-ranking officials of the government is mandated. The Attorney General will establish formal complaint procedures related to extradition request denials. The Attorney General will establish procedures for a State to submit a formal complaint if a foreign country fails to extradite individuals to the United States as requested. SEC. 4. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. This section amends the penalties for flight to avoid prosecution and transfers to persons resisting extradition in the United States Code. Flight to avoid prosecution now carries a penalty of 15 years instead of five years. Transferring anything of value to a person resisting extradition can result in a fine or imprisonment for up to 10 years. SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act and its amendments do not impact extradition treaties between the United States and foreign governments."
