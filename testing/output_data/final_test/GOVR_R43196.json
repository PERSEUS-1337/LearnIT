    "content": "The future of U.S. engagement in Afghanistan post-2014 is uncertain due to stalled negotiations on a bilateral security agreement. President Obama is willing to maintain a troop presence, but President Karzai introduced new conditions that the U.S. rejected. The U.S. rejected new conditions set by President Karzai for a bilateral security agreement, including limitations on U.S. forces' participation in raids and the release of Afghan prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Failure to confirm the agreement could lead to a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces by the end of 2014. NATO has approved a post-2014 effort called Resolute Support, contingent on the U.S.-Afghan BSA. The size and authorities of the U.S. force presence in Afghanistan post-2014 are still pending. President Obama is expected to make a decision on the U.S. force presence in Afghanistan post-2014, focusing on counter-terrorism and supporting the Afghan National Security Forces. The key question is how all facets of U.S. engagement in Afghanistan fit together in a coherent political strategy to end the war. In recent months, Afghanistan has seen progress in security, political, and economic transitions. This includes Afghan government taking lead responsibility for security, President Karzai signing election laws, and international donors focusing on economic self-sufficiency. The international donor community reinvigorated attention towards Afghanistan in July 2013, with renewed efforts in Afghan-Pakistani border security and reconciliation. The opening of a Taliban political office in Doha, Qatar, marked a significant milestone in June 2013. The challenge lies in how these efforts can be coordinated to lay a foundation for future stability in Afghanistan, particularly in leveraging security gains to shape the political landscape. The ground can be leveraged to shape the political landscape and catalyze political progress to protect U.S. interests. Congress needs to oversee the costs of a continued U.S. force presence in Afghanistan, resetting the force, accountability for strategy, integration of efforts across government agencies, and prioritization of efforts compared to other national security priorities. This report summarizes the strategic context for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and analyzes recent progress and remaining requirements. The report summarizes recent progress and remaining requirements for the war in Afghanistan, including U.S. national security interests, essential conditions for long-term protection, current and projected approaches, sustainability timeline, risks, and overall importance of the effort. The report discusses U.S. national security interests in Afghanistan and the region, including concerns about violent extremism, nuclear proliferation, and potential conflict between Pakistan and India. There is debate among observers and practitioners about the importance of these interests compared to other U.S. priorities. The Obama Administration's core goals for the war in Afghanistan are to defeat al-Qaeda and prevent future safe havens. There have been refinements in the strategic architecture over time, with a focus on defeating the core of al Qaeda. The framework for U.S. efforts in Afghanistan dates back to 2009 when General Stanley McChrystal took command of NATO's ISAF. The Obama Administration's core goals for the war in Afghanistan are to defeat al-Qaeda and prevent future safe havens. The ISAF conducted an initial strategic assessment based on these goals, leading to a campaign design with increased troops, civilian expertise, and resources. However, major constraints were introduced, including a troop surge announced by President Obama in 2009 and a Transition process agreed upon at the NATO Lisbon Summit in 2010. In early 2011, President Obama announced a plan to draw down U.S. surge forces in Afghanistan. The troop commitment would decrease by 10,000 troops by the end of 2011 and by a further 23,000 by September 2012, reaching a total of 68,000. The mission would transition from combat to support, with Afghans assuming lead responsibility for security by mid-2013. President Obama later announced a further drawdown of 34,000 troops in February 2013. Obama announced a drawdown of 34,000 troops in Afghanistan by February 2014, leaving approximately 33,000 troops. The international community's commitment to Afghanistan has been extended until 2024, including the NATO security partnership and the U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership Agreement. President Obama confirmed in early 2013 that U.S. forces would continue to be involved in Afghanistan after 2014, focusing on training Afghan forces and conducting targeted counterterrorism missions. Key questions for U.S. strategy in Afghanistan include prioritizing interests such as countering al Qaeda, preventing weapons proliferation, nuclear confrontation, upholding human rights, and maintaining U.S. leadership. The U.S. government is evaluating the appropriateness of its goals and objectives in Afghanistan for protecting national security interests. The focus is on building up competent Afghan forces while reducing the insurgent threat to manageable levels. The key question is the relative priority of Afghanistan and its region for the U.S. government, both before and after 2014. The campaign in Afghanistan has seen improvements in Afghan forces and degradation of the insurgency, with support from the international community. Observers suggest that if the campaign is not effective, it should be stopped immediately due to its high cost in lives and resources. Afghan National Army (ANA) has shown growth in warfighting skills and confidence, with commanders outlining specific plans for counter-insurgency campaigns. The drawdown of U.S. troops in 2012 led Afghan security leaders to take on greater responsibility and have more confidence in their abilities. Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) commanders have successfully conducted missions and applied lessons learned from previous operations, leading to more positive outcomes. For example, the ANA 205th Corps carried out the Kalak Hode series of operations in Kandahar, Zabul, and Uruzgan in 2012-2013. The ANSF conducted the Kalak Hode series of operations in Kandahar, Zabul, and Uruzgan provinces, learning the importance of continuous planning and execution. ANSF progress is measured by their resilience in the face of setbacks, with anecdotal evidence showing growing resilience in 2013. For example, the 2nd Brigade of the 201st ANA Corps in Kunar province demonstrated resilience during the fighting season. The 2nd Brigade of the 201st ANA Corps in Kunar province had an observation post overrun by insurgents during a deliberate operation in Marawara district. Despite heavy losses, the ANSF managed to retake the OP and expressed confidence in their campaign execution. There has been increased integration of effort across the ANSF, with combined Army/police planning becoming the norm. Weekly or bi-weekly provincial-level security shuras have helped unify Afghan forces' efforts. The ANSF in a province has shown increased unity of effort, with Afghan forces coming to each other's aid without waiting for orders from Kabul or coalition forces. Unity of effort requires a shared understanding of roles and resources, which varies depending on the security challenges and development of each Afghan force in different areas. For example, in 2013, the ANA struggled to leave checkpoints in some places, waiting for capable Afghan or local forces. The ANA struggled to leave checkpoints in some areas, waiting for available Afghan uniformed or local police to take their place. The Afghan Border Police were inactive in some regions, beyond the reach of other Afghan forces. The Afghan National Civil Order Police frustrated other forces with their direct reporting chain to Kabul. Personalities like strong ANA Corps Commanders and cult-of-personality police chiefs were influential in the Afghan security landscape. Police chiefs like Abdul Raziq in Kandahar and Matiullah Khan in Uruzgan are expected to continue playing a significant role in Afghan security. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) will require a structured division of labor for efficient resource allocation. Currently, the ANSF's target endstrength is 352,000, but it may not be achieved until 2017 due to delays in developing the Afghan Air Force. After the NATO ISAF mission, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were supposed to reduce to 228,500 troops, but concerns led to maintaining the endstrength at 352,000. Insurgent activity follows a cyclical pattern with an annual fighting season and a winter lull for rest and recuperation. The insurgent threat in Afghanistan is concentrated in the eastern and southern areas, with easy access to safe havens in Pakistan. Despite not being defeated in 2013, insurgent networks were degraded, facing increased costs and using longer transit routes. The insurgency in Afghanistan targeted Afghan forces and civilians, including the ALP and anti-Taliban movements, as international efforts decreased. Insurgent groups became more fractured politically and struggled to justify killing fellow Afghans. The insurgency in Afghanistan became increasingly fractured politically and operationally, with divisions on political settlement efforts and targeting. The ability of coalition forces to adapt to advisory roles post-2014 is seen as crucial for any continued presence. Adaptation has been rapid and effective, transitioning from unilateral fighting to full unit-partnering with Afghan forces. The coalition forces in Afghanistan transitioned from unilateral fighting to full unit-partnering with Afghan forces post-2014. As Afghan capabilities improved, coalition forces began stepping back and focusing on tailored advisory and enabling activities. In 2013, there was a debate among coalition commanders about the effects they needed to generate and when to step back further from the fight. This adaptation was driven by troop drawdowns and the need to reorganize accordingly. The adaptation in Afghanistan was necessitated by troop drawdowns and base closures, particularly after the surge recovery of U.S. troops in 2012. ISAF commanders noted the need for faster adjustments in force posture and priorities. Key questions include how to gauge campaign progress, evaluate ANSF confidence, resilience, unity of effort, and assess the strength of the insurgency. In 2013, discussions revolved around the effectiveness of coalition forces in Afghanistan post-NATO ISAF mission, with debates on the future roles and presence of coalition forces. The post-2014 NATO Resolute Support effort in Afghanistan focuses on the purpose of the presence, including enabling and advising roles for coalition forces to assist the Afghan National Security Forces. The key challenge lies in creating a strong bridge between reliance on coalition and Afghan enablers. The post-2014 NATO Resolute Support effort in Afghanistan aims to create a strong bridge between coalition and Afghan enablers. Afghan forces may have better human intelligence due to cultural ties, but face hurdles in utilizing coalition intelligence for operations. The challenges in transitioning Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) to rely on Afghan sources include determining when to provide information based on coalition assets, reducing the insurgent threat indirectly through ANSF, and addressing hurdles in ANSF's reliance on their own intelligence. The challenges in transitioning Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) to rely on Afghan sources include the tough challenge of \"air\" support. The Afghan Air Force (AAF) is still developing and will have limited capacity and capabilities. ANSF have heavily relied on coalition close air support (CAS) for fires, but are working towards integrating their own CAS capability. A combination of CAS and ground-based systems is seen as a more realistic solution for delivering fires. In 2013, progress was made in integrating D-30 Howitzers and mortars for casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), crucial for saving lives. In 2013, Afghan National Army (ANA) Corps Commanders prioritized casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) for saving lives and maintaining recruitment. The Afghan Air Force's limitations make a CASEVAC system relying solely on air assets unrealistic. A combination of air and ground transportation is necessary for a complex CASEVAC system, including point-of-injury skills and trauma care. Progress was made by the end of 2013 in ANSF's ability to CASEVAC by air, but institutionalizing a comprehensive CASEVAC system will take time. The concept of \"less is more\" emerged among coalition forces in Afghanistan, emphasizing letting Afghan forces take the lead and allowing them to solve problems on their own. However, this led to the misconception that advising meant simply \"doing less.\" Advising actually involves various activities such as mentoring ANSF leadership and helping build effective staffs. Building effective staffs within the ANSF involves creating individual staff sections and fostering unity of effort at the provincial level. Tailored ministerial support is also crucial, including technical assistance and senior-level mentorship to help Afghans develop prioritized systems like planning, resourcing, personnel management, and logistics. This process requires patience and the understanding that systems cannot be built overnight. Questions to inform debates about next steps in the campaign include the required capabilities of the ANSF, the necessary endstrength and force mix, the essential enablers for protecting the Afghan people, prioritizing enablers to maintain Afghan confidence, and the extent of direct enabler support from the coalition. Additionally, considerations should be made regarding the level of risk the ANSF can assume and whether certain planned capabilities are truly necessary. The debate surrounding next steps in the campaign in Afghanistan includes questions about the necessary capabilities, endstrength, force mix, enablers for protecting the Afghan people, and the level of risk the ANSF can assume. It is important to provide clarity on the scope, scale, and duration of future U.S. commitment to bolster confidence and discourage hedging by the ANSF, Afghan leadership, and people, as well as to send a clear signal of resolve to the insurgency and catalyze commitments from other coalition partners. The curr_chunk discusses the future requirements for U.S. and coalition advisory and enabling support to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), including the risks of miscalculations and the need for a serious troop-to-task analysis. It also raises questions about future counter-terrorism (CT) requirements, emphasizing the balance between retaining the ability to take out targets directly and ensuring the capabilities of high-end Afghan forces. The curr_chunk discusses the future requirements for U.S. and coalition advisory and enabling support to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), including the risks of miscalculations and the need for a serious troop-to-task analysis. It also raises questions about future counter-terrorism (CT) requirements, emphasizing the balance between retaining the ability to take out targets directly and ensuring the capabilities of high-end Afghan forces. The chunk also explores the relationship between coalition troop drawdowns and Afghan confidence, as well as potential scenarios where Afghan forces may choose not to undertake missions or make accommodations with insurgent forces. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of retrograde from Afghanistan, including the complexities of terrain and transportation infrastructure. It raises questions about the coalition staying too long, the impact on leaders' time and attention, and when retrograde becomes the top priority for commanders on the ground. The challenges of retrograde from Afghanistan, including difficult terrain and lack of transportation infrastructure, raise questions about the impact on ANSF confidence and sustainability without international financial support. The broader strategic landscape, including governance, economics, and regional dynamics, will play a crucial role in protecting security gains in the long term. The sustainability of security gains in Afghanistan requires responsive governance to direct and hold the ANSF accountable, ensure access to justice and economic viability, inspire trust from neighbors, and earn the confidence of the Afghan people. However, governance in Afghanistan is characterized by personalized rule and lacks capacity for responsible governance. In Afghanistan, the centralized system of budgeting and decision-making has led to uneven distribution of resources. Some provinces have been successful in lobbying for resources from Kabul, while others, like Panjwayi district in Kandahar province, face challenges in receiving a timely response to urgent needs. In Panjwayi, an uprising against Taliban intimidation was sparked by the appointment of a new District Chief of Police, leading to increased security measures and a visit from the Kandahar Provincial Governor. In the wake of the uprising in Panjwayi, Kandahar Provincial Governor Toryalai Wesa called for greater access to schools and clinics to solidify security gains. Kabul's slow response in providing funds and personnel led to ANA soldiers teaching in schools as a temporary solution. Corruption poses a significant challenge to responsive governance in Afghanistan, with major players vying for power and influence, undermining the formal state. In 2013, power struggles in Helmand province involved multiple tribes, potential poppy profits, vested interests of the Akundzada family, and the Taliban exploiting political vacuums. Governor Naeem Baluch sought expanded authorities to address the situation. The power struggles in Helmand province in 2013 involved multiple tribes, poppy profits, the Akundzada family, and the Taliban exploiting political vacuums. Governor Naeem Baluch sought expanded authorities to address the situation, as some argue that local-level deals may offer stability but are fragile due to personal ambition and failed harvests. The international community has grappled with the challenge of supporting governance in Afghanistan from the outside. The 2009 McChrystal Assessment emphasized the importance of governance alongside security in Afghanistan for lasting stability. International efforts to improve governance were inconsistent, focusing on personnel rosters, incentivizing powerbrokers, building ministry capacity, and replacing corrupt officials. Afghan thought leaders suggest a potential remedy for the situation. Many Afghan thought leaders see the voices of civil society organizations, women's groups, media outlets, and others as key to holding governance accountable. They believe these voices, with some international support, can bring constructive changes in Afghan governance, especially with the upcoming presidential elections in April 2014. The upcoming presidential elections in Afghanistan are seen as crucial for the country's governance. While some view the elections as a potential turning point, others warn against expecting immediate solutions to Afghanistan's challenges. The U.S. policy has shifted to recognize the importance of the 2014 elections, with a focus on a longer-term political process. The upcoming presidential elections in Afghanistan are crucial for governance. The focus is on the political transition when a new president takes office next year. Questions about Afghan governance include the level of \"good\" governance needed, accountability mechanisms, and the impact of corruption on security and economic development. The international community must leverage the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework effectively. The Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework aims to counter corruption in Afghanistan. The 2014 Afghan presidential elections are critical for future governance. Support from the US and international partners is needed for safe elections and accountable mechanisms. The text discusses the challenges and opportunities of broadly participatory elections in Afghanistan, including the need for a consensus candidate for stability and the role of alternative voices like civil society and the media in holding the government accountable. The international community is urged to support Afghanistan's new leadership post-election to further develop a Constitutionally-based political process, with a focus on protecting women's rights. Afghanistan's future economic viability is crucial for sustainable security gains. The country aims for economic self-sufficiency by 2024, but international efforts to support its economy have been mixed. The international community must help Afghanistan improve revenue generation and spending to achieve a working economy. The international community's efforts to support Afghanistan's economy have resulted in various challenges, including the mismanagement of funds, distortion of labor markets, and empowerment of undesirable elements. Recent collaboration aims to align economic development efforts, focusing on infrastructure, transportation, financial mechanisms, the judicial sector, and human capital. The Kabul Process and the Tokyo Conference have outlined principles for supporting Afghanistan's economic transformation. The shift towards making Afghan systems work was driven by necessity as international assistance funding decreased and civilian presence was reduced. Questions arise about Afghanistan's economy, including the timeline for building a self-sustaining economy, legal constructs needed for maximizing mineral resources, the impact of the narcotics industry on the economy, and incentive structures. The Afghan economy faces threats from the poppy business, requiring adjustments to incentive structures. Risks to Afghan stability in the near term exist due to limited ability to generate revenue and decreased international assistance. The international community could help mitigate these risks and boost progress in security and politics. Uncertainty surrounds the level of assistance Afghanistan will receive through 2024 amid financial pressures. Most observers agree that a stable Afghanistan is closely linked to Pakistan, with a complex relationship due to shared borders and historical tensions. There is potential for a strategic partnership based on mutual recognition of sovereignty and shared interests. Observers note a fundamental lack of good faith in the future strategic partnership between Pakistan and the U.S., increasing volatility in border disputes and complicating efforts to eliminate safe havens supporting insurgent activities in Afghanistan. U.S. policy struggles to formulate an effective approach for shaping regional dynamics, with a major premise being Pakistan's need to curb safe havens for the campaign to succeed. ISAF intensified efforts to foster Afghan-Pakistani mil-to-mil contacts at tactical and operational levels, facing setbacks after the 2011 U.S. operation targeting Osama bin Laden and the 2011 border incident at Salala, Pakistan. Despite enhanced focus on Afghan-Pakistani bilateral engagement in 2013, challenges like cross-border fires and a lack of good faith persisted. The bilateral relationship is part of a broader regional fabric involving neighboring countries like Iran. The regional dynamics in Afghanistan involve neighboring countries like Iran, as well as major players such as China, India, and Russia. The stability in Afghanistan is crucial and could impact broader regional dynamics. Questions arise about the impact of closer Afghan-Pakistani military ties on the strategic partnership and U.S. engagement. Leveraging the interests of major regional players like China could help end the war in Afghanistan and establish stability. The stability in Afghanistan could also affect other key U.S. national security concerns in the region. Most agree that the war in Afghanistan is unlikely to end with a decisive victory on the battlefield. There is broad disagreement on how to resolve the conflict and establish lasting stability in Afghanistan while protecting U.S. interests. It is important to reassess U.S. national security interests in the region, consider the interests of major stakeholders, envision the future of the region, and determine the best tools of national power to achieve that vision. The Doha process for war termination in Afghanistan focuses on reconciliation between Afghan leadership and the Taliban, with efforts to find common ground and build confidence through specific measures. The opening of the Taliban political office in Doha in 2013 was a significant event, but faced backlash for misrepresentation. U.S. policy generally supports this approach. The Doha process for war termination in Afghanistan focuses on reconciliation between Afghan leadership and the Taliban, with U.S. policy broadly supporting this approach. U.S. officials have outlined three \"red lines\" for any outcome, while some Afghans and outside observers suggest a longer-term political settlement process involving full participation of the Afghan people for a more fruitful approach. Dialogue among all key sectors of Afghan society is crucial for reaching a shared vision for the country's future, including former Northern Alliance members, Pashtuns, urban and rural populations, tribal elders, and youth. This national dialogue is already in progress and a longer timeline could help reduce urgency that leads to detrimental compromises. A clear future vision could also alleviate uncertainty that drives Afghans to seek support from patronage networks or consider emigration. The absence of a robust strategic logic is a key concern for many practitioners and observers. The absence of a robust strategic logic linking various aspects of the Doha process, campaign on the ground, elections, economic development, and regional dynamics is a key concern. Questions arise about how these elements should inform each other to ensure stability in Afghanistan and protect U.S. interests in the long term. The necessity of a formal political agreement among former belligerents for Afghanistan's stable future is also debated. The debate surrounds the necessity of a formal political agreement among former belligerents for Afghanistan's stable future. Questions arise about potential negative repercussions in security, national dialogue, political participation, and economic investment. Balancing these costs and benefits is crucial for the country's development. Looking ahead, some find it easier to envision Afghanistan's situation two years out rather than five years out, with a focus on a competent ANSF, improved security, and new political leadership. Afghanistan's future is uncertain, with overlapping dynamics of traditional local organization, centralized governance, informal power networks, and emerging national institutions. Limited economic opportunities exist alongside a struggling government and impatient military. The future of Afghanistan is uncertain, with limited economic opportunities, lingering uncertainty, organized popular voices, and deepening relationships with neighboring states. Choices made by the U.S., international community, and Afghans will shape the country's future."
