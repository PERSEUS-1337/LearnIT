    "content": "Under Medicaid, states must provide a comprehensive set of services to categorically needy individuals, including physician services, hospital services, and services for individuals under 21. Optional services like dental care and prescription drug coverage can also be included. Federal requirements ensure statewideness and comparability in Medicaid benefit coverage. ABP coverage under DRA 2005 must meet statewideness and comparability requirements, differing from traditional Medicaid benefits by being based on commercial insurance products or a \"Secretary-approved\" option. It must correspond to a benchmark plan or be benchmark-equivalent to comply with the law. The state can choose an Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP) that meets benchmark requirements and other criteria. ABPs can be tailored for specific Medicaid beneficiary subgroups, but certain high-needs categories are exempt. Changes under CHIPRA 2009 and the ACA expanded ABP requirements. The regulations made significant changes to ABP requirements, including the scope of benchmark coverage and populations eligible for Medicaid through ABPs. CMS introduced the term ABPs to prevent confusion with benchmarks used in private health insurance. The benchmarks for SSA Section 1937 ABPs and private health insurance are different. In the private insurance market, CMS regulations use the term base-benchmark to refer to the specific health insurance plan selected by a state to determine the scope of its essential health benefits package. Benchmark coverage for Medicaid ABPs includes Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider option, state employee health benefits coverage, the largest insured commercial HMO in the state, and \"Secretary-approved coverage.\" The fourth ABP benchmark option, Secretary-approved coverage, can be any health benefits coverage that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines provides appropriate coverage for the proposed population. States may also design and seek CMS approval for benchmark-equivalent coverage, which must meet statutory requirements. The Medicaid ABP coverage must include surgical and medical services, laboratory and x-ray services, prescription drugs, mental health services, well-baby and well-child care, and preventive services. It should have an actuarial value equivalent to one of the ABP benchmark options and meet additional requirements set by DRA 2005, CHIPRA 2009, and the ACA. The ACA requires beneficiaries under 21 in ABPs to receive EPSDT benefits, either through ABP coverage or traditional Medicaid as a wraparound benefit. ABP coverage must include federally qualified health center services, rural health clinic services, and essential health benefits. Financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health and substance use disorder benefits must comply with regulations. Treatment limitations for mental health and substance use disorder benefits in ABPs must comply with mental health parity requirements. ABP coverage must include family planning services, ambulance, and nonemergency medical transportation services as wraparound benefits if not covered by the benchmark plan. States have the flexibility to offer additional benefits beyond what is required by law in ABPs. The Medicaid state plan outlines a state's Medicaid program, and states must adhere to it to receive federal financial participation. States establish ABP coverage by amending their Medicaid state plans, providing detailed information on populations covered, benchmark benefit packages, and scope of coverage. Medicaid state plan must be amended when initially establishing an ABP and when seeking substantial modifications. States must require individuals eligible for Medicaid through the ACA Medicaid expansion to receive coverage under ABPs. The ACA limits federal financial participation in Medicaid expenditures for the expansion population to ABP coverage. States have the option to require enrollment in ABPs for other non-ACA Medicaid expansion groups, with exceptions. Enrollment in ABPs can be required on a group-by-group basis, based on eligibility groups. States may design different ABPs tailored to different Medicaid eligibility groups, with only full benefit eligibles (FBEs) being required to receive Medicaid through ABPs. FBEs are those eligible for the standard full Medicaid benefit package under the state plan, excluding partial-benefit Medicaid beneficiaries, medically needy individuals, and other spenddown populations. States can design various Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) for different Medicaid eligibility groups. Only full benefit eligibles (FBEs) are mandated to receive Medicaid through ABPs. Certain categories of Medicaid beneficiaries are exempt from ABPs, including pregnant women with income below 133% of the federal poverty level, blind or disabled individuals, those entitled to Medicare benefits, terminally ill individuals receiving hospice benefits, and those qualifying for Medicaid institutional care on a spenddown basis. Medicaid eligibility includes individuals qualifying for institutional care on a spenddown basis, medically frail individuals, those needing long-term care services, children in foster care, parents under Section 1931 of the SSA, women with breast or cervical cancer, individuals with tuberculosis infection, and noncitizens receiving limited emergency medical assistance. States have discretion in defining medically frail individuals. The Medicaid eligibility criteria include special-needs children, individuals with mental disorders, substance use disorders, disabilities, and those with a disability determination. States can offer these exempt individuals the option to enroll in an Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP) with a comparison of costs and benefits to traditional Medicaid. There is a tension between the ACA Medicaid expansion population and ABP-exempt beneficiary groups. States cannot use federal funding to provide Medicaid to certain groups. The ACA Medicaid expansion population may include ABP-exempt individuals who cannot be required to enroll in an ABP. CMS defined ABP-exempt beneficiaries to exclude them from the expansion population. States must offer ABP coverage that includes all benefits available under the approved state plan. The ACA expanded ABP requirements by mandating coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHBs). States must meet EHB requirements through their ABP state plan amendments. The ACA expanded ABP requirements to include coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHBs). States must ensure that ABP coverage complies with mental health parity requirements and include prescription drugs, mental health services, and family planning. The ACA expanded ABP requirements to include coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) for individuals of childbearing age, including family planning services and supplies. The EHBs must include ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance use disorder services, prescription drugs, and more. The Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) mandated by the ACA include a range of services such as oral and vision care. States select coverage benchmarks based on existing employer plans to establish their EHBs for individual and small-group health insurance markets. The EHB base-benchmark options are similar to Medicaid ABPs but not identical. The Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) mandated by the ACA include a range of services such as oral and vision care. States select coverage benchmarks based on existing employer plans to establish their EHBs for individual and small-group health insurance markets. The EHB-benchmark plan must meet specific criteria and can be changed by states starting in 2020. As of plan year 2020, states can replace EHB categories in their benchmark plan or select a new set of benefits. The selected EHB benchmark plan must be comparable to a typical employer plan but not more generous than the most generous comparison plans. States must identify the ABP benchmark benefit package and EHB base-benchmark package in their Medicaid state plan amendments. If the ABP benchmark covers all 10 EHB categories, it is considered to cover the EHBs. The state can supplement the ABP benchmark to cover missing EHB categories. Benefits can be substituted if they are actuarially equivalent. ABP coverage does not have to be provided through Medicaid managed care. The law allows states to provide Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP) coverage through private insurance plans, with states able to pay for insurance premiums for Medicaid beneficiaries. States may use a premium assistance approach where a private insurer serves as the payer, with the state required to furnish any additional benefits not provided by the insurer. CMS has stated that there are limitations to this approach. CMS has clarified that Medicaid limitations on premiums and cost sharing also apply to Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs). States must adhere to Medicaid limits even if the selected ABP benchmark includes higher premiums and cost sharing. Cost sharing cannot exceed Medicaid limits for beneficiaries, even if other enrollees in the same health insurance plan have higher costs. States are prohibited from applying cost sharing to certain preventive services under ABPs. States have implemented Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) under Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act through private health insurance plans. 35 states and three territories had CMS-approved ABP state plan amendments as of August 6, 2018. Some states have extended ABP coverage to populations beyond ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees. For example, Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia have used ABPs for populations other than the ACA Medicaid expansion population. Additionally, Idaho, Kansas, and Wisconsin have chosen to implement ABPs. Three non-ACA Medicaid expansion states (Idaho, Kansas, and Wisconsin) have implemented ABPs for various non-expansion Medicaid populations. Three territories (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam) have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion and an ABP state plan amendment. States commonly use ABPs for ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees, with the selection of the ABP benchmark being a key decision. ACA Medicaid expansion states typically use an ABP composed of \"Secretary-approved coverage\" based on the traditional state plan benefit. Of the 31 expansion states that elected Secretary-approved coverage as the ABP benchmark, 25 aligned the ABP benefits with traditional Medicaid benefits under the state plan as of August 6, 2018. Some states added or removed benefits for the ABP, such as Colorado including preventive and habilitative services not covered under traditional Medicaid, and West Virginia including physical and occupational therapy and home health services. The remaining six expansion states have chosen a private health benefits package or a combination of benefits for Secretary-approved coverage, aiming to minimize disruption for individuals transitioning between Medicaid expansion and private market coverage. Three states initially implemented Medicaid expansion through a premium-assistance model. The uptake of the ABP option for non-ACA Medicaid expansion populations has been limited. As of August 6, 2018, three non-expansion states (Idaho, Kansas, and Wisconsin) had ABP state plan amendments in effect. Kansas's Working Healthy program helps working individuals with disabilities by offering a full package of Medicaid benefits with a small monthly premium. Kansas selected an ABP benchmark based on state plan benefits and additional services to support individuals. Idaho offers three different ABPs: Basic, Enhanced, and Medicare/Medicaid Coordinated Alternative Benefit Plan. The Basic ABP is for individuals without special health needs, including prevention and wellness benefits. The Enhanced ABP is for individuals with disabilities, offering additional services like SUD services and hospice care. The Medicare/Medicaid Coordinated ABP is for dual-eligible beneficiaries, providing a combination of Medicare and Medicaid benefits. The Alternative Benefit Plans (ABPs) for dual-eligible beneficiaries offer additional services like SUD, community-based rehabilitation, and home health services. States choose the ABP benchmark and base-benchmark for Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) within the ABP, highlighting differences from traditional Medicaid benefits. Under traditional Medicaid, nursing home care is not required, while it is mandatory under ABPs. ABPs include rehabilitative services, preventive services, and mental health services as required benefits. Behavioral health benefits are mandatory under ABPs but optional under traditional Medicaid. Each ABP must include Essential Health Benefits (EHBs). Under traditional Medicaid, coverage of behavioral health services varies widely from state to state. ABPs must include Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) which mandate mental health and substance use disorder services. States must ensure that financial requirements and treatment limitations comply with parity requirements in the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act requires Medicaid ABP behavioral health benefits to comply with parity requirements, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations are no more restrictive than for medical and surgical benefits. Traditional Medicaid benefits are subject to parity requirements only for services delivered through managed care, not for fee-for-service settings."
