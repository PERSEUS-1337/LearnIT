    "content": "Not every agency action is necessarily subject to judicial review in federal court. Courts must have statutory jurisdiction, plaintiffs need a cause of action for legal relief, disputes must satisfy Article III requirements, and suits must be timely. Federal courts have limited jurisdiction granted by Congress, requiring subject matter jurisdiction for a case. Suits against the United States require a statutory waiver of sovereign immunity. Subject matter jurisdiction is necessary for courts to hear a case, and the APA itself does not provide it. Plaintiffs suing under the APA must establish jurisdiction through separate statutory provisions. Various statutes authorize jurisdiction in specific courts for reviewing different types of claims, such as actions in U.S. Courts of Appeals or federal appellate courts. Federal district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under U.S. laws, treaties, or the Constitution. Federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to hear claims under the APA, nonstatutory, and constitutional claims. The doctrine of sovereign immunity shields the United States from suits unless immunity is waived by statute. Waivers of sovereign immunity must be clearly expressed in statutory text, and three primary statutes permit lawsuits against the United States in federal court under certain circumstances. The APA was amended in 1976 to allow individuals aggrieved by agency action to bring suit. The APA was amended in 1976 to allow individuals to sue the United States and government employees in federal court for agency actions, but without money damages. The FTCA allows suits for certain torts with money damages, while the Tucker Act permits suits for breach of contract and other monetary claims. To challenge a federal agency's actions in court, a plaintiff must show legal standing. A plaintiff must demonstrate legal standing to seek judicial redress, with various statutes providing causes of action against federal agencies. The APA offers a general cause of action for individuals aggrieved by a \"final agency action\" without other remedies. Nonstatutory review and mandamus relief are also possible in certain situations. Federal district courts and appellate courts may issue mandamus relief in extraordinary circumstances when no adequate alternative remedy exists. The Supreme Court in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics recognized a common law cause of action against federal officers for constitutional rights violations. Standing and timing are essential for challenging agency actions in court, with Article III of the Constitution defining federal court jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has established legal doctrines and prudential considerations that limit federal court jurisdiction to adjudicate \"cases\" and \"controversies,\" including standing, ripeness, and mootness when challenging agency actions. The doctrine of standing often acts as a barrier for plaintiffs, emphasizing the separation of powers principle and the judiciary's role in interpreting the law without lightly invalidating congressional legislation or executive actions. The doctrine of standing requires a plaintiff to show a concrete and particularized injury that is traceable to the defendant's actions and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. This doctrine often prevents lawsuits challenging agency actions in federal courts. The doctrine of standing requires a concrete injury traceable to agency action and likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. Factors like statutory deadlines, ripeness, mootness, and exhaustion influence federal court adjudication of challenges to agency action. Civil actions against the United States must be filed within six years of the claim's origin. Ripeness doctrine ensures controversies are ready for federal court decisions, avoiding premature adjudication. The ripeness doctrine aims to protect courts and agencies from premature adjudication by ensuring that cases are ready for judicial decision and that delays would cause hardship to the parties involved. Courts consider if the issues presented are ripe for decision and if there are adverse legal effects or behavior adjustments required. For instance, a challenge to an agency rule may be ripe when the rule imposes new restrictions on parties. The ripeness doctrine ensures cases are ready for judicial decision by considering if issues are ripe for decision and if there are adverse legal effects or behavior adjustments required. Courts may decline to hear a case if it is moot or if further factual development would significantly advance their ability to deal with the legal issues presented. Additionally, a court might deny review if a party failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before suing in federal court. The exhaustion doctrine requires full development of a record before court examines a case. In suits under the APA, federal courts can't require exhaustion if not mandated by statute or agency rule. However, in cases not covered by the APA, exhaustion requirements may delay challenges to federal agency actions. The APA allows judicial review of final agency actions with limits on matters and entities eligible for review. It waives sovereign immunity under certain circumstances, allowing individuals aggrieved by agency actions to seek judicial review. The APA allows judicial review of final agency actions, permitting individuals aggrieved by agency actions to seek judicial review of an agency's decision. Courts are directed to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed and to set aside agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with the law. The APA allows judicial review of final agency actions, permitting individuals aggrieved by agency actions to seek judicial review of an agency's decision. Courts can direct an agency to comply with the law, invalidate actions inconsistent with statutory authority, review procedural requirements, and examine discretionary decisions for arbitrariness or capriciousness. Judicial review under the APA is limited to final agency actions not committed to agency discretion or precluded from review by another statute. Defining terms like \"agency,\" \"action,\" \"final,\" and \"committed to agency discretion\" is crucial for understanding when courts will hear challenges to federal agency decisions. The APA limits judicial review to actions of federal agencies, excluding Congress and the judiciary. The definition of agency does not include the President. Agency action is defined as rules, orders, licenses, sanctions, or relief. Courts may review agency rules, denials of licenses, and sanctions under the APA, but only if the agency's conduct fits within the statutory definition of final agency action. This action must represent the completion of the agency's decision-making process. The finality requirement limits judicial review of agency actions that do not have a final, legally binding consequence. For example, it may prevent review of agency recommendations to the President if they are not legally binding. However, individuals can challenge agency determinations before enforcement actions are taken, such as with the issuance of binding regulations. Judicial review of agency action under the APA is generally available, except when a statute explicitly precludes it or when the agency's action is within its discretion. The APA establishes a presumption of judicial review unless another statute clearly prevents it. Determining if review is precluded involves examining the statute's language, structure, objectives, legislative history, and the nature of the administrative action. In some cases, judicial review may be impliedly precluded. Judicial review under the APA is generally available unless explicitly precluded by statute or within the agency's discretion. Review may be precluded if it contradicts congressional intent or if the agency's action is legally committed to its discretion. In cases of constitutional violations, courts interpret preclusion provisions narrowly to allow review. The Supreme Court has stated that an agency's action is committed to its discretion when there is no law to apply, making judicial review unavailable. The Supreme Court has noted that decisions involving agency discretion, such as not initiating enforcement actions or allocating funds, are generally committed to the agency's absolute discretion. This includes cases like the CIA Director's decision to discharge an employee in the \"interests of the United States.\" The court's ruling is based on the overall structure of the relevant statute directing the CIA to gather and protect intelligence sources. The APA authorizes courts to set aside agency actions that are not in accordance with the law, including actions that contravene the meaning of a governing statute. Courts use doctrinal tests to determine if agency actions comply with statutory authority, with varying levels of judicial deference given to the agency's interpretation of the statute. Courts apply a two-step framework outlined in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council to review challenges to agency interpretations of statutes. If Congress has directly spoken on the issue, courts enforce that intent; if not, they defer to a reasonable agency interpretation. This deference is appropriate due to the agency's expertise and delegated authority from Congress. The Chevron doctrine allows agencies to interpret statutes, with courts deferring to agency expertise unless Congress has clearly spoken on the issue. This deference permits agencies to change interpretations over time if reasonable. The doctrine does not apply to every agency interpretation, only where Congress has delegated authority to the agency. The Chevron doctrine applies when Congress delegates authority to agencies to interpret statutes with the force of law. The formality of procedures used in issuing interpretations is a key factor in determining Chevron deference. Interpretations in policy statements, manuals, and guidelines do not receive Chevron deference, but less formal interpretations may still warrant deference. The Chevron doctrine applies when Congress delegates authority to agencies to interpret statutes with the force of law. Courts may consider the agency's expertise, the importance of the question, and the agency's careful consideration over time to determine if Chevron deference is appropriate. In some cases, such as King v. Burwell, the Court has declined to apply Chevron deference to extraordinary questions. The Court did not give deference to the agency's interpretation of the statute regarding tax credits, as Congress did not explicitly delegate that decision. This decision reaffirms the principle established in FDA v. Brown & Williamson, where the Court scrutinized the agency's sudden assertion of authority over tobacco products. The Court did not defer to the FDA's interpretation of regulating tobacco products, stating that Congress did not intend to implicitly delegate such authority to the agency. Without Chevron deference, courts may give less weight to agency interpretations, but specialized expertise can still be considered. Skidmore deference is a principle where courts give weight to an agency's interpretation of a statute based on the agency's reasoning and expertise. It recognizes the agency's power to persuade but does not make agency interpretations controlling on the courts. Courts may review an agency's compliance with legal requirements de novo, without deference to the agency's interpretation. This includes reviewing procedural provisions, Freedom of Information Act provisions, and the Constitution. Courts also defer to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations unless it is \"plainly erroneous.\" Auer deference requires courts to give controlling weight to an agency's reasonable interpretation of its regulations, extending to interpretations developed informally. However, it does not apply when the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. The future of Auer deference is uncertain as some Justices have expressed disapproval of the doctrine, but it is unclear if a majority will be assembled to limit or eliminate it. Judicial review under the APA also includes reviewing agency factual determinations and discretionary decisions for arbitrariness or abuse. The APA's \"catch-all\" provision allows for judicial review of agency actions deemed arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Courts must ensure that agency decisions are based on relevant data and have a rational explanation. The APA allows for judicial review of agency actions that are arbitrary or capricious, based on relevant factors and lack of clear error of judgment. The Supreme Court clarified that agencies can change policies without being considered arbitrary and capricious. The arbitrary-and-capricious standard for agency actions is not stricter when policies are changed, as long as the action is within statutory authorization and supported by good reasons. Courts must evaluate agency decisions based on the grounds provided by the agency, without creating their own justifications. Courts require agencies to provide essential facts and evidence to justify their decisions, beyond conclusory statements. Failure to do so may lead to remand or invalidation of the decision, especially in response to significant comments during rulemaking. This plays a crucial role in judicial review of agency regulations and may result in a decision being deemed arbitrary and capricious. Courts invalidate agency actions that are illogical or inconsistent, arbitrary, or capricious if important factors are not considered. They may remand decisions if regulatory alternatives were not explored. Courts defer to agencies' expertise in scientific or technical matters. Relevant factors for agency decisions vary based on statutory authorities and missions. In Judalong v. Holder, the Supreme Court found the Board of Immigration Appeals' policy for deciding on relief from removal to be arbitrary and capricious. The agency failed to consider relevant factors such as the purposes of immigration laws, leading to an arbitrary decision. Other examples of arbitrary agency actions include failing to consider circumstances that warrant different treatment for different parties. The curr_chunk discusses various examples of arbitrary agency actions, such as failing to consider relevant factors, contradicting expert evidence, and issuing rules based on political compromise. The APA also imposes procedural requirements on agencies for different types of actions. The APA outlines procedural requirements for agency actions, categorizing them into rulemaking and adjudications, as well as formal and informal proceedings. Agency decisions fall into four types based on these distinctions. The APA outlines procedural requirements for agency actions, categorizing them into rulemaking and adjudications, as well as formal and informal proceedings. Agencies have discretion to formulate their own procedures, subject to the Due Process Clause. Agency actions can be challenged for failing to comply with required procedures. When adjudicating a case, individuals can challenge an agency's failure to comply with APA procedures or other statutes. Agencies must provide advance notice and a chance for public comment before engaging in informal rulemaking. Legislative rules require this, while nonlegislative rules are exempt. Courts may invalidate agency documents issued without proper procedures, sometimes reviewing the issue de novo without granting deference to the agency. The APA's \"good cause\" provision allows agencies to bypass requirements in certain cases. The APA's \"good cause\" provision allows agencies to bypass requirements if compliance is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. For example, in 2004, the D.C. Circuit upheld the Federal Aviation Administration's rule on security grounds, covering the suspension and revocation of pilot certificates without notice and comment. The court accepted the agency's argument that the regulation was necessary to protect the public against security threats post-9/11. The appropriate standard of review for determining \"good cause\" under the APA is unsettled. Parties can challenge procedures used in agency adjudications, where trial-type procedures must be provided in formal or on-the-record adjudications. When conducting formal adjudications, agencies must provide trial-type procedures before an ALJ or agency head. Informal adjudications have fewer procedural requirements and may not involve an ALJ. Agencies have discretion to choose between formal and informal procedures, but challenges can arise if informal procedures are used in violation of the APA. Courts cannot impose additional procedural requirements on agencies beyond those outlined in the APA. Courts lack authority to impose additional requirements on agencies beyond those outlined in the APA. Supreme Court decisions in Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation v. Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc. and Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association have established that courts cannot require agencies to utilize extra procedures or undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking beyond what is mandated by the APA. The Constitution grants Congress the power to define the jurisdiction of federal courts and determine the types of agency actions. The APA grants federal courts authority to review agency actions, with limitations set by constitutional and statutory considerations. Judicial interpretation of the APA is crucial in determining which agency actions are subject to review. Congress can modify the APA or other statutes to shape judicial review. The APA grants federal courts authority to review agency actions, with Congress having the power to modify statutes to shape judicial review."
