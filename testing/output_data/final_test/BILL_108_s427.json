    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Agriculture Security Assistance Act\". Congress acknowledges the direct threat of agricultural diseases to human health and the concern of economic sabotage through agroterrorism. The United States' $80 billion livestock industry is at risk, and an outbreak of disease could have severe impacts on the economy and consumer confidence in the food supply. Enhancing monitoring and response mechanisms for agricultural terrorism is crucial for national security. Enhancing biosecurity on farms is crucial to prevent the intentional or accidental introduction of agricultural diseases. Surveys show concerning trends in farm security activities. A national response plan by the Department of Agriculture and FEMA will coordinate agricultural health and emergency management functions. The Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with State and industry partners, would implement a national response plan to ensure an orderly and unified response to agricultural disease outbreaks. State and local partners would require assistance to implement their parts of the plan. States and communities also need help in preparing for agricultural disasters. Rapid detection of agricultural diseases is crucial for containment, as delays in detection can complicate control measures. Planning for outbreak responses is essential. Planning for a response to an agricultural disease outbreak varies by State based on awareness, risk perception, time demands, and resource availability. State response capability would improve with a joint comprehensive plan by agricultural and emergency management officials. Subtitle J of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, titled Agriculture Security Assistance, includes definitions related to agricultural security. Agricultural disease refers to outbreaks of plant or animal diseases or pest infestations that require immediate action to prevent harm to people, livestock, property, economy, or environment. An agricultural disease emergency is determined by the Secretary of Agriculture under specific sections of the Plant Protection Act and the Animal Health Protection Act. The term 'agriculture' includes activities related to food, feed, and fiber production, processing, marketing, distribution, and trade, as well as forestry, wildlife science, and veterinary medicine. Agroterrorism refers to criminal acts involving the intentional harm of agricultural resources. Agroterrorism is defined as causing harm to agricultural resources with the intent to intimidate civilians or influence government policy. Biosecurity involves protection from biological, chemical, or radiological agents that pose risks to plant or animal health, the agricultural economy, and the environment. Biosecurity includes exclusion, eradication, and control of biological agents causing agricultural diseases, focusing on the environment and human health. \"Response plans are outlined in SEC. 899B for biosecurity, focusing on exclusion, eradication, and control of biological agents causing agricultural diseases.\" The Secretary of Agriculture, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, assists States in developing State plans for responding to agricultural disease outbreaks. State response plans must identify necessary authorities, resources, risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential emergency management assistance. The Secretary of Agriculture works with States to develop regional and national response plans for agricultural disease outbreaks. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of these plans. The Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with stakeholders, will conduct a study to determine the best use of experts in handling agricultural disease emergencies and identify necessary data for modeling and analysis. A report on the study results will be submitted to the Secretary of Homeland Security and other appropriate governmental heads within 180 days. The Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with stakeholders, will establish a program to provide grants to States for using geographic information systems and statistical models in agricultural disease emergencies. $2,500,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for subsequent years. The Secretary of Homeland Security, with the Secretary of Agriculture, will establish a program to provide grants for State and local animal health officials to participate in community emergency planning. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004. \"SEC. 899C. BIOSECURITY AWARENESS AND PROGRAMS.\" The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a public awareness campaign for farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers to emphasize the importance of heightened biosecurity and reporting agricultural disease anomalies. Within 240 days of enactment, guidelines will be developed to improve monitoring of vehicles and materials entering or leaving farm operations. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a public awareness campaign for farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers to emphasize the importance of biosecurity. Guidelines will be developed to monitor human traffic entering or leaving farm operations. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for subsequent years. Agriculture will establish an education program in each State to distribute biosecurity guidelines. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop a pilot program to provide incentives for agricultural producers to restructure operations to prevent agroterrorism and disease spread. Grants or low-interest loans up to $10,000 will be offered for this purpose. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a pilot program to prevent agroterrorism and disease spread in agricultural operations. A report on the program's implementation and recommendations for expansion will be submitted to Congress. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include provisions related to preventing agroterrorism and disease spread in agricultural operations. Subtitle J of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 includes provisions for Agriculture Security Assistance, which covers definitions, response plans, and biosecurity awareness and programs."
