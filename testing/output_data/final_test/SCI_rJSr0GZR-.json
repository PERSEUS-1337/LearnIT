    "content": "Most deep latent factor models use simple priors, but recent studies suggest that the choice of prior can significantly impact model expressiveness. This paper proposes learning a proper prior from data for adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) by introducing code generators. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves image quality and disentangled representations compared to traditional AAEs in supervised and unsupervised settings. The text discusses the use of deep latent factor models like VAEs and AAEs for tasks such as image generation, unsupervised clustering, and cross-domain translation. These models involve specifying a prior distribution over latent variables and training a recognition network regularized by the prior. Simple priors, like the standard normal distribution, are traditionally used, but recent studies suggest that learning a proper prior from data can improve model expressiveness. Recent studies suggest that the choice of prior distribution in generative networks can significantly impact model expressiveness. Multimodal priors, such as a mixture of variational posteriors, have been shown to outperform simple priors like the standard normal distribution in maximizing data log-likelihood. Additionally, learning a tree-structured nonparametric Bayesian prior can capture semantic hierarchies effectively. In this paper, the authors propose the concept of code generators for learning a prior from data for AAE. They aim to transform a simple prior into one that can better characterize the data distribution by training the code generator to output latent variables that minimize an adversarial loss in data space. The framework of AAE is generalized by replacing the simple prior with a learned prior and using a learned similarity metric for training the autoencoder. The objective is to maximize the mutual information between part of the code generator input and the decoder output. The paper introduces code generators to improve AAE by maximizing mutual information between input and output. Extensive experiments show better image quality and disentangled representations compared to AAE, especially on complex datasets. It is one of the first works to introduce a learned prior for AAE. The paper is organized into sections reviewing background, implementation details, performance comparison with AAE, and future work. A latent factor model is a probabilistic model that describes the relationship between latent and visible variables. Model parameters are learned by maximizing the marginal log-likelihood of the data. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve expressiveness by introducing a neural network to the model. The model is trained by maximizing the log evidence lower-bound. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) use the evidence lower-bound (ELBO) to train a neural network to approximate the posterior distribution. Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs) relax the Gaussian prior assumption of VAEs by allowing any distribution for the latent code, replacing the KL-divergence with an adversarial loss. Non-parametric Variational Autoencoders offer a different approach to VAEs. Non-parametric Variational Autoencoders (Non-parametric VAEs) aim to learn a non-parametric prior for VAEs using the nested Chinese restaurant process. The VampPrior, a new type of prior for VAEs, consists of a mixture of variational posteriors conditioned on learned pseudoinputs, offering a multimodal nature and superior training complexity and expressiveness. In this paper, a code generator is proposed to learn a proper prior from data for Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE). The code generator transforms the manually-specified prior into a better form, shaping the distribution at its output. The goal is to find a prior that maximizes data likelihood, but two challenges are faced in this process. The code generator aims to address challenges in maximizing data likelihood by imposing an adversarial loss on the decoder output during training. This ensures the code generator produces a prior that minimizes the adversarial loss at the decoder output, matching the distribution of real images in the training data. The code generator is driven by a noise sample z \u223c p(z), with D I as the discriminator in image space and dec(z c ) as the decoder output. To address challenges, training alternates between updating the code generator and the decoder/encoder until convergence. The encoder output is regularized with an adversarial loss in the AAE phase, ensuring consistent training objectives for the decoder. In the AAE phase, the criterion for minimizing squared error in pixel domain is changed to feature domain to improve image sharpness. This adjustment ensures consistent training objectives for the decoder in both phases. Our method uses a training algorithm to produce decoded images that closely resemble real images. We introduce variational learning techniques to maximize mutual information between input variables and generated images. Comparing our model with AAE, we show improved performance in image generation and disentanglement tasks. Our model with code generator and similarity metric learning can generate higher quality images and learn disentangled representations in supervised and unsupervised settings. We apply our model to text-to-image synthesis and compare its performance with AAE in image generation. In an experiment comparing our model with AAE on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, our model generates sharper images with higher latent code dimensions. AAE struggles to reconstruct visually-plausible images on CIFAR-10. Our model's inception score on CIFAR-10 outperforms other generative models. Our model achieves comparable scores to other generative models on CIFAR-10 and demonstrates better adaptability in high-dimensional latent code space. Increasing the dimension of the latent code has little impact on our model but significantly affects AAE, which struggles to produce recognizable images, especially on CIFAR-10. This highlights the importance of having a prior that can adapt effectively. The importance of having a prior that can adapt automatically to changes in code space and data is emphasized. Learning disentangled representation is desirable in many applications, referring to capturing independent factors of variation in data. Experimental results show a network architecture incorporating a GAN-driven prior to learn supervisedly and disentangle label information from images. The model demonstrates the ability to learn disentangled representations and outperforms AAE in disentanglement tasks. The conditional latent code distribution is imposed on image representation to associate each image class with a code space learned from data using GAN-based training. Variational techniques are applied to maximize mutual information between label and generated image. At test time, image generation for a specific class involves inputting the class label and Gaussian noise to the code generator. The AAE baseline also incorporates a learned similarity metric and mutual information maximization, with the main difference being the use of the learned prior. The models use a one-hot vector and Gaussian noise to generate images, effectively separating label and style information. Both models perform well on MNIST and SVHN datasets, with the main digit changing with the label input and style varying without affecting the main digit. On CIFAR-10, the models show similar performance. The code generator in the models learns distinct conditional distributions for each class of images on CIFAR-10, resulting in visually plausible and semantically discernible images matching the labels. Experimental results show the model's ability to unsupervisedly disentangle label information from other image features, achieved by dividing the input to the code generator into two parts. The code generator divides input into two parts: one driven by a categorical distribution encoding data clusters and the other by a Gaussian explaining data variability. These distributions are combined by fully connected layers to form a prior for data explanation. Image generation at test time involves sampling distributions and feeding samples into the code generator and decoder. The categorical distribution is defined over 10-D one-hot vectors. In this experiment, the model is trained to cluster images by altering the label variable or Gaussian noise one at a time. Results show successful disentanglement of label information on MNIST dataset, but mixing of images from different classes on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets. Both models tend to generate images of the same digit or class when the Gaussian part is altered while the label part remains fixed. The model successfully clusters images by altering label variables or Gaussian noise. The encoder and code generator produce distinct distributions based on input labels. Clustering of images by digit is evident on MNIST but not on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets. The code generator can transform text embeddings into a prior for text-to-image synthesis. The code generator can transform text embeddings into a prior suitable for synthesizing images that closely match the sentence's semantics. This is achieved by learning the correspondence between images and descriptive sentences using a pre-trained recurrent neural network. The results show images generated by the model trained on a Flower dataset. In this paper, a code generator is proposed to transform text descriptions into a prior for image generation. The training process involves learning both the autoencoder and code generator simultaneously, showing superior performance in image generation and learning disentangled representations. The model also demonstrates cross-domain translation capabilities, with mode collapse and training instability identified as areas for further investigation. The curr_chunk discusses mode collapse and training instability in image generation. It includes a visualization of generated images with varying color attributes. The model architecture for image generation is also outlined in detail. The model architecture for image generation includes Tanh activation, average pooling, fully connected layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation, convolutional layers with skip connections, and residual connections."
