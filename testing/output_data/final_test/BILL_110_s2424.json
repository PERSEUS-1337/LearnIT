    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Health Literacy Act of 2007\". Congress finds that low health literacy affects 100 million American adults, impacting healthcare cost, quality, and outcomes. Health literacy skills are crucial for effective patient and consumer functioning, including communication with providers, understanding medical instructions, and compliance with treatment regimens, leading to billions in avoidable healthcare expenses annually. The elderly and chronically ill are at risk of low health literacy, impacting Medicare and Medicaid programs. Health literacy is crucial for successful healthcare, as stated in a 2004 report by the Institute of Medicine. Former Surgeon General Carmona emphasized that health literacy can save lives, money, and improve the well-being of Americans. SEC. 904 of the Public Health Service Act addresses health literacy through strategic planning, research, and coordination. The Health Literacy Implementation Center, established under SEC. 904 of the Public Health Service Act, aims to improve health literacy by enhancing measurements, research, development, and information dissemination. The Health Literacy Implementation Center aims to gather resources, sponsor projects, and develop interventions to improve health literacy in various settings, with a focus on education and addressing language and cultural barriers. The Health Literacy Implementation Center aims to address low health literacy rates by identifying research gaps, assisting Federal agencies in establishing objectives, and forming partnerships with organizations to promote interventions and tools. The Health Literacy Implementation Center will collaborate with the Secretary of Education to coordinate Federal health literacy activities. It will also hold public meetings to raise awareness and submit annual reports to Congress. The Health Literacy Implementation Center will submit an annual report to Congress detailing its operations, activities, financial condition, and accomplishments in the field of health literacy. It will also outline plans for the upcoming fiscal year to achieve its goals. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Additionally, grants will be awarded to States by the Director of the Center to establish State Health Literacy Resource Centers. The text chunk discusses grants awarded to States to establish health literacy resource centers to address low health literacy. States must submit an application detailing how they will structure and provide services through the resource center. Funds received must be used to understand low health literacy and support public and private efforts. The State health literacy resource center aims to coordinate and deliver health literacy services, encourage partnerships, provide assistance to governments and service providers, and monitor programs. Meetings are held annually to share best practices, and a summary report is made public. The State must submit an annual report to the Director of the Center detailing the programs supported by the grant and their evaluation results. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012 for this purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract the Institute of Medicine to study ways to improve health literacy in Medicare, Medicaid, and the FDA. A report on the study's results must be submitted within a year of this Act's enactment."
