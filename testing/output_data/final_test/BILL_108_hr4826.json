    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Great Cats and Rare Canids Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to the protection of these animals. Many wild populations of felids and canids are in decline, with nearly all wild felid species and half of wild canid species in need of protection. These animals are important global resources that need conservation efforts due to their intrinsic value and role as umbrella and indicator species. Rare felids and canids are facing various threats such as habitat loss, prey depletion, human activities, and diseases. Conservation efforts for these species require global commitment and adequate funding, as they play a crucial role as indicator species in maintaining ecosystem integrity. Conservation efforts for rare felids and canids are lacking in many range countries, especially in developing nations with limited resources. Poverty, population growth, and habitat loss pose significant challenges to protecting these species. Increased coordination and targeted funding are needed to strengthen conservation strategies for these species of concern. The Act aims to provide financial resources and promote international cooperation to restore and conserve rare felid and canid populations in the wild worldwide. The Act defines CITES as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and conservation as methods to ensure the long-term viability of rare felid and canid species in the wild, including habitat protection and management. The Act establishes the Great Cats and Rare Canids Conservation Fund to support conservation efforts for rare canid species, including habitat protection, research, law enforcement, community outreach, and capacity building. The Fund is defined as the fund established by section 6, and rare canid refers to any canid species, subspecies, or. The term \"rare felid\" refers to any felid species, subspecies, or population. A \"rare felid\" includes non-native species listed in conservation lists, excluding tigers, and is defined by the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Fund to provide financial assistance for projects conserving rare felid and canid species. Project proposals can be submitted by wildlife management authorities or individuals with expertise in conservation. Project proposals for financial assistance under this Act must include a concise statement of project purposes, the responsible individual's name, qualifications of project conductors, methods for implementation and assessment, staffing, logistics, and community involvement. Project proposals for financial assistance under this Act must include a concise statement of project purposes, the responsible individual's name, qualifications of project conductors, methods for implementation and assessment, staffing, logistics, community involvement, estimated funds and time required, support from governmental entities, matching funding information, and any other necessary details for evaluation by the Secretary. The Secretary must review project proposals within 30 days of receipt and consult with relevant wildlife management authorities within 180 days. The Secretary must review project proposals within 30 days of receipt, consult with relevant wildlife management authorities within 180 days, approve or disapprove the proposal, and provide written notification of the decision to the submitter, Federal officials, and countries involved. Projects can be approved if they contribute to the conservation of rare felids or canids in the wild by implementing conservation programs, addressing conflicts with humans, and enhancing compliance with relevant laws. The Act of 1973 prohibits the taking or trade of rare felids and canids, regulates their habitat, develops scientific information on habitat condition and population trends, promotes cooperative projects, and does not appropriate funds for purchasing. The Act of 1973 prohibits the purchase or lease of lands for felids or canids habitat. Project proposals favor long-term conservation and matching funds. Recipients must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. The Act of 1973 prohibits the purchase or lease of lands for felids or canids habitat. Project proposals favor long-term conservation and matching funds. Recipients must submit periodic reports to the Secretary. The government determines the need to evaluate project progress, ensure positive results, and make reports available to the public. Grants under the Act cannot be used for captive breeding or display of rare felids and canids, except for breeding for release into the wild. Captive breeding for release into the wild is allowed only if no other conservation method is feasible for the species. The Secretary may use up to 25 percent of funds for projects targeting rare canid and felid species not listed in section 4. An advisory group may be convened to assist in conservation efforts, with public participation in meetings. The Secretary may convene an advisory group to assist in conservation efforts, with public participation in meetings. The advisory group must provide an opportunity for interested persons to present statements at each meeting, give timely notice of meetings, keep minutes, and is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. GREAT CATS AND RARE CANIDS CONSERVATION FUND. Establishment of the Great Cats and Rare Canids Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, consisting of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. Expenditures from the Fund can be made upon request by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary. The Secretary may transfer necessary amounts from the Fund to provide assistance under section 4. Administrative expenses are limited to three percent or $80,000 for each fiscal year.
