The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a pilot program to repay loans for individuals who used them for psychiatric medicine education. Loans can be from governmental entities, private financial institutions, institutions of higher education, or other specified entities. Eligible individuals will include certain psychiatrists of the Veterans Health Administration. Eligible individuals for the pilot program must be licensed or in a residency program for psychiatric medicine in the Veterans Health Administration, showing a commitment to a long-term career as a psychiatrist. The Secretary will select at least 10 eligible individuals each year for the pilot program, with a focus on those practicing psychiatric medicine in rural areas. Participants cannot be enrolled in other federal programs that repay educational loans. The Secretary selects individuals for a pilot program in psychiatric medicine, requiring obligated service at the Veterans Health Administration in exchange for loan repayment. Loan repayments cover educational expenses. The pilot program in psychiatric medicine requires individuals to serve at the Veterans Health Administration in exchange for loan repayment. The Secretary limits payments to $60,000 per year of service. Participants who breach their service agreement are liable to repay the amount received, adjusted for the days served. The United States must be repaid within one year of a breach of the agreement. A report on the pilot program's impact on the psychiatric workforce shortage at the Veterans Health Administration must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs within 90 days of the program's termination. The Veterans Health Administration aims to improve the psychiatric workforce and promote veterans' physical and mental resiliency through strategies and regulations. The pilot program will expire three years after its commencement, with loan repayments and authorized payees being regulated. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on pay disparities of psychiatrists within the Veterans Health Administration. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on pay disparities among psychiatrists in the Veterans Health Administration, including an examination of contributing factors and recommendations for improving pay equity.

The pilot program provides a housing allowance to health care providers at rural or highly rural community-based outpatient clinics for a minimum of 36 months. The allowance is contingent on good standing within the Veterans Health Administration and assignment to a rural clinic. The monthly allowance is equivalent to the basic allowance rate for the first 36 months of participation.

Providers who complete 36 months receive a bonus equal to three months of the monthly rate, and those who complete 48 months receive additional monthly allowances. Health care providers in the pilot program receive a housing allowance based on their months of participation. Upon completing 60 months, they receive a bonus equivalent to 13 months of the monthly rate. Health care providers in the pilot program receive a housing allowance based on their months of participation, regardless of remaining in an assignment at a rural clinic. The allowance is supplemental to any other pay received. Annual reports are required one year after the program's start. The Secretary must submit annual reports to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding the pilot program, including details on the number of participants and housing allowance provided. The reports also assess the effectiveness of the housing allowance in incentivizing healthcare providers to participate in the program.

Participation in the program is limited to five years after the enactment of the Act, but individuals already in the program can continue to receive allowances. The term \"rural or highly rural community-based outpatient clinic\" in this Act refers to a clinic of the Veterans Health Administration that mainly serves veterans in rural and highly rural areas. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.
