The \"Social Security COLA Protection Act of 2004\" limits Part D premium increases based on Social Security COLA adjustments for individuals receiving benefits. The Special rule for partial premium subsidy individuals limits Part D premium increases for those enrolled in the program. If the individual is also enrolled in Part B, there is a specific factor for calculating the annual premium increase. The annual increase in premium under section 1839(a)(3) is limited for individuals enrolled in the Medicare savings program. This does not apply to those enrolled in the Medicare Advantage program. The Medicare Advantage program premium is amended to include section 1860D-13(a)(1)(F) for prescription drug beneficiaries. Payment from the Medicare prescription drug account is adjusted under section 1860D-16(b) with a new subparagraph for premium payment. The Medicare Advantage program premium is amended to include payment for cola protection premium reductions under section 1860D-13(a)(1)(F) for prescription drug beneficiaries.
