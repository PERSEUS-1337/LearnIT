    "content": "The Senate's role in confirming senior military officer promotions and appointments is derived from the U.S. Constitution. The President nominates these officers, and the Senate provides advice and consent for their appointments. The Senate has been increasingly vigilant in examining senior military officer misconduct since the early 1990s. This report focuses on the confirmation process for generals and flag officers, one-star through four-star officers. The Senate has been vigilant in examining senior military officer misconduct and ensuring nominees meet high standards of accountability. In the mid-1990s, hearings and debates focused on the suitability for promotion of senior officers. Notable confirmation cases included the Senate's decision in 1992 to deny Thomas J. Hickey the retirement rank of Air Force Lieutenant General for failing to implement key directives, the debate in 1994 over Air Force Lieutenant General Buster C. Glosson's retirement grade, and the controversy surrounding Navy Admiral Frank B. Kelso II's retirement rank due to his alleged involvement in the Tailhook Convention scandal. Senate scrutiny of senior military officers' leadership accountability remains strong, especially in cases of misconduct. Recent hearings on the U.S. Air Force Academy sexual assault scandal indicate a push for increased accountability and transparency in the Senate. This new standard aims to balance congressional oversight, the Senate's role in advising and consenting, and the Department of Defense's transparency in disclosing adverse information about senior military officers. During the confirmation process, the Department of Defense (DOD) policy requires informing the President and the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) of adverse information regarding nominated senior military officers. DOD Instruction 1320.4 outlines the procedures for processing personnel actions involving General and Flag Officers that require Senate confirmation. Adverse Information is defined as any substantiated adverse finding from an official investigation, while Alleged Adverse Information includes allegations of misconduct or conflicts of interest. The process for confirming senior military officers involves informing the President and Senate of adverse information. Promotions to one- or two-star rank are decided by a selection board, while three- and four-star appointments are nominated by the Service Secretary through the Secretary of Defense. Reappointments to higher positions require Senate confirmation. GFO retirements also need Senate confirmation. Adverse information is considered according to DOD Instruction 1320.4. DOD Instruction 1320.4 outlines how adverse information is considered during one- and two-star centralized promotion boards. Section 615, Title 10, U.S. Code, governs the procedures for providing adverse information to board members, requiring it to be substantiated and relevant. The law also mandates that officers must be informed of adverse information before it is furnished to a board. The DOD instruction requires that adverse information be reviewed for promotions and appointments, with a thorough internal review process led by the General Counsel of the military department. This includes examining records from the Inspector General, criminal investigation units, and EEO organizations. For one-star promotions, a review of the last 10 years of an officer's career is conducted to identify negative trends, while higher-ranking promotions also consider any new adverse information since the last Senate confirmation. The Service Secretary reviews adverse information for promotions and appointments, forwarding a nomination package to the Secretary of Defense if no issues exist. The Secretary of Defense endorses the nomination and forwards it to the President with a certification that no adverse information has been found since the officer's last Senate confirmation. The Secretary of Defense confirms no adverse information on the officer since the last Senate confirmation. If adverse information exists, it is disclosed in a separate summary included with the nomination package submitted to the President. The White House Clerk forwards the nomination list to the Senate Clerk 48 hours after the President signs it. DOD Public Affairs announces the nomination after Presidential signature. ASD(FMP) serves as the main DOD contact for discussing adverse information related to nominations with SASC members. They inform the Chairman of SASC if a nomination package contains adverse information. DOD typically does not report unsubstantiated allegations to the Senate, but may provide a summary in exceptional cases. ASD(FMP) also monitors nomination lists for new adverse information and conducts monthly checks with services and DOD IG. ASD(FMP) conducts monthly checks with services and DOD IG on nominations pending Senate confirmation. If adverse information is identified post-Senate submission, the military department notifies ASD(FMP) within 5 days. ASD(FMP) informs SASC and requests nomination hold until resolution. If allegations are substantiated, Service Secretary and Secretary of Defense decide on nomination support. If support continues, nomination is resubmitted for President's approval, and ASD(FMP) advises SASC to proceed with confirmation process. If the DOD administration supports the nomination, ASD(FMP) advises SASC to proceed with confirmation. In case of new adverse information, DOD may request withdrawal of nomination. Investigations of misconduct are handled separately by DOD's Inspector General and law enforcement agencies within each service. The Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations (DCIOs) within DOD investigate various crimes including fraud, bribery, financial crimes, and theft. Administrative misconduct, such as sexual harassment and abuse of authority, is handled by an inquiry directorate within each service. In September 2003, there were 275 ongoing DOD senior officer investigations, with 221 cases closed during that period. During a six-month period, the DOD closed 221 senior official cases, with 14% identifying misconduct including misuse of government property, abuse of authority, improper personnel action, sexual harassment, and other misconduct. Some analysts predict increased scrutiny on senior military officer confirmations by Congress, particularly regarding accountability for failing to promote proper leadership. Senators have shown concern over the nomination of Major General Robert Clark due to controversial circumstances during his command at Fort Campbell, Kentucky in 1991. Senator Edward M. Kennedy criticized Major General Robert Clark for allegedly permitting a climate of harassment at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Recent misconduct cases, such as the Air Force Academy sexual assault investigations, suggest increased scrutiny on senior military officer accountability during confirmation processes. The transparency of DOD investigations is crucial in holding senior commanders accountable for fostering bigotry and intimidation in the military. In the September 2003 Semiannual Report to Congress, Inspector General Joseph E. Schmitz emphasizes the importance of promoting integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness in government programs. The DOD disclosure process is transparent and well-defined, with potential administrative improvements needed. One issue is the DOD 10-year \"look-back\" policy, which may need refinement due to discrepancies in record-keeping. The DOD records disposition schedules for IG investigation reports on administrative misconduct, purging them after two years (excluding criminal investigation files). Reports involving senior military officers are held for ten years. This practice may hinder the Senate from compiling a complete ten-year record of past investigations and identifying misconduct trends. Additionally, DOD only discloses new adverse information since the last Senate confirmation, potentially preventing a full disclosure of multiple unsubstantiated allegations. The DOD IG Semiannual Report to Congress may help in disclosing adverse trends in the organizational climate of military bases during Senate confirmation processes. It currently provides statistical information on senior official inquiries but may need to include a more rigorous analysis of developing trends in command climate investigations for effective oversight functions by Members."
