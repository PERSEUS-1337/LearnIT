    "content": "Late-session maneuvering for FY2001 funding followed a rare veto of the Energy and Water appropriations bill by President Clinton. The House overrode the veto on October 11, and the Senate attached the conference bill to another appropriations bill on October 12. The final bill was signed into law on October 27. The President signed the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (P.L. 106-377) on October 27, which includes funding for various agencies and projects. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (P.L. 106-377) signed by the President allocated funds for the National Research Council (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), the Corps of Engineers, the Department of the Interior programs, and Department of Energy (DOE) programs. The requested funding for FY2001 varied for each program, with final appropriations generally exceeding the initial requests. The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill allocated $18.3 billion for various programs, including DOE's programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and energy statistics. The final bill appropriated $171.9 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other independent agencies. The budget details for energy and water appropriations enacted for FY1994 to FY2000 are provided in Table 2. The final Energy and Water bill (P.L. 106-377) allocated $4.54 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers civil projects for FY2001, exceeding the Administration's request by $481 million. The House-passed bill included $4.12 billion, the Senate-passed version had $4.11 billion, and the final version added $21.5 million to the Corps' construction budget. Funding for Corps of Engineers civil programs is often a contentious issue between the White House and Congress, with final appropriations bills typically providing more funding than requested. For FY1998, Congress added $270 million (7%) to the $3.63 billion requested by the Administration. Similarly, the FY1999 bill included $3.86 billion for the Corps, $638 million more (20%) than requested, and for FY2000, Congress provided approximately $250 million more (6%) than requested. In FY2001, the final Energy and Water bill allocated $4.54 billion for the Corps, exceeding the Administration's request by $481 million. The final bill included additional funding for various flood control and environmental infrastructure projects in different states. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Corps' project review process and called for a more streamlined approach. The Senate Appropriations Committee addressed recent allegations of improper manipulation in a study of navigation improvements on the upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway. While no specific action is recommended pending investigation, the Committee emphasized the Chief of Engineers' role in advising on water resources infrastructure investment to support the economy and citizens' quality of life. The Senate Appropriations Committee addressed criticisms of the Corps' operations and expressed dissatisfaction with the Administration's proposed management reforms. Language prohibiting reforms was not included in the final bill, but a provision for the Corps to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study the feasibility of an independent review panel for project studies was included in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The bill deleted Section 103 of the original conference report on H.R. 4733, which would have restricted funds for revising the Corps' Missouri River Master Water Control Manual. The Senate stalled on H.R. 4733 due to this issue, with a failed attempt to remove the provision. The President vetoed the bill on October 7 over this controversy regarding the operation of mainstem dams along the Missouri River. Upper basin states argue that the current manual does not reflect changes in water demand. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The bill includes $39.9 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and $776.5 million for BuRec for FY2001. Downstream states are concerned about changes in the operations manual affecting water supply for navigational uses and potential flooding below Gavins Point dam. The Energy and Water Development bill includes $776.5 million for BuRec for FY2001, $10 million more than FY2000. It also includes funds for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and activities of the Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission. Additionally, there are appropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation, including transfers from the Working Capital Fund and the U.S. Geological Survey. The Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec) manages over 600 dams in 17 western states, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. BuRec has shifted from dam construction to water resource management, focusing on safe, efficient, and sustainable operations while addressing water demands and ecosystem health in the West. The Bureau of Reclamation (BuRec) manages dams in 17 western states, providing water to farmland and people. BuRec focuses on water resource management, addressing water demands and ecosystem health in the West. The agency faces challenges in changing water allocation policies due to various governing statutes. The final bill includes $776.5 million for BuRec for FY2001, slightly more than the previous year. Funding for BuRec was unaffected by modifications to the conference bill. The House-passed bill included approximately $730 million for BuRec for FY2001, while the Senate-passed version included $752.7 million. The Administration requested around $801.03 million, $33 million more than FY2000. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees refused to fund the Administration's $60 million request for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program until it received authorization. The proposal for $20 million in CALFED funding for FY2001 was dropped in conference, along with a proposal for authorizing language similar to H.R. 5130. The Administration submitted language to extend Bay-Delta appropriations authorization. The Administration submitted language to extend the Bay-Delta appropriations authorization through FY2003, totaling $429.9 million. The FY2001 request included $60 million for Bay-Delta activities, with funds allocated for ecosystem restoration, planning, management, and other activities. The Energy and Water Development bill funded DOE programs, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. The Administration's FY2001 request was $18.06 billion, with the House approving $17.29 billion and the Senate $17.95 billion for DOE programs. The House approved $17.29 billion for DOE programs, the Senate bill contained $17.95 billion, and the final bill appropriated $18.34 billion. The FY2001 appropriation for DOE's programs for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and energy statistics was $1.46 billion. The solar and renewable energy program received a proposed boost in funding to $454.8 million. In FY2001, the Department of Energy's budget increased by $92.6 million (26%) to $18.34 billion. This included $407.8 million for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and $47.1 million for the Office of Science. The EERE funding saw increases for biofuels, wind, photovoltaics, electric and storage programs, and international renewable energy programs. Initiatives were proposed for biofuels, wind energy deployment, and photovoltaic advancements. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $352.8 million for the DOE Renewable Energy Program, with an additional $37.7 million added through an amendment. The Senate approved $444.1 million for the program, including funding for various renewable energy initiatives. The final bill appropriated $422.1 million for renewable energy programs, with increases in funding for Electric/Storage, Photovoltaics, Biofuels-Power, Wind, Biofuels-Transportation, and Geothermal. However, there was a decrease in funding for the Renewable Energy Program compared to the request, including reductions for Wind, Biofuels-Transportation, Biofuels-Power, International Renewables, Photovoltaics, and Departmental Energy Management programs. The enacted bill provides $259.9 million for nuclear energy programs, which is $30 million below the Administration's request. The legislation transfers $53.4 million for uranium management programs and adds $9 million for depleted uranium stockpile treatment. The approved bill includes $35 million for the nuclear energy research initiative (NERI). The enacted bill provides $7.5 million for a separate program on nuclear energy technologies, including funding for a next-generation power reactor, improvements in light water reactors, support for an advanced gas-cooled reactor, and a feasibility study for small modular reactors. Additionally, the bill includes $5 million for \"nuclear energy plant optimization\" (NEPO) to improve economic competitiveness. The NEPO program aims to enhance the economic competitiveness of existing nuclear power plants by extending their operating lives and improving efficiency. Funding for NEPO is part of the Administration's Climate Change Technology Initiative, with non-federal partners required to share costs. The goal is to increase the average production of U.S. nuclear plants to 85% capacity by 2010, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear energy is highlighted as a proven large-scale power source with unlimited potential. The DOE's nuclear energy research programs have faced criticism for providing wasteful subsidies to a failing industry. Controversy surrounds the \"electrometallurgical treatment\" of DOE spent fuel, aimed at rendering sodium-bonded spent fuel safe for long-term storage and disposal. The process involves melting metal fuel and separating highly radioactive isotopes from uranium and plutonium. DOE received $40 million in FY1999 for a demonstration program on this technology. Continued research on sodium-bonded fuel treatment received funding for FY2000 and FY2001. The appropriations act establishes a new DOE program called Advanced Accelerator Applications. Opponents of electrometallurgical treatment raise concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. The DOE established a new program called Advanced Accelerator Applications, including $3 million for research on accelerator transmutation of waste at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. The program aims to use particle accelerators to convert long-lived radioactive waste into safer, shorter-lived elements. Funding for the program was not provided in FY2001, but the Senate earmarked $5 million for studies in Nevada. Additionally, the enacted measure includes $44 million for the Fast Flux Test Facility at Hanford, Washington. The Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) at Hanford, Washington received a funding boost of $5 million above the budget request and $16 million above the FY2000 level. The reactor has not operated since 1992 and DOE is considering whether to restart it for nuclear research or shut it down. DOE's science programs cover basic research in various fields including high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and environmental research. The DOE science programs received funding increases in FY2001, with the final bill including $3.186 billion, 0.75% above the request. The increase was concentrated in three areas, including $162 million for the Spallation Neutron Source project. The House and Senate initially approved different amounts for construction funding, but the final bill provided $259.5 million. The final bill provided $259.5 million for DOE funding, slightly below the request. The House approved only $5 million increase for civilian IT research, while the Senate approved around $20 million by shifting funds. The bill also included additional funding for nanoscience and nanotechnology research within BES. The Senate provided strong support for the initiative, initially only funding 56% of the requested BES funding. However, funds were later restored in the final bill, which provided the full request. The House's appropriation for the BER program was 8.8% below the request, citing funding constraints. The Senate approved funding the program at 0.3% below the request, with the final bill providing $500.3 million, 14.1% above the request. The House approved funding for High Energy and Nuclear Physics programs at their requested level, but the Senate's appropriation was about 5.3% below the request. The Senate's appropriation for Fusion Energy Sciences program was initially 8.1% below the request due to budget constraints, but funding was restored in the final bill at the House mark. The Nuclear Weapons Stewardship R&D aims to maintain the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile through computational simulations and experimental facilities. The Department of Energy reorganized its nuclear weapons stewardship R&D programs, creating four new programs. Funding for weapons R&D saw a slight increase in FY2001, with the House approving a 0.2% increase and the Senate approving a 4.9% increase. The House directed DOE to consolidate certain activities within the campaigns program and approved a transfer of funds for this purpose. The Senate approved a 4.9% increase in funding for weapons R&D, expressing concerns about the slow pace of the stockpile stewardship program. The final bill included $2.454 billion for weapons R&D, with most of the increase allocated to the NIF project under the new NNSA organization created by Congress. The Senate approved increased funding for weapons R&D, expressing concerns about the stockpile stewardship program. The NNSA is urged to make major changes in DOE management. A major problem is the cost overrun on the National Ignition Facility, with estimates ranging from $3.26 billion to $3.9 billion due to management and technical issues during construction. The DOE has not amended its FY2001 budget request for the National Ignition Facility (NIF), which was $74 million for construction plus about $85 million in related costs. Congress directed the DOE to provide a new cost baseline by June 1, 2000, or an estimate of termination costs. The House reserved judgment on the NIF project until September, while the Senate proposed capping funding for NIF at $74.1 million until a study by the National Academy of Sciences was completed. The study would assess NIF's contribution to the Stockpile Stewardship program and determine if technical problems could increase costs. The funding for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) for FY2001 was agreed to at $199 million, with $65 million from transferred funds and $134.1 million in new appropriations. The final appropriations bill limits DOE's available funds for NIF to $130 million at the start of FY2001, releasing the rest after March 31, 2001 upon meeting certain conditions. These conditions include reviewing construction options, meeting project milestones, completing a study on NIF's necessity, and providing a five-year plan for funding. The total NIF project cost is estimated at $3.45 billion. The House raised concerns about the use of Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funds, with Congress reducing the funding level to 4% for labs in FY2000. DOE requested a restoration to 6% for FY2001, but the House kept it at 4% and directed DOE to submit specific requests for these funds in future budgets. The Senate approved a level of 8% with funds from Environmental Management programs. The final decision was a level of 6% for laboratories and 2% for weapons production plants, with a requirement for DOE to produce a financial accounting report for these funds. DOE's nonproliferation and national security programs, including Cooperative Threat Reduction programs, arms control treaty verification programs, and intelligence programs, support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. These programs are now part of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and receive funding from both DOE and the Department of Defense. The FY2001 budget request for these programs was $865.6 million, with the House approving $861.5 million. The Energy and Water appropriations bill for FY2001 allocated $874.2 million for DOE nuclear nonproliferation programs. This included $100 million for a new long-term nonproliferation program with Russia to address the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons. The funds would be used to store Russian nuclear waste and enhance safety and security of nuclear materials in Russia. The FY2001 Energy and Water appropriations bill allocated $6.4 billion for DOE's Environmental Management Program, responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination and disposing of radioactive waste at DOE nuclear sites. The enacted measure cut funding for privatization of waste management projects, transferring $377 million to the Office of River Protection at Hanford for waste solidification efforts. The FY2001 Energy and Water appropriations bill allocated $6.4 billion for DOE's Environmental Management Program. The conferees approved a rescission of $97 million for waste solidification efforts at Hanford. The budget request focused on an accelerated cleanup strategy to maximize completed sites by FY2006, aiming for long-term savings. $1.1 billion is allocated for defense facilities closure projects, including Rocky Flats and Fernald sites. Another $981.5 million is provided for site/project completion. The FY2001 Energy and Water appropriations bill allocated $6.4 billion for DOE's Environmental Management Program, with $981.5 million provided for site/project completion. The bulk of EM's funding is in the \"post-2006 completion\" account, including the Office of River Protection at Hanford, with $3.46 billion allocated for post-2006 completion projects. This includes the Hanford waste solidification project, called the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS), seeking $450 million for a pilot vitrification plant. The Department of Energy (DOE) requested $450 million for the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) in FY2001, the largest item in the privatization funding request. TWRS faced a setback when costs were estimated at $15.2 billion, leading DOE to seek a new contractor and traditional financing. The House cut TWRS funding to $194 million, while the Senate approved $259 million. Another project, the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project in Idaho, received $65 million in funding. Residents in Wyoming opposed the project due to concerns about radioactivity from an incinerator, prompting Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to halt further work. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson halted further work on the incinerator in Wyoming due to opposition from residents concerned about radioactivity. The privatization effort aims to reduce costs by increasing competition for cleanup work and shifting project risks to contractors, who would earn profits based on performance. Contractors would be expected to raise most funding for the project themselves. Under the privatization initiative, contractors would fund necessary facilities and equipment for projects, recovering costs and earning profits through negotiated fees for services like solidifying radioactive waste. Higher profits are possible with cost reductions, but losses could occur if costs exceed expectations or services are not delivered. If a project is cancelled, the federal government would reimburse the contractor's expenses. DOE must ensure sufficient funding is appropriated as construction progresses. Hanford TWRS project was deemed too risky by DOE. DOE's $295 million request for decontamination and decommissioning of uranium enrichment plants and mill sites received a 21% boost over the FY2000 appropriation, with the final bill providing a further increase to $345 million. Much of the increase was targeted towards environmental cleanup activities at DOE's uranium enrichment plants at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio. The enacted measure also includes an additional $42 million for reimbursing the mining industry for cleaning up uranium and thorium mill waste. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for the mining industry to clean up uranium and thorium mill waste. The enacted bill allocated $401 million for civilian nuclear waste, slightly below the budget request but higher than the previous year. The DOE is studying Yucca Mountain as a potential national waste repository, with plans to open in 2010. Increased funding is needed for site recommendation and license application in FY2001. The House and Senate disagreed on funding for nuclear waste disposal in FY2001. The House Appropriations Committee report suggested DOE could meet its objectives with a smaller increase in funding. Funding for the program comes from the Nuclear Waste Fund and the defense nuclear waste disposal account. The House voted to appropriate $213 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $200 million for the defense disposal account. The Senate approved $292 million from the defense disposal account and $59 million from other sources. The Senate approved $292 million from the defense disposal account and $59 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The final act provides $191 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $200 million from the defense account, totaling $401 million. The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act deadline of January 31, 1998. Utilities and state utility regulators have won federal court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet the deadline and compensate for any damages. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to market excess power generated from dams and water projects. Utilities have won court cases upholding DOE's obligation to meet deadlines and compensate for damages. Utilities can sue DOE for damages without pursuing administrative remedies. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) including BPA, SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA sell power at wholesale rates to utilities and federal agencies. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and co-ops. PMAs do not own generating facilities but own transmission facilities. The 104th Congress debated divesting the PMAs, with one PMA already divested in 1995. The future of remaining PMAs depends on decisions regarding public power in electric utility restructuring. The Administration's request for the PMAs for FY2001 was $199.6 million, a 25% reduction from FY2000. Customers of SEPA, WAPA, and SWPA would be responsible for their power purchases and transmission arrangements. The proposed elimination of the Purchase Power and Wheeling Program aims to simplify and reduce costs for PMA customers. The final bill appropriated $200.7 million for the three PMAs, with funding for the Denali Commission and Delta Regional Authority included. Independent agencies funded under the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Appalachian Regional Commission, and Denali Commission. The final bill includes the full request by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for $481.9 million in FY2001, an increase of $16.9 million over FY2000. The funding request provides an additional $6.2 million for the NRC inspector general's office, which the enacted measure cuts to $5.5 million. Both the House and Senate had taken the same action. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees sharply criticized NRC in 1998 for allegedly failing to overhaul its regulatory system in line with improvements in nuclear industry safety. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) faced criticism for inconsistencies in regional offices, interference in nuclear plant management, and outdated review processes. However, improvements were noted in the FY2000 budget cycle. NRC's budget has been funded 100% by fees from nuclear power plants and licensed activities. The industry argued that the fee structure required them to pay for programs they did not directly benefit from. To address this, the final bill includes a proposal to phase down fee recovery to 90% over the next 5 years. The Senate approved a phasedown plan to reduce fee recovery for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to 90% over the next 5 years. Various CRS Issue Briefs and Reports cover topics such as nuclear energy policy, waste disposal, renewable energy, DOE restructuring, Western water issues, and Department of Energy programs and budgets."
