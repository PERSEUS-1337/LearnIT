    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1720 of the Labor Code is amended to define \"public works\" as construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work paid for with public funds, excluding work by public utility companies. This includes work in design, preconstruction, postconstruction phases, and installation of office systems. (2) Work done for irrigation, utility, reclamation, and improvement districts, and other similar districts. Excludes operation of irrigation or drainage systems, except as specified in Section 1778 regarding retaining wages.\n(3) Street, sewer, or other improvement work under the authority of state officers or public bodies, regardless of the type of charter.\n(4) Carpet laying under a building lease-maintenance contract paid for with public funds.\n(5) Carpet laying in a public building under contract paid for with public funds.\n(6) Public transportation demonstration projects authorized by Section 143 of the Streets and Highways Code. Infrastructure project grants from the California Advanced Services Fund are included in this section. The Public Utilities Commission is not involved in awarding contracts. \"Paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\" includes direct payments, construction work, and asset transfers below fair market value by the state or political subdivision. The requirements of this chapter include fees, costs, loans, interest rates, and obligations that are adjusted by the state or political subdivision. Private residential projects on private property are exempt unless built under an agreement with a government agency. If a private developer is required by the state or a political subdivision to perform construction work on a public project as a condition of regulatory approval, and no additional funding or proprietary interest is provided by the state or subdivision, only the public work is subject to this chapter. If the state or a political subdivision reimburses a private developer for costs or provides a public subsidy de minimis in the context of the project, the private development project is not subject to this chapter. A public subsidy is de minimis if it is less than $250,000 and less than 2% of the total project cost, excluding projects advertised or awarded before July 1, 2016. The construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing units for low- or moderate-income persons using funds from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund or private funds is not considered a project funded by public funds. Privately owned residential projects may be exempt from certain requirements if they meet specific conditions, such as self-help housing projects with a minimum of 500 hours of construction work by home buyers. The project involves rehabilitating or expanding a not-for-profit facility for homeless individuals with a total cost under $25,000. Assistance can be in the form of mortgage aid, downpayment support, or single-family home rehabilitation. The project involves new construction, expansion, or rehabilitation work for a nonprofit organization to provide emergency shelter and services to homeless adults and children. The organization must fund at least 50% of the project cost from nonpublic sources, excluding real property. Total project cost includes donated labor and materials. (E) Public participation in the project involves below-market interest rate loans for a project where 40% of units are restricted for 20 years to individuals/families earning 80% or less of the area median income. Qualified residential rental projects financed through bonds allocated state ceiling before December 31, 2003 are exempt from certain requirements. Single-family residential projects financed with qualified mortgage revenue bonds or qualified veterans\u2019 mortgage bonds, or with mortgage credit certificates under a Qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, that receive allocation of the state ceiling before December 31, 2003, are eligible. Low-income housing projects allocated federal or state low-income housing tax credits before December 31, 2003, also qualify. The exclusions in subdivision (d) do not apply to projects where this chapter is applied by a statute, regulation, ordinance, or contract. References to the Internal Revenue Code mean the 1986 version and its predecessor sections. Local ordinances requiring prevailing wages on housing projects are not preempted by the amendments made to this section."
