Congress has found that the Byrne Grants program has perpetuated racial disparities, corruption in law enforcement, and civil rights abuses, especially with funding for regional antidrug task forces. Government reports have shown inadequate monitoring of these grants by the Justice Department. A General Accounting Office report revealed deficiencies in monitoring plans for grants, with a lack of progress and financial reports. The Heritage Foundation's 2002 report questioned the effectiveness of Byrne grants in reducing crime and criticized the program for lacking performance measures. The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas identified 17 scandals involving Byrne-funded antidrug task forces, including serious misconduct like falsifying records and selling drugs to children. Recent scandals involving Byrne grant money in various States include selling drugs to children, racial profiling, sexual harassment, and other abuses of official capacity. One notable scandal occurred in Tulia, Texas, where numerous African American residents were wrongfully arrested and sentenced based on the testimony of one undercover officer. The Tulia, Texas scandal involved wrongful arrests and convictions based on the testimony of an undercover officer with a questionable background. Despite lack of evidence, many defendants were convicted until alibis proved their innocence. Governor Rick Perry eventually pardoned the Tulia defendants. In Waco, Texas, 28 African Americans were wrongfully arrested for drug charges, leading to a lawsuit against the county government. A Byrne-funded anti-drug task force was found to have targeted African Americans, resulting in the county being held liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiffs. The lawsuit alleged that informants' uncorroborated tales had led to unjust arrests over the past 15 years. The Hearne task force scandal involved annual raids on the African American community based on uncorroborated informant tales, leading to wrongful arrests. Counties settled the case and paid damages to the plaintiffs. Texas legislature passed reforms outlawing racial profiling and convicting based solely on informant testimony. In 2004, a report recommended abolishing federally funded antidrug task forces due to corruption risks. Texas legislature passed a law transferring authority for drug task forces to the Department of Public Safety. Texas's asset forfeiture proceeds are allocated to support drug abuse prevention programs in the county where assets are seized. A coalition of Christian conservatives and civil rights activists in Texas passed a law requiring corroboration to protect against false witness. Mosaic law was cited during the debate to support the need for corroboration. Texas's \"corroboration\" law, inspired by Mosaic law, required multiple witnesses to establish guilt in criminal cases. This led to increased scrutiny of law enforcement tactics, uncovering corruption and civil rights abuses. The \"Sheetrock\" scandal exposed massive corruption and civil rights abuses within the Dallas police force. Officers and informants were caught framing innocent people, mostly Mexican immigrants, by planting fake drugs made of chalk-like material. This led to the dismissal of over 40 cases and a former detective being sentenced to 5 years in prison. Charges against others are still pending. Many regional antidrug task forces rely heavily on funding from the Byrne grant program, making the US government accountable for corruption. The United States Government should prohibit Byrne grants for States that do not control corruption and civil rights abuses in their task forces. States must not allow criminal convictions based solely on law enforcement officer or informant testimony to receive Byrne grants; corroborative evidence should always be required for such convictions. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON RECEIPT OF BYRNE GRANT FUNDS AND OTHER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE: States must not allow criminal convictions based solely on law enforcement officer or informant testimony to receive Byrne grants; corroborative evidence should always be required for such convictions. States must not receive certain federal funds unless they do not fund drug task forces or have laws in place requiring corroborative evidence for drug offense convictions. The Attorney General will establish regulations for evaluating the honesty and integrity of law enforcement officers participating in drug task forces. Unallocated funds due to non-compliance will be reallocated to compliant states. SEC. 4. COLLECTION OF DATA. A State receiving funds must collect data on racial distribution of charges, nature of criminal law, and city where charges were made. This data must be reported to Congress 180 days before funds are awarded for each fiscal year."
