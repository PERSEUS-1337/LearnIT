    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Downed Animal and Food Safety Protection Act\" and includes a finding and declaration of policy. The \"Downed Animal and Food Safety Protection Act\" finds that euthanizing nonambulatory livestock in interstate and foreign commerce prevents suffering, improves working conditions, enhances product quality, and reduces disease spread. The policy states that all nonambulatory livestock in interstate and foreign commerce must be promptly and humanely euthanized. SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL SLAUGHTER PRACTICES INVOLVING NONAMBULATORY LIVESTOCK. This section amends the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 to address nonambulatory livestock. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as covered entity, establishment, humanely euthanize, and nonambulatory livestock. Covered entities include stockyards, market agencies, dealers, packers, slaughter facilities, and establishments covered by the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Humanely euthanize means rendering an animal unconscious until death, and nonambulatory livestock refers to animals unable to stand. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish regulations for the humane treatment of nonambulatory livestock by covered entities, requiring their humane euthanasia. Covered entities must immediately euthanize nonambulatory livestock, with exceptions for disease testing. The regulations require covered entities to humanely euthanize nonambulatory livestock, with exceptions for disease testing and movement restrictions. Inspectors are prohibited from passing nonambulatory livestock through inspection. The regulations mandate labeling of condemned materials by inspectors. Violating entities face fines up to $5,000, imprisonment up to one year, or both. State laws with stricter requirements or penalties are not preempted. The effective date of the amendment is one year after enactment, with regulations to follow within the same timeframe. The Secretary of Agriculture must issue final regulations within one year of the enactment of the Act to implement the amendment regarding labeling of condemned materials."
