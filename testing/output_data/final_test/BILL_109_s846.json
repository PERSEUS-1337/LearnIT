Section 13 of the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to revoke certain exemptions from overtime pay provisions and reinstate previous regulations. The Secretary will adjust the minimum salary level for exemption accordingly. The Secretary will increase the minimum salary level for exemption under section 13(a)(1) for executive, administrative, and managerial occupations from $155 per week in 1975 to $591 per week, based on the Employment Cost Index. This adjustment will occur annually. The minimum salary level for exemption will be increased annually based on the Employment Cost Index for executive, administrative, and managerial occupations. TITLE II--FAIR MINIMUM WAGE\n\nSEC. 111. MINIMUM WAGE.\n\nAmends the Fair Labor Standards Act to increase the minimum wage to $5.85 an hour, $6.55 an hour after 12 months, and $7.25 an hour after 24 months from the date of enactment. Effective 60 days after the Act is enacted. The Senate findings highlight the importance of multiemployer pension plans in providing benefits to millions of American workers and retirees. These plans offer accessibility and affordability for small employers and allow workers to earn pensions even during job changes. The 2000-2002 stock market drop affected multiemployer plans, threatening retirement income stability. Employers could face penalties due to market losses. In 2004, the Senate passed relief provisions for pension plans. The Senate strongly supports multiemployer defined benefit pension plans and legislation to protect their viability for current and retired members and their families."
