    "content": "The FBI's recent crime data shows an increase in national rates for violent crime and homicide from 2014 to 2016. The violent crime rate rose from 361.6 to 386.3 per 100,000 people, while the homicide rate increased from 4.4 to 5.3 per 100,000. These increases contrast with long-term declines since the early 1990s, with a significant rise in the homicide rate during this period. The violent crime rate increased by approximately 3% from 2014 to 2016, breaking recent trends of decrease. The homicide rate also saw significant increases of 11% in 2015 and 8% in 2016. Short-term crime fluctuations should be viewed in the context of longer time periods to determine underlying trends. Homicide rates have generally trended downward since the early 1990s, with some fluctuations in between. Despite increases in violent crime and homicide rates from 2014 to 2016, both rates remained at levels not seen since the mid-1960s. The 2016 rates are approximately half their post-1960 highs. The analysis of violent crime and homicide data at a local level can provide insight into national trends. Violent crime rates varied in U.S. cities from 2014 to 2015, with increases in larger cities and decreases in some mid-sized cities. From 2015 to 2016, violent crime rates increased in cities of all sizes. The rates rose by 6% in cities with 1 million or more people, 3% in cities with 500,000-999,999 people, and 5% in cities with 250,000-499,999 people. Homicide rates also increased in cities of all sizes from 2014 to 2015, with a 9% increase in cities with 1 million or more people. Homicide rates increased in cities of various sizes from 2015 to 2016. The rates rose by 9% in cities with 1 million or more people, 11% in cities with 500,000-999,999 people, and 3% in cities with 250,000-499,999 people. Additionally, from 1990 to 2016, there was an overall increase in homicide rates across different city populations. From 2014 to 2016, violent crime in the largest US cities increased significantly, with a few cities driving the majority of the rise. Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Baltimore accounted for 60% of the net increase in violent crimes from 2014 to 2015. The top 10 cities with the largest increases in violent crimes during this period contributed to 97% of the overall increase. In the following year, there was a net increase of 24,218 violent crimes in these cities, with Chicago, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston seeing notable increases. Increases in violent crime in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston were significant, accounting for a majority of the net increase. The top 10 cities with the largest increases in violent crime from 2015 to 2016 contributed to a large portion of the overall rise. Similarly, there was a notable increase in homicides in these cities from 2014 to 2015, with Baltimore alone accounting for a significant portion of the net increase. From 2014 to 2015, 10 cities including Baltimore, Chicago, and Houston accounted for 76% of the net increase in homicides. Chicago saw a significant increase, making up 45% of the total. From 2015 to 2016, the same cities saw a net increase of 632 homicides, with Chicago, Memphis, and San Antonio contributing to 94% of the rise. Violent crime rates in nearly half of the 48 largest US cities increased during this period, showing fluctuations in city-level crime rates over the years. The violent crime rates in large cities fluctuate from year to year, as shown in Figure 8. Increases in violent crime rates are not unusual and do not always indicate continued increases. For example, Kansas City had a 30% increase in 2006-2007 followed by a 36% decrease in 2008-2011. In contrast, Los Angeles saw a 13% increase in violent crime rate for three consecutive years. This breaks with long-term historical trends, as the rate had mostly decreased since 1997. The violent crime rates in large cities fluctuate annually, with some cities experiencing increases in rates. From 2014 to 2016, more cities saw a rise in homicide rates compared to violent crime rates. Milwaukee and Wichita had their highest violent crime rates since before 1997 due to increases in 2015-2016. In large cities, homicide rates can have significant percentage increases compared to overall violent crime rates. For example, Arlington, TX, saw a 150% increase in homicide rate from 2015 to 2016, with the rate rising from 2.1 to 5.3 per 100,000 due to an increase in homicides from 8 to 21. Despite the increase, Arlington still had one of the lowest homicide rates among major U.S. cities. Atlanta also experienced a rise in homicide rate from 20.2 to 23.5 per 100,000 from 2015 to 2016, resulting in a 16% increase. An examination of homicide trends in large cities shows significant percentage increases in some cities, such as Albuquerque and Kansas City, where rates rose by approximately 40% from 2014 to 2015 or 2015 to 2016. These increases are not uncommon and often fluctuate from year to year, running counter to long-term trends. Increases in homicide rates were seen in some cities like Nashville and Louisville from 2014 to 2016, breaking long-term trends. Despite this, the rates in many of the 48 largest cities remained lower than any time since 1997. However, six cities including Chicago and Baltimore reached a 20-year high in their homicide rates in 2015 or 2016. Recent increases in violent crime and homicide rates in large U.S. cities are concerning, but the country as a whole is not experiencing a national crime wave. Crime rates fluctuate yearly, with higher rates in large cities. Some cities saw increases in crime from 2014 to 2016, while others only saw increases in one of those years or decreases in both. The \"Ferguson effect\" theory has gained attention as a possible explanation for these trends. The Ferguson effect is a controversial explanation for the recent increases in violent crime in some cities. It suggests that negative publicity and public protest over police practices in Ferguson, MO, have led to \"de-policing\" and a lack of trust in law enforcement, empowering individuals to challenge the legitimacy of police. The Ferguson effect is a debated theory linking increased violent crime rates to negative publicity and public protest over police practices in Ferguson, MO. Research on this effect shows mixed evidence, with some data suggesting that police behavior has changed in response to high-profile incidents, leading to de-policing. However, limitations in the data make it difficult to determine the extent of the impact on crime rates. The study notes a decrease in clearance rates for reported offenses in cities with populations over 100,000 from 2014 to 2015, coinciding with an increase in homicides. This decline in clearance rates aligns with a decrease in proactive policing, although the trend was observed before the events in Ferguson, MO. Clearance rates for serious and minor offenses have also been decreasing for years prior to 2015, despite declining violent crime and homicide rates. The study found that increases in homicides could be linked to decreasing police legitimacy and distrust of the police due to high-profile use of force cases. Calls to the police in Milwaukee decreased significantly after a black man was beaten by the police, especially in black neighborhoods. It is unclear if other cities experienced similar decreases in police calls post-Ferguson, and the extent to which reduced reliance on the police contributed to rising violent crime rates. Additional studies examined crime rates in 81 cities post-Ferguson but found no systematic increase in total, violent, or property crimes. The study found no systematic increase in total, violent, or property crime rates post-Ferguson across all cities. However, there was evidence of increases in robbery rates but no significant increase in other property or violent offenses. The analysis could not determine the impact of de-policing or police legitimacy crisis on crime rates. Another study in Missouri evaluated the link between de-policing and crime rates using traffic stop and crime data. The analysis on de-policing and crime rates in 2015 showed that despite a decrease in police stops, there was no corresponding decrease in searches or arrests. However, police had higher hit rates, indicating more effective stops. In areas with more African-Americans, there were fewer stops, searches, and arrests, suggesting a racial influence on de-policing. No direct link was found between reduced stops and crime rates. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University also studied the Ferguson effect on crime rates and arrests in Baltimore. After analyzing changes in crime rates and arrests in Baltimore following events in Ferguson and Freddie Gray's death, researchers found little evidence of a Ferguson effect before Gray's death. There was a spike in crime after Gray's death, partially decreasing after a new police commissioner was appointed. It is unclear if this spike is evidence of a Ferguson effect, as evaluating the Gray effect is challenging due to its entanglement with the Ferguson effect narrative. The debate on the Ferguson effect gained momentum after the unrest in Baltimore. The crime spike during the Gray period could be a Ferguson effect ignited by localized factors. The size and duration of the spike were likely influenced by gang-related conflicts and a police pullback. Some of the crime spike may be attributed to the Gray effect rather than the Ferguson effect. The Johns Hopkins study found some evidence of a potential Ferguson effect in arrest data. The Johns Hopkins study found evidence of a potential Ferguson effect in Baltimore arrest data. Arrests decreased for lower-level crimes post-Ferguson and continued to decline after Freddie Gray's death. However, arrests for violent crimes remained steady. The researchers suggest that the crime spike after Gray's death was more likely due to unrest handling than declining arrests. There is evidence of a potential Ferguson effect in Baltimore arrest data, with a decrease in arrests for lower-level crimes post-Ferguson. However, there is little evidence linking de-policing to increases in violent crime. The decrease in arrests may not be detrimental if it does not lead to an increase in crime and reduces tensions between minority communities and the police. The decrease in discretionary arrests in Baltimore post-Ferguson could be seen as a positive development for the community, as it aligns with the belief that robust policing in struggling areas may not aid in their redevelopment. While national violent crime rates are not surging, some U.S. cities are experiencing significant increases in violent crime, particularly homicides. Policymakers may need to consider providing more funding to support crime-reduction efforts in these affected cities. Policymakers could consider increasing funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to support crime-prevention efforts in cities experiencing rises in violent crime. Additional funds would be distributed to eligible state and local governments based on a formula, with no requirement to use the funds specifically for violent crime prevention programs. Congress may also need to amend 34 U.S.C. \u00a710157(b) to ensure the Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces the allocation of funds. Consider amending 34 U.S.C. \u00a710157(b) to require the Department of Justice (DOJ) to allocate a portion of the annual JAG appropriation for addressing sudden increases in crime. Additional funding could be provided to discretionary grant programs like COPS hiring program, Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation program, or a new grant program supporting evidence-based policing strategies. Congress could influence grant awards to target specific entities for funding. Congress could influence grant awards by placing conditions on appropriated funding, such as directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to cities with high violent crime rates or those with significant increases in homicide rates. Additionally, Congress may consider providing resources to expand the National Public Safety Partnership (PSP), an initiative established by DOJ to assist law enforcement agencies in combating violent crime. The National Public Safety Partnership (PSP) assists law enforcement in combating violent crime, focusing on gangs, gun violence, and drug trafficking. PSP provides training and technical assistance to develop violence reduction strategies. However, criticism has been raised for not selecting cities with the greatest need for assistance like Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Nashville, and Washington, DC. Selected cities do not receive additional funding to implement their strategies. The National Public Safety Partnership (PSP) does not receive additional funding to help cities implement violence reduction strategies. Authorizing legislation could set criteria for city selection and provide funding for the program. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program includes four subprograms collecting data on offenses, arrests, and clearances. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program collects data on offenses, arrests, and clearances for Part I and Part II offenses. Law enforcement agencies voluntarily submit crime data to the FBI for inclusion in the UCR. The FBI's UCR program collects crime data from law enforcement agencies monthly. In 2016, about 18,400 agencies reported data, covering over 99% of the US population. However, UCR data only includes Part I crimes, not Part II crimes, which limits its usefulness for evaluating crime trends. The UCR SRS does not collect data on crimes like kidnapping, bribery, or child pornography. Unreported crimes are common, with only 42% of violent victimizations reported to the police in 2016. Reporting practices of law enforcement can also impact UCR data accuracy. Local law enforcement agencies must closely follow the FBI's definitions for crimes under the UCR to ensure accurate reporting. Improved organizational practices, such as increasing patrol officers and developing better citizen relationships, can lead to an increase in reported offenses. Additionally, better record-keeping systems and more employees can also contribute to higher reported crime numbers. Law enforcement agencies must adhere to the FBI's rules for classifying and reporting crimes to the UCR program. The hierarchy rule dictates that only the most serious offense is reported in cases involving multiple Part I offenses. This rule reduces the number of offenses reported, but around 85% of incidents involve only one offense. If data is missing, the FBI uses imputation techniques to fill in the gaps. When a law enforcement agency does not report UCR data to the FBI for the entire year, imputation techniques are used to estimate the missing data. The FBI calculates the mean for the months of acceptable data and applies it to the missing months. Agencies that submit one or two months of data are treated as \"non-reporters\" and their data are imputed based on agencies that submitted data for all 12 months. The FBI uses imputation techniques to estimate missing crime data from agencies that do not report for the entire year. The annual crime rate for the stratum is applied to non-reporting agencies' population to impute the number of offenses. Assumptions are made when estimating crime in jurisdictions with missing data, such as assuming the crime rate for non-reported months is the same as the average rate for reported months. The imputation procedure used by the FBI estimates missing crime data by assuming that cities with similar populations have similar crime rates, considering factors like income distribution, unemployment rates, population density, and racial composition. This helps in estimating the annual crime rate for non-reporting jurisdictions."
