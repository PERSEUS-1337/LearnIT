    "content": "Artistic style transfer involves synthesizing an image with content similar to one image and style similar to another. Current models lack user control over the output and require adjusting hyper-parameters for desired results. A novel method proposed in this paper allows real-time adjustment of key parameters to modify synthesized outputs. The text discusses user control in modifying synthesized outputs for artistic style transfer, comparing it to retraining the model with different hyper-parameters. It also explores how adjusting parameters can generate diverse yet similar results in style and content. Neural style transfer techniques have shown effectiveness in capturing visual styles and content for image generation. The text discusses the challenges of style transfer methods, including the vague definition of similarity and the need for diverse yet similar stylizations. It highlights the desire for a single model that can generate varied results in real-time by adjusting input parameters and addresses the issue of high sensitivity to hyper-parameters in current methods. Current real-time style transfer methods aim to minimize losses from different layers of a pre-trained image classification model, resulting in different styles based on weight sets. However, finding the optimal set of weights for each style/content pair is subjective and impractical to achieve through constant model retraining. Adjusting input parameters can generate varied stylized images in real-time, showcasing different styles while maintaining the same content. The primary goal of this paper is to address issues in real-time style transfer by providing a mechanism for adjusting stylized images after training. An auxiliary network with additional parameters can change the style transfer process by adjusting weights between losses, allowing for control over how the stylized image is formed and generating multiple stochastic stylized images from a fixed style/content pair. The proposed method allows for generating multiple stochastic stylized images from a fixed style/content pair. Previous methods in style transfer have focused on generating one stylization for a single pair of content/style image, while the proposed method introduces a stochastic element in the generation process. The project website can be visited to view the generated stylizations. The proposed method introduces a stochastic element in generating multiple stylized images from a fixed style/content pair. Various methods have been studied in domains like colorizations, image synthesis, video prediction, and domain transfer, with style loss function being crucial in affecting output stylization. Gram matrix is a common style loss, but alternative losses like correlation alignment and histogram loss have been introduced to measure distances between feature statistics of style and stylized images. The proposed method introduces a stochastic element in generating multiple stylized images from a fixed style/content pair. It utilizes Gram matrix as a common style loss, along with correlation alignment and histogram loss to measure distances between feature statistics of style and stylized images. Recent work has also incorporated depth similarity into the loss function. The closest related work utilized Julesz ensemble to encourage diversity in stylizations explicitly. The architecture of the proposed model includes loss adjustment parameters passed to the network for predicting activation normalizers that normalize activation of the main stylizing network. The stylized image is then passed to a trained image classifier to calculate style and content loss from its intermediate representation. The proposed method introduces a stochastic element in generating multiple stylized images from a fixed style/content pair using Gram matrix as a style loss. The model includes loss adjustment parameters for predicting activation normalizers and utilizes correlation alignment and histogram loss. At generation time, values for adjustment parameters can be manually adjusted or randomly sampled for varied stylizations. The method is more effective in diverse stylization compared to other techniques. Style transfer involves generating a stylized image with similar content to one image and style to another. Features from a pre-trained image classification network, like VGG-19, are used to define content and style. The goal is to increase similarity by minimizing distances between extracted features. The total loss in style transfer is calculated as a weighted sum of content and style losses across different layers. Hyper-parameters are manually adjusted to control the contribution of each layer to the loss. The objective of style transfer is to minimize a defined function through iterative optimization methods starting from an initial random noise or content image. Training a deep network T can generate stylized images faster than iterative methods. Different networks need to be trained per style image, but this method can produce real-time stylized images. Recent methods have introduced real-time style transfer for multiple styles, addressing issues in real-time stylization. In real-time feed-forward style transfer methods, the output is sensitive to hyper-parameters and different weights significantly affect the generated stylized image. Finding a good set of weights must be repeated for each style image, limiting the practicality of style transfer models. Randomizing parameters results in different stylizations while maintaining style features in the same spatial position. Adding random noise to the content image can move these features with fixed parameters. Combining randomization techniques can produce versatile stylized outputs with varying styles and spatial positions. Current methods generate single stylized images, making it difficult to determine the best stylization for every context. To address this, we propose conditioning the generated stylized image on additional input parameters to control the loss from different layers. This allows users to obtain different stylizations in real-time. By adjusting parameters, users can control the contribution of each layer to the final stylized result in real-time. Randomizing these parameters leads to different stylizations. Conditional instance normalization is used to learn the effect of \u03b1 on the objective by transforming layer activations in the feedforward network. In this section, the text discusses the normalization of loss terms in a neural network to balance them during training. It also explores adjusting input parameters, generating random stylizations, and comparing the method with baselines. The implementation includes a multilayer fully connected neural network and an increased number of residual blocks for improved stylization results. The implementation includes training T and \u039b jointly by sampling random values for \u03b1 from U(0, 1). Content images are from ImageNet, Kaggle Painter by Numbers, and textures from Descibable Texture Dataset, while style images are from VGG-19 network layers. The adjustable parameters \u03b1 were introduced to modify the loss of each separate layer manually, improving stylization results. The model can process 47.5 fps on a NVIDIA GeForce 1080, compared to 52.0 for the base model without \u039b sub-network. The adjustable parameters \u03b1 were introduced to modify the loss of each separate layer manually, improving stylization results. The effect of increasing input parameters is visually demonstrated in figures, with deeper layers stylizing images with larger elements from the style image while maintaining coloring. Quantitative changes in losses with parameter adjustments are shown by gradually increasing one parameter from zero to one across 100 iterations. Interactive demonstrations can be accessed on the project website. The study demonstrates the impact of adjusting input parameters on stylization results across different style images. By increasing \u03b1, the measured loss decreases, indicating the model's ability to generate stylizations based on input parameters. Additionally, modifying \u03b1 generates visually similar stylizations to the base model with different loss weights. This method can be used to generate multiple stylizations from a fixed pair of content/style images. The method described involves randomizing stylizations by adjusting \u03b1 values and adding noise to the content image. This process changes the spatial locations of style elements, resulting in diverse stylizations. More variations can be seen in additional figures and at a provided link. Our method generates diverse stylizations by adding noise to style parameters, resulting in variations in style elements' spatial locations. This approach is compared to a baseline method and shown to be effective in achieving real-time diverse stylizations. Our method adds random noise to style parameters to generate diverse stylizations, making the model robust to noise. Comparing with StyleNet, our model produces stylizations with varying details while maintaining consistent stylization elements. Our model introduces a novel method for adjusting loss layer contributions in style transfer networks in real-time, allowing users to customize stylized output without retraining. By randomizing parameters and adding noise to the content image, different stylizations can be achieved from the same style/content pair. The method can be extended to multi-style transfer methods and different loss functions.

The results show that the optimal weight for stylization varies between style images, with multiple good stylizations possible based on personal preference. Different layers enforce different stylizations, and combinations vary, highlighting that no single layer combination is optimal for all style images."
