    "content": "The federal government mandates that heavy-duty engines and vehicles in the U.S. must meet safety, fuel economy, and air pollution emission requirements. Emission standards for criteria air pollutants like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter were set by the EPA in 2001. In 2016, the EPA and NHTSA introduced Phase 2 greenhouse gas emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles, including commercial long-haul tractor-trailers. The EPA introduced Phase 2 standards for commercial vehicles between model years 2018 and 2027, including controls on trailers and glider kits. Glider kits consist of a chassis with various components, becoming a glider vehicle when an engine is added. The report examines federal requirements on glider kits and vehicles, with a focus on congressional response. Glider kits are assembled by different manufacturers than the original kit producer, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, and Western Star in the US. Various companies not affiliated with these OEMs install remanufactured components into the glider kits to create more reliable and fuel-efficient vehicles. The Phase 2 standards require that glider vehicles be covered by vehicle and engine certificates, ensuring compliance with GHG standards. Glider vehicles are popular due to being 25% less expensive than new trucks, offering reliability, fuel efficiency, and safety features. Used or rebuilt engines can be installed in glider vehicles as long as they meet all applicable standards. The Phase 2 standards allow for the installation of newer engines in glider kits, meeting criteria such as original useful life, low mileage, or age. There is a transitional program for glider manufacturers in 2017, capping production based on past years. The EPA sets limits on annual production of glider kits and vehicles from 2010 to 2014. Small businesses can produce a limited number of glider vehicles without meeting long-term requirements. Starting in 2021, all glider vehicles must meet Phase 2 GHG standards. EPA has the authority to regulate glider vehicles under the Clean Air Act, Section 202(a), to control emissions that may endanger public health. This includes regulating rebuilt heavy-duty engines beyond their useful life to control emissions. The Phase 2 rule gives the EPA authority to regulate emissions from rebuilt heavy-duty engines that may endanger public health. The rule defines a completed glider vehicle as a \"motor vehicle\" under the Clean Air Act. The Phase 2 rule allows the EPA to regulate emissions from rebuilt heavy-duty engines in new glider vehicles, considering them as \"new motor vehicle engines\" under the Clean Air Act. EPA argues that engines in newly-assembled vehicles should meet the same standards as all other new vehicle engines. The CAA authorizes EPA to set emission standards for new motor vehicles, whether designed as complete systems or with pollution control devices. The Phase 2 rule under the Clean Air Act allows EPA to regulate emissions from glider kits, considering them as \"incomplete vehicles.\" Manufacturers of glider kits are subject to production caps and must obtain certificates of conformity before shipping. This regulation aims to control emissions from completed vehicles by addressing the contribution of glider kits. The production and use of glider vehicles can increase emissions of NO x and PM from heavy-duty vehicles. EPA emission standards for NO x and PM have significantly decreased since 2007. Glider vehicles using older engines could emit 10-40 times more pollutants than vehicles with new engines. Sales of glider vehicles have recently increased, leading to a significant impact on emissions. Production of glider vehicles has increased significantly since 2006, with sales assumed to be 10,000 annually from 2015 onwards. This surge in production is believed to be an attempt to avoid stricter emission standards set by the Clean Air Act. EPA's regulatory analysis assumes that glider vehicles emit pollutants at levels equivalent to engines from the MY 1998-2001. The analysis shows that glider vehicles, which could represent 5% of heavy-duty tractors on the road in 2025, may emit nearly 300,000 tons of NO x and 8,000 tons of PM annually. EPA estimated that restricting glider vehicles with high polluting engines could lead to significant public health benefits, potentially yielding between $6 billion and $14 billion in health benefits. The analysis conducted by EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory found that glider vehicles emit significantly higher levels of NOx and PM compared to conventionally manufactured tractors. This could result in health benefits of $6 billion to $14 billion annually. The production and use of glider vehicles have a positive impact on fuel efficiency and GHG emissions in the U.S. fleet of heavy-duty vehicles. Studies show that GHG emissions from selected glider vehicles are lower than conventionally manufactured vehicles. The trade-off between NOx and GHG emissions is known, and aftertreatment technologies used to reduce pollutant emissions can affect fuel efficiency. Glider vehicles are said to reduce GHG and air emissions on a lifecycle basis. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that GHG emissions from glider vehicles are 7%-9% lower compared to conventionally manufactured vehicles. Recent advancements in engine design negate any short-term fuel economy advantage for glider vehicles. The EPA received a petition from the glider vehicle industry to reconsider the Phase 2 rule's application to glider vehicles, engines, and kits. The petitioners argued that EPA lacks authority to regulate glider kits, vehicles, or engines under CAA Section 202(a)(1). They also criticized EPA for relying on unsupported assumptions in the Phase 2 rule and claimed reconsideration was necessary under Executive Order 13783. Additionally, they disputed EPA's assumption of increased NOx and PM emissions from glider vehicles, citing a Tennessee Tech University study showing similar performance between remanufactured and OEM engines. The Tennessee Tech University study found that remanufactured engines from model years 2002-2007 performed similarly to OEM engines, and in some cases even outperformed them. TTU has requested EPA to withhold reference to the study pending an internal investigation. Petitioners argued that glider vehicles have environmental benefits due to greater fuel efficiency and reduced carbon footprint from recycling materials. EPA is under scrutiny for its assumptions in the Phase 2 rule regarding glider vehicle emissions. On November 16, 2017, EPA proposed a repeal of emission standards for heavy-duty glider vehicles, engines, and kits based on a new interpretation of the Clean Air Act. EPA stated that its previous interpretation was incorrect, leading to a lack of authority to regulate glider vehicles, engines, and kits. EPA stated it lacked authority to regulate glider vehicles, engines, and kits under CAA Section 202(a)(1) due to a new interpretation. EPA argued that a \"new motor vehicle\" should be equivalent to a \"new automobile,\" not including vehicles with new body parts and a used powertrain. EPA's interpretation of a \"new motor vehicle\" excludes glider kits with used powertrains, potentially limiting its authority to regulate them under the Clean Air Act. The proposed repeal of emission requirements for glider vehicles, engines, and kits is still pending after receiving over 4,000 comments. The comment period for the proposal to repeal emission requirements for glider vehicles closed on January 5, 2018, with over 4,000 comments received. Supporters argue that glider vehicles offer a more affordable, reliable, and fuel-efficient option compared to new trucks. However, critics from the trucking sector, including original equipment manufacturers and advanced technology firms, oppose the repeal, stating that it could nullify EPA's legal authority. Several large truck manufacturers, including Volvo Group, Daimler Trucks North America, and Navistar International Corp, support limits on glider vehicles. Comments from 12 attorneys general argue that the proposed repeal of emission requirements for glider vehicles is legally untenable. State and local air quality agencies also oppose the repeal, stating it would likely force harmful air pollutants to go unregulated. The National Association of Clean Air Agencies noted that the proposed repeal would likely force state and local regulators to impose new requirements on stationary sources in their State Implementation Plans to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. California Air Resources Board proposed adopting glider vehicle requirements into the state's rulemaking aligning GHG standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks with federal Phase 2 standards. EPA approved California's waiver request to adopt its own Phase 1 standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Uncertainty remains on how California and the federal government will proceed with the adoption of the state's Phase 2 program. The federal government may adopt the state's Phase 2 program and glider vehicle provisions pending national level changes. The White House rejected EPA's draft rule to repeal glider requirements due to lack of pollution impact analysis. EPA issued an 18-month enforcement pause on Phase 2 production limits for glider vehicles to revisit provisions. The EPA issued an enforcement pause on Phase 2 production limits for glider vehicles to revisit provisions. A memorandum allows the agency to exercise enforcement discretion over production caps if vehicles don't meet emissions limits. 13 states, led by California, urged the EPA to withdraw the assurance, stating it circumvents procedural requirements. Environmental groups filed a petition seeking action from the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay of the EPA's enforcement discretion memorandum, preventing its implementation until the court resolves the motion. The EPA later withdrew the memorandum, citing rare circumstances for enforcement suspension. EPA assistant administrators were informed of this decision by Wheeler. The EPA suspended enforcement discretion for the glider industry, citing rare circumstances. The agency will work on revising regulations for glider vehicles while considering air quality impacts. Glider kits have posed challenges with safety standards and tax provisions. Many glider vehicles may not be classified as \"newly manufactured\" for federal safety standards, exempt from certain requirements such as Electronic. Glider vehicles may be exempt from safety standards like Electronic Stability Control and emerging technologies, including automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning. Vehicles with pre-MY 2000 engines are not required to have electronic logging devices. The exemption for glider vehicles is based on the engine's model year, not the chassis. Any glider vehicle with a pre-MY 2000 engine is exempt. This policy differs from previous guidance that focused on the chassis's model year. The logging device requirement aims to reduce fatigue-related crashes by enforcing hours-of-service limits for truck drivers. Internal Revenue Code Section 4051 imposes a 12% excise tax on certain heavy trucks, trailers, and tractors. The 12% excise tax applies to truck trailer bodies and chassis for vehicles over 26,000 pounds, and tractors used for highway transportation. Glider kit modifications may trigger tax liability unless repairs or modifications are under 75% of a new vehicle's retail price, providing a safe harbor provision. In 2014, the IRS released an advisory memorandum on the tax treatment of chassis renovations involving glider kits. The memorandum stated that refurbished vehicles using new parts from glider kits could be subject to a 12% excise tax. The tax liability is based on the vehicle being considered a \"new vehicle\" due to the use of glider kits. Some industry representatives and tax planning professionals noted a change in IRS enforcement regarding glider kit vehicles, with more vehicles now being subject to excise tax. IRS guidance defines a \"chassis\" as the frame and supporting structure along with certain components, triggering excise tax liability. Some tax professionals interpret IRS guidance as requiring remanufactured components to be put back into the same chassis to satisfy safe harbor requirements. The Department of the Treasury plans to issue final regulations on Section 4051, with Congress divided on EPA's glider vehicle regulations. Congressional actions include proposed legislation and oversight requests. Representative Diane Black sponsored two amendments. In the 114th Congress, Representative Diane Black sponsored amendments to prohibit EPA from enforcing fuel efficiency and emissions standards for glider kits and vehicles. Senators Carper and Udall requested documentation on the proposed repeal, while 14 Republican Members of Congress sent letters to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in March 2018. Members of Congress, including four Senators and 10 Representatives, urged EPA to halt the repeal of emissions standards for glider vehicles to protect manufacturing industries in their states. Representative Bill Posey asked DOT to support EPA's repeal, emphasizing that fuel efficiency requirements do not apply to glider kits. Additionally, 24 Members of Congress requested OMB to waive the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed repeal. In June 2018, Subcommittee Chairman Greg Gianforte requested an investigation into a study at EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. The study's objectivity was questioned due to communications between EPA scientists and stakeholders in the trucking industry. In September 2018, EPA's Office of the Inspector General announced plans to audit the agency's testing of glider vehicles. In July 2018, Chairman Lamar Smith and other Members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology requested documents from EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology requested documents and a briefing from EPA officials regarding the NVFEL study. EPA Assistant Administrator William Wehrum stated that the testing program was independent of outside stakeholder input. Chairman Smith requested additional information to understand the rationale behind the testing program's initiation and its independence. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Subcommittee on Oversight and Subcommittee on Environment will hold a hearing on \"Examining the Underlying Science and Impacts of Glider Truck Regulations\" on September 13, 2018."
