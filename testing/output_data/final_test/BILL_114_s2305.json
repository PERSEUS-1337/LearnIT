    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Carbon Capture Improvement Act of 2015\". Congress finds that carbon dioxide capture and long-term storage can benefit the environment, economy, and national security of the United States. The country leads in this technology, but costs remain high. Lowering financing costs for carbon dioxide capture projects through tax-exempt private activity bonds can accelerate deployment of the technology. This can further improve economic prospects if the captured carbon dioxide is sold for industrial use, such as enhanced oil recovery operations. Accelerating deployment of carbon dioxide capture technology can help the United States achieve environmental, economic, and national security goals. SEC. 3. CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FACILITIES. SEC. 3 amends Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code to include a new paragraph (16) for qualified carbon dioxide capture facilities. This new subsection defines a qualified carbon dioxide capture facility as the eligible components of an industrial carbon dioxide facility. The term 'eligible component' refers to equipment in an industrial carbon dioxide facility used for capture, treatment, purification, compression, transportation, or on-site storage of carbon dioxide. The term 'industrial carbon dioxide facility' refers to a facility that emits carbon dioxide as a result of various processes such as fuel combustion, gasification, bioindustrial, fermentation, or manufacturing industry. An industrial carbon dioxide facility excludes geological gas facilities and certain air separation units that do not meet specific criteria. The term 'geological gas facility' refers to a facility that produces gas or mixed gas and liquid from a geological formation, removes impurities, or separates the product into its parts. Industrial carbon dioxide facilities must meet a capture and storage requirement. The capture and storage percentage for industrial carbon dioxide facilities must be equal to or greater than 65 percent. If the facility's percentage is less than 65 percent, the cost of eligible components financed with tax-exempt bonds cannot exceed the capture and storage percentage. The total metric tons of carbon dioxide captured annually must be divided by the total metric tons of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere each year as industrial emissions of greenhouse gases. The industrial carbon dioxide facility must capture and store a certain percentage of emissions from specific sources within the facility. Additionally, an amendment is made to the volume cap section of the Code. The amendment clarifies that the sale of carbon dioxide from a qualified facility owned by a governmental unit does not constitute private business use. The effective date for these changes is after December 31, 2015."
