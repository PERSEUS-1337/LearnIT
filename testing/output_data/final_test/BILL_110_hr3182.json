    "content": "SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE. The Act may be cited as the \"U.S. Participation in Cuban Energy Exploration Act of 2007.\" Congress finds that current laws restrict US nationals and companies from participating in energy exploration in Cuba, penalizing them while benefiting the Cuban government. It is in the national interest for US entities to compete for the opportunity to develop these resources. The Act aims to allow US nationals and companies to explore and develop energy resources in offshore areas near Cuba and other similar areas outside the US exclusive economic zone, if done in an environmentally friendly manner. Authorization of activities and exports involving hydrocarbon resources by United States persons. Authorization for US persons to engage in exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon resources from foreign exclusive economic zones contiguous to the US, export necessary equipment without license, and import extracted resources and products into the US. US persons engaging in exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon resources from foreign exclusive economic zones must comply with specific laws, including those related to Cuba and environmental protection. The rules, regulations, and laws for protecting fish, wildlife, and the environment within the exclusive economic zone of the United States must be followed by those engaging in activities related to exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon resources from foreign exclusive economic zones. The Secretary of the Treasury will authorize travel-related transactions for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction activities in Cuba under a general license. Authorized travelers include employees, executives, agents, and consultants of hydrocarbon companies. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms such as \"exclusive economic zone of the United States,\" \"foreign exclusive economic zone,\" and \"United States person.\""
