    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Code Adam Act\". The \"Code Adam Act\" acknowledges the success of the \"Code Adam\" protocol in preventing child abductions and finding lost children in public places. This protocol was created by Wal-Mart in memory of Adam Walsh, a child who was kidnapped and murdered in 1981. The \"Code Adam\" alert is used in commercial establishments nationwide with the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Puerto Rico is the only jurisdiction to adopt the \"Code Adam\" in government buildings. SEC. 3. PROCEDURES IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS REGARDING A MISSING OR LOST CHILD. On and after the 180th day after the enactment of this Act, each Federal building open to the public must have procedures in place for locating a missing child. Employees must obtain a detailed description of the child when notified by a parent, guardian, or teacher. Employees in Federal buildings must have procedures in place for locating a missing child. When \"Code Adam\" is activated, employees must alert designated staff, provide a detailed description of the child, and escort the parent to help identify the child at the main door. Employees in Federal buildings must have procedures in place for locating a missing child. When \"Code Adam\" is activated, designated staff monitor all building exits to prevent the child from leaving without the parent, tutor, or guardian. If a person with a child insists on leaving, they are asked to go through the main exit to ensure the child is not the missing one before being allowed to leave. After announcing the activation of \"Code Adam,\" designated employees search the entire Federal building, assigning 2 or more to each floor to ensure the child is not there. If the child is not found within 10 minutes, a designated employee calls 9-1-1 for immediate assistance from state or local security personnel. Upon completion of the \"Code Adam\" protocol, designated employees must notify relevant authorities and prepare a report of the incident to be kept on file for at least 3 years. Executive agencies are required to enforce procedures for handling such situations in their buildings. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and the House Office Building Commission are required to enforce procedures for handling situations in Federal buildings owned or leased by the judicial and legislative branches, respectively. The House of Representatives and Senate, along with other legislative branch establishments, must enforce procedures for Federal buildings they own or lease, as outlined in subsection (b). Procedures for Federal buildings owned or leased by the establishment must be enforced as outlined in subsection (b). Definitions for this Act include terms such as Executive agency, Federal agency, Federal building, and Child, with specific meanings assigned to each."
