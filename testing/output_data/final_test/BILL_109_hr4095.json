The Act \"Encourage Initiative and Promote Self-Esteem Act of 2005\" introduces special rules for benefits for qualifying disabled individuals, including adjustments to termination months, benefit extent determination, and maximum benefit payments during the special entitlement period. The Act \"Encourage Initiative and Promote Self-Esteem Act of 2005\" introduces special rules for benefits for qualifying disabled individuals, including adjustments to termination months, benefit extent determination, and maximum benefit payments during the special entitlement period. A qualifying disabled individual is defined as someone entitled to disability insurance benefits under section 223, child's insurance benefits under section 202(d) based on disability, or widow's or widower's insurance benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 based on disability, and whose disability is based on a waxing and waning medical condition. The Commissioner shall not review the disability of an individual who performs services earning $300 or more in a month following a month determined under paragraph (4). The special entitlement period for qualifying disabled individuals begins when they become entitled to benefits and ends when the impairment ceases to exist or is no longer disabling. The maximum benefit payable after the 7th month of entitlement is reduced by 2/3 of the individual's excess trial earnings amount. The term 'waxing and waning medical condition' refers to a medical condition certified by a physician that alternates between periods of being able to work and periods of inability to work due to lack of assistive technology. Excess trial earnings are the amount earned by an individual that exceeds the average amount earned. The trial earnings threshold is calculated by comparing the average monthly earnings of an individual during the test period to the trial earnings threshold for that month, which is the greater of $580 or a calculated amount. The test period consists of the first 3 calendar months of the 6 calendar months preceding the month in question. The trial earnings threshold is determined by multiplying a specified dollar amount by the ratio of the national average wage index for the first of the 2 preceding calendar years to the national average wage index for calendar year 2003. The product is rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The Secretary determines and publishes the trial earnings threshold for each month in November of the preceding calendar year. The termination month for a qualifying disabled individual shall be determined under section 222(f)(1)(A) of the Act. Section 202(d)(1)(G)(i) is amended to include the termination month determined under section 222(f)(1)(A). Section 202(e)(1) is amended to include a new sentence following the matter. The termination month of a qualifying disabled individual shall be determined under section 222(f)(1)(A) of the Act. Section 202(f)(1) is amended to include this provision. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to current rules regarding substantial gainful activity by other individuals during extended periods of eligibility in section 223(e)(1). The amendments made by this section apply to individuals entitled to disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, child's insurance benefits, or spouse's insurance benefits based on disability, whose trial work period has not ended as of the enactment date. Amendment to Title XVI of the Social Security Act includes special rules for disability benefits based on waxing and waning medical conditions. Special rules for disability benefits for qualifying disabled individuals include determining benefit payments without considering ability to work, capping monthly benefits, and avoiding disability reviews if the individual earns over a certain amount from services. The special rules for disability benefits for qualifying disabled individuals include determining benefit payments based on a set dollar amount or $300, defining a qualifying disabled individual as someone eligible due to disability from a waxing and waning medical condition, and specifying the entitlement period from when benefits start to when the disability ceases. The benefit for qualifying disabled individuals is capped at the amount payable under the title, reduced by 2/3 of excess trial earnings. A waxing and waning medical condition is defined as a certified condition that may reasonably affect an individual's eligibility for disability benefits. The amendment defines terms related to disability benefits for individuals with fluctuating medical conditions, including excess trial earnings, test period, and trial earnings threshold. The effective date of the amendment is specified. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to benefits payable for months after the enactment of this Act."
