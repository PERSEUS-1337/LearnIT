    "content": "The electric power industry in the United States is undergoing transformation due to aging infrastructure and uncertainty about modernization. Questions about grid reliability, transmission expansion, and security threats are emerging. There is a growing interest in renewable energy and low carbon sources, as well as concerns about reliability, electricity prices, and environmental regulations. The Federal Power Act is key in shaping national policies for the industry's modernization. The House Energy and Commerce Committee's Energy and Power subcommittee reevaluated the relevance of the Federal Power Act in the changing electricity industry. The act was enacted in 1920 to provide federal oversight of hydropower development. The focus was on wholesale power market concerns and state vs. federal jurisdiction issues. In 1935, Congress passed the Public Utility Act (PUA) to address market power abuses in the electric power industry. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) was created to regulate holding companies and prevent evasion of state regulation. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) was created to regulate holding companies and prevent evasion of state regulation. PUHCA gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authority over holding company transactions and limited power industry mergers to contiguous areas. The Federal Power Act (FPA) was created to regulate interstate transmission and sales of electricity and natural gas, with the Federal Power Commission (FPC) overseeing nonfederal hydropower projects and wholesale sale of electric energy. The Federal Power Act (FPA) was codified as 16 U.S.C. Chapter 12, with four Subchapters regulating water power development, electric utility companies, licensees, and state water conservation facilities. FPA Section 205 ensures that rates and charges for electricity transmission or sale are not unjust, unreasonable, discriminatory, or preferential. Section 206 allows the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to investigate and ensure wholesale rates are just and reasonable under federal energy policies. In 1977, the Department of Energy Organization Act terminated the Federal Power Commission (FPC) and established the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the U.S. Department of Energy. FERC was given jurisdiction over hydroelectric dam licensing, safety, and regulation of rates for interstate transmission or wholesale sale of electric energy. In 1978, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA; P.L. 95-617) established Qualifying Facilities (QFs) as an alternate class of power generators that could sell power to electric utilities at avoided cost or negotiated rates. QFs include small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT92) created Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) to promote competition in the electric power industry. EWGs are power generators that exclusively own/operate facilities and sell electricity to wholesale customers. Small power production QFs use renewable resources with a capacity of 80 MW or less, while cogeneration facilities produce electric and thermal energy from a single fuel source, subject to efficiency standards. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs) to promote competition in the electric power industry by allowing wholesale generators to apply for transmission services. FERC Order 888 ensured open access to the transmission grid for all electricity transporters, promoting wholesale competition. Order 888 established the Commission's Open Access Same-time Information System (OASIS) for transmission-related transactions. FERC also released Order 889 to set rules for OASIS arrangements and move towards market-based rates for electricity purchase and transmission. Electricity is traded in markets as a commodity, measured in power and energy units. Regional transmission organizations (RTOs) manage wholesale electricity transportation across the US. In RTO regions, electricity utilities were restructured to a competitive regime, with power generation and transmission regulated by FERC. Congress introduced competition in the electricity industry, leading to the establishment of RTOs. FERC was given additional authority through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to ensure market transparency. RTOs managed 60% of power in 2009, raising concerns for Congress regarding the efficient functioning of electricity markets. The history of RTO development under FERC dates back to the early 20th century when electric utility companies realized the benefits of interconnecting to reduce costs and enhance reliability. As state agencies moved towards deregulation in the 1990s, transmission facilities often remained under public utility control, leading to discrimination in access. Order No. 888 mandated utilities to provide open access transmission services with specific terms and conditions. It also required functional unbundling of wholesale power services to promote competition in the electricity market. The expansion of FERC's regulatory authority under Order No. 888 faced controversy as parties questioned FERC's jurisdiction over transmission services. Despite challenges, the United States Supreme Court upheld FERC's authority in New York v. FERC. In New York v. FERC, the Court upheld FERC's authority over transmission service regardless of the customer, citing the elimination of bright lines between retail and wholesale sales in the industry. The Court found that Order No. 888 was a legitimate exercise of FERC's jurisdiction under the FPA, encouraging utilities to provide open access transmission services. Order No. 888 encouraged the formation of Independent Systems Operators (ISOs) to regulate transmission services, aiming to promote regional efficiencies, economically efficient pricing, and mitigate market power. FERC included eleven principles to guide the formation and administration of ISOs, focusing on governance, independence, reliability, efficiency, economic efficiency, information systems, regional coordination, and dispute resolution. FERC declined to mandate the creation of ISOs in this order but noted the possibility of requiring them in the future if functional unbundling proves inadequate. Order No. 2000 later encouraged the formation of RTOs, which regulate transmission services, wholesale market-based electricity transactions, and grid reliability. This order aimed for all transmission-owning entities to participate in these organizations. Order No. 2000 encouraged transmission-owning entities to place their facilities under the control of RTOs, setting forth minimum characteristics for RTOs to ensure independence, operational authority, and market efficiency. Order No. 2000 mandated that RTOs have operational authority over transmission facilities and ensure short-term reliability. RTOs perform key functions such as tariff administration, congestion management, and market monitoring. Challenges in implementing this industry reorganization include controversy over capacity markets and the payment of power generators for reliability goals. Capacity markets in RTOs have been controversial, with criticism over their effectiveness in preventing brownouts or blackouts during high demand periods. Some regions like California and Texas do not have formal capacity markets, raising questions about the additional costs versus benefits. RTOs aim to ensure power availability and maintain operating reserves for unexpected events. The real-time market covers unanticipated demand, requiring generators to be ready to serve load when needed. In the day-ahead market, generators must have plants running to serve load and receive market clearing prices for energy provided. State governments issue permits for new power plants, and in RTO regions, LSEs can use their own generation or purchased power to meet electricity demand. FERC lacks authority over generation, so some RTOs use Forward Capacity Markets to ensure adequate capacity for future load demand. Price signals indicate the need for new capacity. Forward Capacity Markets (FCMs) were developed to address the need for new capacity indicated by sustained high locational marginal prices. FCMs include capacity obligations, reserve margin determination, solicitation of supply resources, cost benchmarking, demand curve creation, and resource selection through an auction process. They aim to ensure sufficient capacity to reliably serve end-use customers within RTO regions. Forward Capacity Markets (FCMs) were created to address the need for new capacity in regions with high locational marginal prices. Despite debates on their effectiveness, FCMs aim to provide revenues for new market participants to recover investment costs in building power plants. The regulatory concept of \"Cost of New Entry\" (CONE) estimates the cost of connecting a reference power plant to the grid in specific locations. The Cost of New Entry (CONE) is an estimate of the price at which a peaking power plant can recover its fixed costs in the marketplace. It serves as a benchmark based on the cost of building a peaking unit. CONE pricing helps ensure market competitiveness by incentivizing new generation when needed and showing when no new generation is necessary. New natural gas combined cycle generating units may have cost advantages over existing plants due to efficiency and lower fuel costs. Norman Bay criticized the use of Minimum Offer Price Rules (MOPR) in capacity markets, stating it creates tension between federal and state authority. MOPR screens bids for possible exercise of market power, ensuring competitiveness in the marketplace. Norman Bay criticized the use of Minimum Offer Price Rules (MOPR) in capacity markets, stating it creates tension between federal and state authority. He believes that any state action interfering with wholesale markets should only occur when necessary, respecting federalism. The economic costs of MOPR are significant, as it assumes markets can be free from out-of-market influences, which is not the case. Supply-side resources are impacted by various public policies and agency choices, and these costs and benefits should be allowed to pass through markets naturally. The MOPR in capacity markets frustrates state policy initiatives and may result in load paying twice. Capacity prices based on an administratively-determined MOPR may not efficiently signal entry and exit needs. Congressional task force established to study competitive markets where prices guide consumption and investment decisions. Under competitive markets, prices guide consumption and investment decisions, leading to more economically efficient investments and lower prices than under traditional cost of service monopoly regulation. The Supreme Court recently examined FERC's jurisdiction under the FPA in two cases, reconciling FERC's role in regulating wholesale interstate electricity transactions with state regulatory efforts. Congress may need to assess if FERC's authority under the FPA is sufficient to ensure the economic and reliable functioning of electricity markets without infringing on state authority over retail markets. In FERC v Elec. Power Supply Ass'n, the Court addressed a dispute regarding FERC's Order No. 745 mandating wholesale market operators to set prices. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated FERC's Order No. 745, which mandated wholesale market operators to set rates for demand response services. The Supreme Court later ruled that FERC had the authority to implement the rule, despite challenges claiming it exceeded their authority. The Court upheld FERC's authority to implement Order No. 745, despite challenges claiming it exceeded their jurisdiction due to its impact on non-jurisdictional retail rates. The Court emphasized that FERC's focus was on jurisdictional wholesale rates, which naturally affect retail markets as well. In Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, the Court rejected a Maryland regulatory order aimed at promoting new electricity generation plants in the state. State public service commissions lack the authority to mandate wholesale pricing mechanisms established by FERC. The Maryland Public Service Commission attempted to address concerns by implementing a state program to compensate generation companies for adding capacity to the region. This program required LSEs to enter into 20-year contracts to purchase power from new generation facilities, creating a stable market for construction. The program directed generators to sell capacity into the PJM capacity auction, with the generator agreeing to reimburse LSEs if the auction results were unfavorable. The Maryland Public Service Commission implemented a program requiring LSEs to enter into contracts to purchase power from new generation facilities. The program involved generators selling capacity in the PJM capacity auction, with agreements for reimbursement based on auction results. The program was challenged by incumbent power generators, leading to a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed lower court decisions, ruling that the Maryland program requiring generators to participate in the PJM capacity auction was preempted by the FPA. Justice Ginsburg stated that FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over interstate wholesale sales rates, making the program an intrusion on FERC's authority. The Court limited the application of this ruling. The Supreme Court affirmed that the Maryland program, which required generators to participate in the PJM capacity auction, was preempted by the FPA. The decision noted that states can regulate within their assigned domain, but the Maryland program disregarded an interstate wholesale rate required by FERC. The Court's ruling was limited and did not address other measures states could use to encourage new generation development. Competitive electricity market services offer transaction flexibility and risk management through RTO markets, which provide derivatives and hedges to reduce price volatility. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aims to regulate speculative trading and manipulation in the purchase and sale of natural gas and electric energy. The 2000-2001 Western energy crisis revealed susceptibility to market manipulation in electricity markets, with Enron and other companies implicated. FERC now has new authority under EPACT05 to prevent manipulation in natural gas and electricity markets to protect consumers from bearing losses. FERC aims to maintain market transparency and efficiency by preventing fraud and manipulation in energy markets, as evidenced by recent cases brought between 2012 and 2014. The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in response to the U.S. financial crisis and includes reforms to strengthen oversight of the financial sector, addressing issues related to market manipulation. FERC focuses on anticompetitive conduct threatening market transparency and is exploring revisions to its approach in identifying and assessing market power in electric utility transactions. FERC is revising its approach to identifying and assessing market power in electric utility transactions. Market power is defined as the ability to control prices by withholding production or limiting service availability. FERC differentiates between having market power and exercising it, noting that consumers are only harmed when market power is actually used. In competitive markets, electricity prices should reflect fair competition. The recent settlements at FERC have created uncertainty around market manipulation. FERC allows sellers to charge market-based rates if they can show they lack market power. It is unclear if FERC will proceed with a market manipulation rulemaking. Congress may need to define market power further. Congress may need to consider further defining market power to ensure the efficient and transparent operation of electricity markets. Industry changes driven by regulatory and market pressures, state policies, and new technologies may lead to potential amendments to the Federal Power Act. The E&P subcommittee inquired about the current and future state of organized markets, to which the FERC chairman responded with efforts to promote efficiency, competition, and transparency. FERC is working to promote efficiency, competition, and transparency in wholesale markets. Innovation in electric power has led to the development of technologies for harnessing renewable resources, enabling customer choice in generating their own electricity. Congress introduced competitive providers with PURPA and reinforced competition with EPACT. Further amendments to the FPA may be needed to ensure customer choice as new technologies develop, with net metering playing a key role. Net metering enables customers to offset self-generated electricity against purchased power from electric utilities. State programs for net metering have raised concerns in areas with increasing residential solar PV installations. EPACT05 added net metering as a consideration for electric utilities to offer customers generating their own electricity. Most net metering retail customers rely on PURPA's mandatory purchase requirement to sell their energy to local utilities. The Federal Power Act (FPA) does not require utilities to purchase energy at wholesale prices, leading to concerns about recovering investments in power generation infrastructure. State net metering programs aim to incentivize distributed generation by allowing customers to offset their bills with locally generated power. Net metering compensates consumers for self-generation and allows for bidirectional electricity flow through a single meter. The cost of net metering programs for electric utilities is a key issue. Net metering allows customers to offset their bills with locally generated power by compensating them for self-generation and enabling bidirectional electricity flow through a single meter. Customers in some states are paid for excess power generated at either the utility's full retail rate or the utility's avoided cost price, which can be higher than the market price of wholesale electricity. Net metering enables owners of distributed generation to sell their energy at prices higher than the market rate. The Clean Power Plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, potentially impacting grid reliability. The Trump Administration has expressed intentions regarding the CPP. The Trump Administration has indicated its intent to change or not enforce the Clean Power Plan (CPP). FERC has the authority under the FPA to address insufficient interstate service and to order connections of facilities in emergencies. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of FPA regulations for ensuring reliable generation. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has expressed concerns about the impact of the final CPP rule on resource use and the need for additional transmission and gas infrastructure. States will need to coordinate decisions on CPP compliance with other stakeholders, and FPA Section 207 provisions may require formal hearings in conjunction with state utility commission proceedings. FERC lacks the authority to compel the enlargement of generating facilities or the sale of energy that could impair service to customers. Congress has taken action to address these conflicts. The \"Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act\" (FAST; P.L. 114-94) addressed conflicts between FERC emergency reliability orders and utility compliance with environmental laws. Section 61002 of the FAST Act clarified that FERC emergency orders override federal, state, and local environmental laws. EPA recognizes the potential of renewable energy and nuclear power to replace carbon-intensive generation. EPA considered including nuclear generation in the CPP and incentives for existing nuclear plants. In the final Clean Power Plan (CPP), the EPA did not include generation from nuclear units under construction in its emissions reduction plan. Existing nuclear power plants are at risk of early retirement due to low electricity market prices, mainly caused by the increased dispatch of natural gas-fired power plants. Several proposals have been made to support the competitiveness of nuclear power, which is the largest zero carbon emitting power source in the United States. In New York, state regulators approved a subsidy for three nuclear plants to establish a credit for a \"backwards carbon price-based floor\" as part of the state's 50% renewable and nuclear energy goal by 2030. The subsidy will be based on the social cost of carbon under New York's Zero Emissions Credit program to keep FitzPatrick, Ginna, and Nine Mile Point operating. Exelon has agreed to purchase FitzPatrick from Entergy and operate all four upstate New York reactors through 2029 under the ZEC program. The funding is provided to recognize the carbon-free aspect of nuclear power, following New York's experience with a market price on carbon through RGGI. State programs must be structured to avoid federal/state jurisdictional constraints. The PJM RTO has restructured its capacity market to benefit nuclear power plants by ensuring generators meet performance obligations and pricing incentives are in place. These changes are expected to raise capacity costs by $5 billion a year but reduce energy costs by $2.4 billion a year. Some believe the impact could be greater. Former Illinois Power Agency Director Mark Pruitt believes that capacity performance reforms could significantly increase capacity prices, potentially raising them to $272/MW-day. This change is expected to generate over $560 million in additional revenue for five of Exelon's six Illinois nuclear stations in 2020. Energy prices for ComEd customers could rise by 1.4 cents/kWh, or 19%, from the current 7.4 cents/kWh. UBS market analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith also predicts a similar impact, with capacity prices potentially increasing from $120/MW-day to $204/MW-day in the following year. Concerns have been raised about the potential distortion of price signals and the sustainability of such \"out-of-market\" constructs. The U.S. bulk electric power system has mandatory cybersecurity standards enforced by FERC through NERC. FERC has authority over wholesale power sales and interstate transmission, while states regulate retail sales. Subsidies in electricity markets may discourage investment and innovation, distorting price signals and propping up uneconomic generation. FERC prioritizes grid security and has established the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security (OEIS) to address cyber and physical threats. Despite this, FERC claims it lacks the authority to respond quickly to major cyber events. The Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) report in January 2017 also focused on grid security within the electricity grid. The Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review (QER) report in January 2017 highlighted grid security as a national security concern, recommending amending the Federal Power Act to give more authority to DOE and FERC in responding to emergencies. The Department of Energy (DOE) should have the authority to issue grid-security emergency orders to protect critical electric infrastructure from various threats. Congress should grant FERC the power to modify or create new reliability standards to address evolving grid security challenges, complementing DOE's national security authorities. The DOE should have authority to issue grid-security emergency orders to protect critical electric infrastructure. FERC should be granted power to modify or create reliability standards to address evolving grid security challenges, complementing DOE's national security authorities. The Federal Power Act has been amended by Congress numerous times to reflect changes in technology and federal policies. Former FERC Chairman Norman Bay believes the FPA is flexible and well-suited to respond to changing circumstances in the energy space. The report discusses policy issues and technical challenges in the electric power industry, focusing on electricity markets. FERC is refining its approach to wholesale electricity market issues as new technologies and energy conservation schemes emerge. Congress may consider changes to the Federal Power Act to ensure the economic and reliable operation of U.S. electricity markets."
