The National Forest Good Neighbor Act of 2017 defines 'authorized restoration services' as activities to restore forest, rangeland, and watershed health under a good neighbor agreement. A 'good neighbor agreement' is a cooperative agreement between the Secretary and a Governor for restoration services. The term 'Governor' refers to the Governor or appropriate executive official of a State. The National Forest Good Neighbor Act of 2017 allows the Secretary to enter into good neighbor agreements with Governors for authorized restoration services. These agreements are made public, and certain timber sales regulations do not apply to these services. The Secretary is responsible for providing or approving silviculture prescriptions and marking guides for timber sale projects on National Forest System land. Delegation of decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to a Governor is not allowed. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. Amendments are made to various sections of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, replacing references to \"section 19\" with \"section 18\"."
