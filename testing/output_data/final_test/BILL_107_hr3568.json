Congress finds that abject poverty, food shortages, conflict, and damaged irrigation systems have plagued rural areas of Afghanistan and the Central Asian Republics for over 20 years, despite significant aid from the United States in 2001. Millions of people remain at risk of severe malnutrition and starvation in the region. President George W. Bush announced a $320,000,000 humanitarian assistance package for Afghanistan and neighboring countries to address immediate food and refugee needs during the war on terrorism. Long-term food production and rural development issues in the region are crucial for stability. President George W. Bush announced a $320,000,000 humanitarian assistance package for Afghanistan and neighboring countries to address immediate food and refugee needs during the war on terrorism. The assistance is crucial for stability in the region. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will provide assistance for sustainable food production in Afghanistan and Central Asia by restocking seed, replacing breeding livestock, restoring irrigation systems, and offering credit for food enterprises through rural microenterprise loan programs. Assistance will be in the form of grants to nongovernmental organizations for specific activities in the region. The Administrator may provide grants for activities such as seed procurement, livestock replacement, irrigation system restoration, access to credit for food enterprises, and technical assistance. Grants cannot be used for emergency or disaster-related activities. A nongovernmental organization seeking a grant must submit an application to the Administrator, developed in consultation with local indigenous entities. The Administrator will coordinate activities with other authorized countries and organizations to implement program objectives. The Administrator oversees grants to nongovernmental organizations in countries, provides minimal administrative grants to governments, ensures grant oversight, and coordinates efforts with national and regional entities. The Administrator coordinates with government officials to review grant disbursement and activity effectiveness annually.
