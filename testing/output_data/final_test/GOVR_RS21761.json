    "content": "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 added a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare, increased payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans, introduced a competition program, and implemented a comparative cost adjustment program in 2010. Beneficiaries have access to drug plans regardless of their Medicare enrollment status. Drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries will be provided through newly created prescription drug plans or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plans. Managed care organizations must offer at least one plan with the standard prescription drug benefit, but can also offer additional plans with different benefits. Rules and procedures for enrollment, coverage periods, appeals, and cost bidding will be similar for both prescription drug plans and MA-PD plans. Beginning in 2006, Medicare beneficiaries will have access to prescription drugs whether they are in traditional FFS Medicare or an MA-PD plan. To compete with traditional Medicare, some plans may enhance their benefit packages by adding vision or dental services, reducing cost sharing, or improving the prescription drug benefit. In 2004, 36% of Medicare Advantage enrollees were in plans that included prescription drugs with no additional premium. In 2004, 36% of Medicare Advantage enrollees were in plans that included prescription drugs with no additional premium. Starting in 2006, MA-PD plans will receive additional money from Medicare to pay for the prescription drug benefit. Managed care organizations can compete with traditional FFS Medicare by reducing out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage plans can reduce out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries by adding benefits like eyeglasses and hearing aids, or additional drug coverage. Once the annual out-of-pocket threshold for catastrophic drug coverage is reached, Medicare provides reinsurance to the plan. Third-party payments, including MA payments, do not count towards the beneficiary's out-of-pocket threshold. Additional drug coverage would decrease out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees, delaying when they reach the threshold and reducing the money a plan would receive. Plans may enhance drug benefits in 2004 to increase enrollment before Medicare drug benefit in 2006. Some plans offer Medicare-endorsed drug discount cards. Beneficiaries who enroll in 2004 may stay with the plan when Medicare drug benefit is added in 2006. MMA changed payment rate calculation for Medicare managed care plans in 2004, resulting in increased payment rates for all counties. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) made significant changes to the payment formula for Medicare managed care plans in 2004. These changes included adding a fourth payment type based on per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs, eliminating the budget neutrality adjustment, and adjusting the minimum increase requirement. These changes were aimed at increasing payment rates and reducing variance in payments across counties. In 2005 and beyond, Medicare payments will be updated annually based on a minimum increase or 100% of the rebased fee-for-service per capita payment. Payment rate increases starting in March 2004 vary by county, with an average increase of 10.8%. Approximately 94% of enrollees will see an increase of 20% or less, while some plans may receive increases of over 45%. Higher payment rates aim to keep organizations in Medicare, attract new ones, and encourage plan expansion.

Higher payment rates aim to keep organizations in Medicare, attract new ones, and encourage plan expansion. Plans are using the increases to 2004 payments to strengthen provider networks, reduce premiums, enhance benefits, and reduce cost sharing. Five percent of the additional funds are being held in the stabilization fund for use before the end of 2005. Until 2006, organizations participating in Medicare managed care must submit an Adjusted Community Rate (ACR) proposal to CMS. Starting in 2006, Medicare plans will no longer submit Adjusted Community Rate (ACR) proposals. Instead, they will submit bids, which will be compared to a per capita benchmark. If the benchmark is higher than the bid, plans must return 75% of the difference to beneficiaries in the form of reduced cost-sharing for Part A and B. Starting in 2006, Medicare plans will no longer submit Adjusted Community Rate (ACR) proposals. Instead, they will submit bids compared to a per capita benchmark. Plans must return 75% of the difference to beneficiaries in the form of reduced cost-sharing for Part A and B benefits, additional MA benefits, or a credit towards any monthly MA premium, prescription drug premium, or Part B premium. If the bid is above the benchmark, Medicare will pay the plan the benchmark and the beneficiary will pay the difference. Plans will now return only 75% of the difference if the benchmark exceeds the bid, with the remaining 25% returned to the government as savings. The Secretary's ability to negotiate plan bids and the impact on current Medicare plans remains unclear. Some observers expect plan bids to be close to the benchmark with little savings returned to either the beneficiary or the government. Others estimate plan bids will be below the benchmarks, resulting in savings for both beneficiaries and the government. Sharing savings with the government could lead to plans offering less generous supplemental benefits, making it harder to compete with traditional Medicare. The bid process may be less burdensome than the ACR process, depending on the implementing regulations. Private plans participating in Medicare specify service areas as sets of counties. Plans may serve entire regions designated by the Secretary in a new regional program starting in 2006. This program aims to encourage plans, especially PPOs, to serve previously underserved areas, such as rural regions, to improve Medicare managed care. The bid process no longer requires a calculation of expected returns from Medicare business compared to non-Medicare business. The new regional program for Medicare managed care aims to make plans more closely resemble the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Plans will have specified reimbursement for covered benefits, serve one or more regions, and be called MA regional plans. The Secretary will establish 10-50 regions based on current insurance markets. MA regional plans cannot segment service areas for different benefits or cost sharing within the same region. MA regional plans will differ from MA local plans in benefit package, access to risk-sharing arrangements, and potential additional payments to hospitals. The benefit package must include a single deductible for Part A and B services, and a catastrophic limit on expenditures. Medicare will share risk with MA regional plans in 2006 and 2007 if costs fall outside a specified range. Plans will assume responsibilities for beneficiaries within the same region. The Medicare Advantage regional program includes risk-sharing arrangements for unexpected high and low costs, a stabilization fund to incentivize plan participation, and provisions for hospitals in less-populated areas to join regional plans. The Medicare Advantage regional program includes risk-sharing arrangements, a stabilization fund, and provisions for hospitals in less-populated areas to join regional plans. Plans must pay hospitals at least the Medicare Part A payment for services provided to enrollees. The regional program will encompass all areas currently served by local MA plans, with incentives for participation. Plans may choose to participate in the regional program instead of local MA plans based on business decisions about risk, profit, and competition. The Comparative Cost Adjustment (CCA) program, active from 2010 to 2015, aims to boost competition among local Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Only local plans in metropolitan statistical areas with specific enrollment criteria can participate. Payments to local MA plans in CCA areas are based on competitive bids, unlike non-CCA areas. In CCA areas, local MA plans compete with traditional Medicare, affecting Part B premiums based on cost comparisons. Premium adjustments are phased in over five years and cannot exceed 105% of the original amount. The CCA program in Medicare aims to decrease costs by promoting competition in CCA areas through strategies like provider negotiations and disease management. However, opponents argue that beneficiaries who prefer traditional Medicare may face increased Part B premiums."
