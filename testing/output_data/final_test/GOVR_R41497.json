    "content": "The President and the Senate share the power to appoint principal officers of the United States. The appointment process involves selection, clearance, and nomination by the President, followed by consideration by the Senate before the final appointment. Candidates are selected and vetted by the White House before a formal nomination is sent to the Senate. Members of Congress and interest groups may recommend candidates for Senate-confirmed positions. The White House may receive recommendations for PAS positions, but they are not obligated to follow them. Senators can provide advice to the President on selections, and if consultation is lacking, they may delay or block nominations. Candidates go through a clearance process and submit various forms before nomination consideration. The clearance process for national security positions involves background checks by various agencies like the FBI, IRS, and OGE. Conflicts of interest are addressed before nomination submission to the Senate. Delays can occur, especially when processing multiple candidates simultaneously. At the beginning of an Administration, candidates for higher-level national security positions are given priority in the clearance process. Amendments to the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 aim to speed up the appointment of the national security team after a new President's inauguration. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for a 90-day extension for temporary appointments during presidential transitions, potentially lengthening the appointment process for some positions. The appointment process for positions within a state involves the President nominating individuals recommended by Senators or party leaders. Recess appointments may be given under certain circumstances, but they can have political consequences. Recess appointments can have political consequences when Senators perceive them as circumventing their role. Nominees have no legal authority until Senate confirmation or other appointment methods are used. The Senate determines whether to confirm a nomination. The Senate determines confirmation of nominations based on position importance, political circumstances, and policy implications. Factors like nominee's views, President's party control, and involvement affect the examination process. Nominations are received by the Senate executive clerk and referred to committees for investigation, hearings, and reporting. The Senate committees conduct investigations, hearings, and reporting on nominations. Hearings provide a platform for discussing nominees and related issues. Senators use hearings to assess qualifications, express policy views, and raise oversight concerns. Committees can choose not to act on a nomination at any stage. If a committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate, it has three options. If the committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate, it can do so favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Failure to obtain a majority on the motion means the nomination won't be reported. The Senate can discharge the committee under certain circumstances to bring the nomination to the floor. Most executive nominations are confirmed by the Senate, but some fail at the committee stage due to various reasons. The Senate rules dictate that pending nominations not confirmed or rejected in the current session must be resubmitted by the President in the next session. Typically, pending nominations are returned to the President at the end of the session or Congress. The confirmed nominee receives a commission signed by the President and is sworn into office, granting full authority to carry out responsibilities. The President has full authority to make limited-term appointments without Senate confirmation during recess. Presidents have used this power to bypass confirmation processes, leading Congress to enact restrictions on pay for recess appointees. This incentivizes the President to use recess appointments to ensure appointees can be paid. During Senate recess, the President can make temporary appointments without Senate confirmation, but appointees may not be paid until confirmed. Exceptions include vacancies within 30 days of session end, pending nominations, or rejected nominations followed by a new appointment. A nomination must follow a recess appointment within 40 days. The President can make temporary appointments during Senate recess, but appointees may not be paid until confirmed. Exceptions include vacancies within 30 days of session end, pending nominations, or rejected nominations followed by a new appointment. A nomination must follow a recess appointment within 40 days. The Department of Justice interprets provisions to prevent payment for appointees given successive recess appointments to the same position. Recess appointees whose nominations are rejected may continue to serve until the end of their appointment, but a provision in the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act may prevent them from being paid after rejection. The Senate responded to the President's use of recess appointments by restructuring longer recesses into shorter ones with pro forma sessions every three days to prevent appointments. This practice began in November 2007 to restrict the President from making recess appointments during shorter recesses. During the 110th Congress, the Senate implemented pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments by President Bush. This practice continued for the remainder of his presidency, with limited statutory authority allowing temporary filling of vacant positions. Officials holding PAS positions designated as \"acting\" are likely serving under this authority or agency-specific statutes. President Bush did not make any more recess appointments after this period. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, vacant executive agency positions requiring confirmation can be temporarily filled in three ways: by the first assistant, by directing an officer in another agency, or by selecting an officer or employee within the agency meeting specific criteria. The temporary appointment lasts for 210 days, with exceptions for pending nominations or presidential transitions. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 allows for temporary filling of vacant executive agency positions requiring confirmation. The appointment period lasts for 210 days, with exceptions for pending nominations or presidential transitions. President George W. Bush submitted 172 nominations for full-time positions in executive departments during the 110th Congress, with 125 confirmed, 13 withdrawn, and 34 returned under Senate rules. No recess appointments were made during this period. The report provides data on the time taken for executive department nominations to be confirmed in the 110th Congress. On average, it took 104 days for nominations to be confirmed, with a median of 92 days. The methodology used in this report differs from previous ones, including counting days during Senate recesses. This change affects the comparability of statistics with earlier research. The report provides data on the time taken for executive department nominations to be confirmed in the 110th Congress, with an average of 104 days and a median of 92 days. The methodology includes counting days during Senate recesses, which affects the comparability of statistics with earlier research. The decision to extend Senate consideration of nominees over recesses is intentional, and the choice to include all days, including long recesses, is better represented. The report includes tables with information on full-time PAS positions and nominations during the 110th Congress. Data was collected from authoritative sources, detailing positions, incumbents, pay levels, and vacancies. Pay levels range from level I ($196,700) to level V ($143,500). The appointment action table provides chronological information on nominations and appointments. The appointment action table in chronological order provides information on each nomination, including nominee name, position, nomination date, confirmation date, and days to confirm. It also notes actions other than confirmation, such as nominations returned or withdrawn by the President. The table presents average \"days to confirm\" as mean and median to account for outliers influencing the data. The tables in the report show different titles for some positions due to discrepancies in titles used by the White House, statutes, and departments. The first table lists incumbents based on department data, while the second table lists nomination actions based on Senate nominations database. The report highlights discrepancies in job titles between the White House, statutes, and departments for some positions. It includes tables organizing nominations and appointments alphabetically by last name, agency involved, dates, confirmation status, and confirmation duration. Additionally, there is a summary table by department for nominations and appointments. The report provides detailed information on executive department nominations and confirmations for the 110th Congress, including statistics on positions, nominees, confirmations, and nomination timelines. It also includes tables on Senate recess dates and department abbreviations, as well as explanations for methodological changes in tracking appointments. The report details executive department nominations and confirmations for the 110th Congress, including nomination-to-confirmation intervals. Methodological changes in tracking appointments are explained, with a shift to counting all days within the interval, including recesses. Senate rules suggest excluding days during longer recesses for nomination consideration. The Senate rules suggest that nominations not confirmed or rejected during the session they are made should not be acted upon in succeeding sessions without being resubmitted by the President. If the Senate adjourns or takes a recess for more than 30 days, pending nominations should be returned to the President. The methodology for tracking appointments in the 110th Congress has changed to include all days within the nomination-to-confirmation interval, including recesses. The Senate in the 110th Congress broke up longer recesses into shorter recesses with pro forma sessions. This created two options for calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals. The Senate and the President treated short recesses as short recesses, avoiding the need to return pending nominations or make recess appointments. The Senate in the 110th Congress broke up longer recesses into shorter recesses with pro forma sessions, allowing for two options in calculating nomination-to-confirmation intervals. The inclusion of these days in the count of time to confirmation reduces comparability with previous reports. This methodological issue could arise in future Congresses as well. The Senate in the 110th Congress broke up longer recesses into shorter recesses with pro forma sessions, affecting the calculation of nomination-to-confirmation intervals. The inclusion of recess days in the count of time to confirmation extends Senate consideration intentionally. Work on nominations continues during recess, including investigatory work and interviews with nominees. Political scientists may subtract recess days in their calculations, but ongoing activities still occur. In the 110th Congress, the Senate used pro forma sessions to break up longer recesses, affecting the calculation of nomination-to-confirmation intervals. While some researchers exclude recess days in their calculations, this report introduces a new methodology that includes all days for easier comparison with related work."
