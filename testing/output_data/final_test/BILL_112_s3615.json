The Act aims to improve markets for seafood, promote sustainable development, enhance safety and quality of seafood products in the United States. The Act aims to assist seafood industry stakeholders in developing and promoting markets, as well as educating consumers about the health benefits of seafood. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
