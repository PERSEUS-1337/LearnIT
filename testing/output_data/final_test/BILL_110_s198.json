    "content": "The Act titled \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings of the Act. The Act \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of protecting the United States from the threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. It also highlights the need to comply with the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, IAEA safeguards system, and Missile control lists are key international agreements aimed at preventing the development and use of nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons. The United States has benefited from key international agreements such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Chemical Weapons Convention, and IAEA safeguards. Additionally, laws like the Nunn-Lugar Act and its successors have served national security interests by reducing nuclear threats. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act, also known as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, has achieved significant milestones by deactivating nuclear warheads, destroying missiles and launchers, eliminating bombers, and sealing nuclear test tunnels. President George W. Bush called for the expansion of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program in 2004 to prevent weapons and dangerous materials from falling into the wrong hands. The program helps former Soviet states find employment for weapons scientists and dismantles, destroys, and secures leftover Soviet weapons and materials. More work is needed in this area. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the US must utilize all capabilities to prevent catastrophic terrorism using weapons of mass destruction. This includes pursuing a strategy involving multilateral agreements, missile defense, arms control, threat reduction assistance, and export controls to prevent dangerous regimes and terrorist groups from obtaining these weapons. Nations must be held accountable for their actions. The United States must hold nations accountable for violations of international nonproliferation treaties and provide assistance to uphold these standards. The President should have authority to use Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF RESTRICTIONS.\n\n(a) Repeals Section 211(b) of the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991.\n(b) Repeals Section 1203(d) of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993.\n(c) Repeals Section 1305 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000.\n\nSEC. 5.
