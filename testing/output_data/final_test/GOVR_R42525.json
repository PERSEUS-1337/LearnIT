    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for Department of the Interior agencies, the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, arts and cultural agencies, and numerous other entities and agencies. The appropriations laws for Interior and Related Agencies previously funded Department of Energy programs, Naval Petroleum Reserves, and Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, these DOE programs were transferred to energy and water subcommittees in the 109th Congress. EPA and smaller entities were also moved to Interior subcommittees for funding in the annual appropriations bill. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill underwent changes due to the abolition of the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. This resulted in EPA being included in the appropriations bill under Title II. The report is organized into sections for Interior agencies, EPA, other agencies, programs, and entities, as well as selected cross-cutting topics. Major agencies and cross-cutting issues receiving funding in the bill are covered in the report. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill discusses key funding changes and related policy issues of interest to Congress. The appropriations process is complex, with numerous funding, programmatic, and legislative changes for consideration. For more information on programs funded in the bill, contact the key policy staff. The report explains that appropriations represent total funds available, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, but excludes mandatory spending authorities. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of funding figures used in the report, with other sources including the Senate Committee on Appropriations, agency budget justifications, and the Congressional Record. Funding figures in tables may not match precise totals due to rounding, and appropriations for accounts within annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws can be obligated for varying periods. Appropriations in Interior laws are typically available for one fiscal year, unless specified otherwise. For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided funding for the National Park Service for FY2012 only. Many accounts in these laws have appropriations for longer periods. Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws often contain appropriations for longer periods of availability, spanning multiple fiscal years. For instance, appropriations in P.L. 112-74 for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement were provided for FY2012 and FY2013, with funds remaining available until September 30, 2013. These appropriations may be carried over from the first fiscal year to the second and must be obligated by the end of the second year. Additionally, many accounts have appropriations without fiscal year limitations, known as \"no-year appropriations,\" which typically remain available until expended. In P.L. 112-74, appropriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service's Construction account are an example of no-year appropriations, with funds remaining available until expended. FY2013 discretionary appropriations were considered in the context of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. The Budget Control Act of 2011 required a federal deficit reduction plan to be enacted by January 15, 2012. Failure to do so triggered automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 made changes to the procedures outlined in the BCA. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated deficit reduction by January 15, 2012, leading to sequestration and lower spending caps from January 2, 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013 made significant changes, including delaying the sequester to March 1, 2013, reducing the dollar amount by $24 billion, and lowering discretionary spending caps for FY2013 and FY2014. President Obama ordered the sequester's implementation on March 1, 2013, with OMB canceling budget authority from non-exempt accounts. Sequester reductions were calculated annually and applied at the program level under OMB guidance. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations were initially funded through a continuing appropriations resolution (CR, P.L. 112-175) until March 27, 2013. This was replaced by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) on March 26, 2013, providing full-year funding through September 30, 2013. Appropriations from the FY2012 Interior appropriations law with multi-year availability maintained a comparable period for the new FY2013 funds. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations were initially funded through a continuing appropriations resolution (CR, P.L. 112-175) until March 27, 2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided full-year funding through September 30, 2013, with appropriations reduced under the sequester order. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations were initially unclear pending guidance from OMB. Final appropriations for agencies were not updated in the report. Most accounts in the Interior bill were funded at the FY2012 level under P.L. 113-6, with exceptions provided for about two dozen appropriations. Funding anomalies were included in the FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations, with provisions in P.L. 113-6 rescinding previous appropriations and authorities for various agencies. The law affected specific accounts/programs within DOI, EPA, FS, IHS, and the Smithsonian Institution, among others. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill included provisions for changes in mining claim maintenance fees, national heritage areas, EPA pesticide registration fees, Indian Health Service funding, Forest Service cost recovery, and a temporary ban on EPA enforcement of the Spill Prevention rule. Reporting requirements were also outlined for departments and major agencies. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill required departments to submit detailed plans for fund allocation and monthly reports on obligations. Funding levels for Interior accounts were generally higher than FY2012, with exceptions for Wildland Fire Management. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill required detailed plans for fund allocation and monthly reports on obligations. It provided funding for DOI Wildland Fire Management at $726.5 million and for FS Wildland Fire Management at $1.97 billion, including repayments for funds transferred in FY2012 to suppress wildfires. The part-year CR was similar to the full-year CR in effect, with funding at the account level. The FY2013 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill required detailed plans for fund allocation and monthly reports on obligations. It directed departments and agencies to report on how funds would be allocated below the account level. The bill also contained provisions affecting specific programs or activities, such as amending the funding formula in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act included a $15 million annual limitation on payments to certified states as an offset for federal surface transportation spending. This raised concerns among some Members of Congress and affected states. Additionally, the bill extended the authority of the Forest Service for cost recovery for processing rights-of-way and other special use authorizations. It also extended the authorization for EPA to collect and expend pesticide registration fees. The FY2013 President's budget requested reauthorization of pesticide registration fees at existing rates, but the CR reauthorized them at current levels through March 27, 2013. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2012 extended pesticide registration fees and prohibited pesticide tolerance fees through FY2017, with a revised fee structure. The Administration requested $29.72 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies in FY2013, a $495.1 million increase from FY2012. The FY2013 budget proposed increases for various agencies including the Forest Service, Indian Health Service, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Geological Survey, and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Proposed decreases were seen for the Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, but no further action was taken by Congress on an FY2013 appropriations bill. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 6091 (H.Rept. 112-589) with $27.66 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2013, a decrease of $1.57 billion from FY2012. Funding levels remained the same for some agencies, while others saw increases or decreases in funding. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 6091 (H.Rept. 112-589) with $27.66 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2013, a decrease of $1.57 billion from FY2012. The bill proposed varied funding levels for different agencies, with some receiving more funding than the Administration's request, such as the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs, while others, like the Environmental Protection Agency, received less funding. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 6091 with reduced funding for various agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service, and Smithsonian Institution. The bill required DOI agencies, EPA, FS, and IHS to report quarterly on appropriation balances. The House Appropriations Committee requested detailed reporting on funding levels and sources for various programs and activities in FY2012. This included information on uncommitted, committed, and unobligated funds, as well as costs of litigation related to agency actions. The committee directed DOI agencies, EPA, and FS to report on payments of attorney fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act. The committee directed agencies to report on the costs of litigation shifting funding from priority programs, including program funds used and fee recipients' names and rates. The committee-reported bill aimed to prohibit funds for the National Ocean Policy and required the President to report on FY2011 and FY2012 expenditures related to the policy. The President was tasked with identifying funding for implementing a new policy in the FY2014 request. The bill also included a provision to extend mandatory funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT) for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee's report contained additional views and recommendations affecting multiple agencies. The committee recommended approximately $6 billion in total appropriations for 51 unauthorized agencies or programs within the bill. They urged authorizing committees to quickly reauthorize these programs and encouraged collaboration with interested parties. Authorizing legislation establishes, continues, or modifies agencies or programs, outlining their duties, organizational structure, and funding authorization. The Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies held hearings on appropriations requests for FY2013. A draft bill and funding table were released with $29.72 billion allocated, slightly lower than the President's request but higher than previous years. The Senate subcommittee draft for FY2013 appropriations was $5.3 million lower than the President's request but $489.8 million higher than the FY2012 appropriation. It was also $2.06 billion higher than the House committee-reported level in H.R. 6091. The draft provided higher funding levels for most agencies compared to the House committee-reported bill, except for a few agencies. Congress debates various funding and policy issues each year, including environmental regulations, energy development, wildland fire fighting, and endangered species management. Issues discussed in FY2013 appropriations hearings included funding for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to address wastewater and drinking water infrastructure needs. Other topics included DOI science programs, endangered species management, wild horse and burro management, agency reorganizations, and funding for various programs such as Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement and education, Indian Health Service construction, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The curr_chunk discusses funding for drinking water infrastructure projects, Endangered Species Act provisions, EPA regulatory actions, and Indian Health Service funding levels. The curr_chunk discusses funding for Land Acquisition, Outer Continental Shelf Leasing, and appropriate funding levels for agencies addressing regulatory issues related to energy and minerals development. The curr_chunk discusses funding for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Office of Natural Resources Revenue, and Superfund. It highlights the adequacy of proposed funding for hazardous waste cleanup and the debate on funding sources. Appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies from FY2004-FY2012 are shown in Table 1, with a significant increase in FY2012. Funding history for FY2008-FY2012 is detailed in Table 19. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations for the Bureau of Land Management and the management of public land for various uses. It also mentions legislative actions for FY2013 funding, including part-year and full-year continuing appropriations. The Bureau of Land Management manages federal subsurface mineral estate and Indian Trust lands. The House Appropriations Committee approved $1.074 billion for BLM in FY2013, a decrease from previous years. Funding includes various land programs for protection, recreation, development, and administration. The House Committee supported increases for wildlife and range management activities funded by the Bureau of Land Management in FY2013. Wildlife management would increase by $15.3 million for sage grouse conservation, while range management would increase by $2.6 million for livestock grazing on BLM land. The committee did not support the proposed grazing administration fee of $1 per animal unit month (AUM) and directed the agency to report on potential cost recovery based on permit administration costs. The committee-reported bill included provisions to extend the maximum term for BLM and FS grazing permits and leases from 10 to 20 years, and to make permanent the automatic renewal of permits and leases until the renewal process is completed. Energy and minerals management funding would increase by $23.2 million in FY2013. In FY2013, the President sought $140.9 million for oil and gas management, including a proposed fee on industry for inspections. The committee did not approve the fee and reduced funding for renewable energy by $2.9 million. The committee emphasized the need for BLM to address delays in mining permitting. Resource management planning funding was recommended to increase by $4.7 million to $42.7 million. The committee-supported decreases in funding for BLM land management plans included cuts for wild horses and burros, recreation, the National Landscape Conservation System, and the Alaska conveyance program. Wild horse and burro management funding would have decreased by $10.8 million, with concerns raised about program costs. The Administration requested an increase for research on contraception methods to control population growth. The House committee bill retained the prohibition on using funds for the slaughter or sale of healthy, unadopted wild horses and burros under BLM management. The House committee-supported bill included a provision to bar funds from being used to prohibit access to BLM and FS land for hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting, with exceptions for closures authorized by the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture. The President sought an increase in funding for recreation management, primarily for managing wild and scenic rivers, national scenic and historic trails, and off-highway vehicles. The President proposed an increase in funding for the National Landscape Conservation System by $3.3 million, bringing it to $35.1 million. This system manages BLM's protected areas, including national monuments, conservation areas, and wilderness. The House committee-reported bill would continue to prohibit funds from implementing an order regarding wilderness protection on BLM lands. The Alaska conveyance program would decrease by $12.3 million to streamline the land conveyance process. The BLM is decreasing funding for the Alaska conveyance program as part of streamlining the land conveyance process. The House Appropriations Committee provided $6.7 million for land acquisition in FY2013, which is $15.6 million less than the previous year's appropriation. The House Appropriations Committee provided $22.3 million for BLM land acquisition, $26.8 million less than the Administration's request. The funding would have been used for recreational access, inholdings acquisition, and program management. The appropriation for BLM acquisitions has varied over the past decade, funded from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The House Appropriations Committee approved $1.16 billion for wildlife habitats and migratory bird conservation in H.R. 6091 for FY2013, a decrease of $316.6 million from FY2012. The President requested $1.55 billion for similar programs, with a total FWS request of $1.35 billion for FY2013. The committee's proposed changes ranged from elimination to a 6% decrease in accounts and activities compared to FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee approved $1.16 billion for wildlife habitats and migratory bird conservation in FY2013, a decrease of $316.6 million from FY2012. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is for the Resource Management account, with a decrease of 15% approved by the House Committee. Funding for the endangered species program within the Resource Management account was approved at $134.0 million, a decrease from previous levels. The FY2013 Interior appropriations law included spending limits for listing species in response to petitions, listing foreign species, and critical habitat designation. The House Committee approved $14.1 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, a decrease of $33.6 million from previous levels. The House Committee approved reduced funding for various conservation programs, including $14.1 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, $437.4 million for the National Wildlife Refuge System, and $127.2 million for aquatic habitat and species conservation. These reductions were attributed to increased operational costs, maintenance backlog, and other demands. The House Committee proposed reduced funding for aquatic habitat and species conservation, with $63.1 million allocated for this activity. The committee supported funding for National Fish Hatchery Operations at $46.1 million, the same as the previous year. The controversy over hatchery funding stems from FWS management of hatcheries providing mitigation for other agencies. The House Committee stated it will reject proposals to reduce funding until offsetting reimbursable funds are secured from responsible Federal agencies. The House Committee provided reduced funding of $3.0 million for the FWS program, down from previous levels. The program supports work with partners at various levels to address climate impacts on wildlife and habitat through scientific research and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). The House Committee did not make specific comments on this program but criticized the Administration's climate change programs for duplication and lack of coordination. The House committee allocated $15.0 million for land acquisition in FY2013 from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), a decrease from previous levels. Funding was directed towards inholdings, acquisition management, and $4.0 million for the Highlands Conservation Act. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) compensates counties for federal lands under FWS jurisdiction. The committee approved $12.0 million for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF), a reduction of $2.0 million from the previous year. This funding, along with $4.9 million in permanently appropriated receipts, would have provided counties with 23% of the authorized level of $73.8 million. County governments have long urged additional appropriations to make payments at the full authorized level due to the presence of non-taxable federal lands under the jurisdiction of FWS. The Administration requested no funding for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) and Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) despite Congress appropriating $14.0 million for NWRF in FY2012. The MSCF, which benefits various endangered species, was reduced by 50% to $4.7 million by the House committee. All programs under MSCF were also cut by 50%. The House committee reduced funding for various conservation programs, including the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, by 50% from the FY2012 level and the Administration's FY2013 request. The committee emphasized that all authorizations in this account have expired or will expire in FY2012. They urged the authorizing committees to enact legislation for these grants. The House committee urged authorizing committees to enact legislation for grants or consider alternatives. The committee-reported bill proposed raising a state's minimum share to 50%, compared to the FY2012 requirement of 25% or 35%. The Administration suggested canceling $200.0 million of unobligated funds for the Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP), but the House Appropriations Committee did not support this. CIAP, established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, focuses on assisting states and local governments with the impacts of offshore development on coastal ecosystems. Eligible states are those with offshore energy resources. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) was established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to assist states with offshore energy production. Eligible states include Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The program had a mandatory spending authority of $250 million annually from FY2007 to FY2010, totaling $1 billion. Approximately $565 million in unobligated balances remain available without further appropriation. The program was initially administered by the Minerals Management Service, then by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE), and now by FWS. The unobligated balance was transferred to FWS in FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee transferred administrative provisions affecting FWS in H.R. 6091. One provision addressed gray wolves in Wyoming, requiring the Secretary of the Interior to issue a final rule on their removal from the Endangered Species Act list. The committee emphasized the need for a timely decision on the wolf management plan, warning that without an approved plan, wolf management in the state may fall short of recovery goals. Another provision related to three captive-bred exotic species linked to antelope. The provision in question concerns three captive-bred exotic species related to antelope - scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle - listed as endangered. The 2005 rule allowed hunting and interstate shipment of these species on game farms, but a court found it violated the ESA by granting a broad exception. FWS removed the exclusion and stated permits would be required for hunting or transport. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Park System, covering 397 units over 84 million acres. In FY2013, H.R. 6091 allocated $2.45 billion for the NPS, a decrease from previous levels. Permits are now required for hunting or transporting three endangered exotic species. The FY2013 request saw a decrease in funding for the National Park Service, with the largest portion allocated to the Operation of the National Park System account. The House Appropriations Committee approved $2.23 billion for this account, which was less than both the FY2012 level and the Administration's request for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee approved $324.3 million for resource stewardship activities in the National Park Service, a decrease from both the FY2012 level and the Administration's request. The Administration sought $8.0 million for the climate change program within this activity, focusing on monitoring, mitigation, and adaptation strategies. The House committee did not include funding for climate-change related activities, citing a need for improved coordination and communication in this area. The House Appropriations Committee rejected proposed cuts to funding for park base operations by the Administration, which aimed to reduce costs through various measures. The committee-approved bill included level funding for NPS external administrative costs, while the Administration had requested an increase in funding for these costs. The House committee bill supported the Administration's requested increase of $2.6 million for NPS responsibilities related to the 2013 presidential inauguration, park police, and visitor safety. It also included $9.8 million for Everglades restoration planning and coordination. For the National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P) account for FY2013, the bill contained $51.8 million, $8.1 million less than FY2012. The NR&P funds various Park System activities, including resource protection, environmental review, and heritage partnership programs. Both the House Committee and the Administration approved a reduction in heritage partnership funding to $9.3 million for FY2013, focusing resources on national park units and partnership programs. The House committee-reported bill aims to provide financial assistance to heritage areas, address concerns about their self-sufficiency, and extend the authority of the Secretary of the Interior for certain heritage areas. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $49.5 million for the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) for FY2013, a reduction of $6.4 million from the previous year. This fund provides grants for restoring historic sites and buildings significant in American history. Additionally, $131.2 million was recommended for NPS Construction for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $131.2 million for NPS Construction for FY2013, a $24.2 million decrease from the previous year. The funding would address critical life/health/safety, resource protection, and emergency projects identified through an NPS inventory and condition assessment program. No new facility construction was included in the House committee-reported bill or Administration's request. The Construction account funds general management planning and special resource studies for potential Park System additions. The House Appropriations Committee supported $13.6 million for FY2013, with $2.2 million for special resource studies. Construction funds also address deferred maintenance, although the specific allocation for this purpose is not always specified. The NPS has improved inventory and asset management systems, but the deferred maintenance backlog continues to grow. The National Park Service's deferred maintenance backlog has been increasing, estimated at $8.94 billion to $13.15 billion for FY2011. Funding for NPS road construction and repair has been provided through the Federal Lands Highway Program. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 proposed $13.3 million for Land Acquisition and State Assistance, a decrease from previous appropriations. Land acquisition funds are primarily used to acquire lands for the National Park System. The committee bill proposed $10.5 million for land acquisition within the National Park System, with funds allocated for managing previous acquisitions, emergencies, and battlefield protection. This amount was a decrease from previous appropriations and the Administration's request. State assistance for outdoor recreation-related land acquisition and planning was also included, with grants provided on a 50/50 matching basis. The House committee-reported bill contained $2.8 million for grants to states. The House committee-reported bill proposed $2.8 million for grants to states, which would be used for administering previous state grants. This amount represented a decrease from previous levels and the Administration's request. Additionally, the Administration suggested $20.0 million for a new competitive grants program focusing on urban parks, greenspaces, landscape-level conservation, and public access to rivers and waterways for recreation. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provides information on geological resources, climate change, and energy, mineral, water, and biological sciences. The US Geological Survey (USGS) is the federal government's mapping agency and a key source of data on water resources. In 2011, the USGS reorganized its science programs to focus on interdisciplinary themes outlined in its strategic plan. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a total appropriation of $967.0 million for the USGS in FY2013, a decrease from previous levels. The committee-reported bill for the US Geological Survey in FY2013 included decreases in funding for various programs, with increases only for Water Resources and Core Science Systems. Restrictions were placed on the use of funds, such as requiring consent for surveys on private land and limiting cost-sharing for mapping and data collections with states and municipalities. The committee proposed cutting climate change spending by 29% for FY2013 compared to FY2012, citing limited funding for USGS science programs. The Climate Change Program's funding was reduced to $51.9 million, $7.1 million less than FY2012. The committee emphasized the need for improved coordination among federal agencies in climate change activities. The Ecosystems program focuses on research and monitoring of ecosystems, with six sub-programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $132.5 million for the program in FY2013, a decrease from the Administration's request and the previous year. The committee did not support many of the requested program increases. The committee supported some increases proposed by the Administration for ecosystem priorities activities, including funding for addressing white nose syndrome in bats and research on controlling Asian carp. However, reductions were proposed for all sub-programs under this program compared to the Administration's request. The committee-supported bill included a $25.5 million reduction for the Climate and Land Use Change Program, split into climate variability and land use change sub-programs. The Land Use Change sub-program received $76.4 million, enabling users to access Earth observation imagery. Landsat Missions programs would have received $66.4 million. The Land Remote Sensing line item in the reported bill would have received $66.4 million, $5.7 million less than the FY2013 request and $7.3 million less than the FY2012 level. The Climate Variability sub-program would receive $51.9 million, $15.9 million less than the FY2013 request and $7.1 million less than the FY2012 level. The bill did not fund increases requested by the Administration for science support for DOI agencies and climate research and development. The funding would be used to monitor landscape changes and understand climate effects and adaptation strategies. The Minerals and Environmental Health program focuses on research and assessments of the nation's mineral and energy resources, with components including minerals resources, energy resources, toxic substances hydrology, and contaminant biology. The House committee-reported bill allocated $88.3 million for this program, with $46.8 million designated for the Minerals Resources sub-program. This funding represents a decrease from both the Administration's request and the FY2012 level. The program received $45.3 million, a decrease of $2.4 million from FY2012. It supports research on mineral resources, including rare earth elements important for defense systems. The committee backed a $1.0 million increase for rare earth element research. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $107.4 million for a program addressing natural hazards in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, with a focus on endocrine-disrupting chemicals affecting fish and wildlife. This is a decrease from the Administration's request and the FY2012 level. The Earthquake Hazards program saw the largest reduction in funding. The House Appropriations Committee proposed funding reductions for various programs, including a $11.0 million decrease for one program and a $14.4 million decrease for the Coastal and Marine Geology program. The Water Resources program, which focuses on hydrological data collection and water conservation, received an increase of $10.0 million to $219.8 million. The committee proposed level funding for the Water Resources Research Act Program at $6.5 million, which provides grants to water resources research institutes. The Administration wanted to eliminate this program to allocate funds to higher priority areas like the WaterSMART program. Funding for the Cooperative Water Program was retained at $64.0 million, despite the Administration's request for a reduction to $59.3 million. The Administration proposed funding for interpretative studies and data collection activities related to water through streamgages. The Core Science Systems program provides geospatial data for resource management and natural hazard planning. The House Appropriations Committee bill suggested $112.3 million for the program, a decrease from the Administration's request but an increase from the previous year. The Administration also realigned funds for a new science synthesis, analysis, and research program, resulting in an increase in funding for biological information management and delivery. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $82.4 million for the Enterprise Information program, a decrease from the Administration's request of $99.1 million and from the FY2012 level of $110.2 million. The committee also proposed a reduction of $10.5 million for the Science Support sub-program to $62.9 million from the FY2012 level of $73.4 million. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $96.0 million for the Facilities program, a decrease from the Administration's request of $99.7 million. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced a plan to separate the safety and environmental functions of the Minerals Management Service. The Minerals Management Service was restructured into three new entities: the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The transition was completed on October 1, 2011, with each entity having a director overseeing specific functions related to offshore resource management, safety enforcement, and revenue collection from energy and mineral leases. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) collects, analyzes, audits, and disburses revenues from energy and mineral leases on federal and Indian lands. In FY2011, ONRR disbursed $11.2 billion from mineral leases, fluctuating annually based on oil and gas prices. Revenues come from bonus bids, rents, and royalties from coal and other minerals. ONRR distributes revenues to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs based on statutory formulas. The House Appropriations Committee proposed funding for BSEE, BOEM, and ONRR at FY2012 levels, which were lower than the Administration's FY2013 requests. Offset collections were supported for BSEE and BOEM but not for ONRR. Funding levels for the agencies were detailed in tables provided. The House Appropriations Committee proposed funding increases for BSEE and BOEM in FY2013, with a focus on regulatory programs and environmental enforcement. Oil spill research funding would remain flat at $14.9 million, while inspection fees would increase to $65.0 million. BOEM would see a $3.0 million increase, with half allocated to the renewable energy program. The Administration proposed increasing the offshore alternative energy program by $1.4 million from $22.7 million in FY2012 to $24.0 million in FY2013. BOEM established the program in FY2010 to develop offshore renewable energy policies. The agency issued leases for site testing and data collection, including a commercial lease for a wind energy project offshore. BOEM aims to streamline the process for offshore wind energy projects with its \"Smart from the Start\" program. The House committee did not support the proposed fee on new nonproducing Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Administration proposed a $4.00 per acre fee on new nonproducing Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and onshore leases or the repeal of royalty relief provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress expressed concerns over delays in issuing OCS exploration and development permits in FY2012, emphasizing the importance of safety and prompt permit consideration. The Administration prioritizes safety and timely processing of permits, particularly for deepwater drilling. The Administration's review of deepwater permit applications has been delayed due to the Deepwater Horizon incident and additional informational requirements. The House committee proposed funding ONRR's major programs at FY2012 levels, with CAM receiving $77.8 million and revenue and operations receiving $41.8 million. CAM is implementing reforms to improve revenue collections, while the revenue and operations program is phasing out the royalty-in-kind program. The focus of recent debates has been on moratoria areas off limits to leasing and the audit and compliance program in the oil and gas industry. President Bush lifted executive moratoria in 2008, potentially opening up areas for leasing activity. The Administration's review of deepwater permit applications has been delayed due to the Deepwater Horizon incident. ONRR's major programs are funded at FY2012 levels, with reforms being implemented to improve revenue collections. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act placed a leasing moratorium in the eastern Gulf until 2022, with revenue-sharing provisions for coastal states. There are debates on lifting the moratorium to increase domestic oil and gas supply, while others are concerned about economic and environmental impacts. The 2010 oil spill in the Gulf has influenced the debate. The Obama Administration announced the Revised Program for the 2007-2012 OCS Leasing Program, eliminating five Alaskan lease sales and withdrawing the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area from leasing until 2017. The final five-year OCS oil and gas leasing program for 2012-2017 excludes Atlantic and Pacific Coast planning areas but includes three areas in Alaska. There are 15 lease sales in the new program, with 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and three in Alaska. President Obama cancelled lease sales following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. President Obama cancelled lease sales in response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Obama Administration held lease sale 218 in the Western Gulf of Mexico in December 2011, the first sale since the spill. The final combined OCS sale of the 2007-2012 leasing program took place on June 20, 2012. Critics argue that less auditing and more focus on compliance review has led to a less rigorous royalty collection system, resulting in a loss of revenue to the federal Treasury. Recommendations have been made to strengthen compliance and asset management controls. The Department of the Interior (DOI) implemented a risk-based compliance approach and established the Royalty Policy Committee (RPC) to review the Mineral Leasing Program. The RPC made over 100 recommendations to improve the leasing program and auditing function, including a review of the RIK program. The program saw significant growth from 2004 to 2007, but a report by the GAO in 2008 suggested improvements. As a result, the Secretary of the Interior announced the phased-in termination of the RIK program. Additionally, concerns about hazards from coal mining led to the enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 authorized the federal government to reclaim abandoned coal mines and regulate active coal mines to minimize environmental impacts. It established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement and the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, financed by fees on coal production. Amendments in 2006 made payments to eligible states and tribes for reclamation programs mandatory appropriations. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) receives mandatory funding for its budget, with discretionary appropriations funding grants for coal mine regulation and reclamation activities. The proposed FY2013 budget for OSM was $677.8 million, $211.8 million less than FY2012, primarily due to the termination of mandatory payments to certified states with reclaimed coal sites. Legislation now limits payments to certified states to $15 million annually. Legislation limits mandatory payments to certified states to $15 million annually, impacting mine reclamation resources. Section 142 of P.L. 112-175 addresses concerns for noncertified states but maintains funding limitation for certified states. House Appropriations Committee recommends $150.1 million for OSM in FY2013, slightly higher than President's request. The discretionary appropriations for OSM are detailed in Table 10, with funding issues discussed regarding regulation of active coal mines, the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, a proposed fund for hardrock mines, and integrating OSM functions within BLM. OSM develops regulations for coal mines and approves state and tribal regulatory programs for environmental protection. \"Primacy\" states have approved regulatory programs. States with approved regulatory programs, known as \"primacy\" states, receive federal grants covering up to 50% of operating costs. They are responsible for regulating active coal mines, with OSM granting primacy to 24 states and retaining it in Tennessee and Washington. No tribes have regulatory primacy under SMCRA. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $122.7 million for OSM's Regulation and Technology account in FY2013, an increase from the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee recommended maintaining funding for federal regulatory grants to primacy states in FY2013 to support their regulatory role in overseeing active coal mines. The committee expressed concern that reducing these grants could hinder primacy states' ability to regulate effectively if they had to rely more on increasing permit fees. The House Appropriations Committee recommended maintaining funding for federal regulatory grants to primacy states in FY2013 to support their regulatory role in overseeing active coal mines. The Administration proposed increasing coal mining permit fees to ensure more comparable treatment among industries and reduce reliance on federal appropriations. Primacy states would have the discretion to increase permit fees within their jurisdictions. The President requested an increase in the Regulation and Technology account for enhanced federal oversight of state regulatory programs. The committee emphasized the importance of states with primacy under SMCRA regulating coal mining operations within their jurisdictions. Title IV of SMCRA established the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to reclaim lands affected by coal mining. The fund is financed by a per-ton fee on coal production in the US. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund supports the reclamation of abandoned coal mines in states and tribes with coal production. Payments are made to eligible states and tribes based on coal production. Amendments in 2006 reauthorized coal production fees collection through FY2021 and mandated payments from the fund. Disbursements are now based on coal production, and mandatory payments also support United Mine Workers of America retiree health benefit plans. Activities relying on discretionary appropriations are limited to those administered by OSM. The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund activities are limited to those administered by OSM, not by states and tribes. These activities include evaluating state and tribal reclamation programs, providing technical assistance, managing coal production fees, and federal watershed restoration projects at historic coal sites. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $27.4 million for these activities for FY2013, similar to FY2012 and slightly lower than the President's FY2013 request. The 2006 amendments addressed concerns about fee collections exceeding appropriations and western states bearing a disproportionate share of reclamation expenses due to coal production moving westward. The 2006 amendments authorized mandatory payments to states and tribes from the U.S. Treasury to address prior fee collections. Payments are to be made in seven annual installments through FY2014. OSM can \"certify\" states and tribes that have reclaimed priority coal sites, allowing them to use payments for other mining sites. Currently, four states and three tribes are certified. Certified states and tribes receive Treasury payments in lieu of disbursements from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. They can use these payments for reclamation of other mineral mining sites, with priority given to impacts of mineral development. The President's FY2013 budget proposed terminating payments to certified states and tribes to prioritize coal sites in need of reclamation. Similar proposals were included in the FY2012 and FY2011 budgets but were not enacted. The President's FY2013 budget proposed terminating payments to certified states and tribes for reclamation purposes, with a focus on prioritizing coal sites in need of reclamation. The House Appropriations Committee specified discretionary appropriations for reclamation in FY2013 but did not address the President's proposal. Certified states and tribes have opposed the termination of these payments, which would affect the availability of coal production fees for reclamation of abandoned mines. Section 100125 of P.L. 112-141 amended the funding formula to limit payments to $15 million annually. The President's budget also suggested allocating coal production fees through a competitive grant process to focus on hazardous sites. The President's FY2013 budget proposed focusing coal production fees on hazardous sites through a grant process, reversing aspects of the 2006 amendments. A related proposal aimed to establish a fund for the reclamation of abandoned hardrock mines, funded by fees on uranium and metallic minerals production in the US. The President's FY2013 budget proposed establishing a Hardrock Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund funded by fees on uranium and metallic minerals production in the US. The fund would be administered by BLM and provide grants for reclamation of abandoned hardrock mines, with priority based on hazards. The estimated revenue from the fees was $1.8 billion from FY2014 to FY2022. The proposed fund aimed to hold the hardrock mining industry accountable for mine reclamation. The lack of a dedicated fund for hardrock mines has increased reliance on EPA Superfund appropriations to address abandoned sites. Opponents are concerned about the potential impacts on the domestic hardrock mining industry, employment, and competitiveness with foreign minerals production. The Administration is considering consolidating support functions of OSM and BLM while maintaining their independence. The House Appropriations Committee directed no additional funds be spent on studies to merge their functions. The Secretary of the Interior issued an order to integrate OSM within BLM, which was later suspended due to concerns raised by conferees and stakeholders. The integration was meant to combine revenue collections, mine land reclamation, mine regulation, and administrative support functions. Recommendations were prepared to address these concerns by OSM and BLM. The Secretary of the Interior issued an order to integrate OSM within BLM, which was later suspended due to concerns raised by conferees and stakeholders. OSM and BLM recommended consolidating support functions while maintaining independence. The Secretary issued a new order directing the consolidation of certain support functions and resources to gain efficiencies among similar functions. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to federally recognized tribes and historically leads federal dealings with tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) historically leads federal dealings with tribes, providing various programs and services such as government operations, law enforcement, social programs, economic development, and education through the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The House Appropriations Committee allocated $2.57 billion for BIA and BIE in FY2013, reflecting an increase to address programs and policies benefiting American Indian communities. Since the enactment of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), contract support costs have been a major issue for Congress, the BIA, and tribes. Tribes contract with the DOI to provide services that the federal government would have provided, and ISDEAA requires the DOI to pay full contract support costs. However, appropriations have been insufficient to cover the full costs for every tribe. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that tribes are entitled to receive the full amount of reasonable and allowable federal funds for their contract support costs. Congress has options to address this, including amending ISDEAA or appropriating enough funds to cover all tribes' contract support costs. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 bill included $228.0 million for contract support, the same amount requested by the Administration. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $228.0 million for contract support costs in FY2013, $8.8 million more than the previous year. The BIA was directed to improve transparency on contract support costs and the federal government has primary jurisdiction over major criminal offenses on Indian reservations. The BIA funds law enforcement, jails, and courts in Indian country, supporting numerous agencies and programs operated by tribes. The sufficiency of funding for public safety and justice in tribal law enforcement agencies has been a concern in Congress. Tribes and the BIA have fewer law enforcement resources compared to state and local jurisdictions. The National Congress of American Indians reported that tribal law enforcement agencies are understaffed, with a shortage of officers to provide adequate services to tribal residents. Despite serving 1% of the population and patrolling nearly 2% of the country's square mileage, tribal law enforcement officers only make up 0.004% of all law enforcement officers in the United States. Detention and corrections facilities funded by the BIA face staffing, training, and operational deficiencies according to a 2004 report. The BIA is addressing these issues but still lacks 373 positions. The Tribal Law and Order Act has placed new responsibilities on the BIA's Office of Justice Services, impacting tribal courts, law enforcement, and detention centers. The Tribal Law and Order Act impacts tribal courts, law enforcement, and detention centers by allowing longer jail sentences for tribal citizens convicted of crimes under tribal codes. The act also requires the BIA to develop guidelines for approving correctional centers for long-term incarceration and a plan for the construction, maintenance, and operation of tribal detention centers. This could lead to a need for additional court capacity and increased detention capacity. The Administration requested $353.9 million for Public Safety and Justice, $7.7 million more than the FY2012 appropriation, to hire tribal and bureau law enforcement personnel and staff for newly added responsibilities. The House Committee recommended higher funding of $361.9 million for Public Safety and Justice, $8.0 million more than the request. This included additional funds for law enforcement and tribal courts. The committee-reported level would have been $15.7 million more than the FY2012 appropriation. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) funds an elementary and secondary school system, institutions of higher education (IHEs), and other educational programs, serving approximately 41,000 students in 183 schools and residential facilities. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) operates two IHEs and supports 29 tribally controlled IHEs, along with early childhood and adult education programs. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $810.1 million for the BIE in FY2013, $14.0 million more than the Administration's request. This included $61.2 million for tribal grant support costs, $13.0 million over the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $810.1 million for the Bureau of Indian Education in FY2013, $14.0 million more than the Administration's request. This included $61.2 million for tribal grant support costs, $13.0 million over the request, which would provide half of the projected shortfall. IHEs funded under Title I and Title II of the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities Assistance Act would have received an increase of $2.5 million compared to the FY2012 appropriation, for a total of $69.8 million. In FY2013, the Bureau of Indian Education saw a 15% increase in equivalent enrollment, with the addition of Keweenaw Bay Ojibwa Community College. BIE education program management costs were reduced to $18.4 million from $22.0 million in FY2012. The BIE plans to streamline service delivery and reduce workforce based on tribal consultations and a third-party study. The House Appropriations Committee directed the BIE to count students eligible for the Johnson O'Malley program in coordination with the U.S. Department of Education. The Johnson O'Malley (JOM) program provides financial assistance to eligible Indian students in public and private schools. Student counts have been frozen since FY1995, leading to a lack of data collection on students served. The freeze allows pre-1995 contractors to receive funding based on their 1995 student count. Tribes have flexibility in managing funds through Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA). The House Appropriations Committee reported $117.1 million for BIA construction activities in FY2013, with $62.1 million allocated for education, $11.3 million for public safety and justice, and $32.7 million for resource management. The education construction program focuses on replacing, repairing, and improving facilities in the BIE school system, including employee housing, to ensure safety and functionality. $9.2 million was designated for replacement school construction to complete the next project on the 2004 priority list. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $117.1 million for BIA construction activities in FY2013, with a focus on education, public safety, and resource management. OIA provides financial assistance to insular areas and freely associated states in the Western Pacific, managing relations and building capacities. OIA aid is crucial for addressing financial challenges in territorial governments, supporting infrastructure projects. OIA funding supports infrastructure projects in insular areas and freely associated states in the Western Pacific. The funding consists of permanent appropriations and discretionary funds from Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts. AT funding is used for government operations, infrastructure improvements, and natural resource initiatives, while CFA funding assists freely associated states under compact agreements with the U.S. government. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) budget for FY2013 totaled $575.3 million, with $487.3 million (85%) required by statutes. This includes funds from Compacts of Free Association and fiscal assistance for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The remaining $88.0 million (15%) comes from discretionary and current mandatory funds in the AT and CFA accounts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an appropriation of $83.3 million for FY2013, $22.0 million less than the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an appropriation of $83.3 million for FY2013 for the Office of Insular Affairs, which is $22.0 million less than the previous year. The committee approved $79.9 million in Assistance to Territories funding, providing technical assistance for infrastructure projects. For the Compact of Free Association account, $3.3 million was recommended, returning to typical funding levels after additional funds were provided in FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $7.06 billion for EPA in FY2013, which is less than the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. The EPA's responsibilities include implementing federal statutes on environmental regulations and awarding grants to assist states in pollution control. Congress may need to approve a renegotiated compact with Palau, which could lead to additional funds being pursued. The House Appropriations Committee approved a decrease in EPA funding for FY2013 compared to the President's request and the previous year. The reduction was mainly due to proposed cuts in four of EPA's accounts, including grants for Clean Water State Revolving Funds. The House Appropriations Committee approved a decrease in EPA funding for FY2013 compared to the President's request and the previous year. The committee-reported bill included decreases and increases in funding for various programs within the EPA accounts. Key focus areas included federal financial assistance for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, air pollution control requirements, and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund (LUST) account. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2013 included provisions to restrict EPA funding for regulatory actions related to pollution control statutes, climate change, and contamination cleanup at Superfund and Brownfields sites. Amendments to remove these provisions were defeated during full-committee markup. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2013 included provisions to restrict EPA funding for regulatory actions related to pollution control statutes, climate change, and contamination cleanup at Superfund and Brownfields sites. Amendments impacting ongoing and anticipated EPA actions were proposed, including addressing greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous air pollutants, permitting of new source air emissions, water quality impacts of mountaintop mining operations, management of coal ash, lead-based paint removal, and regulation of stormwater discharges. The overall decrease in funding was largely due to a proposed reduction in EPA's STAG account for SRF capitalization grants. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2013 included provisions to restrict EPA funding for regulatory actions related to pollution control statutes, climate change, and contamination cleanup at Superfund and Brownfields sites. The overall decrease in funding was largely due to a proposed reduction in EPA's STAG account for SRF capitalization grants, which support municipal wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2013 included reduced funding for EPA's SRF capitalization grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water projects. The bill allocated $689.0 million for Clean Water SRF grants, $486.0 million below the President's request and $777.5 million below the FY2012 level. The Drinking Water SRF grants received $829.0 million, also below requested and FY2012 levels. The committee noted the importance of these programs, which received additional funding in the ARRA of 2009. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2013 included reduced funding for EPA's SRF capitalization grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water projects, with a combined additional $6.00 billion in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The debate in Congress revolves around federal assistance needed to maintain sufficient capital in SRFs for water infrastructure needs, with advocates citing estimates of hundreds of billions of dollars required. Advocates argue for maintaining or increasing federal assistance for water infrastructure needs, citing estimates of hundreds of billions of dollars required. Some call for more self-reliance among state and local governments. Congress also focused on EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental actions in FY2013 appropriations. The House committee-reported bill addressed EPA's use of FY2013 funds for CAA regulatory actions, expressing skepticism about funding new \"climate change\" programs. The impacts of these actions on the economy were discussed in multiple hearings and proposed legislation. Funding for programs labeled as \"climate change\" nearly doubled in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations. Funding for programs labeled as \"climate change\" nearly doubled from $192.0 million to $372.0 million between FY2008 and FY2011. The House Committee proposed cutting climate change funding by 29% in H.R. 6091 due to concerns about duplicative programs and lack of coordination. EPA is one of 17 federal agencies receiving appropriations for climate change activities. EPA's funding for climate change activities has increased in recent years, with appropriations distributed across various program activities. There are concerns about program duplication and coordination, as well as questions about the effectiveness of EPA's strategy in achieving U.S. objectives. Comparing funding levels from year to year is challenging due to variability in activities and modifications to account structures. The House committee-reported bill for EPA's clean air and climate programs in FY2013 included $372.5 million for EPM and S&T accounts, compared to the President's request of $440.3 million and the FY2012 appropriation of $410.5 million. Additionally, $95.0 million was allocated for \"Research: Air, Climate, and Energy\" in FY2013, compared to the FY2013 request of $105.9 million. The STAG account had $200.7 million for State and Local Air Quality Management grants, $100.8 million less than the FY2013 request. The House Committee's FY2013 budget for EPA's clean air and climate programs allocated $372.5 million for EPM and S&T accounts, $35.0 million less than the FY2012 level. Within the STAG account, $30.0 million was included for Diesel Emission Reduction Grants, $15.0 million more than the FY2013 request. The radon categorical grant program was proposed for elimination in the FY2013 request. The Superfund account, administered by the EPA under the Superfund program, supports cleanup of hazardous substance-contaminated sites. The House committee-reported bill proposed $1.16 billion for the Superfund account in FY2013, $11.5 million less than the FY2013 request and $48.9 million less than the FY2012 appropriation. Funding levels for the Superfund account have averaged around $1.25 billion over the past decade, with debates focusing on cleanup pace and adequacy. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $546.8 million in FY2013 for remedial actions at Superfund sites, a $15.0 million increase from the President's request. Additionally, $188.5 million was recommended for emergency response and removal actions. The Superfund account funds EPA's research of cleanup technologies, oversight of federal facility cleanups, and enforcement of cleanup liability. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $169.4 million in FY2013 for Superfund enforcement, a decrease from the President's request. The President's FY2013 budget request for Superfund cleanup was $15.0 million below the requested amount and $17.3 million below the FY2012 appropriation. Concerns were raised about funding availability for ongoing remediation at Superfund sites due to budget constraints. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an increase for remedial projects above the President's request, prioritizing ongoing projects. EPA could still start new projects in FY2013 using private settlement funds or with oversight from responsible parties. The House Appropriations Committee provided direction to EPA on Superfund program funding, prohibiting funds for financial responsibility requirements until an analysis of market capacity is completed. This addresses concerns about responsible parties' capability to fund cleanup. The House Appropriations Committee directed EPA to analyze market capacity before implementing new financial responsibility requirements for Superfund cleanup. Concerns about responsible parties' ability to pay for cleanup have led to debates on reinstating Superfund taxes on industry to support the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund. Congress appropriates funds from this trust fund. The Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund is financed by Congress through appropriations. The President's FY2013 budget proposed reinstating Superfund taxes from 2013 to 2022. These taxes historically provided most revenues until expiring in 1995. General revenues now mostly fund the trust, with the potential reinstatement of Superfund taxes requiring reauthorizing legislation. Funding for brownfield cleanup, not covered by Superfund, is also a concern. Brownfields are sites with contamination that hinder economic redevelopment. EPA's program provides grants for assessment and cleanup, funded through the STAG account. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $131.2 million for the program in FY2013, a decrease from previous years. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $4.68 billion for the Forest Service in FY2013, which was 2% more than the FY2012 appropriation and 3% less than the Administration's request. The committee prioritized active forest management due to concerns about the health of national forests. The committee directed the USDA to conduct a review of the Administrative Solutions Services Project's impact on the Forest Service. They also instructed the Forest Service to assess personnel and resources for duplicative functions and include recommendations in the budget request. Additionally, the bill required the Forest Service to seek authorization for \"alternative arrangements\" for compliance with NEPA for post-fire restoration activities on National Forest System land. The Forest Service can pursue alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance for post-fire restoration activities on National Forest System land without prior CEQ authorization. FS appropriations are provided in various accounts for different purposes. The Forest Service budget request includes funding for Capital Improvement and Maintenance, Land Acquisition, Wildland Fire Management, and other programs. The Forest and Rangeland Research account received a decrease in funding under the committee-reported bill, with $247.8 million provided, $45.0 million less than the FY2013 Administration's request. The committee expressed concerns about the program's funding levels. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill with $183.0 million for State and Private Forestry programs, which was less than the Administration's request. The decrease in funding is mainly due to a decrease in the Forest Legacy Program and shifting cooperative fire protection programs to be funded under the Wildland Fire Management account. The committee expressed concerns about the Forest and Rangeland Research program's funding levels and lack of coordination among research stations and other entities. The committee approved funding for forest health management in the State and Private Forestry account at $112.0 million, an increase of $24.6 million over FY2012. They also allocated $16.0 million for landscape scale restoration, $2.0 million less than the Administration's request. These funds aim to restore the health and resiliency of forests and communities in priority areas identified by states. The committee-reported bill allocated $6.0 million for international forestry, a decrease from FY2012 but an increase over the Administration's request. For FY2013, the House Appropriations Committee reported $1.50 billion for the National Forest System, less than the Administration request. The committee did not approve a major restructuring of the NFS account but continued the proof of concept pilot. Funding for FS planning was eliminated in the committee bill. The committee bill for FY2013 eliminated funding for FS planning, expressing concerns about the implementation and cost of the revised planning rule. They believe the Forest Service has ignored Congress's direction and that the rule will lead to increased litigation. The bill also allows the use of the 1982 planning rule procedures instead of the 2012 rule for revised plans. Other provisions include restrictions on travel management plans in California and increased funding for forest products. The FS increased funding by 2% for various management activities in the NFS account to improve national forest health and protect communities from wildfires. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 allocated $344.1 million for Capital Improvement and Maintenance, $9.7 million more than the Administration's request. Legacy roads and trails received $35.0 million, a decrease from the previous year. The House committee-reported bill for FY2013 allocated $17.7 million for land acquisition, a decrease from the Administration's request. Legacy roads funding was maintained, with $7.1 million allocated for deferred maintenance, matching the Administration's request. The agency's backlog of deferred maintenance was estimated at $6.0 billion as of September 30, 2012. The FY2013 budget allocated $59.1 million for FS land acquisition, a $36.0 million decrease from FY2012. The Indian Health Service provides medical services to 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives through facilities and programs. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates numerous healthcare facilities, including hospitals, health centers, and clinics. In FY2013, the House Appropriations Committee proposed a $4.49 billion discretionary appropriation for IHS, an increase of $186.9 million from the previous year. In addition to discretionary funding, IHS also receives third-party reimbursements, mandatory appropriations for specific programs, and rent on personnel quarters, making up its total program level funding. The Indian Health Service (IHS) receives reimbursements, diabetes funding, and rent as part of its total program level funding. The House Appropriations Committee's bill proposed $5.57 billion for IHS in FY2013, $186.9 million more than the previous year. Approximately 90% of the funding is allocated to Health Services, with the remaining 10% for Health Facilities. In FY2013, the House Appropriations Committee approved $4.05 billion for Health Services, $70.6 million more than the Administration's request. The committee's bill included additional funding for clinical services, with $48.4 million allocated for staffing new or expanded health care facilities. The Administration requested additional funding for clinical services but sought $2.4 million less than the House committee-reported bill. Both the bill and the Administration's request included a $54.0 million increase for contract health services (CHS), which are used to purchase care from outside providers. The Administration stated that increased funds for CHS are a top tribal priority. The Administration considers increased funding for Contract Health Services (CHS) a top tribal priority. Congress has raised concerns about the CHS program, including funding levels, administration, and denials. The House Committee directed the Indian Health Service (IHS) to implement recommendations from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) regarding fund allocation. Additionally, the House committee-reported bill included $546.4 million for Contract Support Costs (CSC), which is more than the Administration's request and the previous year's appropriation. CSC funds are provided to tribes for administering IHS-funded programs under self-determination contracts or self-governance compacts. The CSC program, funded by the ISDEAA, covers costs for tribes like financial management and training. Shortfalls in the program have led to reduced services for tribes. The IHS was directed to improve transparency of contract support cost information and submit additional reports on hiring dentists, personnel issues, and sanitation facilities in Indian Country. The House Committee proposed reduced funding for IHS's direct operations to $67.6 million, a decrease from FY2012. However, the bill contained $443.9 million for the IHS Facilities Account, higher than the Administration's request, to support maintenance, improvement activities, and environmental health issues like sanitation facility construction in Indian Country. The House Committee proposed reduced funding for IHS's direct operations to $67.6 million, a decrease from FY2012. The bill contained $443.9 million for the IHS Facilities Account to support maintenance, improvement activities, and environmental health issues such as sanitation facility construction in Indian Country. Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex funded by federal appropriations and a private trust, with over $1.2 billion in total revenue. The House Appropriations Committee proposed reduced funding for the Smithsonian Institution (SI) for FY2013, with $643.6 million allocated for salaries, expenses, museums, research centers, and administration. This was an increase from FY2012 funding but a decrease from the FY2013 request. Additionally, $252.0 million was allocated for museums and research institutes, which was less than the FY2013 request but more than the FY2012 level. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $252.0 million for museums and research institutes, including $19.0 million for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. This was $5.6 million over the FY2012 level and $7.5 million less than the Administration's FY2013 request. Additionally, $44.6 million was allocated for program support and outreach, and $82.6 million for administration, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, and the Inspector General. $264.4 million allocated for facilities services in FY2013, with $145.5 million approved for facilities capital. Funding was allocated for baseline revitalization requirements, facilities planning and design, and repairs at the Museum Support Center and the National Air and Space Museum. In FY2013, $50.0 million was allocated for the construction of the NMAAHC, which is set to open in 2015. The Smithsonian Institution receives federal appropriations and income from trust funds to support various projects and operations. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities provides federal support for the arts and humanities through agencies like the NEA and NEH. The House Appropriations Committee approved a total of $264.0 million for the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, a decrease of $28.0 million from the FY2012 enacted level. Both NEA and NEH included $3.0 million for relocation expenses in their FY2013 requests, but the committee did not provide funding for this as detailed justification was not provided. The General Services Administration is preparing a detailed justification for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), a major federal supporter of arts disciplines. The House Appropriations Committee approved $132.0 million for NEA in FY2013, a decrease from previous years. The committee allocated $105.5 million for grants, $16.4 million less than requested. The two largest grant programs received $52.5 million for direct grants and $35.5 million. The House Appropriations Committee approved $132.0 million for NEA in FY2013, with $105.5 million allocated for grants. The committee recommended $52.5 million for direct grants and $35.5 million for state/regional partnership grants. Other grants included $6.0 million for Challenge America grants and $2.5 million for Our Town. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public programs. They have awarded over 61,000 grants since 1965 and have a Challenge Grant program to match private donations. The House Appropriations Committee approved $132.0 million for NEH in FY2013, a decrease from previous years. The committee allocated $97.0 million for non-matching grant funding, with $38.0 million for federal/state partnership grants. The House Appropriations Committee approved $38.0 million for the grants program, a decrease from the request and previous appropriations. $2.5 million was allocated for the Bridging Cultures initiative, which supports projects enhancing cultural understanding. The We the People grant program was not requested for FY2013 funding, but the committee emphasized its importance as a core NEH grant program. The LWCF grant program received bipartisan Congressional support and a funding increase to $3.5 million for FY2013. The program is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015, primarily funded by oil and gas leasing revenues. It is used for acquiring lands by federal agencies and state/local governments for recreational development. Since FY1965, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received about $34.4 billion, with $16.2 billion appropriated for various activities. LWCF funding has been used for land acquisition, state and local recreational development grants, and related programs like those of the Fish and Wildlife Service and Forest Service. Annual appropriations have varied, with FY2013 seeing a proposed $66.0 million allocation, the second-lowest in recent years. The House committee proposed a significant reduction in funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for FY2013, aiming to focus on oversight of previous projects rather than new acquisitions. They emphasized the need for agencies to submit prioritized lists of acquisitions for limited funds allocation and implement a standard policy for inholdings. The House committee proposed a significant reduction in funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for FY2013, with a focus on oversight of previous projects rather than new acquisitions. The Administration sought a $127.6 million increase for FY2013, but the House committee's reported bill contained the lowest level of funding for land acquisition since FY1974. Funding for new federal acquisitions was limited to small inholdings and recreational access for BLM and FS lands. The House committee proposed a significant reduction in funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for FY2013, focusing on oversight of previous projects rather than new acquisitions. The Administration sought an increase for land management agencies, using consistent criteria for acquisition projects to meet conservation goals. The DOI agencies considered factors like agency mission value, feasibility, willing sellers, and development threats for land acquisition in FY2013. The FS budget justifications since FY2011 have noted changes to the LWCF program, including the use of selection criteria to rank land acquisition projects. For FY2013, criteria included national importance, public and partner support, landscape impact, land management improvements, and protection of threatened lands. Funding was sought for inter-agency landscape scale acquisition projects and recreational access. Congressional concerns led to the development of criteria for acquisitions to ensure consistency among agencies. The House Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with agencies' lack of information on land acquisitions for FY2013. Funding for the DOI Office of Valuation Services was not included in the committee bill. State grants were approved for administrative expenses, not new grants, at $2.8 million for FY2013. The Administration requested $60.0 million for FY2013, with $3.5 million for program administration, $36.5 million for distribution according to law, and $20.0 million for a new competitive grant program aimed at funding projects in urban centers with limited access to natural areas, reconnecting youth to the outdoors, providing access to rivers and waterways, and protecting open spaces. The NPS evaluates proposed projects based on various criteria for funding. The House Appropriations Committee approved $14.4 million for FY2013 from LWCF for other purposes, $63.8 million less than FY2012. Funding was allocated for the Forest Legacy program and cooperative endangered species grants. The Forest Legacy program and cooperative endangered species grants are funded through LWCF. The Forest Legacy program aims to protect forests threatened by land conversion, while the cooperative endangered species grants include recovery land acquisition and habitat conservation plan grants. The Administration requested $60.0 million for each program in FY2013. Wildfire protection programs and funding are controversial, with debates on the high cost of fire suppression, locations for treatments, and challenges to administrative decisions. Funding for fire suppression, preparedness, and operations is included in the FS and DOI wildfire budget for FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee's FY2013 bill allocated $3.23 billion for Wildland Fire Management, with $2.39 billion for the FS and $838.5 million for DOI. This marked a $121.4 million increase from the Administration's request and a $600.6 million increase from the FY2012 enacted level. The increase was mainly due to the use of previously enacted emergency funds and not adopting the Administration's request to shift funding for hazardous fuels. The FY2013 committee-reported bill allocated $1.28 billion for preparedness, with $279.5 million for DOI and $1.00 billion for the FS. It also included $24.0 million to modernize the air tanker fleet. Additionally, $892.5 million was allocated for wildfire suppression, with $276.5 million for DOI and $616.0 million for the FS, marking an $83.8 million increase from the FY2012 level. The FY2013 committee-reported bill allocated $512.3 million for hazardous fuel reduction, with $167.3 million for DOI and $345.0 million for the FS. This was a $125.4 million increase from the Administration's request. The FY2013 committee-reported bill allocated $512.3 million for hazardous fuel reduction, with $167.3 million for DOI and $345.0 million for the FS. Funding for site rehabilitation was limited to DOI, with $13.0 million allocated, while other agency appropriations are available for post-fire site rehabilitation. DOI fire facilities were funded at $4.1 million, a decrease from previous levels. Research funding was set at $31.9 million, a decrease from both the enacted FY2012 level and the Administration's request. The committee supported the Administration's proposal to consolidate funding for FS state and volunteer fire assistance in Wildland Fire Management to improve program management. The FY2013 bill allocated $72.7 million for FS state fire assistance and $11.7 million for volunteer fire assistance, matching the Administration's request. The committee urged the FS to submit reports on wildfire management, including a nationwide assessment of night flying operations and the cohesive wildland fire strategy as required by the FLAME Act. The FLAME Act of 2009 established the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund for DOI and the Department of Agriculture to cover costs of large fires. Secretaries can transfer funds for suppression activities when needed. The FLAME Act of 2009 established the FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund for DOI and the Department of Agriculture to cover costs of large fires. The conferees on the FY2010 bill intended for FLAME funds to fully fund suppression needs and prevent borrowing from other programs. The committee-reported bill contained $407.0 million in FLAME funds for FY2013, matching the Administration's request. During FY2008 through FY2012, appropriations by agency were detailed in Table 19, including FY2013 funding requested in H.R. 6091. The graph shows appropriations for Title I (Department of the Interior), Title II (Environmental Protection Agency), and Title III (Related Agencies)."
