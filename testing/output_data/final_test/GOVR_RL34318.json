    "content": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and weakens the immune system, making individuals susceptible to infections. In 2013, an estimated 953,245 individuals in the US were diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Medications have improved health outcomes for those living with HIV/AIDS, allowing them to live longer and healthier lives. However, stable and affordable housing remains important for individuals with HIV/AIDS, as research shows a link between housing and health status. Research shows the relationship between housing and health status for individuals with HIV/AIDS. The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program provides housing and services for those affected. Adequate, affordable housing has been a concern since the early years of the epidemic, with many facing homelessness due to financial constraints. Individuals with HIV/AIDS face impoverishment due to inability to work, high medical costs, and loss of health insurance. There is a co-occurrence between HIV/AIDS and homelessness, with homeless individuals having a higher infection rate. Studies show a prevalence of HIV/AIDS among homeless populations ranging from 2% to 22%, with homelessness linked to higher risk factors for HIV/AIDS. The National Commission on AIDS was established by Congress in 1988 to develop a national consensus on AIDS policy. In 1990, the commission recommended federal housing aid for individuals with HIV/AIDS. Around the same time, the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs discussed barriers to housing for those living with HIV/AIDS. During a hearing, committee members discussed barriers to housing for persons living with HIV/AIDS, including poverty, homelessness, and discrimination. Eligibility for subsidized housing and concerns about the definition of \"handicap\" for the Section 202 Supportive Housing program were also raised. Difficulty in obtaining subsidized housing through mainstream HUD programs was highlighted, with individuals often dying while on waiting lists. In the 101st Congress, two bills were introduced addressing these issues. In the 101st Congress, two bills were introduced to create a housing program for individuals living with AIDS. The proposed programs, AIDS Housing Opportunity Act and AIDS Opportunity Housing Act, aimed to provide short-term and permanent housing with supportive services. The text from one of the bills, H.R. 1180, was included in the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, renamed Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) during Senate conference. The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program was established through the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act in 1990. It is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and provides housing assistance to low-income individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their families. The program offers reasonably priced housing for those with incomes at or below 80% of the area median income. The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program, established in 1990, provides housing assistance to low-income individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Funding is distributed through formula allocations and competitive grants, with 90% awarded by formula to eligible states and metropolitan areas based on HIV and AIDS case requirements. HUD administers the program through the Consolidated Plan process. The Consolidated Plan includes an assessment of community housing and development needs, proposing solutions using federal funds and community resources. Changes to the HOPWA formula requirements were made under the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act, affecting funding allocation starting in FY2017. Formula funds are distributed to large cities within metropolitan statistical areas with populations exceeding 500,000 and over 2,000 individuals living with HIV or AIDS. Starting in FY2017, HOPWA funds are distributed to states with more than 2,000 individuals living with HIV or AIDS outside of eligible MSAs. 25% of total funds are allocated based on housing costs and poverty, instead of AIDS incidence. Recipient cities within MSAs must address local needs with allocated funds. Recipient cities must allocate funds to address needs within their metropolitan statistical area. States can use funds for projects statewide, including areas with their own funding. HUD guidance allows states to serve clients outside eligible areas and coordinate resources throughout the state. In FY2016, 98 MSAs and 40 states received funds based on AIDS cases. HUD jurisdictions can administer programs or allocate funds to private nonprofits. HOPWA formula funds can be allocated to states or subgrantee private nonprofit organizations. States did not lose formula funds if AIDS cases dropped below 1,500 due to a provision in HUD appropriations laws. The remaining 10% of funding is available through competitive grants for supportive housing projects. States and local governments can apply for grants to provide housing in areas not eligible for formula funds. HUD's HOPWA program allocates formula funds to states or nonprofit organizations, with 10% available for competitive grants for innovative housing projects. These grants are awarded through an annual SuperNOFA, with funds now available for three years starting from FY2006. The program aims to support transitional or permanent housing in areas not eligible for formula allocations, as well as special projects of national significance that demonstrate innovative service delivery models. Since FY2000, Congress has required HUD to renew expiring contracts for permanent supportive housing before awarding funds to new projects. HOPWA competitive grants for new projects are not awarded every year. In August 2015, HUD announced competitive funds for a demonstration with the Violence Against Women Act Transitional Housing Program. In June 2016, awards were given to eight organizations providing housing and services to people living with HIV/AIDS who experience sexual assault or domestic violence. Prior to these awards, the last year with sufficient funds for new competitive grants was FY2011, awarding $9 million to seven projects. Puerto Rico is the only territory receiving HOPWA formula grants. Puerto Rico is the only territory receiving HOPWA formula grants, while other territories are eligible for competitive grants. The formula grants are distributed to states and populous cities meeting AIDS case requirements. Metropolitan statistical areas may include Puerto Rico but not other territories. The other territories are considered units of general local government for grant eligibility. In the HOPWA program, individuals eligible for housing must be HIV positive or diagnosed with AIDS and low income. Housing and supportive services are available for family members of those living with AIDS, defined broadly to include anyone important to the eligible individual's care. In the HOPWA program, individuals eligible for housing must be HIV positive or diagnosed with AIDS and low income. Family members of those living in HOPWA-supported housing are given a grace period to remain in the housing after the eligible individual's death. HIV positive individuals may also be eligible for other HUD-assisted housing for persons with disabilities, but must meet the statutory definition of disability beyond just their HIV/AIDS status. The HOPWA program provides housing for individuals who are HIV positive or have AIDS and low income. Housing eligibility requires meeting the statutory definition of disability beyond just HIV/AIDS status. Supportive services must be provided alongside housing, with a focus on housing activities. Formula grantees have flexibility in providing supportive services not tied to housing. Allowable activities include housing, social services, program planning, and development costs. The HOPWA program provides housing and supportive services for individuals with HIV/AIDS and low income. Activities include developing and operating community residences, providing short-term rental assistance, and utility assistance. Funds can be used for construction, rehabilitation, operating costs, and technical assistance. Residents in short-term housing facilities cannot stay for more than 60 days in a 6-month period. The HOPWA program offers housing and supportive services for individuals with HIV/AIDS and low income. Short-term rental, mortgage, and utility assistance are provided for up to 21 weeks in a 52-week period, with waivers possible for permanent supportive housing projects. Funds can also cover operating expenses and rental assistance for tenants in shared housing arrangements. Residents contribute 30% of their income towards rent, and supportive services like health assessments and counseling are included. The HOPWA program provides housing and supportive services for individuals with HIV/AIDS and low income. Assistance includes short-term rental, mortgage, and utility aid, operating expenses, rental assistance, and supportive services like health assessments and counseling. Nearly 69% of HOPWA funding is used for housing assistance, including various types of housing support and placement services. In 2016, Congress passed legislation to change the HOPWA formula as part of the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act (HOTMA, P.L. 114-201). The HOPWA method for allocating formula funds had been an ongoing issue since the program's inception due to the data that were used to distribute the majority of funds. Through FY2016, 75% of funds were distributed using the cumulative number of AIDS cases as reported by the CDC. The HOPWA formula for distributing funds changed in 2016 with the passage of the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization Act (P.L. 114-201). Previously, funds were distributed based on the cumulative number of AIDS cases reported by the CDC, but now the formula includes the current number of people living with AIDS and HIV. This change mirrored the shift in the Ryan White program, which also moved away from using cumulative AIDS cases for funding distribution. The Ryan White program formula changed in 1996 to use CDC estimates of persons living with AIDS for funding distribution, with hold-harmless provisions to prevent drastic shifts in funding. In 2006, the formula was further modified to include living HIV cases. The White program formula was modified to include living HIV cases for funding distribution. 90% of HOPWA funds are distributed via formula, with 75% going to metropolitan statistical areas and states with qualifying AIDS cases. P.L. 114-201 changed the qualification criteria to include people living with HIV as well as AIDS. Funding is based on the number of people living with HIV or AIDS, and grantees receiving funding in FY2016 will continue to receive funding subject to appropriations and HUD Secretary approval. P.L. 114-201 modified the HOPWA formula to include living HIV cases for funding distribution. 75% of funds are distributed to metropolitan statistical areas and states with qualifying AIDS cases, while the remaining 25% is bonus funding for qualifying states. The law prevents grantees from losing or gaining significant amounts of funding, with allocations not to decrease by 5% or more, nor increase by 10% or more for the first five years after enactment. Both Congress and recent administrations recognized the need to modify the HOPWA formula over the years. In response to the need for modifications to the HOPWA formula, HUD proposed changes in 1999 to make it more reflective of current AIDS cases. This included using an estimate of persons living with AIDS instead of all cumulative cases. The HOPWA formula for allocating funds was proposed to be modified in 1999 by using estimates of persons living with AIDS instead of cumulative cases. However, Congress did not adopt the recommendations. Subsequent reports by the Government Accountability Office highlighted the disproportionate funding per living AIDS case and the failure to target funds to areas of need. Attempts to change the allocation method in the 109th Congress were unsuccessful. The HOPWA formula for allocating funds has been a topic of discussion since 1999, with proposals to change it from using cumulative AIDS cases to estimates of persons living with AIDS. Various attempts in Congress, including the Housing for Persons With AIDS Modernization Act (H.R. 5640) in the 113th Congress, have been made to address the issue. The Administration has also proposed changes to the formula in multiple budget proposals, aiming to account for the present number of people living with AIDS and differences in housing costs in qualifying areas. HUD has proposed changing the HOPWA distribution formula to use the number of persons living with AIDS and potentially with HIV in the future. This proposal has been mentioned in budget justifications from FY2010 to FY2017, with a goal to shift to HIV/AIDS case reporting for formula grants. HUD proposed changes to the HOPWA distribution formula, including using the number of persons living with HIV and AIDS, maintaining eligibility for current grantees, limiting allocation changes, and replacing bonus funding with factors based on fair market rent and poverty. Both the House and Senate addressed formula modernization during the FY2016 and FY2017 appropriations processes. In FY2017, the Senate and House Appropriations Committee proposed modernizing the HOPWA formula to accommodate the increasing number of individuals living with HIV and AIDS. Funding for the HOPWA program has steadily increased since its creation, ranging between $330 million and $335 million since FY2010. Since FY2010, funding for the HOPWA program has ranged between $330 million and $335 million. The number of households receiving housing assistance has generally declined from FY2003 through FY2015, dropping from 78,467 to 54,647. Factors such as increased housing costs and longer stays in housing units may have contributed to this trend. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, established in 1990, provides funds for health care and supportive services for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. While housing is not specifically listed as an eligible activity, support services can include housing assistance to help clients achieve their medical outcomes. Policy guidance released in 1999 by the HIV/AIDS Bureau of HRSA outlines the type of housing that Ryan White grantees can provide. The Policy Notice 99-02 outlines the housing options for Ryan White grantees, including referral services and short-term housing. Ryan White funds are the last resort for housing, with time limits imposed on short-term housing since the program's reauthorization in 2006. HRSA released guidance on time limits for housing assistance in 2011, defining short-term housing as transitional in nature. Short-term housing assistance provided by Ryan White grantees is transitional in nature, aimed at moving individuals or families to a stable living situation. It cannot be permanent and must be accompanied by a strategy for long-term housing. Notice 11-01 encourages defining short-term housing as 24 months and requires housing to provide medical or supportive services. In 2013, 14,837 Ryan White clients received housing services, with HIV/AIDS status linked to homelessness. Homelessness is linked to HIV/AIDS status, with homeless individuals more likely to be HIV positive. Research shows that stable housing can improve health outcomes for homeless individuals with HIV/AIDS. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy recognizes the importance of housing in accessing care and improving health outcomes for those living with HIV/AIDS. The CHAIN Project, a longitudinal study since 1994, examines the impact of stable housing on health care for individuals with HIV/AIDS in New York City. Researchers found that stable housing improves health outcomes for those living with HIV/AIDS, compared to those who are unstably housed or homeless. Individuals who were unstably housed were less likely to access and maintain medical care, including appropriate HIV care. However, receiving housing assistance, mental health services, and social services case management increased the likelihood of entering and retaining medical care. The Housing and Health Study provided HIV positive individuals at severe risk of homelessness with HOPWA-funded rental housing. The Housing and Health Study provided HIV positive individuals at severe risk of homelessness with HOPWA-funded rental housing. After 18 months, 82% of HOPWA-assisted renters and 52% of individuals in the comparison group were living in their own housing. Both groups showed statistically significant improvements in health outcomes, including fewer emergency room visits, hospitalizations, opportunistic infections, and reduced use of medical care. Self-reported depression and perceived stress also improved. The Chicago Housing for Health Partnership study focused on homeless individuals with chronic illnesses, including HIV. After 12 months, the group receiving housing assistance had higher rates of intact immunity and undetectable viral loads compared to the usual care group. There was no significant difference in CD4 counts between the two groups. The treatment group in the study spent fewer days in emergency rooms and hospitals over an 18-month period, showing a 29% reduction in hospitalizations, a 29% reduction in hospital days, and a 24% reduction in emergency room visits compared to the usual care group."
