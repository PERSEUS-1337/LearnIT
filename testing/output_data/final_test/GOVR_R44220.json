    "content": "Some tax proposals aim to broaden the tax base and lower individual and corporate income tax rates, with examples like H.R. 1 introduced by Dave Camp. Other proposals focus on business-only tax reform, such as the Obama Administration's plan to cut the corporate rate and simplify taxes for small businesses. Tax reform proposals include business-related tax expenditures, reducing taxes on manufacturing, simplifying taxes for small businesses, and reforming the international tax system. Broadening the tax base may impact pass-through businesses, where income is taxed at individual rates. Lowering individual tax rates to offset base-broadening provisions for pass-through businesses may be costly. A revenue-neutral tax reform focusing on corporate rate reductions and base-broadening could increase the tax burden on pass-through entities. The tax reform proposals include base-broadening provisions that may impact pass-through businesses. Lowering individual tax rates to offset these provisions could increase the tax burden on pass-through entities. The Administration's proposal includes changes to the international tax system, which may not affect pass-through businesses. Special provisions in the proposal benefit small businesses, leading to a net tax cut for some. This report discusses issues and options for business-only tax reform. The report discusses issues and options for business-only tax reform, including the different forms of businesses such as C corporations, proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations. It also examines corporate tax expenditures and potential options for reform. Individuals may also hold rental property without engaging in business. Income from rental property can be received through real estate investment trusts (REITs). Regular corporations' income is subject to corporate and individual income tax. Other business forms are pass-throughs, where income is taxed under individual income tax. Sole proprietorships are owned by one individual, while partnerships are owned by multiple entities. Partnership income may be reported multiple times. In 2012, individual income reported on tax returns was $9,234 billion, while income from sole proprietorships was $304 billion and income from partnerships and Subchapter S firms was $535 billion. Farming income was small and negligible, rental income was $14 billion, and farm rental income was $6 billion. Noncorporate business income is significant compared to the corporate sector but small relative to total individual income. In 2012, individual income reported on tax returns was $9,234 billion. Business and rental incomes constituted 9.2% of income reported on individual income taxes. Corporate income in that year was $1,051 billion, with corporate accounting for 55% and noncorporate for 45% of total income. Broadening the base for business could impact unincorporated businesses, which make up a significant share of total business income. The noncorporate business sector has different activities and capital ownership compared to the corporate sector. Corporations hold 60.6% of business assets, with a larger share than their income (55%). They have a small share of residential rental property but a significant share of equipment and intangibles. The noncorporate business sector has different activities and capital ownership compared to the corporate sector. About half of nonresidential structures in the corporate sector are public utility properties, treated as equipment in the tax code but structures in the National Income and Product Accounts. Changes in cost recovery provisions for rental residential structures would impact unincorporated businesses, while changes in research and development treatment would affect corporate income tax. Different forms of organizations earn income in various industries, with corporate share of income at 47%. The data in Table 2 show the concentration of corporate activity in manufacturing, trade, and services. Proprietorships are concentrated in professional and health services, while Subchapter S firms have activities in trade, professional services, and manufacturing. Partnerships range from small to large firms, with the largest share of income earned in professional services, finance, and insurance. The data suggests that income is earned in various sectors such as professional services, finance, insurance, mining, manufacturing, and information. Integrated companies like major oil companies are classified as manufacturing, accounting for 14% of income. Agriculture and construction earnings are mainly in the unincorporated sector, while manufacturing equipment assets are mostly owned by corporations. Service industries are dominated by the unincorporated sector. The unincorporated sector dominates in service industries, owning a larger share of furniture, fixtures, and machinery. The largest tax expenditure in the corporate sector is accelerated depreciation on equipment, a potential base-broadening candidate. Base-broadening provisions could finance corporate rate reductions in a business-only tax reform by eliminating tax expenditures like exemptions, credits, or deductions. Table 3 shows corporate tax expenditures with costs of $1 billion or more. The corporate tax expenditures in Table 3 show costs of $1 billion or more, including amounts allocated to individuals and associated with business activities. Some tax expenditures relate to non-business activities like charitable contributions and treatment of investment income. Numbers from 2014 reflect adjustments for bonus depreciation and certain temporary provisions that expired at the end of 2014. Depreciation of structures is not included in Table 3 due to its small cost to corporations. The tax expenditures for corporate assets are significant, with rental housing being largely held by individuals. Other potential provisions in tax reform proposals include limiting interest deductions, capitalizing advertising expenses, and disallowing entertainment deductions. Base-broadening provisions are also associated with foreign income and multinationals. Some tax reform proposals aim to limit deferral of tax on foreign income by focusing on profit shifting, implementing a minimum tax rate, or restricting benefits for multinationals. Other provisions include limiting foreign tax credits and deductibility of interest to prevent profit shifting by foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries. Some tax reform proposals aim to limit deferral of tax on foreign income by focusing on profit shifting, implementing a minimum tax rate, or restricting benefits for multinationals. Other provisions include limiting foreign tax credits and deductibility of interest to prevent profit shifting by foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries, with base-broadening provisions concentrated in the corporate sector. The tax expenditure list is divided into four categories based on their impact on businesses and organizational form. Some provisions in the tax code, such as general obligation tax exempt bonds and low-income housing credit, are aimed at benefiting state and local governments and reducing housing costs for low-income tenants. These provisions account for $16 billion and 8% of total corporate tax expenditures. Other similar provisions include private activity bonds and charitable contributions. Private activity bonds allow reductions of interest on borrowing by private entities to finance assets used in certain activities like hospitals, mass transit facilities, and docks. The revenue gain from disallowing tax expenditure for corporations might be offset as individuals replace corporations as bond holders. The largest corporate provision allows deferral of U.S. tax on foreign source income, accounting for 42% of corporate tax expenditures. The largest corporate provision, accounting for 42% of corporate tax expenditures, may not be a potential source of revenue for corporate rate reduction. Tax expenditures that could be considered for base broadening are limited, including research provisions, insurance, finance, graduated corporate rates, and other small provisions. The availability of tax benefits is not restricted by organizational form, but some benefits are limited in dollar amounts or other ways. For example, Section 179 expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full amount. The curr_chunk discusses the potential implications of repealing certain provisions for corporations only in tax reform proposals. It highlights the challenges of differentiating tax benefits based on organizational form and the potential efficiency issues and revenue loss that may arise. Accelerated depreciation for equipment is mentioned as a significant tax expenditure that would benefit from conformity in tax policies. The curr_chunk discusses the implications of repealing provisions like accelerated depreciation for equipment and the production activities deduction in tax reform proposals. It emphasizes the need for conformity in tax policies to avoid confusion and encourage efficiency. Eliminating these provisions would reduce complexity and limit incentives based on organizational form. Eliminating complex provisions like accelerated depreciation and production activities deduction in tax reform proposals would reduce confusion and promote efficiency. Uniformity in tax policies is crucial to avoid incentives based on organizational form. One approach to business-only tax reform is to limit provisions like like-kind exchanges and nondealer installment sales to the noncorporate sector, simplifying rules and avoiding the need for complex systems. Various options for tax reform for businesses are discussed, with potential spillovers from base broadening for unincorporated businesses being considered. The argument for tax reform is to accept potential spillovers from base broadening for unincorporated businesses and aim for revenue neutrality for business investment. The current tax system favors the noncorporate sector, with higher corporate statutory tax rates compared to noncorporate businesses. Effective tax rates are lower but still higher for corporations, especially for tax-favored investments. The effective tax rates for corporations do not account for taxes on stockholders, which are estimated to be an additional 2.3 percentage points. A business-neutral tax reform that equalizes tax rates between corporate and noncorporate investments could increase efficiency. Reducing the corporate tax rate would also address the favorable treatment of debt finance. The effective tax rate for debt-financed corporate investment is -7% compared to 22.3% for equity. Noncorporate equity investors may not be made whole in tax reform, leading to winners and losers. Different industries will be affected differently by tax reform, with manufacturing and construction firms impacted more than trade and services. Noncorporate business investors with passive assets in corporate stock could benefit from business tax reform. Passive assets in corporate stock could benefit from business tax reform, driving capital flows into the corporate sector and increasing pre-tax returns in the noncorporate sector. Efficiency and administrative arguments support a business-only tax reform that uses base-broadening provisions from unincorporated businesses to finance corporate rate cuts. There is no clear fairness argument against this approach. One approach to business tax reform is to target base-broadening provisions primarily affecting corporations, such as slowing depreciation for buildings and equipment. This change would increase the tax rate for corporate investment and noncorporate businesses. Excluding buildings from the depreciation change would result in a smaller rate increase for corporations. The corporate tax rate would increase to 26.5% and the rate for structures to 22.5%. The effective tax rate change for noncorporate firms would be smaller. Eliminating the production activities deduction would increase the overall statutory corporate tax rate. Focusing on base broadening provisions primarily for corporations may interfere with other tax reform objectives. Excluding deferral leaves only a few relatively small provisions associated with international taxes, research, advertising, and LIFO inventories. Limiting base broadening to the corporate sector by restricting provisions only for corporations may leave rental housing favored relative to other business assets. The curr_chunk discusses implementing corporate-only changes for certain tax provisions, such as research subsidies and lower tax rates for small corporations. It suggests preserving existing depreciation systems for unincorporated businesses and disallowing provisions like production activities deduction and interest deductions only for corporations. This approach may add complexity to the tax code and create incentives to shift out. The curr_chunk discusses how implementing corporate-only changes for certain tax provisions may add complexity to the tax code and create incentives to shift out of the corporate form for certain businesses. It mentions that unincorporated businesses, being smaller on average than incorporated businesses, can benefit from provisions that allow benefits based on dollar amounts. An example is the Section 179 expensing provision, which allows firms to deduct the cost of investment in equipment up to a certain dollar limit. The Section 179 expensing provision allows firms to deduct the cost of investment in equipment up to a certain dollar limit. In 2014, the limit was $500,000, with a reduction in eligibility once investment reaches $2 million. Unincorporated firms receive almost 70% of the benefit from this provision, and the Obama Administration has proposed increasing the limit to $1 million to benefit smaller businesses. The Administration has proposed expanding eligibility for cash accounting for small businesses to compensate for the loss of tax benefits in a business-only tax reform. This could involve lowering individual rates only for business income, with precedents in current tax law. The proposal suggests lowering individual tax rates for business income, with precedents in current tax law. To simplify the process, a deduction from taxable income for pass-through businesses could be allowed, similar to the production activities deduction. This would reduce effective statutory rates for unincorporated businesses. An analysis by Sullivan suggests that an across-the-board deduction for all ordinary tax rates may not benefit small businesses primarily, as a large share of earnings from partnerships and S corporations come from larger entities. It is proposed to target the deduction to certain industries, such as manufacturing and construction, to better focus on firms affected by the tax revision. This proposal was included in a tax reform bill introduced by then-Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Dave Camp. Tax reform has been focused on revising the international tax system, particularly on the deferral of tax on foreign source income. This deferral creates distortions and incentives to retain earnings abroad. Options include eliminating deferral for rate reduction or moving to a territorial tax system. There are also middle ground approaches to consider. The focus of tax reform has been on revising the international tax system, particularly on deferral of tax on foreign source income. Options include moving to a territorial tax system or imposing a minimum tax on foreign income. International tax reforms may not significantly impact pass-through businesses, but could affect corporate rates and revenue neutrality. This appendix provides methodology for calculating effective tax rates and base-broadening provisions affecting savings and investment. The relationship between pre-tax return (r) and after-tax discount rate (R) for corporate depreciable investments is derived from the standard user cost formula. The formula includes variables such as corporate tax rate (u), economic depreciation rate (d), and present discounted value of tax depreciation deductions (z). For unincorporated businesses taxed at an effective statutory tax rate (t), the pre-tax return formula includes variables like effective tax rate on capital gains and dividends (v). The discount rates differ between corporate and noncorporate firms due to these assumptions. The discount rates for noncorporate firms are based on the corporate discount rate adjusted for taxes on capital gains and dividends. Special tax rates apply to shares, taking into account earnings not subject to tax in the economy. The effective tax rate is influenced by statutory rates, cost recovery speed, and credits. The tax rate equals the statutory rate without the production activities deduction when cost recovery equals economic depreciation. The formula is applied to obtain firm-level tax rates in Table 4 and subsequent calculations in the text. To calculate the effect on debt-financed investment, the firm's discount rate is adjusted to include debt finance. Data on Assets and Depreciation is used to provide overall effective tax rates for different types of assets. The pre-tax returns for 32 types of assets are estimated and weighted by asset share to determine an overall pre-tax return. The estimates cover equipment, structures, and intangible assets used in business, excluding land and inventories. Assets are categorized into corporate or noncorporate sectors, with values and economic depreciation rates listed in Table A-1. The value of z depends on the tax life and depreciation method used. The report provides alternative tax lives and depreciation methods for mining structures, with costs expensed through various methods. Data on rates of return, inflation rate, and tax rates are also needed. The equity rate of return is set at 7%, nominal interest rate at 7.5%, and inflation rate at 2%. The estimated statutory tax rates for corporate income are 34.14%, slightly reduced by the production activities deduction. Unincorporated business income has an estimated statutory tax rate of 27%. The estimated tax rates for unincorporated business income, including the production activities deduction, are 26.74%, 26.87%, and 26.56%, with an overall rate of 26.83%. Marginal rates for interest, dividends, and capital gains are 22%, 14.6%, and 15.4% respectively. A significant portion of interest and dividends paid are not reported on individual tax returns. The share of dividends and capital gains, at 19% and 25%, is slightly lower but similar to past rates. This is mainly due to a large portion of assets in pension, retirement, and insurance plans. Additionally, half of privately held capital gains are assumed to be untaxed until death."
