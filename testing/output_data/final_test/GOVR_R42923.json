    "content": "The electric power industry in the United States is undergoing transformation due to aging infrastructure and uncertainties around modernizing the grid. Issues of transmission, reliability, cybersecurity threats, renewable energy, and low carbon sources are key concerns. Congress will need to address policy issues related to the industry's modernization. Electric power generation in the United States is dominated by combustible fuels like coal and natural gas, biomass, and nuclear power. Other sources include wind turbines, solar power, geothermal energy, and hydropower. Electricity must be used immediately as it is produced due to storage limitations. Originally, utility systems were not linked, but with increased demand, sharing became necessary. The increased electricity demand led to the need for sharing generation resources, requiring an interconnection of separate company systems. This resulted in three major interconnections in the US - the Eastern and Western interconnections, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. These interconnections include reliability regions and balancing authorities that integrate resource plans and maintain load-interchange generation balance. The grid connects publicly and privately owned electric utility and power companies across different states and regions. Congress passed the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to regulate this interconnected system. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 introduced competition into wholesale power markets in the US, transitioning the electric power industry from regulated monopolies to competitive markets for power generation. Competitive markets largely determine power prices in regions with restructured electricity industries. In competitive markets, power prices are set through auctions in regional transmission organizations (RTOs) or independent system operators (ISOs). Wholesale power rates are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and include components for energy, capacity, transmission, ancillary services, operating reserves, and system costs. Non-RTO transmission and distribution costs are added for end-use customers. FERC oversees wholesale power markets while distribution functions are regulated separately. The distribution function of the electric power business in the United States is regulated by state government agencies. Power generation technology choices are influenced by fuel costs, with coal, natural gas, and nuclear power being the main sources. The average age of power plants is over 30 years, with a life expectancy of about 40 years. Older plants are less efficient and may be upgraded or retired as they age. The cost of upgrading older power plants to meet new environmental regulations, along with increasing operations and maintenance expenses, often leads to retirement decisions. Electric power generation accounts for a significant portion of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Growing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs from burning fossil fuels are prompting utilities and energy providers to shift towards renewable energy technologies. Hydropower makes up 8% of U.S. electric power generation, with other renewables accounting for 4%. These technologies harness the power of the sun, wind, water, and earth's heat to produce electricity on a large scale with fewer environmental consequences compared to fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources offer inexpensive, limitless electricity with minimal environmental impact. Energy storage technologies can boost renewable energy deployment. State governments lead in promoting renewable energy through Renewable Portfolio Standards. Some states have provisions expiring soon. Electricity is viewed as a commodity bought and sold in competitive markets, with various products and services facilitating transactions. The California energy crisis highlighted market manipulation risks. Enron and its affiliates were found liable for market manipulation schemes, ordered to disgorge $1.6 billion in unjust profits. FERC investigates energy market manipulation, resulting in civil penalties and disgorgement of profits. Natural gas production increase leads to a shift in power generation from coal to natural gas, with electricity generation from natural gas equaling coal for the first time in history in April 2012. The electricity generation mix is shifting from coal to natural gas and renewable technologies. Coal's share is projected to decline as natural gas prices have dropped significantly due to increased domestic production. Fuel prices and economic growth are key factors influencing the future electricity generation mix. The electric utility industry values diversity in fuel choice. The electric utility industry values fuel diversity to avoid vulnerability to price and supply volatility. Coal vs. natural gas power generation choice is influenced by market economics. Coal is expected to remain a key part of electricity generation in the US beyond 2030. Increased availability of natural gas may lead to more distributed generation. Proposed amendment to require electric utilities to obtain a percentage of electric energy from renewable sources starting in 2015. The bill proposed requiring electric utilities in most states to obtain a minimum of 84% of their electric energy from clean sources by 2035 and beyond. It also included provisions for a federal clean energy credit trading program and penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, the bill aimed to establish a state energy efficiency funding program. Introduced in 2012, the bill would have amended the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The bill proposed a federal combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard, requiring each retail electric supplier to submit federal renewable electricity credits and annual electricity savings to FERC. It also allowed states to request an increase in the proportion of electricity savings towards compliance. The bill proposed a federal combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard, requiring each retail electric supplier to submit federal renewable electricity credits and annual electricity savings to FERC. It also allowed states to set rates for the sale of electricity from renewable energy sources. Introduced in 2012, the bill would have prescribed penalties for noncompliance and terminated in 2041. The electric transmission and distribution system components are aging, with power transformers averaging over 40 years old and 70% of transmission lines being 25 years or older. The grid is evolving with changes in federal law, regulatory changes, and the adoption of newer components like the Smart Grid. The grid is evolving into a national interconnected system to accommodate massive transfers of electrical energy. Damage from storms to transmission systems is increasing, but undergrounding lines may not always be the best solution due to cost and repair time. Upgrading the nation's transmission and ensuring grid security are top priorities for the federal government, with cybersecurity and physical security remaining key issues. The Smart Grid's IT systems enhance power flow control and efficiency but also increase vulnerability to cyber attacks. Safeguarding against physical attacks on transformers and substations is a concern. Protection from geomagnetic disturbances and storm damage to utility systems are key issues for grid security. The recent damage from Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey highlights the fragility of the power system and the need for modernization. Data shows that storm-related outages cost the U.S. economy between $20 billion and $55 billion annually. Legislation is being proposed to enhance cybersecurity, create jobs, and protect sensitive information. The legislation introduced on January 25, 2011 aims to enhance cybersecurity, promote investments in the American IT sector, prevent identity theft, and protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks. It also focuses on improving government and private sector capabilities to assess and respond to cyber risks. The legislation introduced on February 11, 2011 allows FERC to order emergency measures to protect the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure in response to an imminent grid security threat. It also requires consultation with Canada and Mexico, implementation procedures, cost recovery measures, and mandates protection measures against vulnerabilities for owners, operators, or users of the bulk-power system. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and resources related to power outages, electric system resiliency, electricity transmission cost allocation, federal government's role in electric transmission facility siting, smart grid cybersecurity, and the economic impact of electricity infrastructure investment trends. It also mentions guidelines for smart grid cybersecurity and the future of the electric grid. The burning of coal and other fossil fuels for electricity production has environmental consequences, contributing to global climate change. The EPA has been directed by Congress to limit emissions from fossil fuel use to reduce health and environmental impacts. New regulations are being developed by the EPA to impose stricter requirements on coal-fired power plants. The EPA has implemented various rules to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, including the Utility MACT rule for mercury reduction. New regulations for greenhouse gas emissions are also being developed, with a focus on retiring older coal-burning power plants. The electric power industry is concerned about new environmental regulations impacting the retirement of older coal-burning power plants. These regulations are seen as unrealistic and could affect reliability. Some in the industry believe these concerns are exaggerated. The regulations prohibit the use of funds for a cap-and-trade program or any requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources. The bill defines a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases and prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from issuing regulations impacting coal mine employment until 2013. Introduced in February 2011. The bill prohibits regulations impacting coal mine employment and restricts the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. It also excludes greenhouse gases from the definition of \"air pollutant\" for this purpose and repeals several federal rules and EPA regulations. Introduced in February 2011. The bill introduced in November 2011 aims to repeal federal rules and EPA regulatory actions related to addressing climate change. The Regulatory Assistance Project released a report in July 2012 on reliable and affordable environmental compliance."
