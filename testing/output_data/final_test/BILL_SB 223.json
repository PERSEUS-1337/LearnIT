    "title": "SB 223",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta's importance but notes the threat posed by water hyacinth. The Division of Boating and Waterways is responsible for controlling this invasive plant with pesticides, but in 2012, permits were not obtained on time, causing delays in spraying. The Division of Boating and Waterways is responsible for controlling water hyacinth in the Delta. An advisory committee is needed to monitor their activities for transparency and accountability. Amendments to the Harbors and Navigation Code are proposed for better management of invasive aquatic plants. The Legislature acknowledges the excessive growth of water hyacinth, Brazilian elodea, and South American spongeplant in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun Marsh, causing navigation obstructions, recreational use impairments, and potential damage to manmade facilities and ecosystems. Collaboration with US agencies is necessary for an aggressive control program. The excessive growth of Brazilian elodea and South American spongeplant in the Delta, tributaries, and Suisun Marsh is causing issues. The department is designated as the lead agency for controlling water hyacinth, Brazilian elodea, and South American spongeplant in the Delta, its tributaries, and the Suisun Marsh. Various agencies are authorized to cooperate and provide resources for this purpose. The Department of Fish and Game will allocate up to $5,000 per year from the Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund for implementing control programs in Rock Slough. An advisory committee will be established to oversee the management and eradication of invasive aquatic plants in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and its tributaries. The advisory and oversight committee for managing invasive aquatic plants in the Delta will have representatives from various interests like agriculture, recreational boating, and wildlife conservation. They will meet twice a year to provide findings and recommendations to the division for public access on their website. The act is an urgency statute to address invasive aquatic plants in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, its tributaries, and the Suisun Marsh. It will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute enacted before that date."
