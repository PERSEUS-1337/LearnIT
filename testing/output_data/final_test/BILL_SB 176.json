    "title": "SB 176",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1347 of the Penal Code is amended to provide the court with discretion to use alternative procedures to protect the rights of a child witness, defendant, and judicial process. The court must balance defendant's rights with the need to safeguard the child witness and maintain truthfinding integrity. This discretion is to be used selectively based on compelling evidence in individual cases. In criminal proceedings, the court can order testimony of a minor 13 years or younger to be taken in another place via closed-circuit television if it involves sexual offenses or violent felonies. In criminal proceedings, a minor 13 years or younger can testify via closed-circuit television if they are a victim of specified felony offenses or if their testimony in the defendant's presence would cause serious emotional distress. The defendant used a deadly weapon, threatened serious bodily harm or family separation, inflicted great bodily injury, or disrupted the minor's testimony during the trial. The court considers various factors when determining the need for a special procedure for a minor's testimony, such as age, relationship with the defendant, disabilities, and nature of the acts charged. The minor's refusal to testify alone is not enough evidence. Closed-circuit television must accurately convey the minor's image and demeanor to the court. If the court orders closed-circuit television for a minor witness, two-way closed-circuit television is preferred. However, if factors impact the minor significantly, one-way closed-circuit television may be used. The prosecution must give the defendant at least 30 days' notice before seeking one-way closed-circuit television. Hearings on such motions are conducted without the jury present. In determining the merits of the motion, the court will not force the minor to testify or deny the motion based on the minor not testifying, regardless of Evidence Code Section 804 or any other law. The court may question a minor in chambers to determine if their impact is substantial enough to require the use of closed-circuit television for testimony, with the support person, prosecutor, and defense counsel present. The defendant or defendants are not allowed to be present, and the prosecutor and defense counsel cannot examine the minor. Defense counsel can submit questions to the court beforehand and consult with the defendant before the session concludes. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, it must provide reasons on record, instruct the jury not to draw inferences from the use of closed-circuit television, and prohibit comments on the procedure during the trial. Instruct the support witness not to influence the testimony of the minor. A video recording of the examination of the minor must be made and preserved, in addition to a stenographic record. The recording will be available for viewing by the prosecuting attorney, defendant, and their attorney, and will be destroyed after five years unless an appeal is filed. The court may issue a protective order to safeguard the witness's privacy. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, only specific individuals are allowed to be present, including the minor, a support person, a nonuniformed bailiff, necessary technicians, and a court-appointed representative. Video recording devices must capture the minor's testimony and the support person separately. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, the minor must meet with the judge, prosecutor, and defense counsel in chambers along with a support person. This meeting is to explain the court process to the child and establish rapport for later questioning via closed-circuit television. No discussion of the defendant or case facts is allowed during this meeting. When a court orders a minor's testimony to be taken outside the courtroom, the minor can be brought into the courtroom for specific purposes. The examination is conducted under oath, allowing the defendant to see and hear the minor witness. The cost of using closed-circuit television for testimony is covered by the court. Defendants are allowed to have legal representation during the testimony."
