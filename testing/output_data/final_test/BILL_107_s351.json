    "content": "The \"Mercury Reduction Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Congress finds that mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that bioaccumulates in the environment, posing a significant public health threat in many States. 40 States have issued fish advisories due to mercury contamination, and over 60,000 children are born each year at risk for adverse effects from methyl mercury exposure. Wildlife consuming fish with elevated mercury levels also suffer serious harm. Mercury fever thermometers contribute significant mercury waste annually, posing risks to wildlife and human health. New England Governors aim to eliminate anthropogenic mercury discharge, highlighting the dangers of mercury exposure from broken thermometers. Just 1 gram of mercury from a thermometer can contaminate all fish in a 20-acre lake. Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include a new section on mercury. Effective 180 days after enactment, the sale of mercury fever thermometers to consumers is prohibited without a prescription. Manufacturers must provide clear instructions on handling and cleanup. The Administrator will grant funds for a national program to collect liquid mercury thermometers from households. The Task Force on Mercury is established to manage the collection of liquid mercury fever thermometers from households and exchange them for mercury-free alternatives. The Task Force consists of 5 members, including the Administrator, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense. The Task Force on Mercury consists of 5 members, including the Secretary of Energy and the Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Members are appointed within 30 days of enactment for the life of the Task Force, with vacancies not affecting its powers. The Task Force on Mercury, consisting of 5 members, must hold an initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. Meetings are called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members constitute a quorum for decision-making. The Task Force on Mercury, with a minimum number of members required for hearings, must submit a report to Congress within a year of its initial meeting, containing recommendations on managing surplus mercury from various sources. The Task Force on Mercury must submit a report to Congress with recommendations on managing surplus mercury from government, industrial, and other sources. This includes testing technologies for mercury sequestration and ensuring safe storage to prevent environmental release. The Task Force on Mercury must submit a report to Congress with recommendations on managing surplus mercury from various sources, including reducing the total quantity of mercury produced, used, and released globally through agreements or other means. The Task Force on Mercury recommends reducing mercury use in products, mining, and manufacturing by substituting with safer alternatives. Essential mercury needs can be met using existing stockpiles instead of virgin mercury. The Task Force on Mercury may consult with various stakeholders and hold hearings to gather information necessary for carrying out its recommendations. It can also obtain information directly from federal agencies to fulfill its mandate. The Task Force may request information from federal agencies, use postal services, accept gifts, and members serve without additional compensation. The Task Force members may receive additional compensation for their services and travel expenses while performing their duties.

Additionally, they must identify potential mercury stabilization methods. The Task Force, in consultation with the Administrator, must manage collected mercury to prevent environmental release and provide analysis for mercury collection and management activities. This includes identifying potential mercury stabilization technologies and long-term storage measures to minimize mercury release into the environment. Additionally, the section does not limit states from imposing additional requirements or diminish obligations under other Federal laws. Authorization of $20,000,000 is provided for research, development, and demonstration of these technologies and measures. The Task Force, in consultation with the Administrator, must manage collected mercury to prevent environmental release and provide analysis for mercury collection and management activities. Authorization of $20,000,000 is provided for research, development, and demonstration of technologies and measures. Additionally, there is authorized to be appropriated $1,000,000 for safe management and storage under subsection (c)(2)(A).
