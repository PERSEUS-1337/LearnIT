    "content": "The history of federal legislation impacting banking, securities, capital markets, and financial services can be divided into three periods: Civil War to New Deal; New Deal Era; and 1956 to present. Federal oversight increased in response to economic turmoil, such as the Civil War, Panic of 1907, Great Depression, and savings and loan crisis. This legislation forms the foundation of today's financial services industry. The New Deal era legislation established a rigid separation of banking, securities, and insurance businesses, creating the federal financial safety net and deposit insurance. Recent legislation has allowed for the reintegration of these functions, promoting competition across political boundaries and in nontraditional businesses. This has led to a more uniform structure of U.S. financial providers through deregulation of controls over geography, pricing, and products in the last two decades. The growing complexities of financial transactions have led to federal regulation of customer financial information to protect privacy, deter criminal activity, and ensure national security. The laws cited are chosen for their historical significance, present importance in regulating financial services businesses, or recent enactment. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 21-215b establishes the national banking system and regulates federally chartered banks under the Comptroller of the Currency within the U.S. Treasury Department. The National Bank Act of 1863 and 1864 was enacted during the Civil War to assist the government in paying debts, charter banks, and provide a uniform national currency. The legislation grants the federal government authority to charter and regulate national banks through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 established the Federal Reserve System to prevent financial panics and improve the national payments system. It includes the Board of Governors, 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee. The Fed issues national currency, provides services to member banks, and regulates state banks, financial conglomerates, and international banking organizations. The Federal Home Loan Bank System was established in 1932 to support home mortgage lending for thrift institutions. The system was regulated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board until it was abolished in 1989 under FIRREA. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, established in 1932 to support home mortgage lending for thrift institutions, is now subject to the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Oversight Board. Federal savings and loan associations were originally chartered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and are now regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Banking Act of 1933, also known as the Glass-Steagall Act, included amendments to the Federal Reserve Act and the National Bank Act. It created the Federal Open Market Committee and enforced a separation between banking and securities businesses. Additionally, it allowed national banks to open branches and initiated federal deposit insurance for banks. The Reserve Act of 1950 authorized the FDIC to provide insurance for deposits in banks, protecting depositors and the economy from bank failures. The FDIC is the primary regulator of federally insured state-chartered banks, setting safety standards. The Securities Act of 1933 aims to provide investors with information about securities offered for public. The Securities Act of 1933 aims to provide investors with financial information about securities offered for public sale and prohibits fraudulent acts in the sale of securities. It requires publicly traded companies to provide prospectus disclosures for evaluation by investors. The act is enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) since 1934. The Securities Act of 1934 expanded federal regulation of securities markets, requiring companies with listed securities to file registration applications with the SEC. It defined SEC's authority over national exchanges, insider trading, and corporate governance rules. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 abolished the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and established deposit insurance for savings and loan associations through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The legislation from 1934 provides a system for the chartering and supervision of federal credit unions, currently regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) regulates credit unions, overseeing deposit insurance and providing oversight of a Central Liquidity Facility. Credit unions have evolved from small, state-chartered institutions to larger, safer entities with increased powers under the Federal Credit Union Act. They remain cooperative in nature, not subject to corporate taxes, and are limited in some services and customer bases. The Securities and Exchange Commission was given authority in 1940 to regulate investment companies like mutual funds and investment trusts. This legislation required companies to register their securities, disclose policies, maintain capital, and avoid insider transactions. It also regulated investment advisors who provide advice on securities. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 assigns regulation of insurance to states, with exceptions for federal laws related to insurance. It was enacted in response to a Supreme Court ruling that insurance is commerce subject to federal regulation. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, amended in 1970, regulates companies controlling banks to prevent certain non-banking activities and ensure safety and competitiveness. It served as a model for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, providing centralized regulation over the mixing of banking and commerce. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, along with the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, require reports and records of transactions involving cash, negotiable instruments, or foreign currency. Violations of the regulations are subject to civil and criminal penalties. This legislation regulates the credit reporting industry by prescribing standards for information collected by businesses used to determine eligibility for credit, insurance, or employment. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates the credit reporting industry by setting standards for information used to determine eligibility for credit, insurance, or employment. It imposes accuracy requirements, limits dissemination purposes, grants access rights, and includes civil penalties for violations. Enforcement authority lies with the Federal Trade Commission, with other federal agencies also authorized to enforce the act. Consumer reporting agencies and users of information failing to comply may face civil liability. The Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act of 1991 regulates foreign bank operations in the United States, allowing federal or state chartering of foreign bank branches and agencies. It restructured the deposit insurance system and transformed the regulatory structure of savings associations. The Bank System legislation, under P.L. 102-242 and P.L. 103-328, expanded enforcement authority for federal banking regulators, enforced capital standards on depository institutions, and provided greater federal supervision of state banks and savings associations. It also allowed bank holding companies to acquire banks outside their home states. The legislation under P.L. 106-102 allows bank holding companies to acquire banks outside their home states and eliminates barriers to affiliation among financial service providers. It also sets regulations for securities and insurance activities by banking organizations. The legislation under P.L. 107-56 modifies membership criteria and capital structure of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, establishes disclosure requirements for ATM fees, mandates privacy policies for financial institutions, and includes various banking regulatory reforms to prevent illegal fund movements. The legislation under P.L. 107-204 aims to combat money laundering by requiring financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs, imposing standards on informal money transmitting businesses, amending criminal statutes, and enhancing cooperation between financial institutions and government agencies. It increases federal scrutiny of financial transactions and extends it to previously unexamined domestic and international money transmitters. The legislation under P.L. 107-204 aims to combat money laundering by requiring financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs and imposing standards on informal money transmitting businesses. It also enhances cooperation between financial institutions and government agencies, increasing federal scrutiny of financial transactions. The legislation establishes the Public Company Oversight Board to regulate public accounting firms auditing publicly traded companies and sets corporate responsibility standards for CEOs and CFOs to certify company reports. The legislation also authorizes the SEC to issue rules on various matters related to audits and securities laws. The legislation under P.L. 108-100 addresses violations of securities laws, insider trading restrictions, enhanced financial disclosure requirements, increased SEC appropriations, whistle blower protections, new federal criminal laws, and an extension of the statute of limitations for private securities fraud actions. Additionally, the Check 21 Act aims to improve efficiency in electronic processing of checks and check truncation. The Check 21 Act allows for the use of substitute checks in electronic processing of checks, ensuring accuracy and legal equivalence to the original check. It includes indemnity and expedited recredit procedures to protect substitute check recipients. The Check 21 Act, P.L. 108-159, includes indemnity and expedited recredit procedures to protect substitute check recipients. It amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to improve accuracy and transparency in credit reporting, prevent identity theft, and enhance consumer rights in cases of identity theft and inaccurate information. State laws on sharing consumer report information among affiliated companies are preempted under this legislation. The legislation P.L. 109-172 merges insurance funds and increases deposit insurance coverage. It also requires companies to provide notice and opt-out options for sharing consumer information for marketing purposes. Per-participant coverage is provided for employee benefit plan accounts. The legislation requires the FDIC to set the Designated Reserve Ratio between 1.15% to 1.50% and declare dividends from the DIF when the reserve ratio reaches 1.35% at the end of the year. FDIC has the discretion to price deposit insurance based on risk for all insured institutions regardless of the reserve ratio level."
