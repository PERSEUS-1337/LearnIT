Congress finds that women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering face underrepresentation and barriers in education and employment. Progress has been made, but there is still room for improvement in increasing participation and opportunities in these fields. Women in science and engineering face challenges such as underrepresentation in the labor force, lower likelihood of full-time employment in their field, and disparities in salary compared to men. Additionally, women are more likely to be employed at 2-year institutions and teach part-time. Minority groups like Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans are also underrepresented in graduate science and engineering programs. Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans make up 23% of the US population but only 6% are scientists or engineers. Women face hurdles in accessing industrial jobs in science and engineering, including limited access and common recruitment practices that overlook them. Paternalism, sexual harassment, and discrimination are challenges women often encounter in these fields. Women in science and engineering face discrimination, lower salaries compared to men, inequitable job assignments, and limited opportunities for advancement into management positions. A commission is proposed to address these issues and eliminate barriers to recruitment. The proposed commission aims to eliminate barriers for women and minorities in science, engineering, and technology fields by promoting workforce diversity, sensitizing employers to the need for recruitment and retention, and encouraging replication of successful programs. A commission called the \"Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology Development\" is established to promote diversity and eliminate barriers in these fields. The Commission will review research and may conduct additional research to identify the representation of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in science, engineering, and technology occupations, assess their readiness for careers and advancement, and examine employer and union practices related to their recruitment, retention, and progression in these fields.

The Commission aims to identify opportunities and barriers for the recruitment, retention, and advancement of underrepresented groups in science, engineering, and technology, and issue recommendations for lawful policies that government, academia, and private industry can follow. The Commission aims to identify opportunities and barriers for the recruitment, retention, and advancement of underrepresented groups in science, engineering, and technology. This includes identifying disincentives for women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in graduate education and undergraduate programs, as well as reasons for their disproportionate departure from these fields before completing their education. The Commission aims to assess the implementation of recommendations for women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in science and technology fields. This includes compiling federally funded reports on encouraging and retaining these groups in the workforce.
