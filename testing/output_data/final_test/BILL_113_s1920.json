The Act includes a permanent extension of a tax credit against the alternative minimum tax and a 5-year carryback for research credits of small businesses, allowing for adjustments in the application of certain paragraphs for eligible small businesses. The amendment extends the taxable years from 20 to 24 in subparagraph (B). Effective starting from taxable years after December 31, 2013. SEC. 5 amends section 41(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to allow election on an amended return. The amendment is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. SEC. 6 addresses the treatment of research credit for certain startup companies. Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow qualified small businesses to elect to treat the payroll tax credit portion as a credit under section 3111(f) if it does not exceed $250,000. The term \"qualified small business\" is defined for this purpose. The definition of a \"business\" for tax purposes includes corporations, partnerships, or S corporations with gross receipts under $5,000,000 and no prior gross receipts in the preceding 5-taxable-year period. It also includes individuals meeting specific criteria. The term \"business\" for tax purposes includes entities with gross receipts under $5,000,000 and no prior gross receipts in the preceding 5-taxable-year period. An election under this subsection must be made at the entity level for partnerships or S corporations. The $250,000 limitation for gross receipts applies to entities within a controlled group of corporations or under common control. An election under this subsection is irrevocable without the Secretary's consent and cannot be made if the taxpayer has made the same election for 5 or more preceding taxable years. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to prevent avoidance of tax credit purposes, minimize burdens for start-up companies, and recapture credits in case of adjustments. The IRS will require amended returns for adjustments in subsection (a) and a new paragraph is added to Section 280C(c) regarding small business credits. A new subsection is added to allow a credit for research expenditures against FICA taxes for qualified small businesses. Qualified small businesses can receive a credit against payroll taxes for research expenditures under section 41(a). Unused credits can be carried over to the next quarter. The credit allowed for research expenditures under section 41(a) shall be reduced for preceding calendar quarters. Controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer, with each member receiving a proportionate share of the credit based on qualified research expenses. Definitions are provided for this subsection. The term \"applicable calendar quarter\" is defined as the first quarter after filing a return for the taxable year in which the payroll tax credit portion of the research credit is determined, with succeeding quarters also considered applicable. The paragraph discusses the appropriation of funds to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund in response to revenue reductions due to amendments made. Amounts appropriated will be transferred from the general fund to replicate transfers that would have occurred if the amendments had not been enacted. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2013."
