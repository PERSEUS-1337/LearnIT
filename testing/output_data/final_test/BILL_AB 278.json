    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34872 of the Government Code is amended to specify the number of legislative districts and the method of electing members of the legislative body. Additionally, a new section 34876.5 is added, outlining the ballot language for voters to decide on the election process for the legislative body and the Mayor of the City. The proposition of altering legislative districts shall be printed on the ballots with options for voters to choose \"Yes\" or \"No.\" If the majority vote in favor, members of the legislative body will be elected based on the approved district boundaries in the next election. The proposition to alter legislative districts will be on the ballot for voters to choose \"Yes\" or \"No.\" After approval, the legislative body will prepare a map of district boundaries for the next election, seeking public input. If a legislative body is transitioning from at-large to district-based elections, public hearings must be held as per the Elections Code. Adjustments to district boundaries also require public hearings. If a majority vote favors incorporation and district-based council elections, specific procedures apply. Before the first day of candidate nominations for the next municipal election, the legislative body must establish district boundaries that are nearly equal in population and comply with the Voting Rights Act. Factors like topography, geography, and community interests can be considered. The terms of office for members elected with the lowest votes expire after the next election, with members elected by district holding office for four years. The terms of office for members elected with the highest vote expire after the second regular municipal election following incorporation. Members are elected by district in odd-numbered districts and serve four-year terms. The vote on future city council elections being by district or at large does not prevent future measures on the issue. Section 34886 of the Government Code is amended. Section 34886 of the Government Code is amended to allow a city's legislative body to adopt an ordinance for district-based elections without voter approval, in alignment with the California Voting Rights Act of 2001."
