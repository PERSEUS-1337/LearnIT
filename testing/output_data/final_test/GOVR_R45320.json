    "content": "In 1971, Congress enacted FECA, requiring campaign finance reporting. In 1974, amendments were made after the Watergate scandal, implementing limits on contributions and creating the FEC. The Supreme Court ruling in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976 invalidated spending limits and the original FEC structure. Congress amended FECA in 1976 and 1979 to restructure the FEC and revise contribution limits. In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) was enacted. In 2002, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), which prohibited corporate and labor union spending on certain advertisements before elections and restricted the raising and spending of unregulated \"soft money\" in federal elections. Since 2003, the Supreme Court has invalidated several BCRA provisions, including a long-standing prohibition on independent expenditures funded by corporations and labor unions. The Court has overturned these provisions as unconstitutional violations of free speech guarantees. The remaining federal campaign finance laws were not originally enacted by Congress as a comprehensive regulatory policy. The Supreme Court established the framework for evaluating the constitutionality of campaign finance regulation, distinguishing between contribution limits and expenditure limits. Contribution limits are subject to a more lenient standard of review, while expenditure limits face stricter scrutiny due to their impact on political expression and association under the First Amendment. The Court determined that contribution limits do not heavily restrict speech but still allow for symbolic support of candidates. Reasonable limits enable independent political expression and volunteering on campaigns. The Court emphasized that the amount of the limit is crucial, as excessively low limits could hinder candidates from effectively communicating their message. The Buckley Court concluded that expenditure limits, unlike contribution limits, impose a substantial restraint on speech and association, requiring strict scrutiny. Expenditure limits restrict the amount of money a candidate can spend on communications, reducing issues discussed and audience size, but are not justified by a compelling governmental interest due to the lack of direct benefit to the candidate's campaign fund. The Buckley Court rejected expenditure limits as they restrict speech and association, without benefiting a candidate's campaign fund. The Court emphasized that quid pro quo corruption, involving a direct exchange of an official act for money, is the key concern in campaign finance. The Court also highlighted that self-financing candidates reduce their dependence on outside contributions, lowering the risk of corruption. The Supreme Court, in McCutcheon, stated that only quid pro quo corruption justifies limits on contributions and expenditures. The Court emphasized that efforts to reduce influence over elected officials do not constitute a permissible governmental interest. The Court's campaign finance jurisprudence has evolved over the years, focusing on the concept of corruption and rejecting other governmental objectives like leveling the playing field or equalizing financial resources. Campaign finance jurisprudence has evolved over the years, with courts generally upholding limits on contributions to protect elections from corruption. FECA defines contributions broadly as anything of value given to influence federal elections. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) defines contributions as anything of value given to influence federal elections, including loans made to campaign committees. However, loans from banks made in the ordinary course of business are exempt from this definition. Personal loans to campaigns are considered contributions, with the outstanding balance treated as such. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) defines contributions as anything of value given to influence federal elections, including loans made to campaign committees. The amount of an unpaid loan, along with other contributions to a candidate, cannot exceed the contribution limit. Once a loan is repaid, it is no longer considered a contribution. FECA sets specific limits on individual contributions to candidates, adjusted for inflation in odd-numbered years. In the 2017-2018 cycle, individuals could contribute up to $2,700 per election to a candidate. Buckley upheld FECA base limits on money contributions. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of FECA base limits on money contributions, applying principles from Buckley to determine reasonable limits. In Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, contribution limits were upheld for state office candidates, while in Randall v. Sorrell, a Vermont law imposing contribution limits was invalidated. The Court emphasized that limits must serve a significant interest but do not need to be overly precise. In Randall v. Sorrell, contribution limits in Vermont were found to violate First Amendment free-speech guarantees as they were deemed too low and not narrowly tailored, restricting candidates, parties, and citizens from participating effectively in campaigns. In McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court ruled that aggregate contribution limits are unconstitutional under the First Amendment, as they restrict political expression and association rights without preventing corruption. The Supreme Court upheld a $25,000 federal aggregate contribution limit as a means to prevent circumvention of base limits. However, in McCutcheon v. FEC, the Court invalidated biennial limits on aggregate contributions, which restricted individuals from contributing large amounts to candidates and political committees. In McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court determined that FECA's aggregate contribution limits did not align with the government's objective and could not be upheld, even under a lenient standard of review. The Court distinguished this case from Buckley v. Valeo, stating that the legal backdrop and statutory regime were different. In McCutcheon v. FEC, the Supreme Court found that aggregate contribution limits violated free speech and association rights, unlike in Buckley v. Valeo. The Court suggested additional safeguards Congress could enact to prevent circumvention of base contribution limits. The Supreme Court in McCutcheon v. FEC stated that preventing quid pro quo corruption is the only legitimate reason for restricting campaign contributions. The decision did not establish a stricter standard for contribution limits but emphasized that only quid pro quo corruption or its appearance is a compelling governmental interest. Additionally, FECA places restrictions on the types of contributions donors can make, such as prohibiting contributions made through a conduit. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits contributions made through a conduit, where one person donates in the name of another. This prevents individuals from bypassing contribution limits by giving money to someone else to donate to the same candidate. FECA also prohibits corporations from reimbursing employees for campaign contributions. Additionally, candidates are not allowed to convert campaign funds for personal use. Penalties are in place for knowing and willful violations of these provisions. Candidates are prohibited from converting campaign funds for personal use, except for expenses that would exist irrespective of their campaign or duties as a federal officeholder. This includes home expenses, clothing, car costs, vacations, food, tuition, entertainment, and health club fees. In 2018, the FEC ruled that child care expenses related to campaign activity can be paid with campaign funds. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) distinguishes between independent expenditures and coordinated communications. Independent expenditures are made without coordination with a candidate or party, while coordinated communications involve cooperation with a candidate or party and are treated as in-kind contributions subject to FECA limits and restrictions. The Supreme Court has ruled that independent expenditures, made without coordination with a candidate, are protected by the First Amendment. The Court emphasized that without coordination, the value of an expenditure is decreased, and there is less risk of improper commitments from the candidate. Therefore, independent expenditures do not raise heightened governmental interests in regulation. The Supreme Court has ruled that independent expenditures, made without coordination with a candidate, are protected by the First Amendment. This allows individuals, political parties, PACs, super PACs, and other organizations to engage in unlimited independent expenditures. Regulations under FECA establish criteria for determining coordination between organizations and candidates. Regulations under FECA establish criteria for determining coordination between organizations and candidates. Specifically, a communication will be deemed coordinated if it meets the three-prong test of payment, content, and conduct. Payment is met if the communication is funded by someone other than the candidate, content addresses the subject and timing of the communication, and conduct involves electioneering communication. The regulations under FECA establish criteria for determining coordination between organizations and candidates, including the three-prong test of payment, content, and conduct for electioneering communication. Conduct standards address interactions between the communication funder and the candidate or party. The FECA regulations specify conduct standards for determining coordination between organizations and candidates, including criteria such as communication creation at the request or suggestion of a candidate, material involvement of the candidate in decisions, substantial discussions between the funder and candidate, use of a common vendor, or conveyance of information by a former employee. Safe harbors are also outlined to exempt certain communications from being considered coordinated. Several \"safe harbors\" exempt communications from being deemed coordinated, including endorsements and solicitations by federal candidates for other candidates, as long as the communication does not promote, support, attack, or oppose the endorsing candidate or another candidate for the same office. Firewalls can also prevent coordination if certain requirements are met, such as prohibiting the flow of information between employees or consultants working for the funder of the communication and those working for the candidate or opponent. The firewall must be described in a written policy distributed to relevant employees, consultants, and clients. Publicly available information exempts certain communication standards unless made at the request of a candidate or party. Legislative inquiries about positions on issues do not meet conduct standards. The Supreme Court has invalidated BCRA provisions on aggregate contribution limits and limits on contributions opponents. The Court invalidated BCRA provisions on contribution limits for self-financing opponents and minors, as well as limits on contributions to groups making independent expenditures. The ruling in Davis v. FEC established that staggered contribution limits for self-financing candidates violate the First Amendment. This included the \"Millionaire's Amendment\" under BCRA. The invalidated provision of law under BCRA, known as the \"Millionaire's Amendment,\" set increased individual contribution limits for candidates who spent over $350,000 of personal funds during an election cycle. The limits were tripled for House candidates and varied for Senate candidates based on opponent's personal campaign funding. The increased limits were removed once spending parity was achieved between candidates. The Court rejected limits on a candidate's personal funds for campaign speech, stating it reduces reliance on outside contributions and prevents corruption. The Millionaire's Amendment was found to infringe on free political expression by imposing a choice on candidates. The Court invalidated a provision in the BCRA that imposed discriminatory contribution limits on candidates, warning that using election law to influence voters' choices is a dangerous business. Candidates have different strengths that should be allowed to affect an election, and leveling electoral opportunities may infringe on free political expression. The Supreme Court invalidated a BCRA provision prohibiting individuals age 17 or younger from making contributions to candidates and political parties, citing First Amendment protection for minors and lack of evidence for corruption by conduit. The Court suggested that existing FECA provisions could deter circumvention of contribution limits. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in 2010 that limits on contributions to groups making independent expenditures are unconstitutional, paving the way for the creation of super PACs. The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United also played a role in this ruling. Various states have adopted more tailored approaches to address the issue of contributions by minors, but the Court did not decide on the validity of these alternatives. The D.C. Circuit in SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Commission ruled that campaign contributions to groups making independent expenditures do not lead to corruption, similar to the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United. The court reasoned that limiting contributions to such groups does not serve an anticorruption interest. The SpeechNow.org court ruled that FECA contribution limits are unconstitutional for groups making independent expenditures, leading to the creation of super PACs. FEC guidance allows tax-exempt corporations to establish super PACs that can accept unlimited contributions from various sources. Federal candidates and officials are subject to FECA when fundraising for super PACs. Federal candidates, officeholders, and party officials are limited to soliciting contributions up to $5,000 from individuals and federal PACs under FECA fundraising restrictions. The Supreme Court's campaign finance jurisprudence provides guidance on constitutional limits for campaign contribution restrictions. The Court has deemed certain FECA provisions unconstitutional, including individual, party, and political committee contribution limits considered unreasonably low, aggregate limits on total contributions, staggered increases in contribution limits for candidates facing self-financing opponents, and a ban on campaign contributions by minors under 17. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the only valid reason for limiting campaign contributions is to prevent quid pro quo corruption. Other policy goals, such as reducing influence over elected officials or equalizing financial resources among candidates, are not sufficient to justify contribution limits. Congress must demonstrate that any limits are narrowly tailored to serve the government's interest in preventing corruption. The Supreme Court has emphasized that contribution limits must be justified to prevent corruption. The government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of such restrictions, with the Court generally upholding them. However, there is a possibility that future cases may subject contribution limits to stricter scrutiny, potentially leading to legislation with enhanced limits facing constitutional challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Montana's contribution limits in Lair v. Motl, citing the government's interest in preventing corruption. The Supreme Court may review cases that could impact contribution limits, providing guidance for legislative options. The Ninth Circuit upheld Montana's contribution limits in Lair v. Motl, citing a risk of quid pro quo corruption in state politics. The petitioners argue that the decision conflicts with Supreme Court precedent on evidence of corruption. They interpret quid pro quo corruption as requiring a clear agreement connecting a gift to an official act. If the Court reviews Lair, it could clarify the definition of corruption in campaign finance law. The Ninth Circuit upheld Montana's contribution limits in Lair v. Motl, citing a risk of quid pro quo corruption in state politics. If the Court decides to review Lair, its ruling could clarify the extent to which the government is required to present evidence of quid pro quo corruption in order to justify contribution limits. In Zimmerman v. City of Austin, the Fifth Circuit affirmed a lower court ruling upholding a base campaign contribution limit of $300 per contributor, per election, adjusted annually for inflation. The Fifth Circuit determined that the City of Austin had shown \"a sufficiently important interest in preventing either actual corruption or its appearance.\" The Fifth Circuit upheld a campaign contribution limit in Zimmerman v. City of Austin, stating that the city had a significant interest in preventing corruption. The petitioner argues that the $350 limit is too severe and lacks evidence of quid pro quo corruption. The Court's ruling in Zimmerman could clarify the burden on Congress to prove that contribution limits serve the government's interest in preventing corruption. Federal campaign finance law includes bans on campaign contributions by corporations, labor unions, federal contractors, and foreign nationals. The Supreme Court invalidated limits on corporate and union independent spending on campaigns. Key Supreme Court holdings may guide the constitutionality of policy options for campaign contribution sources. FECA prohibits corporations and labor unions from making campaign contributions from their own funds. The Supreme Court upheld the ban on corporations making direct campaign contributions from their general treasuries in connection with federal elections, despite Citizens United allowing independent expenditures from general treasuries. In the 2010 landmark decision of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court invalidated two FECA prohibitions on independent electoral spending by corporations and labor unions, citing the need to counter corruption and protect political integrity. This decision allowed corporations and labor unions to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. In the 2010 Citizens United decision, corporations and labor unions can use general funds for independent electoral spending and electioneering communications without needing a PAC. The Court upheld that such expenditures are protected speech, regardless of the speaker being a corporation. The decision overturned previous restrictions on political speech by corporations. The Court in Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce upheld a state law restricting corporate independent expenditures in elections to prevent disproportionate economic power. In contrast, Bellotti struck down a state law prohibiting corporate independent expenditures related to referenda. Citizens United rejected the \"antidistortion interest\" rationale from Austin, stating that independent expenditures, including those by corporations, do not cause corruption. The Supreme Court in Citizens United overturned the decision in Austin and McConnell, ruling that banning corporate expenditures interfered with the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The Court also found that allowing Congress to ban political speech of media corporations would be dangerous and unacceptable. Additionally, the ban on corporations and labor unions using general treasury funds for independent expenditures was struck down. The Supreme Court in Citizens United overturned the ban on corporate expenditures, including the use of funds for electioneering communications. In a previous case, FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), the Court had narrowed the definition of electioneering communications to only include express advocacy or its functional equivalent. Despite this limitation, the Court in Citizens United found both prohibitions to be a violation of the First Amendment as they were considered a \"ban on speech.\" The Supreme Court overturned the ban on corporate expenditures, deeming it a violation of the First Amendment. The Court rejected the argument that allowing corporations to establish PACs mitigated the ban on corporate speech, citing separate associations. The statute had exceptions for corporations to use treasury funds for PACs, but the Court emphasized the onerous reporting requirements associated with PACs. The Court overturned the ban on corporate expenditures, citing First Amendment violations. It highlighted the burdensome reporting requirements of PACs and how they may hinder corporations from effectively communicating their views. Additionally, the Court discussed \"pay-to-play\" laws that restrict federal office candidates from accepting contributions from government contractors to prevent political corruption. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits contractor contributions as a form of political corruption, applying from the start of contract negotiations to the end of contract performance. The ban extends to federal contractor partnerships but allows individual partners to contribute personally. It also includes assets of individuals and sole proprietors who are federal contractors, except for contributions from spouses and employees. In 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors, citing First Amendment and Fifth Amendment protections. The ban applies to contractors making contributions to candidates, parties, and traditional PACs. The federal ban on campaign contributions by federal government contractors is upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals, citing government interests in preventing corruption and maintaining merit-based administration. The ban, in place since 1940, is deemed necessary to prevent pay-to-play infractions and quid pro quo corruption. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal on this ruling in 2016. FECA prohibits foreign nationals from donating or spending money in connection with any U.S. election, including foreign governments, political parties, and citizens, except for dual U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. The law bans foreign nationals from making contributions or donations, directly or indirectly, to a political party or candidate's campaign. Coordination with a candidate's campaign or political party is considered an in-kind contribution. FECA prohibits foreign nationals from donating or spending money in U.S. elections. It also prohibits candidates from soliciting contributions from foreign nationals. Providing substantial assistance in receiving foreign contributions is unlawful. Foreign nationals are prohibited from contributing to U.S. elections and from participating in decision-making processes related to campaign finances. The FEC has provided guidance on compliance with these restrictions, such as allowing U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations to establish PACs as long as they are not financed by the foreign parent company. The Supreme Court affirmed the prohibition on foreign nationals making campaign contributions in 2012. The court ruled that the US has a compelling interest in limiting foreign citizen participation in American democracy to prevent foreign influence over the political process. Foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to participate in US elections. The Supreme Court affirmed the ban on foreign nationals making campaign contributions in 2012, stating that foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to participate in US elections. The district court in Bluman interpreted the ban on independent expenditures to apply only to foreign nationals engaging in express advocacy, allowing them to engage in issue advocacy. The court defined express advocacy as speech or spending that explicitly urges voting for or against a specific candidate. In 2014, the Supreme Court in McCutcheon hinted at a stricter review of contribution limits, potentially leading to the overturning of the ban on corporate contributions. The Court's rejection of the rationale in Citizens United raised the possibility of another basis for overturning the ban in the future. The Court's reliance on state-conferred advantages for corporations in Beaumont may be challenged in future cases. The Supreme Court's rulings in Citizens United and Bluman have implications for the accumulation and distribution of assets by corporations in the political marketplace. While Citizens United invalidated the prohibition on corporations engaging in independent spending, Bluman upheld the ban on foreign nationals donating or spending money in connection with U.S. elections. The Court's decisions suggest that legislation to enhance the ban on foreign influence may withstand a First Amendment challenge if limited to regulating express advocacy or its equivalent. The Supreme Court rulings in Citizens United and Bluman have implications for political spending by corporations and foreign nationals in U.S. elections. Legislation regulating issue advocacy by foreign nationals may face First Amendment challenges. FECA sets forth disclaimer and disclosure requirements for campaign-related communications. FECA requires disclaimers on public political advertising financed by political committees, including candidate committees, and on all public communications advocating for or against a candidate or soliciting contributions. The Act specifies attribution statements for communications and mandates disclosure of who paid for radio and television advertisements by candidate committees. FECA mandates disclaimers on political ads, requiring disclosure of the ad's sponsor and candidate approval. Non-candidate ads must also include a disclaimer stating the sponsor's information and lack of candidate authorization. In political advertisements, disclaimers are required to include the entity paying for the ad and a statement of responsibility. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of these disclaimer requirements in McConnell in 2003, stating it serves the important governmental interest of transparency in campaign financing. The Supreme Court upheld disclaimer and disclosure requirements in campaign financing cases like Citizens United and McConnell, stating they serve the important governmental interest of transparency in campaign financing. These requirements provide the electorate with information, ensure voters are fully informed about who is speaking, and clarify that ads were not financed by candidates or parties. Under FECA, political committees and entities making independent expenditures must disclose contributions over $200, including donor information. Litigation has arisen over these disclosure requirements. FEC is mandated to make reports public within 48 hours of receipt. The FEC is required to make reports of organizations making independent expenditures publicly available within 48 hours of receipt. Organizations must disclose contributions over $200 and file quarterly reports. Additionally, organizations must file reports within 48 hours of spending at least $10,000 on independent expenditures before an election. Before an election, organizations must file a report within 24 hours of spending at least $1,000 on independent expenditures. FEC regulations require electronic filing for organizations spending over $50,000 on independent expenditures. Donor disclosure regulations have been challenged in court regarding the \"purpose requirement\" for donor disclosure. The donor disclosure regulation was challenged in court in August 2018, resulting in a federal district court invalidating the regulation for requiring less disclosure than mandated by the statute. The ruling will now require groups making independent expenditures to disclose more donors. The FEC has not issued interim regulations to comply with the FECA disclosure requirement. The Supreme Court denied a request for a stay, leaving the lower court's decision intact unless successfully appealed. FECA requires organizations making disbursements over $10,000 to disclose information including the corporation's identity, amount of each disbursement over $200, names of candidates, and donors who contributed at least $1,000. Organizations can avoid full donor disclosure by setting up a separate bank account for electioneering communications. FECA requires organizations to file electioneering communication reports when making disbursements over $10,000. An FEC regulation allows disclosure of donors who contribute at least $1,000 specifically for electioneering communications. The regulation on disclosure requirements for electioneering communications has been the subject of ongoing litigation, with the D.C. Circuit upholding the regulation in 2016. The Court has affirmed the constitutionality of disclosure requirements, citing governmental interests in promoting transparency and accountability in the electoral process. The Court has consistently upheld disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, citing governmental interests in promoting transparency and accountability in the electoral process. In Buckley, the Court identified three governmental interests justifying disclosure requirements, including providing the electorate with information on campaign money sources and deterring corruption. The Court upheld the constitutionality of FECA's donor disclosure requirements for independent expenditures, stating that it increases information on candidate support. McConnell rejected a challenge to enhanced disclosure requirements in BCRA, distinguishing between express and issue advocacy. The Court in Buckley distinguished between express advocacy and issue advocacy for statutory construction, not constitutional command. The First Amendment did not require a rigid barrier between the two. Electioneering communications aim to influence elections, so the absence of \"magic words\" of express advocacy doesn't negate the government's interest in disclosure to combat corruption. The McConnell Court found that disclosure requirements in BCRA serve important state interests like providing voters with information and deterring corruption. In Citizens United, the Court upheld FECA's disclosure requirements for electioneering communications. The Court evaluated disclosure requirements for electioneering communications in a political movie and broadcast advertisements, applying \"exacting scrutiny\" to determine a substantial relation to a government interest. In Citizens United, the Court rejected limiting disclosure requirements to express advocacy, upholding FECA's requirements. The Court upheld disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, rejecting limits to express advocacy. It stated that disclosure could be unconstitutional if donors faced threats or harassment. The Court also referenced previous cases like Buckley and Citizens United to support its decision. The Washington statute requires public disclosure of all records, including signatures on referendum petitions, under the First Amendment's exacting scrutiny. The Court upheld the law as necessary for safeguarding the electoral process, promoting transparency, and rejected concerns about threats to petition signatories. In a case involving Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of FECA's disclosure requirements for electioneering communications. Challengers argued that their ad was protected issue advocacy exempt from disclosure, but the court disagreed citing previous rulings. The district court emphasized that the First Amendment does not require limiting disclosure to express advocacy. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of current disclaimer requirements in FECA, emphasizing the importance of providing critical information about the source of advertisements for the electorate to judge arguments effectively. Congress may consider legislation to increase disclosure requirements, which are likely to be upheld if they further the informational interests of the electorate. The Supreme Court has upheld disclaimer requirements in FECA, emphasizing the importance of providing critical information for the electorate. If a disclaimer requirement hinders the ability to speak or if enhanced disclosure requirements are considered, they should further the informational interests of the electorate. The Court in Citizens United held that the First Amendment does not require limiting disclosure requirements to speech equivalent to express advocacy. Legislation for increased disclosure of funding sources for communications, including issue advocacy, may be upheld if it serves governmental interests. FECA outlines criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations, related to contributions. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) imposes penalties for violations related to contributions, donations, or expenditures. Violators could face fines, imprisonment for up to five years, or both, depending on the amount involved. Specific penalties are outlined for knowing and willful violations, with imprisonment possible for amounts over $10,000. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) imposes penalties for violations involving amounts over $25,000, with imprisonment for up to five years. The U.S. Department of Justice typically prosecutes criminal violations, but the FEC can refer cases to the Justice Department under certain circumstances if there is probable cause for knowing and willful violations exceeding $2,000."
