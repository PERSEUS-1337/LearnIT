Appreciation in value can be real or due to inflation. Gains from depreciable assets may reflect depreciation timing. Taxation of capital gains differs from other income. The taxation of capital gains differs from other income. Gains are not taxed until realized, allowing for tax deferral. Taxes on long-term capital gains are imposed at rates corresponding to pre-2018 brackets. The tax revision in December 2018 maintained links to income levels for rate brackets in prior law. The new tax law changes the brackets for capital gains, with a single 12% rate bracket replacing the previous 10% and 15% brackets. The top rate is now 37%, starting at a higher income level than before. There is a 25% ceiling rate on gain from prior straight-line depreciation on real property, and a 28% tax on gains from collectibles. Additionally, there is an exclusion of $500,000 ($250,000 for single returns) for gains on home sales. The 2010 legislation imposed a 3.8% tax on high-income taxpayers' passive income, including capital gains over certain thresholds. Partnership interest gains are treated as long-term capital gains if held for at least three years. Capital gains have been subject to various tax rates since 1913, with exclusions based on holding period enacted in 1924. In 1924, capital gain exclusions based on holding period were enacted to address gains bunching in one year. In 1978, the exclusion increased to 60% with a maximum rate of 28%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated some tax preferences, aligning high-income individuals' capital gains rate with ordinary income at 28%. In 1989, President Bush proposed halving top rates for capital gains. The Ways and Means Committee considered various proposals, including a 30% exclusion and inflation indexation. In 1990, the President proposed a 30% exclusion, setting the rate at 19.6% for high-income individuals. The House also passed a 50% exclusion, but it was not enacted into law. When rates on high-income individuals were set at 31%, the capital gains rate was capped at 28%. In subsequent years, there were proposals for different exclusions and indexation, but no action was taken. In 1993 and 1994, no changes were proposed or adopted regarding capital gains taxes, except for a small business stock benefit in 1993. In 1993, the tax cap value was increased, and new brackets of 36% and 39.6% were added for ordinary income. In 1994, the \"Contract With America\" proposed a 50% exclusion for capital gains and indexing the basis for inflation, while eliminating the 28% cap. In 1995, H.R. 1215 restricted inflation indexing to newly acquired assets, included a flat 25% tax rate for corporations, and delayed the indexation provision until 2002 in H.R. 2491. During the 1996 presidential election, both candidates supported eliminating capital gains taxes on most home sales. In 1997, President Clinton and Congress agreed to a tax cut that included changes in tax treatment for owner-occupied housing and reduced the 15% and 28% rates to 10%. The final legislation in 1997 included a maximum tax of 20% on capital gains held for a year, with a maximum rate of 18% for assets held for five years and acquired after 2000. Prior to 1997, rules allowed for avoidance or deferral of taxes on gain from owner-occupied housing. The 1997 legislation included a maximum tax of 20% on capital gains held for a year, with a maximum rate of 18% for assets held for five years and acquired after 2000. In 1998, the holding period for long-term gains was reduced to one year. The 1999 House bill proposed cutting rates to 15% and 10%, but the final version cut rates to 18% and 8%. Temporary provisions for lower rates of 15% for higher brackets and 5% for lower brackets were adopted in 2003. The tax rates on capital gains for lower income brackets were extended in 2006 and 2010, with permanent lower rates enacted in 2012. A 3.8% tax on high-income taxpayers' passive income was introduced in 2010. The 2017 tax revision made changes to deductions and rates, affecting capital gains rates tied to old brackets. The 2017 tax revision made changes to itemized and standard deductions, repealed personal exemptions, and introduced a new measure of inflation affecting taxable income. It also altered capital gains taxes, treating partnership interest gains as long-term if held for at least three years. There has been a debate on the revenue impact of cutting capital gains taxes, with differing estimates on the potential gains or losses. The 2017 tax revision made changes to deductions and introduced a new inflation measure affecting taxable income. There is a debate on the revenue impact of cutting capital gains taxes, with differing estimates on potential gains or losses. The Treasury and Joint Tax Committee had varying estimates on revenue loss due to the tax cut, with uncertainties on capital gains realizations and revenue costs. The tax reduction's impact on revenues is larger with a higher tax increase, assuming a corresponding rise in response. A 50% exclusion has less feedback effect than a 30% exclusion. Allowing a tax cut dependent on asset transactions can lead to short-term gains. Arguments suggest a capital gains tax cut may boost savings, but the effect is uncertain due to income and substitution effects. The debate continues on the effect of the capital gains tax on growth through innovation, with uncertainties on the impact of savings on taxable income in the short run. Despite potential increases in savings rates, the overall effect on the capital stock is projected to be minimal. Additionally, a temporary increase in asset values from tax cuts may only shift revenues from the future to the present. The tax burden on investments is influenced by tax rates and benefits or penalties, with the potential for a marginal effective tax calculation. The effective tax rate on capital gains can vary from the statutory rate based on factors like inflation, real appreciation rate, and holding period. Assets held until death are not subject to tax. For example, a growth stock with a 7% real appreciation rate and 3% inflation rate would be subject to tax rates of 27%, 22%, 14%, and 0% if held for 1 year, 7 years, 20 years, and until death, respectively. The capital gains tax rates can vary based on factors like inflation, holding period, and real appreciation rate. The effective tax rate is likely lower than the statutory rate due to unrealized gains. Individuals in higher tax brackets benefit more from the capped capital gains tax rate. Reducing the tax can address the lock-in effect, which distorts behavior with minimal revenue gain. Accrual taxation and easily valued assets can help reduce lock-in. One way to reduce lock-in effect is to tax gains passed on at death, although this approach has been unpopular. For owner-occupied housing, current tax rules may result in individuals staying in houses that are too large, even if economic circumstances have changed. Lowering capital gains taxes on corporate stock could be justified to address heavy taxation on corporate equity capital. Lowering capital gains taxes on corporate stock may introduce tax distortions in firm decisions on retaining earnings, but this effect is not seen with temporary tax cuts benefiting dividends and capital gains. Most corporate stock is held by tax-exempt or foreign investors not subject to capital gains taxes. Lower gains taxes are argued to potentially increase economic growth and entrepreneurship, although evidence on the impact on savings rates and economic growth is inconclusive. Some studies suggest a higher rate of return may not necessarily lead to increased savings, as individuals may save less while still reaching their savings goals. An alternative approach to increasing savings could be using revenues to reduce debt instead of implementing tax cuts. Lowering capital gains taxes on corporate stock may introduce tax distortions in firm decisions on retaining earnings, but this effect is not seen with temporary tax cuts benefiting dividends and capital gains. Most corporate stock is held by tax-exempt or foreign investors not subject to capital gains taxes. There is little evidence to connect periods of technical advance with lower taxes or high rates of return. The extent to which entrepreneurs consider tax considerations is unclear, and there is doubt that capital gains taxes are important in obtaining venture capital. Longer corporate stock holding periods do not necessarily lead to more investments in long-term assets. The lower capital gains rates primarily benefit high-income individuals, with 92.5% of the benefit going to the top quintile of the income distribution and 73% to the top 1%. Capital gains are concentrated among higher-income individuals who own capital generating capital gains. The distributional effects of capital gains relief for homes are less concentrated at the higher end, enhancing horizontal equity. Critics mention tax sheltering activities and complexity due to preferential capital gains treatment. Constraints like passive loss restrictions limit deductions in real estate ventures. Capital gains differentials complicate tax law, especially with depreciable assets creating incentives for asset churning. Indexing capital gains for inflation is complex due to different basis adjustments for various asset vintages, especially with depreciable property. This complexity likely led to the decision to forego indexing, keeping the tax law simpler."
