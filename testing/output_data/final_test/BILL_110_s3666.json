    "content": "The \"Copper Theft Prevention Act of 2008\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Act includes findings and purposes related to copper theft prevention. Since 2006, there has been a rise in metal theft, specifically copper, due to increased global demand. The price of copper has doubled from $2 to over $4 per pound. This theft is endangering critical infrastructure like transportation and electrical networks. There have been numerous copper thefts reported, with many linked to illegal drug activities, particularly methamphetamine. The 2008 Threat Assessment highlights the growing threat of methamphetamine use. Law enforcement officials support legislation to combat methamphetamine issues linked to metal theft for funding. Copper theft is increasing due to lax regulations at scrap yards. Improved communication between metal businesses and law enforcement is needed to address the problem. The Act aims to protect consumers, businesses, critical infrastructure, and governments from metal theft. The Act aims to protect consumers, businesses, critical infrastructure, and State and local governments in the United States from the problem of copper theft by establishing a system to document metal transactions between sellers and buyers. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SECONDARY COPPER RECYCLER: A secondary copper recycler is defined as a person engaged in paying for used copper regardless of manufacturing processes. SEC. 4.
