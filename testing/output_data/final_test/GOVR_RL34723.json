It aims to help Congress assess the impact of international weapons trade on U.S. national interests and regional stability. The report provides Congress with data on arms transfers to developing nations by major suppliers from 2000 to 2007. It helps evaluate policy questions regarding U.S. arms sales and foreign policy initiatives, focusing on potential regional conflicts in the developing world. During the Cold War, arms transfers were used as a foreign policy tool by the United States and its allies. During the Cold War, arms transfers were used as a foreign policy tool by the United States and its allies to prevent military disadvantage from the Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, U.S. arms transfer policy focuses on assisting friendly nations in dealing with regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers have evolved in response to changing circumstances. During the Cold War, arms transfers were used as a foreign policy tool by the United States and its allies to prevent military disadvantage from the Soviet Union. Post-Cold War, U.S. arms transfer policy focuses on assisting friendly nations in dealing with regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers have evolved in response to changing circumstances. Arms sales by foreign suppliers today may be motivated by economic considerations as much as foreign or national security policy. Developing nations remain the primary focus of foreign arms sales, with a significant percentage of agreements and deliveries involving these countries. The new report provides updated data on arms deliveries to developing nations from 2000-2007, constituting 55.6% of global arms deliveries. The data are in U.S. dollars, adjusted for inflation, and exclude U.S. commercially licensed arms exports and transfers to subnational groups. Developing nations are defined in the report, with detailed data tables in the table of contents for reference. In 2007, global arms transfer agreements totaled nearly $60 billion, with the United States leading at $24.8 billion, followed by Russia at $10.4 billion and the United Kingdom at $9.8 billion. These three countries accounted for 75.2% of all international arms transfer agreements. During 2004-2007, global arms transfer agreements totaled $208.3 billion, a 29.2% increase from 2000-2003. Developing nations accounted for 67.7% of these agreements during both periods. In 2007, developing nations made up 70.5% of all arms transfer agreements globally. The United States led in arms deliveries in 2007, with $12.8 billion, followed by Russia at $4.7 billion. In 2007, the United States led in arms deliveries with $12.8 billion, followed by Russia at $4.7 billion. The top three suppliers collectively delivered nearly $20.1 billion, accounting for 64.8% of all arms delivered worldwide. The total value of international arms deliveries in 2007 was $31 billion, a decrease from the previous year. Developing nations accounted for 64.7% of the value of all international arms deliveries from 2004-2007. In 2007, developing nations collectively accounted for 55.6% of the value of all international arms deliveries, totaling nearly $60 billion, an increase from previous years. Major arms orders were mainly made by traditional suppliers, reflecting new acquisitions or ongoing weapons programs. Some nations purchased major systems they had previously deferred due to budget constraints. Some nations were integrating purchased weapons systems into their forces, while others were acquiring major systems previously deferred due to budget constraints. Arms transfer agreements also included contracts for training, support services, and upgrades. Competitive arms sales efforts targeted nations with established military-support relationships, with new NATO members in Europe driving business for arms suppliers. The modernization programs in NATO states have led to new business for arms suppliers. European countries are selling refurbished military equipment to less-developed countries, using creative financing options to facilitate arms agreements. The United States and European countries are expected to compete for arms contracts in the region. These sales are important for European suppliers to offset lost deals in the developing world. Demand for new weapons is increasing, with developed nations focusing on joint production to preserve domestic production capabilities and share development costs. Consolidation of defense industries is ongoing, with some nations specializing in niche weapons categories. Developing nations are limiting weapons purchases due to various reasons. Some developing nations have limited weapons purchases due to financial constraints, while others with significant assets are cautious in launching costly procurement programs. Economic difficulties caused by oil price increases have led some countries to curtail or defer new weapons acquisitions. Less affluent nations are upgrading existing weapons systems instead of buying new ones, which may reduce sales of new weapons systems but create opportunities in the weapons upgrade market for arms producers. In the Near East and Asia regions, major weapons purchases have resumed, primarily by India, China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These purchasing trends are influenced by threat assessments and economic strength. The timing of arms purchases in developing nations is mainly determined by the strength of their economies. Latin America and Africa also show interest in modernizing their military capabilities. In Latin America and Africa, some nations aim to modernize their military forces, but financial constraints limit weapons purchases. Limited availability of credit and low military budgets restrict major arms sales to these regions. The value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations in 2007 was $42.3 billion, higher than in 2006. In 2007, arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaled $42.3 billion, lower than in 2006. The United States and Russia dominated the arms market in the developing world from 2004-2007, making 52.5% of all agreements. Russia made $39.3 billion, while the United States made $34.7 billion in such agreements during this period. During the period of 2000-2007, the United States and Russia were the top arms suppliers to developing nations. The United States ranked first for five out of eight years, while Russia was a strong competitor, ranking second from 2000-2003 and first from 2004-2006. Despite lacking a large client base, Russia's success in securing new arms orders indicates its continued competitiveness in the market. Russia's recent successes in securing new arms orders indicate its continued competitiveness in the market. High-value arms transfer agreements with India and China remain significant, while agreements with clients beyond these two countries are also notable. Russia is expanding its prospects in North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, and has increased sales efforts in Latin America, including with Venezuela. The Russian government has adopted more flexible payment arrangements for prospective customers in the developing world. Russia is forgiving debts to secure new arms purchases and improving follow-on support services. Major European suppliers like France and the UK have secured large orders with developing countries. The US is likely to remain the principal supplier to key developing nations for major new weapons. The United States continues to dominate the global arms market by providing upgrades, ordnance, and support services for weapons systems sold to clients. Arms sales to wealthier developing countries are a focus, while transfers to less affluent nations are limited by budget constraints. The decline in arms agreements with developing nations seen after 2001 has stopped. The halt in arms agreements with developing nations that began after 2001 and continued through 2003 has stopped. Arms transfer agreements with developing countries reached their peak in 2007 at nearly $43.3 billion, with a steady increase from 2004 to 2007, driven in part by sales to more affluent nations. Developing nations with increased oil revenues have been actively seeking new weaponry, with China and other suppliers increasing their participation in the arms trade with the developing world. Non-major arms suppliers have also made significant deals, although their annual agreement values during 2000-2007 have been relatively low. The total value of United States arms transfer agreements with developing nations rose from $9.1 billion in 2006 to $12.2 billion in 2007, with a 28.8% share of all agreements in 2007. These arms suppliers focus on small arms and light weapons rather than major military equipment. In 2007, the total value of U.S. arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased to $12.2 billion, accounting for 28.8% of all agreements. Major deals with clients in the Near East and Asia contributed significantly to this total, along with smaller purchases by traditional U.S. arms clients in the region. The U.S. maintains a strong advantage in defense-support arrangements worldwide, offering a variety of weapons systems and upgrades to its clients. In 2007, the United States signed significant arms transfer agreements with developing nations, including deals with the United Arab Emirates for helicopters and rocket systems, Egypt for tanks, Saudi Arabia for jet engines and aircraft services, South Korea for radio systems and missiles, Colombia for helicopters, and Jordan for a C4SIR system. Russia also had arms agreements. In 2007, Russia signed arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaling $9.7 billion, a decrease from $14.4 billion in 2006. Russia's share of all developing world arms transfer agreements decreased from 37.9% in 2006 to 23% in 2007. Despite economic and political challenges, Russia remained a leading supplier of arms to developing nations from 2004-2007, making $37.9 billion in agreements. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia focused on obtaining hard currency for arms sales. To compete with Western suppliers, Russia adapted its selling practices by offering creative financing options like counter-trade and debt-swapping to developing countries. Russia's arms sales efforts have included licensed production agreements with key clients like India and China. Apart from these partnerships, Russia has also secured arms deals with Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Indonesia, as well as Venezuela and Algeria. Russia's military equipment ranges from basic to advanced, making it competitive in the developing world where its affordable armaments are attractive. Military aircraft and missiles remain significant exports for Russia. Russia's arms sales efforts with key clients like India and China have been successful, with agreements for combat fighter aircraft and main battle tanks. Despite challenges in research and development, Russia continues to provide support for these weapons systems. Sales of advanced weaponry in South Asia by Russia remain significant. Sales of advanced weaponry in South Asia by Russia have been a concern to the United States due to tensions between India and Pakistan. India's acquisition of new weapon systems prompts Pakistan to seek comparable weapons. The US aims to prevent a destabilizing arms race in the region. China is another key arms client for Russia, particularly for advanced aircraft and naval systems. Russia has sold China various weapons systems, including fighter aircraft, destroyers, submarines, and missiles. In 2005, Russia agreed to sell China military transport aircraft. In 2005, Russia agreed to sell China military transport aircraft, aerial refueling tanker aircraft, military aircraft engines, and jet engines for fighter aircraft. These acquisitions aim to enhance China's military projection capabilities in Asia and its influence in the region. U.S. policymakers monitor these acquisitions to ensure appropriate military equipment is provided to U.S. allies in Asia to offset any potential threat from China. In 2007, Russia focused on arms agreements with India, selling T-90 tanks, Su-30MKI fighter aircraft, and MiG-29 aircraft. They also made sales to Indonesia and Iran for fighter aircraft and air defense systems. Syria purchased military equipment from Russia as well. China's arms sales have been regional and targeted since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. From 2004-2007, China's arms transfer agreements with developing nations averaged about $2.3 billion annually, with the highest value in 2007 at $3.8 billion. A significant portion of this total was due to a contract with Pakistan for the production of the J-17 fighter aircraft. China's sales figures mainly consist of smaller valued weapons deals in Asia. China's arms sales focus on smaller valued weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East. Most Chinese weapons for export are less advanced than those from Western suppliers or Russia. China is not expected to be a major supplier of conventional weapons in the international arms market. Its likely client base includes states in Asia and Africa seeking small arms and light weapons. China has been a significant source of missiles in the developing world arms market, supplying Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran. China's arms sales in the developing world include supplying missiles to countries like Iran, Pakistan, North Korea, and others, raising concerns about China's commitment to missile transfer restrictions. This could hinder efforts to prevent proliferation of advanced missile systems in certain regions. China, along with other countries, has been a key source of small arms and light weapons transferred to African states. These sales may enhance China's international political power and access to natural resources like oil. The United States and the United Nations are concerned about controlling arms sales to conflict regions, particularly in Africa. Major West European suppliers also play a significant role in arms sales. Major West European arms suppliers - France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy - can provide sophisticated weapons as alternative sources when the United States chooses not to supply for policy reasons. These NATO allies have historically supported the U.S. in restricting arms sales during the Cold War but have not fully coordinated their national defense export policies in the post-Cold War era. France, in particular, views arms sales independently. The leading European arms supplying states, including France, view arms sales as a national decision. France has used foreign military sales to support its own military development. Policy differences with the United States arose when France and Germany tried to lift the arms embargo on China, causing tension between the U.S. and the European Union. This highlights the interest of U.S. policymakers in the arms sales activities of major European suppliers. The major European suppliers, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, saw a significant increase in their arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 2006 to 2007. The collective value of these agreements in 2007 was $13.6 billion, with the United Kingdom leading with $9.8 billion in agreements. This increase in sales is of interest to U.S. policymakers due to the potential impact on national security. In 2007, major European suppliers, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, had a total arms agreement value of $13.6 billion with developing nations. The United Kingdom led with $9.8 billion in agreements, including a significant deal with Saudi Arabia for 72 Typhoon Eurofighter aircraft. Germany's agreements in 2007 were primarily with South Korea for a Patriot PAC-2 air defense system worth $1.2 billion. France had notable years in 2000 and 2005 with $2.2 billion and $6.8 billion in agreements, respectively. In 2007, major European suppliers, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, had a total arms agreement value of $13.6 billion with developing nations. The United Kingdom led with $9.8 billion in agreements, while Germany concluded arms agreements totaling nearly $2 billion in 2006, and $1.5 billion in 2007. The competitive position of major West European suppliers in weapons exports has been strengthened through strong government marketing support. These suppliers have successfully competed for arms sales contracts with developing nations against the United States and Russia. The demand for U.S. weapons in the global arms marketplace has made it challenging for individual West European suppliers to secure large new contracts with developing nations. European Union member states have adopted a new code of conduct for defense procurement practices in hopes of fostering greater competition within the European defense equipment sector. Cooperation and collaboration in defense contracting among European arms suppliers have led to joint production ventures to sustain their defense industrial bases. This includes projects like the Eurofighter and Eurocopter, as well as partnerships with the United States on projects like the Joint Strike Fighter. This strategy enhances the ability of European defense firms to compete in the international arms marketplace. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) project involves collaboration among European arms suppliers to meet their own advanced combat aircraft needs and share profits from future sales. The focus is on maintaining stability in developing regions by supporting arms sales that align with this goal and discouraging significant sales by other suppliers in low-threat areas. The regional arms suppliers prioritize financial gain over U.S. perspectives on appropriate arms sales. Policymakers can use arms-transfer data to identify potential concerns and review options. The report reviews arms-transfer activities in the Near East and Asia, as well as leading arms purchasers in the developing world. The Persian Gulf crisis in the 1990s led to increased weapons procurements in the Near East region, with key purchasers like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait demanding advanced weapon systems. GCC states focused on air, naval, and missile defense systems due to concerns over Iran's growing threat. Egypt and Israel also increased arms purchases from the United States. Saudi Arabia has re-established itself as the principal arms purchaser in the Persian Gulf region. Saudi Arabia has re-established itself as the leading arms purchaser in the Persian Gulf region. From 2000-2003, its arms agreements were valued at $3.2 billion, but from 2004-2007, this increased to $23.2 billion, making it the top buyer in the Near East. The region accounted for 42.3% of all developing nations arms transfer agreements in 2000-2003, and 46.3% in 2004-2007, surpassing Asia in both periods. In 2004-2007, the United States dominated arms transfer agreements with the Near East, accounting for 32.8% of agreements. Russia accounted for 20.8% of agreements in the same period. In Asia, efforts have been focused on upgrading defense forces, leading to new conventional weapons sales. Since the mid-1990s, Russia has become the main supplier of advanced conventional weaponry to China and India, increasing Asia's overall share of the arms market in the developing world. Russia has expanded its client base in Asia, while India has diversified its weapons suppliers by purchasing from Israel and France. In 2007, India made major purchases from Russia, and the United States also made significant arms deals in the region. In 2006, the United States sold new F-16 fighter aircraft, weapons, and upgrades to Pakistan, while Sweden sold a SAAB-2000 based AWACS airborne radar system. Pakistan also contracted with China for J-17 fighter aircraft production in 2007, making them a major arms buyer in Asia. From 2000-2007, Asia was the second largest developing-world arms market, with 42.3% of total arms transfer agreements. In the period 2000-2007, Russia and the United States were the top arms suppliers to Asia, with Russia leading in the earlier period and the United States in the later period. India was the leading arms purchaser in the developing world during this time, with significant agreements totaling $31.9 billion. India was the top arms purchaser in the developing world from 2000-2007, with armstransfer agreements totaling $31.9 billion. In the 2000-2003 period, China ranked first in arms transfer agreements at $10.1 billion, while in 2004-2007 India ranked first with agreements totaling $24.2 billion. This increase reflects India's military modernization effort primarily through major arms agreements with Russia. India alone accounted for 14.7% of all developing-world arms-transfer agreements during these eight years. During 2004-2007, India was the top arms purchaser in the developing world with agreements totaling $31.9 billion. Saudi Arabia ranked second with $23.2 billion in arms transfer agreements, accounting for 17.1% of all developing-world agreements. The top ten recipients collectively accounted for 61.6% of all agreements during this period, with Saudi Arabia leading the group. In 2007, Saudi Arabia led in arms transfer agreements among developing countries with $10.6 billion, followed by India at $5 billion and Pakistan at $4.2 billion. India received the most arms deliveries at $1.6 billion, followed by Israel and Egypt at $1.5 billion each. The top ten developing nation recipients accounted for 64.5% of all arms deliveries, with five in Asia, three in the Near East, and one each in Latin America and Africa. Weapons delivery data from various regions show that the United States, Russia, and major European suppliers dominate in supplying conventional weaponry to developing nations. However, other European and non-European suppliers, including China, also play significant roles in supplying certain types of armaments. Deliveries to the Near East, historically the largest purchasing region, include tanks, self-propelled guns, APCs, armored cars, and minor surface combatants.

The data shows the number of tanks, self-propelled guns, APCs, armored cars, combat aircraft, helicopters, surface-to-air missiles, and anti-ship missiles supplied by different countries. Large numbers of major combat systems, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, helicopters, air defense, and anti-ship missiles, were delivered to the Near East region from 2004-2007. The United States, Russia, and European suppliers were the principal providers of these weapons, with a focus on costly categories such as supersonic combat aircraft, helicopters, and tanks. During 2004-2007, the Near East region received a significant number of weapons systems from major suppliers like the United States, Russia, and Europe. The delivery of naval combatants was costly, with notable increases in delivery values. The United States, China, and major European suppliers delivered anti-ship missiles, surface combatants, and guided missile boats to the region. Additionally, non-European suppliers delivered APCs and armored cars. During 2000-2007, major suppliers delivered a variety of weapons to developing nations, including APCs, armored cars, surface combatants, and surface-to-surface missiles.
