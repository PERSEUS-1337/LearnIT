The \"Medicare Drug Card Guaranteed Savings Act\" aims to address the high costs of prescription drugs for Americans, highlighting the disparity in prices compared to other countries and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Act was established to provide reduced prices for drugs through medicare drug discount card programs. The Medicare Drug Card Guaranteed Savings Act aims to provide reduced prices for drugs for Medicare beneficiaries through endorsed drug discount card programs. Currently, there are over 70 programs that can change their offerings every seven days. Enrollment has been lower than expected due to program complexity, limited drug coverage, changing needs, and beneficiary concerns about guaranteed savings. Beneficiaries are concerned about the lack of guaranteed savings on prescription drug purchases through the Medicare drug discount card program. Only a small percentage of low-income Medicare beneficiaries have enrolled in the program. Sponsors are only required to pass on a portion of rebates to enrollees, keeping the rest for administrative costs and profit. Transparency is lacking in disclosing rebate sizes and how much is kept by sponsors. There is a need for federal oversight in the Medicare program. There is a need for a Federal national medicare prescription drug discount card program that guarantees discounts on all drugs by aggregating the buying power of all medicare beneficiaries to negotiate price reductions. The Federal National Prescription Drug Discount Card Program is being offered to provide discounts on all drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. The Federal National Prescription Drug Discount Card Program is being offered to provide discounts on all drugs for Medicare beneficiaries nationwide, including the territories. The Federal National Prescription Drug Discount Card Program is the exclusive program for enrollment in 2005, limiting individuals to only this program despite other options available. The Federal national prescription drug discount card program, as of December 31, 2004, requires individuals enrolled in other programs to affirmatively disenroll to be deemed enrolled in this exclusive program for 2005. Additional requirements for the program include meeting specific criteria outlined in subsection (a)(1)(C). The Federal national prescription drug discount card program for 2005 requires discounted prices negotiated with manufacturers to be lower than retail market prices, passing all savings to enrollees, and charging a $30 annual enrollment fee. The Federal national prescription drug discount card program for 2005 offers discounted prices to individuals nationwide and includes a handling fee for pharmacists. The program's oversight falls under the Secretary's authority.

The term 'average foreign price' is defined as the average price realized by drug manufacturers in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom for drugs with the same active ingredients.

The Secretary has the authority to exempt certain transactions from this calculation. The Secretary has the authority to exempt certain transactions from price calculations for drugs, including those for charitable or research purposes. Amendments include the inclusion of the Secretary in the Federal national prescription drug discount card program.

The Social Security Act requires the Secretary to offer a program during the annual open enrollment period in November 2004."
