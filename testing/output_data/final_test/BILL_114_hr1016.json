    "content": "The Act titled \"Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2015\" requires the identification and tracking of biological implants used in Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The \"Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2015\" mandates the implementation of a standard identification system for biological implants used in Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The system will be based on the unique device identification system developed for medical devices by the FDA. The Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2015 requires the implementation of a system to track biological implants from donor to implantation in VA medical facilities. The system must be compatible with the FDA's identification system for medical devices and include inventory controls for patient notification in case of a recall. The Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2015 mandates a system to track biological implants in VA medical facilities, ensuring compatibility with FDA regulations. The definition of a biological implant includes animal or human cells or tissue regulated under specific acts. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a new item in the table of sections. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a new item in the table of sections related to the identification and tracking of biological implants. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must adopt a standard identification system for biological implants within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must implement a biological implant tracking system within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, in compliance with FDA standards. If the system is not operational by the deadline, a reporting requirement is triggered. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must provide monthly written explanations to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs regarding impediments, remediation steps, and target dates for the implementation of the biological implant tracking system until it is operational. The procurement of biological implants for Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary may procure biological implants of human origin only from vendors that meet specific conditions, including using a standard identification system and being registered with the FDA. The vendor must ensure that the tissue distribution intermediary or processor is FDA registered, provide donor eligibility records with each implant, consent to inspections by the Secretary, and cooperate with implant recalls. The vendor must comply with FDA regulations, report adverse events, retain records for five years, and notify the Secretary of any warning letters received from the FDA. The vendor must comply with FDA regulations, report adverse events, retain records for five years, and notify the Secretary of any warning letters received from the FDA. Biological implants must be acquired from accredited tissue processors and non-human origin implants must meet specific vendor conditions. The vendor must comply with FDA regulations, consent to inspections, cooperate with recalls, and report adverse events to the Secretary. The vendor must report adverse events to the FDA within 60 days and retain records for at least five years. The Secretary procures biological implants through the Federal Supply Schedules, accommodating vendor outreach efforts. The Secretary procures biological implants through the Federal Supply Schedules and may use competitive procedures for unavailable implants. Penalties apply to procurement employees who violate regulations. The definitions in this section clarify terms related to biological implants, including the meaning of 'biological implant' and 'production identifier'. The production identifier is a distinct code that links the implant to the donor and recipient, meeting specific requirements for tracking. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to human tissue processing, including 'tissue distribution intermediary' and 'tissue processor'. It also includes a clerical amendment to the regulations. Section 8129 of title 38, United States Code, pertains to the procurement of biological implants. It specifies that the effective date of this section will be 180 days after the implementation of a tracking system required under another section. Additionally, there is a special rule for cryopreserved products allowing for the procurement of biological implants produced before the effective date without relabeling."
