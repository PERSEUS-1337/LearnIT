    "content": "Qui tam is a whistleblower concept where an individual sues in the name of the government and shares in the proceeds of successful litigation. It is a civil procedure that allows individuals to prosecute for the government, even if they were not directly affected by the misconduct. The term qui tam originates from Latin and has been authorized by legislative bodies when law enforcement officials are unable to enforce certain laws effectively. The False Claims Act is a well-known qui tam provision allowing individuals to sue on behalf of the government. Recoveries under the Act have totaled over $33 billion. Qui tam statutes have a long history, dating back to King Wihtred of Kent in 695. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, qui tam statutes became common in English law, leading to unintended consequences such as bounty hunters exploiting the system. Coke advocated for reform legislation to control these \"vexatious relators, informers, and promoters,\" who were considered unruly and unpopular. Queen Elizabeth I even issued a proclamation to protect them from mob violence. Qui tam statutes were prevalent in colonial America and the early Republic, with colonial legislatures enacting their own laws. By the twentieth century, these statutes had fallen out of use, although they remained on the books. The Supreme Court identified four federal qui tam statutes in Stevens: the False Claims Act, the Patent Act, and two Indian protection laws. The False Claims Act, Patent Act, and Indian protection laws have qui tam provisions. The Leahy-Smith America Invests Act replaced the Patent Act's qui tam provision. Congress has enacted other statutes allowing qui tam actions. The Supreme Court stated that statutes with informer rewards authorize qui tam actions. Environmentalists were encouraged to bring qui tam actions under the Rivers and Harbors Act. Lower courts have not been receptive to this suggestion. The lower federal courts have generally refused to recognize qui tam actions under the Rivers and Harbors Act. The False Claims Act, originating in 1863, includes a qui tam provision explained by Senator Howard. Lower courts maintain that Congress must explicitly create qui tam statutes. The qui tam provision in the bill offers a reward to informers who betray their coconspirators, including the district attorney, who can also be the informer and receive a portion of the forfeiture and damages. The sections are based on the idea of setting a rogue to catch a rogue. The statute prohibited various frauds against the government, including false claims, vouchers, oaths, theft, embezzlement, and conspiracy. Offenders faced imprisonment or fines, civil liability, and the ability for private parties to bring suit on behalf of the United States. Relators were entitled to half of the penalty recovered and costs. Private parties, known as relators, were entitled to half of the penalty recovered and costs under the qui tam provisions. In 1943, Attorney General Biddle sought to repeal these provisions, citing that informers' suits often did not provide new information to the government and sometimes used information already obtained by the government in law enforcement. Informers' suits have become parasitical actions, brought after law enforcement has already investigated and prosecuted individuals, solely for the hope of a large reward. The Senate and House passed bills to repeal qui tam provisions, but the Supreme Court overturned a lower court opinion cited by the Attorney General. The Senate Judiciary Committee recommended curtailing, rather than repealing, the provisions. The Senate Judiciary Committee recommended curtailing the false claim qui tam provisions, leading to the passage of Public Law 78-213. The legislation required relators to provide evidence to the government, precluded suits based on government-held information, and reduced relator's share of successful suits. The 1943 amendments aimed to reform qui tam procedures, while the 1986 amendments reinvigorated them in response to extensive fraud against the United States. The amendments to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 introduced several changes, including new causes of action, increased sanctions and damages, higher awards for whistleblowers, clarified definitions and burden of proof standards, expanded jurisdictional scope, extended statute of limitations, and authorization for government use of civil investigative demands. The amendments to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 reinforced previous changes, including modifications to the False Claims Act such as expanding conspiracy proscription, clarifying materiality elements, and enlarging reverse false claims offense. Additional amendments were made in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, including clarifying the definition of \"original source\" qualification and adding a 3-year statute of limitations. The False Claims Act includes a 3-year statute of limitations for civil actions related to retaliation. It defines \"person\" broadly to include various entities. Local governments are considered persons, but states, Indian tribes, and certain federal officials are exempt from False Claims Act suits. Private individuals can sue on behalf of the government under the Act. The False Claims Act allows private individuals to sue on behalf of the government, with the government having the option to intervene at any point in the litigation. The government can also dismiss or settle the case over the objections of the relator, with the court having the authority to limit the relator's participation for a more effective presentation of the case. A relator in a False Claims Act action must be the original source of information and cannot file based on public information or official proceedings. The first-to-file bar prevents copycat actions with similar fraud claims. Government employees can bring qui tam actions if statutory bars don't apply. Seven forms of misconduct lead to civil liability under \u00a73729, including knowingly presenting false claims for payment. The False Claims Act prohibits various forms of misconduct, including knowingly making false claims for payment or approval, using false records or statements, conspiring to commit violations, delivering less than all government property, fraudulently certifying receipt of property, buying public property unlawfully, and using false records. The False Claims Act prohibits misconduct such as making false claims, using false records, conspiring to commit violations, delivering less government property, fraudulently certifying receipt of property, buying public property unlawfully, and using false records. Additional liability may arise from retaliatory actions against those reporting violations. The False Claims Act prohibits various misconduct, including making false claims, using false records, conspiring to commit violations, delivering less government property, fraudulently certifying receipt of property, buying public property unlawfully, and using false records. Liability under the Act does not require direct presentment to a government officer or employee, and intent to defraud is not necessary. Knowledge can be established through knowing, deliberate ignorance, or reckless disregard, with a standard between deliberate disregard and gross negligence. Section 3729(a)(1)(B) applies to any person who knowingly commits violations. The False Claims Act prohibits various misconduct, including making false claims and using false records. Section 3279(a)(1)(B) applies to any person who knowingly makes a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. The 2009 Act amended the section to include materiality as a specific element, requiring that the false record have a natural tendency to influence the payment or receipt of money or property. Most lower courts believed \u00a73729 had an implicit materiality requirement. The 2009 amendments were retroactively applicable. The Act resolved issues regarding civil liability for conspiracy to defraud the Government. The 2009 Act amended the conspiracy prohibition to establish liability for engaging in any misconduct covered by \u00a73729(a)(1), eliminating the receipt requirement and adding a knowledge element. The 2009 Act amended the conspiracy prohibition to establish liability for engaging in any misconduct covered by \u00a73729(a)(1), eliminating the receipt requirement and adding a knowledge element. Section 3729(a)(1)(D) establishes civil liability for delivering less than all government property, while Section 3729(a)(1)(E) imposes liability for falsely certifying receipt of property with intent to defraud the government. An intent to defraud may be implied in other offenses listed in Section 3729(a)(1). The 2009 Act amended various sections of the False Claims Act, including creating civil liability for purchasing or accepting government property without authority. The Act also revised the reverse false claims section, which involves avoiding providing money or property to the government. The 2009 Act amended the False Claims Act to include misconduct designed to avoid providing money or property to the government. This includes making false statements or concealing obligations to the government. The second prong was added for symmetry with other sections of the Act. The 2009 Act amended the False Claims Act to include misconduct such as making false statements or concealing obligations to the government. Section 3729(a)(1)(G) now covers false records or statements material to payment obligations to the government, creating civil liability for such actions. The 2009 Act expanded the False Claims Act to include liability for any knowing and improper conduct, regardless of false statements or records. The definition of \"obligation\" was broadened to encompass various types of duties, including those arising from contractual relationships, fee-based relationships, statutes, regulations, or overpayments. The 2009 Act broadened the definition of \"obligation\" under the False Claims Act to include fixed and contingent duties owed to the Government, such as fixed liquidated obligations and tariffs. The 2009 Act expanded the definition of \"obligation\" under the False Claims Act to cover fixed and contingent duties owed to the Government, including liquidated judgments and tariffs on imported goods. The new section also encompasses various types of relationships that result in a duty to pay the Government money, whether the amount owed is defined or not. It is unclear if false statements or improper conduct aimed at reducing future fines or penalties would be considered obligations under this section. The 2009 Act expanded the False Claims Act to protect employees, contractors, and agents from retaliation for reporting violations. It removed references to employers and specific examples of protected assistance, ensuring that anyone who reports wrongdoing is entitled to relief. The False Claims Act was expanded in 2009 to protect employees, contractors, and agents from retaliation for reporting violations. This includes providing relief for those who are discriminated against for lawful acts done in furtherance of reporting violations. Liability under the Act may extend to supervisors, contractors, and agents, with potential penalties including treble damages, statutory penalties, litigation costs, and attorneys' fees. The False Claims Act allows for damages, attorneys' fees, and costs to be awarded in successful cases. Defendants who cooperate may have damages reduced, and victims of retaliation can receive compensation for back pay and special damages. Relators can receive up to 30% of proceeds if the government does not participate, and 15-25% if they do, reduced to 10% for public information claims. The False Claims Act allows for damages, attorneys' fees, and costs to be awarded in successful cases. Defendants may have damages reduced if they cooperate. Relators can receive up to 30% of proceeds if the government does not participate, and 15-25% if they do, reduced to 10% for public information claims. Attorneys' fees and expenses may be awarded to defendants if the court deems the relator's action to be frivolous, vexatious, or brought to harass. The False Claims Act allows for damages, attorneys' fees, and costs to be awarded in successful cases. Defendants may have damages reduced if they cooperate. Relators can receive up to 30% of proceeds if the government does not participate, and 15-25% if they do, reduced to 10% for public information claims. Attorneys' fees and expenses may be awarded to defendants if the court deems the relator's action to be frivolous, vexatious, or brought to harass. Prosecution of a violation of \u00a73729 must begin within six years, with an exception for undiscovered fraud extending the deadline to 10 years if action is brought within three years of discovery. The courts are divided on whether this extension applies to private parties or only cases initiated by the government. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act established a 3-year statute of limitations for litigation of retaliatory misconduct under \u00a73730(h), replacing the need to refer to state law for limitations. The process of filing a complaint under seal with the federal court involves delivering evidence to the government, which then decides whether to intervene within 60 days. The government can use civil investigative demand authority to gather material and testimony. Defendants have 20 days to respond after being served, and the burden of proof lies with the government or relator to establish damages and violation elements. In parallel criminal proceedings, a defendant cannot contest elements of a violation already established. Relators, suing on behalf of the United States, must adhere to a 30-day appellate review deadline. The 2009 Act allows the government to intervene in cases within the statute of limitations based on the date of the relator's complaint. The government can intervene in cases within the statute of limitations based on the date of the relator's complaint. Penalties under Title 28 of the Revised Statutes can be recovered in court, with half going to the informer and half to the United States. Section 201 authorizes qui tam actions for violations of statutes related to Indian land. Qui tam actions under \u00a7201 are rare and typically involve unlicensed trading and grazing on Indian land. In some cases, relators' actions have been dismissed due to failure to join an indispensable party or bureaucratic nonfeasance. Section 179 prohibits grazing horses, mules, or livestock on Indian land. Section 179 prohibits grazing horses, mules, or cattle on Indian land without permission, with a penalty of $1 per head. There is a debate over whether the Secretary of the Interior can set the penalty at $1 per head per day. Federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction for enforcing these penalties, but they may defer to tribal courts. It is uncertain if the penalty under \u00a7177 can be enforced through a qui tam action under \u00a7201, which typically involves unlicensed trading and grazing on Indian land. Section 177 deals with cases where individuals attempt to lease tribal lands without federal approval, subjecting violators to a $1,000 fine. The Eighth Circuit in Harlan discussed the qui tam provisions in relation to contracts for services requiring government approval, citing section 177 to show a broader policy oversight. The James case clarified that tribal members can only sue for violations of section 177. The James case clarified that tribal members can only sue for violations of section 177 as representatives of their tribe, not individually. Qui tam raises constitutional issues regarding defendants' rights in criminal cases and the separation of powers among government branches. The Fifth Amendment rights, such as the right to a speedy and public trial before an impartial jury, apply only to criminal proceedings, not civil qui tam cases. Constitutional rights in civil cases depend on whether the government's actions are punitive. For example, the double jeopardy clause may not apply to civil actions aimed at protecting the government from financial loss. The Supreme Court ruled that a civil penalty cannot be considered a criminal penalty for double jeopardy purposes unless it is excessively punitive. The Court established that a defendant cannot be subjected to an additional civil sanction if it is not remedial but only serves as a deterrent or retribution. The Court later clarified that the appropriate test is whether Congress intended the penalty to be civil or criminal. The Supreme Court has set a high bar for proving the unconstitutionality of a statute based on punitive grounds. While the Hudson case was not a qui tam case, lower federal court cases have considered it influential. The Court suggested that issues similar to those in Hudson could be evaluated using Eighth Amendment excessive fines standards. The Supreme Court has determined that the excessive fines clause applies to the government's power to extract payments as punishment for an offense. A fine is considered excessive if it is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the defendant's offense. In the qui tam context, some lower courts treat False Claims Act qui tam penalties as punishment subject to excessive fines clause analysis. The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of excessive fines as punishment, particularly in cases involving False Claims Act qui tam penalties. Lower courts have generally found that the fines imposed were not excessive for Eighth Amendment purposes. Additionally, there are concerns about due process issues when individuals with a personal interest prosecute in the name of the United States, as highlighted in the case of Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc. In Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., the Supreme Court overturned a conviction due to the appointment of Vuitton's lawyers as prosecutors in a contempt action, which was deemed an error undermining due process. The Supreme Court overturned a conviction in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A. due to the appointment of an interested prosecutor, which was deemed an error undermining due process. Challenges to qui tam legislation based on due process have been rejected by lower federal courts. Ex post facto challenges have also been raised but failed in court. The courts have rejected ex post facto challenges to qui tam legislation, citing insufficient penal statute concerns. Retroactivity due process challenges have also failed, with courts finding rational legislative purposes for retroactive application. The Constitution allocates federal governmental authority among the three branches, empowering Congress to make laws necessary for execution and allowing impeachment for high crimes. The Constitution outlines the powers and duties of the President, including the appointment of officials with Senate approval, executing laws faithfully, recommending legislation, and serving as commander in chief of the armed forces. It also allows for impeachment of the President and other civil officers for treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors. The Constitution empowers the President to appoint officials with Senate approval, grant pardons, receive ambassadors, and define the judicial power of the United States. This system of separation of powers and checks and balances serves as a safeguard against branch encroachment. The Framers of the Constitution aimed to prevent one branch from overpowering the others, emphasizing the importance of separateness and interdependence. However, concerns have been raised about qui tam actions potentially conflicting with constitutional principles, particularly regarding the federal courts' requirement for cases with conflicting interests. The Constitution assigns the President the duty to ensure laws are faithfully executed, including appointing officers. However, qui tam provisions in the False Claims Act allow relators to initiate litigation without presidential appointment. This raises constitutional challenges as qui tam statutes were common during the Constitution's drafting, potentially conflicting with the separation of powers principle. Critics face the challenge of explaining why a process that the Framers did not consider unconstitutional is now viewed as such. History plays a significant role in determining standing, which requires a concrete injury attributable to the defendant and amenable to judicial relief. The Supreme Court's decision in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens put standing challenges to rest by considering the long tradition of qui tam actions in England and the American colonies relevant to the constitutional standing inquiry. The Stevens Court found the injury to the United States sufficient to establish False Claims Act relator standing, considering the relator as an agent of the defrauded United States. Relator standing is in doubt when tangible injury to the United States is less obvious, as seen in cases involving the false marking section of the Patent Act. The Stevens Court found injury to the United States sufficient for False Claims Act relator standing, considering the relator as an agent of the defrauded United States. Qui tam standing was resolved, but no view was expressed on whether qui tam suits violate Article II. The Appointments Clause and 'take Care' Clause were not addressed. The appointments clause issue in qui tam cases arises from conflicting language in Supreme Court cases. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court suggested that only officers appointed under Article II can conduct civil litigation for the United States. Previous decisions implied that the appointments clause applied to those holding an \"office of the United States.\" The appointments clause issue in qui tam cases arises from conflicting language in Supreme Court cases. United States v. Hartwell found that a Treasury Department clerk was an officer of the United States for purposes of an embezzlement statute, while United States v. Germaine concluded that a surgeon paid to conduct examinations was not an officer of the United States. The Court determined that individuals like appraisers and agents employed to obtain information for federal pensions were not considered officers of the United States, as they did not hold official positions, take oaths, or have public offices. This decision was in line with previous cases such as United States v. Germaine, which distinguished between employees and officers of the United States. The Commissioners appointed for a statutory term are not considered employees of the United States but officers, not subject to control by any other authority. The Court affirmed that only officers appointed in conformity with Article II can exercise significant authority. In Freytag, it distinguished between Tax Court special trial judges (inferior officers) and special masters (not officers). The office of special trial judges is established by law, distinguishing them from special masters who are hired on a temporary basis by Article III courts. Special trial judges exercise significant discretion and perform more than ministerial tasks. Lower federal courts generally do not see appointments clause impediments in qui tam suits. The lower federal courts generally do not see appointments clause impediments in qui tam suits because qui tam relators are not considered officers of the United States. Relators do not hold any legislatively created office, do not receive government salaries, and do not have continuing and permanent duties like officers. The take care clause imposes a responsibility on the President to faithfully execute laws, without granting authority. The allocation of powers among branches prevents interference with the President's duties. Morrison v. Olson questioned if independent counsel provisions undermined the President's ability under the take care clause. The Morrison v. Olson case involved the judicial appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute senior executive branch officials. The Court found that the Act did not impermissibly reduce the President's control over prosecutorial powers, as it did not threaten the separation of powers or checks and balances. The Morrison v. Olson case upheld the President's control over prosecutorial powers, stating that the Executive Branch has sufficient control over the independent counsel to ensure the President can fulfill his duties. Lower court cases also supported this conclusion. The False Claims Act allows the Executive Branch control to address challenges under the take care clause. It outlines liability for various fraudulent acts, including presenting false claims for payment or approval, making false records, conspiring to commit violations, and delivering less than all government property or money. The False Claims Act outlines liability for fraudulent acts such as presenting false claims, making false records, and knowingly deceiving the government, resulting in civil penalties and damages. The False Claims Act outlines liability for fraudulent acts, including presenting false claims and deceiving the government, resulting in civil penalties and damages. The Adjustment Act of 1990 allows for penalties up to 3 times the damages caused by the violation, with reduced damages possible if the violator cooperates and provides information promptly. The False Claims Act allows for penalties of not less than 2 times the damages sustained by the Government due to fraudulent acts. Violators are also liable for the costs of civil actions brought to recover penalties or damages. The Act defines \"knowing\" and \"knowingly\" as having actual knowledge, acting in deliberate ignorance, or reckless disregard of the truth. The False Claims Act defines \"obligation\" as a duty arising from a contractual or grantor-grantee relationship, excluding compensation for Federal employment or income subsidies with no restrictions on use. The False Claims Act defines \"obligation\" as a duty arising from a contractual or grantor-grantee relationship. Any information furnished pursuant to this obligation is exempt from disclosure. The Attorney General is responsible for investigating violations under section 3729 and may bring a civil action against the violator. This section does not apply to claims, records, or statements made under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 on behalf of the United States Government. The complaint must be filed in camera, remain under seal for at least 60 days, and not be served on the defendant until ordered by the court. The Government has the option to intervene within 60 days after receiving the complaint and evidence. The Government may request extensions to keep the complaint under seal. The defendant has 20 days to respond after the complaint is unsealed. The Government must decide to proceed with the action within 60 days or allow the person who brought the action to proceed. No one other than the Government can intervene in the action. If the Government proceeds with the action in a qui tam case, it has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action and can dismiss or settle the action despite objections from the person who initiated it. Only the Government can intervene in the action. The court may hold a hearing to determine if a proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable. Restrictions on the person initiating the action's participation may be imposed if it interferes with the Government's prosecution. If the person initiating the action's participation would cause harassment or undue burden, the court may limit their involvement. If the Government chooses not to proceed, the person can continue the action. The Government may intervene later with good cause. Discovery actions by the person may be restricted if the Government shows it is necessary. If the Government shows that the person's discovery actions would interfere with their investigation or prosecution, the court can stay discovery for up to 60 days. The court can extend this period if the Government is diligently pursuing the investigation and the proposed discovery would interfere. The Government can choose to pursue its claim through other remedies, such as administrative proceedings for civil penalties. If the Government proceeds with an action brought by a person under subsection (b), such person shall receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim. The court may award up to 10 percent of the proceeds to a person who substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action based on specific information, but not more than 25 percent overall. The payment will be made from the proceeds. The court may award a person up to 10 percent of the proceeds for contributing to the prosecution of the action. The person may also receive reasonable expenses, attorneys' fees, and costs, which will be paid by the defendant. If the Government does not proceed with the action, the person bringing the action will receive a reasonable amount for collecting the civil penalty and damages, not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds. The court may reduce the share of proceeds for a person who planned and initiated the violation of section 3729, and if convicted of criminal conduct, they will be dismissed from the civil action. The United States can continue the action if the Government does not proceed. The court may award attorneys' fees to the defendant if the person bringing the action is found to be frivolous or vexatious. Certain actions are barred, including those against members of the armed forces or government officials based on known evidence. The court may dismiss an action under this section if the allegations were publicly disclosed in a federal hearing or report. The action cannot be based on known evidence against government officials. The Government is not liable for expenses incurred in bringing an action under this section, and fees and expenses may be awarded to the prevailing defendant in civil actions. An \"original source\" is defined as an individual who voluntarily discloses information to the Government before a public disclosure or who has independent knowledge that adds to publicly disclosed allegations. In civil actions brought under this section, fees and expenses may be awarded to the prevailing defendant. Any employee, contractor, or agent discriminated against for lawful acts done in furtherance of an action under this section is entitled to relief including reinstatement and back pay. The prevailing defendant in civil actions may be awarded fees and expenses. Discriminated employees are entitled to relief, including reinstatement, back pay, interest, and compensation for special damages. A civil action must be filed within 3 years of retaliation. Subpenas for witnesses can be served nationwide. Civil actions under section 3730 have a limitation of 6 years after the violation or 3 years after the material facts are known. The statute of limitations for civil actions under section 3730 is 6 years after the violation or 3 years after the material facts are known. The Government may intervene and file its own complaint within 10 years after the violation is committed. In actions under section 3730, the United States must prove all elements of the cause of action, including damages, by a preponderance of the evidence. A final judgment in a criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements estops the defendant from denying the offense's essential elements in related civil actions under section 3730. Actions under section 3730 can be brought in any judicial district where the defendant can be found. District courts have jurisdiction over actions under state law for the recovery of funds paid by a State or local government. Service on State or local authorities is required in certain cases. In actions under section 3730, a seal ordered by the court shall not prevent the Government or the person bringing the action from serving the complaint and evidence to law enforcement authorities authorized to investigate and prosecute such cases. The Attorney General can request relevant material for false claims law investigations. Before commencing a civil proceeding under false claims law, the Attorney General or a designee may issue a civil investigative demand requiring the production of documentary material, written interrogatories, oral testimony, or a combination of these. The authority to issue demands may be delegated, and if a demand includes a product of discovery, it must be served by specified officials. The Deputy Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General must serve a copy of a demand for discovery in any authorized manner to the person from whom the discovery was obtained. Information obtained under this section can be shared with a qui tam relator if deemed necessary for a false claims act investigation. Each civil investigative demand must specify the nature of the alleged violation and the applicable law. If the demand is for documentary material, it must describe the material to be produced. The demand for discovery must be specific in describing the material to be produced, setting a reasonable return date, and identifying the false claims law investigator. If the demand is for written interrogatories, it must specify the questions, submission dates, and investigator. For oral testimony, the demand must include the date, time, and place for testimony to begin. The demand for oral testimony must include the date, time, and place for testimony to begin, identify the false claims law investigator, specify the purpose of the demand, and notify the person of their right to be accompanied by an attorney. Additionally, any civil investigative demand for discovery cannot be returned until 20 days after it has been served. The civil investigative demand for oral testimony must include the date, time, and place for testimony to begin, with a minimum of seven days notice unless exceptional circumstances warrant a shorter period. The Attorney General can only issue one demand for oral testimony unless the person requests more or it is deemed necessary after investigation. The civil investigative demand may not require the production of documentary material, answers to written interrogatories, or oral testimony if protected from disclosure under certain standards. Such demand supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, or provision of law preventing disclosure of the product of discovery. The civil investigative demand allows for the disclosure of discovery materials, but this does not waive any rights to resist further discovery. The demand can be served by a false claims law investigator or a US marshal within the jurisdiction of any US court, including in foreign countries according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to enforce compliance with civil investigative demands issued to legal entities by delivering them to authorized individuals within the entity. Service of process can be done on partnerships, corporations, associations, or entities by delivering a demand or petition to their principal office, or by registered mail. For natural persons, service can be made by delivering the demand or petition in person or by registered mail to their residence or office. Proof of service must be verified. Proof of service for civil investigative demands must be verified, including the manner of service and delivery receipt for demands served by registered or certified mail. Documentary material must be produced under a sworn certificate by the individual or authorized person with knowledge of the facts. The certificate must verify the production of all required documentary material in response to a civil investigative demand. The person served with the demand must make the material available for inspection and copying at their principal place of business or another agreed-upon location. The false claims law investigator may prescribe a return date for material requested in a civil investigative demand. Interrogatories must be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, with objections stated in a sworn certificate. All required information must be provided in response to the demand. The civil investigative demand must include all required information, and any omitted information must be clearly identified with reasons for its omission. Oral examinations under the demand must be conducted before an authorized officer who will record the testimony stenographically. The testimony of the witness must be taken stenographically and transcribed. The transcript shall be promptly transmitted to the custodian. Only specific individuals are allowed during the examination, including the person giving testimony, their attorney, the Government's attorney, agreed-upon individuals, the officer, and the stenographer. The oral testimony taken under a civil investigative demand must be conducted in the person's judicial district or another agreed-upon location. The witness is allowed to review and make changes to the transcript with the false claims law investigator present. The witness can review and make changes to the transcript of their oral testimony taken under a civil investigative demand, with the false claims law investigator present. If the witness does not sign the transcript within 30 days, the officer or investigator will sign it and note the reason for the lack of signature. The officer certifies the transcript as a true record of the testimony given and promptly delivers it to the custodian. The false claims law investigator shall deliver the transcript to the custodian. Witnesses can obtain a copy of the transcript upon payment. Witnesses can have counsel present during oral testimony and can object to questions on the record. When a person objects to answering a question, they must state the reason briefly for the record. Objections can be made based on legal rights or privileges, such as the privilege against self-incrimination. If a person refuses to answer, a petition can be filed in court to compel them. Witness fees and allowances are also provided for those appearing for oral testimony. The Attorney General designates a false claims law investigator as custodian of documentary material, answers, and transcripts received under this section. Additional investigators may be designated as necessary. The custodian designated by the Attorney General is responsible for receiving and handling documentary material, answers, and transcripts obtained under this section. They may prepare copies for official use by authorized investigators or Department of Justice employees. The material is not available for access while in the custodian's possession. The custodian designated by the Attorney General handles documentary material, answers, and transcripts obtained under this section. The material is available for examination by individuals other than false claims law investigators or Department of Justice employees, with consent from the producer. Disclosure to Congress or other agencies is allowed for statutory responsibilities. The custodian designated by the Attorney General handles documentary material, answers, and transcripts obtained under this section. The material is available for examination by individuals with consent from the producer. Delivery of material to Department of Justice attorneys for use in legal proceedings is permitted. The custodian designated by the Attorney General handles documentary material, answers, and transcripts obtained under this section. The material is available for examination by individuals with consent from the producer. Department of Justice attorneys may use the material for legal proceedings and must return it after the case is completed. The custodian designated by the Attorney General handles documentary material, answers, and transcripts obtained under this section. If no case is initiated after examination of the material, the custodian must return it to the producer upon request. In case of custodian's death or separation from service, a successor custodian is appointed. The Attorney General designates a custodian to handle material obtained under a civil investigative demand. If the custodian is relieved of duty, a successor is appointed with the same responsibilities. In judicial proceedings, a petition for enforcement can be filed.
