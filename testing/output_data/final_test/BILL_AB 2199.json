Any person 21 or older engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under 16 may face misdemeanor or felony charges, with potential imprisonment for up to four years. If the perpetrator holds a position of authority over the minor, an additional two-year jail term may be imposed. An adult in a position of authority who engages in sexual intercourse with a minor may face civil penalties. Undue influence can include affection, intimidation, coercion, or deceit. An adult engaging in unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor may face civil penalties ranging from $2,000 to $25,000 based on the age difference between them.
