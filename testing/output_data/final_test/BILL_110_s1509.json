Congress finds that scatterometers on satellites are advanced radar instruments that use high-frequency microwave pulses to measure wind velocity on the ocean surface. These instruments provide continuous, accurate, and high-resolution measurements of wind speeds and directions, surpassing the capabilities of ships and buoys. The Quick Scatterometer satellite (QuikSCAT) was launched in 1999 to replace the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Scatterometer (NSCAT). The QuikSCAT satellite, launched in 1999, aims to improve weather forecasts near coastlines using wind data. It was built in 12 months with a 3-year design life but continues to operate 5 years past its projected lifespan, providing daily coverage of 90% of the world's oceans. The QuikSCAT satellite, launched in 1999, has been crucial for National Weather Service forecasts since 2000. Despite exceeding its expected lifespan, a replacement is urgently needed as without it, hurricane forecasting accuracy would decrease significantly. According to recommendations in the National Academies of Science report entitled \"Decadal Survey\", a next generation ocean surface wind vector satellite mission is needed during the three year period beginning in 2013. The area expected to be under hurricane danger would rise from 136 miles to 150 miles on average with a 10 percent loss of accuracy at 48 hours before landfall. This inaccuracy could lead to more \"false alarm\" evacuations and decrease the possibility of impacted populations heeding mandatory evacuations. A next generation ocean surface vector wind satellite is needed to enhance the capabilities of the National Hurricane Center and improve warnings for coastal residents about possible hurricanes. A next generation ocean surface vector wind satellite is required to enhance the National Hurricane Center's capabilities and improve hurricane warnings for coastal residents. SEC. 3 outlines a program for an improved ocean surface winds vector satellite. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in consultation with other agencies, is required to carry out a program for an improved ocean surface winds vector satellite. The program aims to address science questions, improve forecasting for hurricanes and weather-related disasters, and ensure satellite ocean quality continuity. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is required to ensure quality continuity for satellite ocean surface vector wind measurements, advance data capabilities, and address other relevant matters. Annual reports must be submitted to the Senate and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must submit annual reports to the Senate and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the satellite program. The reports should include details on program funding, satellite operational status, capabilities, and anticipated lifespan, as well as current and proposed uses of the satellite. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must submit annual reports to the Senate and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the satellite program, including details on program funding, satellite operational status, capabilities, anticipated lifespan, current and proposed uses of the satellite by various entities, and any other relevant matters. Authorization of $375,000,000 is provided for the program."
