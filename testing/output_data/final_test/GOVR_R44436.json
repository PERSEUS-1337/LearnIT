    "content": "The landslide victory of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) in Burma's parliamentary elections in 2015 may lead to changes in U.S. policies towards Burma. The NLD now has control over both chambers of the Union Parliament, but the military still holds significant power under the 2008 constitution. The Tatmadaw's potential restrictions on an NLD-led government's reforms, the constitution's transition period, and implications for U.S. policy towards Burma post-election. The text discusses considerations for the Obama Administration and Congress regarding relaxing restrictions on relations with Burma, consulting Aung San Suu Kyi on U.S. policy, supporting initiatives by the Thein Sein government, and potential new programs in Burma during the transition period. The text discusses potential considerations for the U.S. government regarding engagement with the Burmese military, sanctions on individuals from the Thein Sein government, and opportunities for Congress to weigh in on U.S. policy toward Burma. The 2015 parliamentary elections in Burma led to the election of members for the Union Parliament and state/regional parliaments. Various U.S. legislation, such as the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act and the JADE Act, have imposed restrictions on U.S. relations with Burma. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 includes specific language on Burma, maintaining restrictions while calling for new forms of engagement. No standalone legislation on Burma has been introduced in the 114th Congress, leaving room for the Obama Administration to adjust U.S. policies towards Burma based on the election results. The 2015 parliamentary elections in Burma saw over 90 political parties and 6,000 candidates competing for seats in the Union Parliament and state/regional parliaments. More than 23 million people voted, with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning a landslide victory, securing majority seats in all levels of government. The National League for Democracy (NLD) won over 75% of elected seats in state and regional parliaments, while President Thein Sein's Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) secured fewer seats. Ethnic minority-based parties had limited success, with the NLD dominating election results in most regions. The NLD won a majority of seats in state and regional parliaments, with victories in eastern Shan State and northern Rakhine State. The USDP secured fewer seats, while ethnic minority-based parties had limited success. The NLD won 60% of seats in the National Assembly and 58% in the People's Assembly, giving them the ability to pass legislation without support from other parties. The NLD's majority in both chambers allows them to pass legislation without support from other parties, enabling them to implement political and economic reforms. They can also nominate two out of three candidates for Burma's next President as per the 2008 constitution. The Union Parliament will nominate a third candidate for President, with the NLD expected to make the selection due to their majority. However, amending the constitution requires approval from military members who hold 25% of the seats, giving them veto power. Additionally, some constitutional amendments need approval from a majority of eligible voters. The election results have potential implications for Burma's future. The new Union Parliament in Burma will have over 100 ex-political prisoners, 64 women, 26 returning MPs, and no Muslims. The presence of ex-political prisoners may pressure the government to address the status of alleged political prisoners and revise laws used for arrests. The lack of women and Muslims could hinder efforts to address discriminatory laws, while the absence of returning members may offer a chance to adopt more democratic procedures. The NLD made efforts to field ethnic candidates in States with minority populations. Aung San Suu Kyi plans to collaborate with ethnic parties in forming a government. State Parliaments could play a role in resource administration and local communication. The extent of ethnic representation in future governance remains uncertain. The NLD won majorities in Regional and State Parliaments, with appointed military members as the largest opposition. The party ranks second in Rakhine State and third in Shan State. The President appoints Chief Ministers for Regions and States, pending approval from the respective Parliament. The NLD government may utilize Regional and State Parliaments for political and economic reform in various regions, facing challenges in Rakhine State and Shan State. These Parliaments could aid in communication with ethnic armed groups for national reconciliation efforts and provide insights on policy options. Additionally, they may play a role in addressing economic priorities such as agriculture. The NLD government aims to address economic priorities like agriculture and land reform in Burma, where most of the population is involved in agriculture but many do not own land. The constitution grants authority over land administration to the Union Parliament and over land revenue to Regional or State Parliaments. This is crucial for improving the standard of living for agricultural workers and increasing productivity. The NLD government in Burma aims to address economic priorities such as agriculture and land reform. The Regional and State Parliaments are expected to be involved in this process due to their constitutional authority. The transition to a new government, outlined in the 2008 constitution, includes the election of a new President, Htin Kyaw, who will take office on March 30, 2016. Until then, Thein Sein remains President. The legal framework for the transition to a new government in Burma is outlined in the 2008 constitution. Election laws also contain relevant provisions. After the election, the next step is confirming the results and resolving any appeals. The constitution states that decisions by the Union Election Commission are final, including appeals of election results. Candidates have 45 days to appeal after the official results are announced. The UEC announced final results on November 20, 2015, giving candidates until January 4, 2016, to appeal. Over 200 complaints were received, including 45 against election winners. After the election, the Union Election Commission received over 200 complaints, with at least 45 cases against the election winners. The UEC continues to hear and render decisions on election cases, while the Union Parliament members were sworn into office in early February 2016. Key positions were quickly filled, including the selection of the President and two Vice Presidents as one of the main orders of business for the new Union Parliament. Section 60 of the constitution outlines the selection process for the President and two Vice Presidents by the \"Presidential Electoral College,\" consisting of elected members of the People's Assembly, National Assembly, and appointed military members. Each group selects a candidate who meets the qualifications specified in Section 59, with Aung San Suu Kyi effectively excluded. The Union Parliament then chooses the President by a simple majority vote from the three candidates, with the remaining two becoming Vice Presidents. The Union Parliament selected Htin Kyaw as President, Henry Van Thio as Vice President, and Myint Swe as First Vice President on March 15, 2016. Htin Kyaw, elected as President, will serve alongside First Vice President Myint Swe and Second Vice President Henry Van Thio under Burma's constitution. The term of office for the President and Vice Presidents is five years, with the current officials continuing until the new President is duly elected. Htin Kyaw will be sworn in on March 30, 2016, and will nominate Union Ministers and Chief Ministers for approval by the respective Parliaments. Htin Kyaw submitted 18 names, including Aung San Suu Kyi, for Union Ministers, confirmed by Parliament on March 24, 2016. Commander-in-Chief nominated Defence, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs Ministers. NLD members appointed as Chief Ministers, except for Kachin State. The selection of NLD member Nyi Pu as Chief Minister for Rakhine State upset the Arakan National Party. Aung San Suu Kyi's future role as leader of the NLD-led government was accepted by key officials. Speculation arose about a process for her to become President. Aung San Suu Kyi's potential selection as President involved amending the constitution's Section 59(f) and gaining approval through a referendum. An alternative option discussed was to \"suspend\" Section 59(f) to allow her presidency, a move supported by the Burmese military and USDP. Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing met multiple times but couldn't agree on terms for her presidency. The constitution was not amended, and the selection of candidates for President and Vice President was moved up, indicating a shift in strategy by Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD. President-Elect Htin Kyaw nominated Aung San Suu Kyi among 18 others for government positions. After multiple meetings, Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing failed to agree on her presidency terms. The constitution remained unchanged, and the selection of candidates for President and Vice President was expedited, signaling a new approach by Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD. President-Elect Htin Kyaw nominated Aung San Suu Kyi for various ministerial positions, including Foreign Minister, Education Minister, Minister for Electric Power and Energy, and President's Office Minister. The transition period allowed for the passing of new legislation by the outgoing Union Parliament and President Thein Sein. Several laws were enacted, such as a supplementary budget and amendments to laws on judicial evidence, mining, and tariffs. Additionally, a bill granting more powers to the Burmese military was under consideration. The Ministry of Home Affairs introduced a bill granting outgoing Presidents lifetime immunity from prosecution for alleged crimes committed while in office. The legislation, passed on January 28, 2016, also provided protective services for Thein Sein. Another bill discussed aimed to give more power to the Burmese military through administrative changes. The NDSC, established by the constitution, consists of 11 members with various powers, including limited oversight of the President. A proposed law aims to restrict the President's voting rights within the NDSC to break a tie, currently delayed for consideration by the new Union Parliament. Critics view this as an attempt to limit the power of the future NLD. Critics of the proposed legislation believe it aims to limit the future NLD President's power and strengthen the military's authority. The NDSC membership is skewed towards the military, with key members effectively under the Commander-in-Chief's control. The bill would reduce the chances of a tie vote in the NDSC, diminishing the President's influence. Another bill would transfer the Ministry of Immigration to the Ministry of Home Affairs, further consolidating military control. President Thein Sein supported this move. Thein Sein supported a bill for national security, but it was not passed before the Union Parliament dissolved. Challenges for the new government include ending civil war, managing relations with the military, ethnic and religious issues, political prisoners, IDPs, and economic reforms. Burma has been in a low-grade civil war since gaining independence in 1948, with the key issue being the autonomy of ethnic States. The 1947 Panglong Agreement promised autonomy to the ethnic States in exchange for joining the Union of Burma, but some groups felt the central government did not uphold this agreement, leading to the formation of ethnic militias for protection. The Burmese military seized power in 1962 to preserve the Union of Burma's integrity. Over the next 40 years, they alternated between fighting and negotiating with ethnic militias, leading to deep mistrust. President Thein Sein broke several ceasefires but established the UPWC in 2011 to negotiate new agreements. The UPWC was established in 2011 to negotiate ceasefire agreements with ethnic organizations and their militias. By 2015, a ceasefire agreement was signed with 8 out of 21 ethnic organizations interested in the NCA. The Thein Sein government has been working on peace negotiations following the NCA timeline. The Burmese military has initiated military assaults against non-signatory ethnic militias since the NCA was signed in 2015. Fighting has occurred between the military and various ethnic groups, with the Commander-in-Chief referring to the conflict as \"a just war.\" The Tatmadaw announced it would continue its offensive attacks. Aung San Suu Kyi prioritizes peace process, aims for inclusive ceasefire agreement and effective peace conference to unify Burma. She seeks to fulfill her father's vision and build relations with the Burmese military. Aung San Suu Kyi has met with key military figures, including Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and retired Senior General Than Shwe, who expressed support for her becoming the future leader. Despite this, managing relations with the Burmese military poses challenges for Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD due to the military's significant presence in the Union Parliament. The Burmese military holds significant power in the Union Parliament, with effective veto power over constitutional amendments. They operate with almost complete autonomy from the President and Parliament, with the constitution granting them the right to participate in national political leadership. The Burmese military holds significant power in the Union Parliament, with effective veto power over constitutional amendments. They operate independently and designate the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services as the \"Supreme Commander\" of all armed forces. The Commander-in-Chief appoints members to the Union Parliament and recommends persons for key security ministries, potentially hindering the NLD-led government's policy implementation. The Tatmadaw's military operations against ethnic militias could impede progress in the peace process. The Burmese military's influence in the Union Parliament may obstruct constitutional amendments and governance changes desired by the NLD. Tensions between the NLD and military MPs were evident when an NLD MP questioned the rapid sale of state-owned lands for military projects. Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD must find common ground with the military to implement desired reforms. The military's influence in the Union Parliament may hinder NLD's desired governance changes. State-owned lands were sold for military projects, leading to tensions with NLD MPs. Myint Swe, a military candidate for President, has close ties to the former military junta leader. Myint Swe, a military candidate for President with close ties to the former military junta leader, is viewed as an anti-reform hardliner likely to resist NLD efforts to reduce the military's role in Burma's government. He is on the U.S. Department of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals list and is involved in the increased ethnic and religious tensions in Burma since 2011. The Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Rakhine State, have been heavily impacted by ethnic and religious tensions in Burma. The Buddhist organization Ma Ba Tha, led by Wirathu, has fueled these tensions by promoting the protection of Theravada Buddhism from perceived threats, including Islam. In 2015, Ma Ba Tha successfully influenced the passing of four laws aimed at protecting race and religion. Thein Sein approved race and religion protection laws in Burma, criticized for curtailing Muslim rights. Ma Ba Tha accused of advocating violence against Muslims, denies allegations. Ethnic and religious tensions persist in Burma, with ongoing fighting between military and militias leading to internal displacement. Over 100,000 people in Rakhine State remain in inadequate resettlement camps. In summer 2015, Rohingya refugees attempted to leave Burma by sea, sparking a regional crisis. Concerns remain about the conditions for Rohingya in Rakhine State. The NLD-led government faces challenges in addressing ethnic and religious tensions, especially in Rakhine State. The new Union Parliament has fewer members from ethnic parties and no Muslim members. Observers worry that NLD members may prioritize party interests over ethnic concerns. The situation in Rakhine State, where the Arakan National Party is active, is particularly concerning. The Arakan National Party (ANP) in Rakhine State won a majority of seats and pressured the NLD to appoint one of their members as Chief Minister. The lack of Muslim MPs and strong ANP presence in Parliament concerns the Rohingya. The NLD chose Nyi Pu as Chief Minister, sparking discussions with ANP leaders. Thein Sein government in Burma released thousands of political prisoners between 2011 and 2016. Despite promises to free all prisoners of conscience by the end of the year, concerns remain about the treatment of political detainees in Myanmar. Despite Thein Sein's promise to release all political prisoners in Myanmar by the end of the year, concerns persist as 87 individuals were imprisoned and 409 were facing trial as of February 18, 2016. Many detainees are accused of violating laws dating back to British colonial rule or the military juntas, as well as post-2011 legislation like the Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Law. The NLD has pledged to address this issue once in power. The NLD promised to define political prisoners, secure their release, and prevent new arrests. However, concerns remain about the government's ability to stop new arrests due to the police force's allegiance to the military. The Former Political Prisoner Society expressed worry about continued arrests of protesters. Burma had nearly 670,000 internally displaced people. Burma had nearly 670,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan States as of March 2015, mainly due to civil war and unrest. Cyclone Komen in 2015 added 40,000 IDPs, but many have resettled. Access to humanitarian aid for IDPs has been limited, with the military blocking relief efforts in conflict areas. IDPs lack adequate food, water, and medical care. In Rakhine State, IDPs face inadequate supplies of food, water, and limited medical care. Local authorities restrict humanitarian aid to prevent violence outbreaks. International relief organizations were attacked by Rakhine mobs in 2014, leading to the expulsion of Doctors Without Borders. Despite negotiations, access to Rohingya in IDP camps remains limited. The NLD-led government in Burma faces pressure to increase humanitarian assistance to IDPs in Rakhine State, but challenges persist due to ongoing fighting in Kachin and Shan States. The provision of aid to Rohingya in IDP camps is limited, with objections from some members of the Rakhine community. The Arakan National Party (ANP) is likely to resist efforts to provide aid to the Rohingya. Burma's history of military rule has led to economic decline, transforming the country into one of the region's poorest nations. Prior to March 2011, Burma's military junta transferred ownership of valuable assets to military-owned companies or close associates. Key sectors controlled by these entities include oil, natural gas, mining, banking, finance, and port operations. Despite reports of corruption and inefficiency, these companies remain profitable due to lack of competition. Burma also faces significant wealth and income disparities, with most of its population living in rural areas and working in agriculture. Since the Thein Sein government took power in 2011, Burma has seen an increase in its official gross domestic product (GDP) annual growth rate from about 5% to more than 8%, but income and wealth inequality remains high. The government's economic reforms focused on promoting growth and attracting foreign investment rather than poverty reduction or combatting corruption and inefficiency. Land ownership is concentrated, with agribusinesses, often tied to the military, controlling much of the nation's farmland. Urban areas in Burma also face high income inequality. The NLD government in Burma aims to prioritize agricultural and land reform, increase productivity, reduce government spending, privatize state-owned enterprises transparently, improve transparency and accountability, enhance the financial system, and develop critical infrastructure. The US policy towards Burma focuses on promoting a democratically elected civilian government that respects human rights. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act imposed sanctions on Burma's militia junta until measurable progress towards a democratic government is made, including releasing political prisoners and allowing freedom of speech and religion. The JADE Act imposed additional sanctions until certain conditions are met. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act imposed sanctions on Burma's military junta until specific conditions are met, including the release of political prisoners and dialogue with democratic forces. The uncertain transition period in Burma poses challenges for U.S. policy formulation and congressional oversight. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 maintains provisions from past legislation regarding assistance to Burma, while addressing issues like the treatment of the Rohingya. Factors influencing potential changes in U.S. policy towards Burma include the consistency of outgoing Union Parliament legislation with U.S. objectives, executive actions by President Thein Sein, and the relationship between Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's new government. The condensed text chunk focuses on key aspects such as the relationship between Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's new President, Htin Kyaw, the Burmese military's conduct during the transition period, the NLD-led government's approach to the peace process, addressing ethnic and religious tensions, and economic reforms. U.S. policy towards Burma is also mentioned in the context of past legislation and potential changes. The condensed text chunk discusses the role of key individuals in U.S. policy towards Burma, including President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi, and reformers. Critics question President Thein Sein's status as a reformer, highlighting the political and economic reforms in Burma from 2011 to 2015. The 2015 reforms in Burma aimed to maintain military control while allowing limited civilian participation to lift U.S. sanctions. The future of U.S. policy in Burma may hinge on key individuals' alignment with American interests. The future of U.S. policy towards Burma in 2016 may be influenced by factors such as the timing of the NLD-led government assuming power and the limited time left in the current U.S. Administration's term. Congress and the Obama Administration's focus on developing and implementing changes in U.S. policy towards Burma remains uncertain due to the upcoming election year in the United States. The future of U.S. policy towards Burma in 2016 is uncertain. Congress has limited time to consider legislation, and the Obama Administration has a short window to revisit and potentially change U.S. policy on Burma. This appendix provides a detailed breakdown of the 2015 election results for the Union Parliament and Regional and State Parliaments."
