    "content": "The \"Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit. The Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 introduces a credit for qualified new investments in rural microbusinesses, equal to 35% of the investment amount, with limitations on the maximum credit per business and per taxpayer. The Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 allows a tax credit for qualified new investments in rural microbusinesses, capped at $10,000 per year per taxpayer. Qualified new investment is defined as the excess of qualified expenditures for the current year over the previous year's expenditures. The Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 allows a tax credit for qualified new investments in rural microbusinesses. Qualified expenditures include costs for capital plant and equipment, inventory expenses, and wages. If the microbusiness was not in existence for the entire 3-year period, the credit is applied based on the period it was in existence. The Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 provides a tax credit for qualified new investments in rural microbusinesses. Qualified expenditures include costs for capital plant and equipment, inventory expenses, and wages. The term 'rural microbusiness' refers to a trade or business carried out in a distressed rural area for the first taxable year when the credit is allowable. The Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 offers a tax credit for investments in rural microbusinesses meeting specific criteria, including gross revenue, employee count, and ownership structure. The Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 provides a tax credit for investments in rural microbusinesses meeting certain criteria. For the purpose of the act, all persons considered a single employer under specific sections shall be treated as a trade or business. Exceptions to this definition include businesses such as golf courses, country clubs, massage parlors, and gambling facilities. The gross revenue test for a trade or business under the Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 states that the average annual gross revenue should not exceed $1,000,000 over a 3-taxable year period. The gross revenue test for a trade or business under the Rural Microbusiness Investment Credit Act of 2010 states that if the average annual gross revenue over a 3-taxable year period does not exceed $1,000,000, certain aggregation rules apply for entities treated as a single employer. Special rules also apply for entities not in existence for the entire 3-year period. Self-employed individuals are also considered under this paragraph. For purposes of determining employee status in a trade or business, an individual is treated as an employee if certain conditions are met. The term \"full-time equivalent employee\" is defined as the total number of hours worked by employees divided by 2,080. The Secretary will determine employee hours of service, rounding to the next lowest whole number if needed. Excess hours over 2,080 in a year are not counted. Regulations will be provided for employees not paid hourly. A distressed rural area is defined as an area in the United States that has experienced population loss, low median family income, high poverty rate, and elevated unemployment. The term \"distressed rural area\" excludes cities or towns with a population over 50,000 inhabitants or urbanized areas adjacent to such cities. Determination of distressed rural areas relies on recent data from the Census Bureau, Labor Statistics Bureau, or other relevant government entities. The taxpayer must materially participate in the qualified rural microbusiness to be eligible for the credit. No double benefits are allowed for the same amount under any other tax provision. The credit under this section is not allowed if a deduction is allowable to another taxpayer for the same amount in the same calendar year. Married couples must file a joint return to qualify for the credit. The credit is part of the general business credit. The rural microbusiness investment credit is added to the tax code, with provisions for carryover of unused credit for up to 5 years. The tax code is amended to extend the taxable years for certain provisions, with a conforming amendment to the table of sections. The tax code is amended to extend taxable years for certain provisions, including the Rural microbusiness investment credit, effective for expenditures made after the enactment of this Act."
