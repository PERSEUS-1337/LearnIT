    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ADA Amendments Act of 2008\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities and provide broad coverage. It recognized that disabilities should not hinder participation in society due to prejudice or barriers. The definition of disability under the ADA was expected to be interpreted consistently with how courts had applied the definition of handicap. The ADA aimed to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities and provide broad coverage. However, Supreme Court cases have narrowed the scope of protection intended by the ADA, leading to incorrect findings that individuals with impairments are not considered disabled. The ADA aims to reinstate broad protection against discrimination for individuals with disabilities, rejecting the Supreme Court's narrow interpretation in cases like Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc. The goal is to ensure clear and enforceable standards addressing discrimination and to broaden the scope of coverage under the definition of disability. The curr_chunk discusses the rejection of strict standards for defining disability under the ADA, citing the Supreme Court's reasoning in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline. This contrasts with the Court's stance in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, emphasizing a broader view of disability. The curr_chunk proposes a new definition of \"substantially limits\" in the ADA to move away from the strict standard set by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams. The curr_chunk amends the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by redefining physical or mental disabilities and removing certain paragraphs. The curr_chunk defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activities, clarifies the term \"substantially limits\" as materially restricts, and lists examples of major life activities. The curr_chunk further elaborates on major life activities, including major bodily functions, and defines being regarded as having an impairment under the Act. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of disability under the Act, including exemptions for transitory and minor impairments. It also emphasizes the broad construction of the definition to achieve the remedial purposes of the Act. The curr_chunk explains that an impairment does not need to limit multiple major life activities to be considered a disability. It also states that an episodic or remission impairment can be a disability if it substantially limits a major life activity when active. Additionally, the determination of impairment should not consider the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures. The curr_chunk discusses the use of assistive technology, reasonable accommodations, and learned behavioral modifications for individuals with disabilities. It also mentions that the effects of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses should be considered when determining if an impairment substantially limits a major life activity. The curr_chunk defines \"ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses\" as lenses intended to correct visual acuity and \"low-vision devices\" as devices that magnify or enhance visual images. The curr_chunk defines \"additional definitions\" related to visual aids, such as ordinary eyeglasses, contact lenses, and low-vision devices. The curr_chunk defines auxiliary aids and services as including interpreters, readers, equipment, and similar services for individuals with impairments.
