    "content": "The MBTA, enacted in 1918 to protect migratory birds between the US and Canada, has expanded to include treaties with Mexico, Japan, and Russia. The Department of the Interior administers the program covering 1,027 bird species. This report discusses legal issues related to the MBTA's prohibition on \"takes\" of migratory birds and the federal government's obligations and criminal penalties under the statute. The MBTA prohibits the taking and killing of migratory birds, with provisions addressing enforcement, penalties, and regulations. It is unlawful to pursue, hunt, capture, kill, possess, sell, barter, ship, export, import, or transport migratory birds without permits. The MBTA prohibits the taking and killing of migratory birds, with regulations defining \"take\" as pursuing, hunting, shooting, trapping, or capturing. Federal agencies must comply with MBTA provisions if their actions negatively impact migratory birds. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with FWS aims to minimize intentional and unintentional take of migratory birds, as defined by the MBTA. FWS's position is that the MBTA applies to incidental take that is not the purpose of an otherwise lawful activity. DOI has regulations for prescribed migratory bird hunting and permits for taking birds under certain circumstances. The FWS has regulations and permit schemes for various activities involving migratory birds, including hunting, import/export, scientific collecting, falconry, and population control. Special purpose permits are required for activities not covered by these categories, with a focus on the benefit to the bird resource or important research reasons. Additionally, incidental take by the Armed Forces is authorized during military-readiness activities. The FWS enforces the MBTA which does not have a citizen suit provision, but civil suits can be brought under the APA. Violations of the MBTA can result in felony or misdemeanor penalties. Under Section 707(a), violations of the MBTA can result in misdemeanor penalties of up to $15,000 and/or six months in jail. Felony provisions in Section 707(b) apply to entities knowingly selling or bartering migratory birds, with fines up to $2,000 and/or two years in jail. Government actions may unintentionally harm protected birds, raising questions about MBTA violations by federal agencies. Court opinions on this matter vary. The applicability of the MBTA to federal agencies is a subject of debate in courts. While some courts hold that federal agencies are not subject to the MBTA's penalty provisions, others require compliance with the MBTA take prohibitions. In Sierra Club v. Martin, the U.S. Forest Service's activities were challenged for violating the MBTA using the APA's Section 706. In Sierra Club v. Martin, the Eleventh Circuit denied review under the APA, stating that an agency's actions must be subject to the law to be considered not in accordance with it. The court reversed an injunction, ruling that federal agencies and officials are not subject to the MBTA according to the statute's plain meaning and legislative intent. The court in Sierra Club v. Martin determined that the MBTA does not apply to federal agencies or officials, as it only prohibits individuals and entities from harming migratory birds. This decision was based on the lack of congressional intent to include the federal government in the statute's prohibitions, considering the historical context and the potential impact on federal obligations such as timber supply. The USFS must consider the impact of federal land management on migratory birds under NFMA and NEPA. NGOs alleged in Newton County Wildlife Association v. United States Forest Service that USFS violated the MBTA by not obtaining \"special permits\" for timber sales affecting nesting birds. The court determined jurisdiction under NFMA and questioned if USFS actions were arbitrary and capricious regarding MBTA obligations. The court ruled that sovereign governments are not subject to penalties under the MBTA, based on the term \"person\" not applying to them. It was concluded that the US government's obligation to comply with the treaty comes from the treaty itself, and federal agencies are not covered by the MBTA's take prohibitions. In Human e Society of the United States v. Glickman, the D.C. Circuit addressed whether federal agencies are subject to MBTA Section 703 prohibitions on killing or taking migratory birds without a permit. The court held that federal agencies are indeed subject to these prohibitions, despite not being subject to penalties under Section 707. The court ruled that federal agencies are subject to MBTA Section 703 prohibitions on killing or taking migratory birds without a permit, rejecting arguments that there were no means of enforcement without penalties or injunctive relief. The court disagreed with previous decisions and cited the APA and Supreme Court cases allowing for equitable relief. The court held that the agency violated the MBTA by failing to obtain a permit to take geese, citing the APA and Supreme Court cases allowing for equitable relief. The court disagreed with the Eleventh Circuit decision and emphasized that federal agencies are not exempt from MBTA prohibitions due to the U.S.-Canadian treaty. The MBTA applies to federal government actions, with courts distinguishing between intentional bird takings and regulatory actions related to third-party projects. Courts require permits for intentional takings but do not apply MBTA to regulatory actions not directly taking birds. Agencies are not obligated to ensure third-party compliance with the MBTA. In a recent Ninth Circuit case, environmental groups challenged the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for granting a right-of-way for a wind energy facility that could harm migratory birds. The court ruled in favor of the BLM, stating that regulatory actions do not create secondary liability under the MBTA if they do not directly cause harm to birds. The court ruled that the APA and MBTA do not impose an \"affirmative duty\" on BLM to ensure a grantee's future compliance with the MBTA. Similarly, a challenge against the Corps' Clean Water Act permit issuance was rejected by the U.S. District Court in Maine. The court found the connection between the Corps' permitting activity and harm to migratory birds too indirect to enforce the MBTA's prohibition on 'takes.' Litigation over energy projects often raises the question of federal agency liability under the MBTA when approving permits under separate regulatory programs. In Responsibility v. Beaudreu, the U.S. District Court rejected the claim that BOEM violated the MBTA by approving the Cape Wind energy project without a permit for taking migratory birds. The court held that BOEM did not violate the MBTA by approving a project that might result in bird takes. The D.C. Circuit did not address the MBTA issue as BOEM conceded a permit was required. Similarly, in Protect Our Communities Foundation v. Chu, the issue of MBTA permits was acknowledged. The U.S. District Court dismissed a claim that the Department of Energy needed an MBTA permit for a cross-border electric transmission line connecting a wind power project. Courts and FWS are reluctant to hold federal agencies responsible for third-party bird deaths during project construction. Agencies are not subject to MBTA prohibitions in their regulatory roles. The MBTA prohibits killing or taking migratory birds, punishable as misdemeanor crimes. Courts define \"taking\" as pursuing, hunting, shooting, killing, trapping, capturing, or collecting birds. Three types of actions leading to bird taking include direct intentional, direct unintentional, and indirect unintentional acts. Courts review different types of takings of migratory birds under the MBTA, considering plain meaning, statutory construction, legislative history, and constitutionality. Various federal court cases have addressed this issue, with FWS's regulatory definition prohibiting unpermitted direct and intentional actions like hunting, shooting, and trapping birds. The D.C. Circuit United States v. Glickman decision found that the Department of Agriculture's planned actions to capture and kill Canadian geese violated the MBTA by lacking a depredation permit. The MBTA prohibits intentional actions directed at protected migratory birds, with strict liability crimes under Section 703(a) not requiring guilty knowledge. The MBTA's Section 703(a) imposes strict liability crimes for possessing any part of a migratory bird without the need to prove intent. A 1997 court case affirmed this by convicting a defendant for possessing eagle feathers. The court ruled that no mens rea was required for a conviction. Additionally, unintentional deaths of migratory birds can also violate the MBTA, such as through baiting under Section 704(b). Prior to the 1998 MBTA amendments, courts did not require proof of intent for baiting to attract migratory birds. The amendments removed the strict liability standard, making it illegal to take birds by baiting if the person \"knows or reasonably should know\" the area is baited. The MBTA applies to incidental bird deaths during lawful activities, as seen in enforcement actions against wind energy developers like Duke Energy Renewables Inc. in 2013. In 2013, Duke Energy Renewables Inc. and PacifiCorp Energy were fined for violating the MBTA due to golden eagle deaths at wind projects in Wyoming. The ambiguity remains on whether the MBTA applies to incidental bird deaths from lawful activities. Courts in the Second and Tenth Circuits treat the taking of protected birds under the MBTA as strict liability crimes with varying limitations. In a 1978 case, the Second Circuit focused on the hazardous nature of pesticide manufacturing in relation to the MBTA. In United States v. FMC Corp., the court affirmed the conviction of a pesticide manufacturer for killing migratory birds by storing wastewater in a pond frequented by birds. The court likened the bird injuries to strict liability torts, emphasizing the lack of intention as a requirement under the MBTA Section 703. The MBTA Section 703 takings prohibition imposes strict liability for failing to prevent lethal chemicals in wastewater from harming migratory birds. Federal courts have limited strict liability by requiring acts to be the proximate cause of bird takings. Failure to take preventive measures in hazardous activities resulting in foreseeable bird takings is also viewed as a strict liability offense. For example, in United States v. Corbin Farm Service, the MBTA applied to such cases. In United States v. Corbin Farm Service, the court imposed strict liability for accidentally poisoning migratory ducks with pesticide, stating that the guilty act alone is sufficient to constitute a crime under the MBTA. The court emphasized that individuals using pesticides could foresee the danger to birds and take preventive measures. Similarly, in United States v. Moon Lake Electric Association, a rural electrical cooperative violated the MBTA by failing to prevent migratory birds from being electrocuted by power lines. The court in United States v. Moon Lake Electric Association upheld that the MBTA prohibits killing migratory birds by any means, including unintentional acts like electrocutions from power lines. The court emphasized that the law extends beyond intentional harmful acts like hunting and poaching, imposing strict liability for such incidents. The court in United States v. Moon Lake Electric Association upheld that the MBTA imposes strict liability for incidental takings of migratory birds, requiring the government to prove that the power lines caused the bird deaths. This decision limits the scope of criminal liability under the MBTA for unintentional acts like electrocutions. The court affirmed the conviction of oil drilling operators for violating the MBTA by having dead migratory birds in their equipment. The court ruled that the 'take' provision of the Act does not require intent. It also rejected the argument that the MBTA is unconstitutional due to lack of notice, stating that it criminalizes conduct leading to bird deaths without being vague. The court affirmed the conviction of oil drilling operators for violating the MBTA by having dead migratory birds in their equipment. The court ruled that the 'take' provision of the Act does not require intent and rejected the argument that the MBTA is unconstitutional due to lack of notice, stating that it criminalizes conduct leading to bird deaths without being vague. The court further concluded that a strict liability interpretation of the MBTA for the conduct charged satisfies due process only if defendants proximately caused harm to protected birds. Questions arise about what types of predicate acts can constitute a crime under the MBTA, with issues of notice and causation being analytically indistinct and crucial for due process constraints on criminal statutes. The court affirmed the conviction of oil drilling operators for violating the MBTA by having dead migratory birds in their equipment. The court held that liability under the MBTA requires proximate cause and that it was reasonably foreseeable that protected birds could be trapped in the operators' equipment. This interpretation of the MBTA ensures due process constraints on criminal statutes. Courts in the Eighth and Ninth Circuits interpret the MBTA's take prohibitions narrowly, focusing on deliberate and intentional actions like hunting and poaching. They argue that the MBTA only applies to direct and intentional harm to birds, not incidental or unintended effects. These courts compare the MBTA to the ESA, which specifically addresses incidental take of endangered species. The ESA's definition of \"take\" includes activities that harm or harass wildlife, while the MBTA is limited to intentional and direct actions. The Ninth Circuit limited the scope of the MBTA taking prohibition to direct and intentional actions, such as hunting and poaching. The court ruled that the MBTA does not prohibit selling and logging timber from lands that may provide suitable habitat for wildlife. The ESA addresses incidental take of endangered species, while the MBTA focuses on intentional and direct harm to birds. The court ruled that the MBTA only prohibits direct and intentional actions like hunting and poaching, not habitat modification or destruction. Unlike the ESA, the MBTA's definition of \"take\" does not include harm from habitat degradation. The court concluded that logging and selling timber, likely to destroy bird habitat, did not violate the MBTA. This decision differs from cases involving unintentional bird deaths from pesticide use, as habitat destruction indirectly leading to bird deaths is not considered a \"taking\" under the MBTA. In Newton County Wildlife Association v. U.S. Forest Service, the court ruled that habitat destruction causing harm to owls under the ESA does not constitute a 'take' under the MBTA. The court also determined that the USFS did not violate the MBTA by not obtaining special permits for timber sales that could result in bird deaths. The court stated that the MBTA only applies to direct and intentional actions like hunting and poaching, not habitat modification or destruction. The federal district court in North Dakota dismissed misdemeanor MBTA criminal charges against oil and gas companies for the incidental death of migratory birds through contact with oil reserve pits, stating that the MBTA only applies to deliberate actions, not accidental conduct like lawful commercial activity. The Fifth Circuit court ruled that oil development activities are not covered by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act unless there is a clear intention to harm protected birds. They emphasized the need for clarity in criminal laws regarding incidental bird takings. In 2015, the Fifth Circuit limited strict liability offenses under the MBTA, requiring deliberate acts to migratory birds before being subject to the Act. The court reversed a criminal conviction for bird deaths in oil production tanks, adopting Justice Scalia's definition of \"take\" from a previous case. The Fifth Circuit limited strict liability offenses under the MBTA in 2015, requiring deliberate acts to migratory birds to be subject to the Act. The court explained that \"take\" means to reduce animals to human control, affirmatively and intentionally. The court distinguished between intentional and deliberate acts in defining \"take,\" emphasizing the need for harm and harass to be included in the definition. The court clarified that under the MBTA, strict liability requires both an intentional and deliberate act (actus reus) and a guilty mind (mens rea) element. Even without a mens rea, the act of \"taking\" must be intentional and deliberate towards the bird to be strictly liable. This means that defendants must take an affirmative action to cause migratory bird deaths to be held accountable under the MBTA. The court explained that under the MBTA, strict liability requires an intentional and deliberate act towards the bird. Courts have tried to exclude accidental human-related bird deaths, like collisions with vehicles, from the MBTA's reach. These accidental takings are generally unforeseeable and unpreventable accidents. Courts disagree on interpreting the MBTA to limit its application, with some holding a broader view that includes incidental takings. The Second Circuit in United States v. FMC Corp. acknowledged the potential for a broad interpretation but suggested handling such situations through prosecutorial discretion and nominal fines. Courts have differing views on interpreting the MBTA to limit its application. The Second Circuit in United States v. FMC Corp. suggested addressing incidental takings through prosecutorial discretion and nominal fines. However, other courts have criticized this approach, arguing that prosecutorial discretion should not be a limiting principle of statutory interpretation. The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado emphasized the importance of proximate cause as a limiting feature of the MBTA's misdemeanor provision, while the Fifth Circuit disagreed, stating that proximate cause alone is not sufficient to restrict the strict liability standard of the MBTA. The Fifth Circuit expanded the scope of the MBTA to include accidental deaths of migratory birds, subjecting various entities to penalties. The court held that strict liability applies even in cases of unintentional bird deaths, differing from courts that interpret the MBTA more narrowly. The legislative history of the MBTA has been interpreted differently by courts, with some focusing on illegal hunting while others cover activities affecting songbirds. Amendments added mens rea requirements, such as limiting felony penalties to entities knowingly selling migratory birds. This amendment was proposed to address a court decision that dismissed a felony indictment on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Circuit ruled that strict liability under the MBTA for selling migratory birds violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Congress later eliminated strict liability for taking birds by baiting, requiring knowledge or reasonable belief of baited areas. The standard of liability for hunting with bait or over baited areas under the MBTA has changed from strict liability to requiring a degree of knowledge. This change does not affect the general application of strict liability for misdemeanor offenses under the MBTA. Offenses under the MBTA have historically been strict liability crimes, with the exception of felonies requiring scienter since 1986. Some courts have used these amendments to support the view that MBTA prohibitions on takings are strict liability offenses. The court upheld misdemeanor offenses under the MBTA as strict liability offenses, citing legislative history and Congress's attempts to limit penalties. In 2015, the House passed a bill to prohibit DOJ funds for MBTA prosecutions, but it was not considered by the Senate. In May 2015, FWS announced plans to develop an MBTA permitting program for incidental takes of migratory birds, seeking public input on regulatory options for industries like oil and gas, communication towers, and wind energy. The FWS is considering various options for regulating incidental take of migratory birds, including permits for specific projects, memoranda of understanding with federal agencies, and voluntary industry guidance. Public comments on this initiative have shown support for regulatory certainty but also raised questions about FWS's legal authority in this matter. The FWS is reviewing comments and developing draft regulations for incidental take of migratory birds from lawful commercial activities. If adopted, the final regulations may face challenges in certain circuits that narrowly interpret FWS authority under the MBTA."
