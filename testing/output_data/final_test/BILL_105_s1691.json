    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE. The \"American Indian Equal Justice Act\" is based on the principle of legal remedies for violations of rights, as guaranteed by the fifth amendment. Sovereign immunity is seen as incompatible with the rule of law in a democratic society. The Act aims to address this issue. The doctrine of sovereign immunity has been scaled back by states without compromising their dignity or sovereignty. Indian tribal governments are the only remaining entities with full immunity from lawsuits. Nearly half of individuals on Indian reservations are non-Indian, putting their rights to due process at risk due to tribal immunity. The purpose of this Act is to limit the immunity of Indian tribes to ensure due process and legal rights for all individuals, upholding the principle that no government should be above the law. This aims to strengthen the rule of law by subjecting Indian tribal governments to judicial review in certain civil matters. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Indian tribe\" refers to any tribe or band recognized by the Secretary of the Interior. \"Tribal immunity\" is the immunity of an Indian tribe from court jurisdiction and other remedies. Section 1362 of title 28, United States Code is amended to require Indian tribes to collect and remit state taxes on purchases made by nonmembers. States can enforce this requirement in federal court, and tribal immunity is waived for this purpose. SEC. 4. INDIAN TRIBES AS DEFENDANTS. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction over civil actions or claims against Indian tribes related to the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, as well as cases involving contracts made by the governing body of the tribe. They also have jurisdiction over claims for money damages against Indian tribes. The American Indian Equal Justice Act allows for claims for money damages against Indian tribes for injury or loss caused by negligence. Tribal immunity can be waived to enforce this provision. SEC. 5. TORT CLAIMS PROCEDURE. Part 6 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by inserting after chapter 171 the following: \"CHAPTER 171A--INDIAN TORT CLAIMS PROCEDURE.\" \"Chapter 171A of title 28, United States Code, defines the term 'employee of an Indian tribe' to include officers, employees, and individuals acting on behalf of the tribe, whether compensated or not, excluding federal or state government employees.\" \"Indian tribe defined as per Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Liability of Indian tribes in tort claims similar to private individuals or corporations, excluding interest before judgment or punitive damages. In cases of death with punitive damages, liable for actual damages.\" The Indian tribe or its designee can arbitrate, compromise, or settle claims under section 1362(d). Exceptions apply to cases involving tribal membership. Tribal immunity can be waived to implement this chapter. SEC. 6. INDIAN TRIBES AS DEFENDANTS IN STATE COURTS. Consent is given to sue an Indian tribe in a State court for claims arising under Federal or State law, including tort claims or non-tort claims related to contracts made by the tribe. In tort claims, the tribe is liable like a private individual or corporation, but not for pre-judgment interest or punitive damages. The section provides federal consent for a State court to exercise jurisdiction over claims against an Indian tribe, allowing for the tribe to be sued like a private entity but without liability for pre-judgment interest or punitive damages. Actions under this section are not removable under certain provisions of the United States Code. SEC. 7 of the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 is amended to include a provision for enforcement in civil rights actions. District courts of the United States have jurisdiction over cases alleging non-compliance with rights under this title, with tribal immunity waived for enforcement. SEC. 8 states that the Act and its amendments apply to cases against Indian tribes initiated after the Act's enactment date."
