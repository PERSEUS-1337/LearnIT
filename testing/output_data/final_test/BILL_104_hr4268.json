The Secretary of Health and Human Services will grant funding for a project to demonstrate the use of high-capacity computing and advanced networks in providing healthcare to residents of underserved rural and inner-city areas. The project will focus on improving primary care for residents with diabetes and Medicare beneficiaries over a 4-year period. The project funded by the Secretary of Health and Human Services aims to improve patient access to care guidelines for chronic diseases using advanced networks. The project will run for 4 years with a total federal expenditure limit of $30,000,000. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain provisions of the Social Security Act to allow Medicare and Medicaid funding under the project. The project aims to improve patient quality-of-life and reduce healthcare costs by developing a curriculum for training health professionals in medical informatics and telecommunciations. It also focuses on applying advanced technologies like video-conferencing and remote monitoring to assist primary care providers in treating patients with chronic illnesses at home. Additionally, it includes addressing language barriers, developing standards for telemedicine and medical informatics.
