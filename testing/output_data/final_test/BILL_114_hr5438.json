The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 is amended to include a provision allowing for a private right of action for damages caused by violations of the Act. This provision applies to any issuer subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, domestic concerns subject to the Act, or other United States persons. The court may find for the plaintiff in an action under this subsection if the plaintiff proves that the defendant violated subsection (a), which prevented the plaintiff from obtaining or retaining business and assisted the defendant in obtaining or retaining such business. The damages that a plaintiff may obtain in this action may be equal to the total amount of the contract. In cases of violation of subsection (a), damages may be awarded to the plaintiff based on the total amount gained by the defendant or lost by the plaintiff due to the violation. The court may award treble damages, three times the greater amount determined, along with attorney's fees and costs. The subsection (a) violation may result in damages awarded to the plaintiff, including treble damages, attorney's fees, and costs. The statute of limitations for enforcing liability under this subsection is 3 years after discovery of the facts and 6 years after the cause of action accrued.

The court will assess treble damages, three times the amount determined under subparagraph (A), along with attorney's fees and costs for violating subsection (a). The exception for routine governmental action in subsection (b) and affirmative defenses in subsection (c) apply to actions under this subsection. Liability under this subsection allows for recovery of contribution from any other liable party. In cases of contract, liability must be enforced within 3 years of discovery and 6 years of accrual.
