The benefits package for disability insurance applicants includes vocational and health interventions, wage subsidies based on work capacity, and emergency cash grants if needed.

SEC. 8. EMPLOYERS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM REPORT. The Commissioner of Social Security must submit a report to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment, outlining a demonstration program to reduce disability incidence among employees by 20%. Employers participating in the voluntary program would receive a tax credit if their employees do not file for social security disability insurance. The Commission of Social Security will determine a baseline predicted rate of social security disability insurance enrollment for employees participating in the program. Employees tracked for 3 years from enrollment, regardless of employment status, with any eligibility for disability insurance affecting the employer's participation rate. If the participation rate falls by 20% or more compared to the baseline, the employer will receive a social security incentive. If the employer's participation rate drops by at least 20 percent, they will receive a 75 percent tax credit on disability insurance cost savings."
