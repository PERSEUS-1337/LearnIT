    "content": "The federal material support statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339A and 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339B, have been central to the Justice Department's terrorist prosecution efforts. Congress has expanded and clarified these statutes since the mid-1990s. Section 2339A was passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, while Section 2339B was added as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Section 2339B of the federal material support statutes was added in 1996 as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. It recognizes the fungibility of financial resources and material support for terrorist organizations. The USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 amended the statutes, increasing the maximum imprisonment term to 15 years and adding \"expert advice or assistance\" as proscribed support. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 expanded the definition of \"material support or resources\" in Section 2339B, covering any property or service. Congress later added genocide and recruiting child soldiers to Section 2339A's predicate offense list and increased the maximum penalty for violations of Section 2339B in 2015. In 2015, the maximum penalty for violations of Section 2339B was increased from 15 to 20 years imprisonment. Section 2339A prohibits support for terrorist activities, including providing material support or concealing resources for terrorism offenses. The Dictionary Act states that \"person\" and \"whoever\" include corporations in federal law. Courts use this statute to interpret federal criminal cases, holding corporations criminally liable for actions by their officers, employees, or agents. Common law required both a mental (mens rea) and physical (actus reus) element for a crime. Legislative bodies, including Congress, have created criminal offenses without a mental component for regulatory misconduct. These offenses typically result in fines or short periods of incarceration. The Supreme Court has not equated felony status with the intent to require a mental component, but has indicated that severe penalties suggest a mens rea requirement. Section 2339A addresses providing material support without specifying knowledge requirement. Staples suggests courts will likely reject interpreting it to include unknowing support. Offenses under this section carry 15-year penalties, indicating a strong mens rea element. The nature of support provided varies, with some actions considered lawful and others not. Congress's intent is crucial, as seen in later sections of the law. Congress has provided an explicit mens rea requirement in Section 2339A, stating that support must be provided \"knowing or intending\" it will be used for a predicate offense. The government must prove the defendant had knowledge of the offense, not necessarily that they knew it was unlawful. The meaning of \"provides\" in the sections is not clearly defined, but common words are assumed to have their common meaning unless indicated otherwise by the text, context, or legislative history. Section 2339A condemns providing material support and concealing the nature, location, source, or ownership of such support. The concealment provision targets middlemen or conduits between terrorists and their supporters. The expansion of material support to include services may have made the provision redundant. Concealment charges have been limited to those also charged with other offenses. Concealment charges are typically linked to providing support to terrorists. Section 2339A defines \"material support\" broadly, including various forms of assistance but excluding medicine and religious materials. Personnel, weapons, and transportation are among the items covered. Section 2339B specifies the type of personnel prohibited, limiting it to those provided to foreign terrorists. Section 2339A outlaws providing or concealing support only when defendant knows or intends the support to be used in preparation for, commission of, or the escape following the commission of one or more of a list of predicate offenses, such as bombing a federal building or murdering. Section 2339A prohibits providing support for specific offenses, including bombing a federal building or murdering a federal official. The list of predicate offenses includes federal crimes of terrorism. Violations can occur through attempts, conspiracies, or support for concealing an escape from a predicate offense. Section 2339A prohibits providing support for specific offenses, including bombing a federal building or murdering a federal official. The law also outlaws attempts and conspiracies to violate its proscriptions. Attempt requires intent and a substantial step towards completion, while conspiracy involves distinct offenses with different objectives. A defendant's actions must cross the line between preparation and attempt to constitute a substantial step towards a crime. It is no defense if the underlying offense was impossible to commit. Providing material support in violation of Section 2339A carries a punishment of imprisonment for up to 15 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Conspiracy to violate Section 2339A requires proof of entering into a conspiracy. The offense of conspiracy to provide material support under Section 2339A requires proof of entering into a conspiracy with the intent to provide support or resources for a predicate offense. Conspiratorial statements are not protected speech under the First Amendment, and the offense is complete upon assent, even if the support is only planned and not delivered. Each conspirator is liable for any foreseeable offense committed in furtherance of the overall scheme. Conspiracy to provide material support carries penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000. Conspirators can be punished for both conspiracy and providing support if their scheme succeeds. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a72, aiding or abetting a violation of Section 2339A makes one punishable as if they committed the offense themselves. Liability under Section 2 only attaches if someone else commits the substantive offense. Section 2339A convictions carry a sentence of imprisonment for not more than 15 years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000. The Sentence Guidelines influence the sentence actually imposed below the statutory maximum. Sentencing courts must begin the process by determining the sentence range recommended by the Guidelines. Either the defendant or the government or both may seek appellate court review of the sentence imposed to ensure that it is appropriate. The appellate court may review the sentence to ensure it is reasonable, either procedurally or substantively. The Sentencing Guidelines treat Section 2339A convictions as aiding and abetting, with a terrorism adjustment for offenses involving federal crimes of terrorism. Section 2339A is a federal crime of terrorism with specific consequences, including property confiscation and an extended statute of limitations. Conviction for this offense can lead to pre-trial detention and is considered a predicate offense for money laundering and RICO prosecutions. A defendant convicted for violation of a federal crime of terrorism may face pre-trial detention and a potential lifetime term of supervised release. Section 2339A lacks a clear statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction, but it is likely to apply overseas due to various reasons such as accomplices abroad, congressional intent, and international law principles. The extraterritorial application of Section 2339A for federal crimes of terrorism is determined by various international law principles, such as the territorial, nationality, passive personality, protective, and universal principles. The Supreme Court has emphasized the need for clear congressional intent for federal laws to apply abroad. Section 2339A asserts that venue for federal crimes of terrorism can be in any Federal judicial district where the offense was committed. The law allows for trial wherever an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs, and crimes committed abroad can be tried in the US. Venue is also proper where the accused aided and abetted the commission of an offense. The reach of Section 2339A may be limited by Supreme Court decisions on offenses committed within the United States. Section 2339A allows for trial in any Federal judicial district where a federal crime of terrorism was committed. Court decisions suggest venue is proper where the offense occurs. Section 2339A does not create a private cause of action, but 18 U.S.C. \u00a72333 allows suits for those injured by international terrorism. Violations of Section 2339A or Section 2339B may be considered \"acts of international terrorism\" under Section 2333. Section 2339A condemns providing material support for crimes in a terrorism context, while Section 2339B condemns providing support to foreign terrorist organizations. Section 2339B condemns providing material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization, knowing their terrorist activities. The law applies to individuals and legal entities, including corporations. Courts interpret federal criminal cases based on this statute, holding corporations criminally liable for crimes committed by their officers or employees. Section 2339B holds corporations criminally liable for providing support to foreign terrorist organizations. The government must prove awareness of providing support and knowledge of the organization's terrorist activities. The defendant's intent to further illegal activities is not required. Section 2339B does not explicitly define the word \"provide\" and lacks any special meaning attached to it by Congress. Courts have interpreted \"provide\" in a companion section to have its ordinary dictionary meaning. The term \"material support or resources\" in Section 2339B mirrors the definition in Section 2339A(b). The section defines \"material support\" as any property or service, excluding medicine and religious materials. It includes currency, financial services, training, expert advice, safe houses, false documentation, weapons, personnel, and transportation. Section 2339B adopts this definition and provides amplifications for \"training\" and \"expert advice and assistance.\" Section 2339B provides two amplifications of the word \"personnel,\" limiting it to those working under a designated terrorist organization and offering limited immunity for approved support. Congress adjusted definitions after challenges in the Supreme Court case Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project. Critics argued that the prohibitions could be vague and extend to activities like advocating at the U.N. or training members on international law. In Humanitarian Law Project, the Supreme Court upheld Section 2339B as not unconstitutionally vague or infringing on free speech or association rights. Chief Justice Roberts emphasized that due process prohibits vague criminal statutes. Section 2339B is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to coordinated advocacy and training for a terrorist organization, as Chief Justice Roberts emphasized in Humanitarian Law Project. The statute must provide fair notice of prohibited conduct and not encourage discriminatory enforcement. The Chief Justice concluded that Congress can outlaw material support to a terrorist organization without violating the First Amendment. The government has a compelling interest in suppressing terrorism, as training and support for terrorist activities can strain diplomatic relations and legitimize the organization. The Chief Justice upheld the ban on material support to terrorist organizations, stating that it does not violate the First Amendment. To be considered a crime under Section 2339B, the defendant must know that the beneficiary is a foreign terrorist organization. The Secretary of State can designate an entity as a foreign terrorist organization under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The designation of an organization as engaging in terrorist activity can be challenged, with the Secretary having the authority to revoke it. However, a defendant charged with providing support to a designated organization cannot challenge the designation. This restriction has been deemed constitutional by the courts. Organizations known to be involved in terrorism are also prohibited beneficiaries. The term \"terrorist activity\" under Section 2339B refers to premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. It includes unlawful activities such as hijacking, sabotage, seizing individuals to compel others, and threatening harm. Section 2339B outlaws various forms of terrorist activities, including seizing individuals to compel others, violent attacks on internationally protected persons, assassinations, use of weapons to endanger individuals or cause damage, and threats or attempts to commit these acts. It also prohibits attempts and conspiracies to violate these provisions. Attempt is the unfulfilled commission of an underlying offense, requiring intent and a substantial step towards completion. It is not a defense if the crime was impossible to commit. Providing material support in violation of Section 2339B and attempting to do so are punished equally. Conspiracy to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B carries the same penalties as the completed substantive offense: imprisonment for not more than 20 years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000. The offense is complete upon agreement to provide support, and each conspirator is liable for any foreseeable offense committed in furtherance of the scheme. Conspiracy to provide material support under Section 2339B can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Conspirators can be punished for both conspiracy and providing material support if their scheme is successful. Aiding and abetting a violation of Section 2339B or any federal crime can result in similar punishment as committing the offense oneself. The same evidence can support both a conspiracy and an aiding and abetting conviction under Section 2339B, with liability only attaching if someone else commits the substantive offense. Conviction for a violation of Section 2339B can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. The Sentencing Guidelines assign a base offense level of 26, but offenses under Section 2339B may trigger the terrorism adjustment, raising the offense level to 32. Constitutional challenges to this adjustment have been raised. Section 2339B violations can lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing courts can depart from the Guidelines but may face review for procedural or substantive unreasonableness. Violations may be classified as federal crimes of terrorism if they aim to influence government conduct through intimidation or coercion. Classification as a federal crime of terrorism has consequences such as confiscation of property involved in the offense. These crimes are predicate offenses for money laundering and RICO prosecutions. Prosecution has an eight-year statute of limitations, and defendants face enhanced pre-trial detention and possible lifetime supervised release. Federal criminal law is generally territorial unless Congress indicates otherwise for overseas application. Section 2339B of federal criminal law has both a general and descriptive statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction, indicating that there is federal jurisdiction over offenses committed overseas under certain circumstances. The federal criminal law section 2339B includes a general and descriptive statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction, allowing federal jurisdiction over offenses committed overseas under specific circumstances. The descriptive statement was added in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, with no clear explanation for its necessity. If the general statement had been removed, it would have shown Congress intended to limit extraterritorial application. Congress intended extraterritorial application to be confined to situations found in the descriptive statement of Section 2339B. One court suggested a broader interpretation, stating that a jurisdictional nexus exists for non-citizens acting abroad if the aim is to cause harm in the US. Section 2339B(c) allows the Attorney General or Secretary of the Treasury to bring civil suits to enjoin violations. While there is no private civil cause of action under Section 2339B or Section 2339A, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72333 authorizes suits for treble damages. Section 2333 allows private civil suits for treble damages for those injured by acts of international terrorism, which include violations of Section 2339A or Section 2339B. Financial institutions failing to report assets for a foreign terrorist organization face civil penalties under Section 2339B(a)(2). Section 2339B(f) establishes procedures for protecting classified information during civil proceedings. Procedures for protecting classified information during civil proceedings, including authority for interlocutory appeals by the government."
