    "content": "Some policymakers are considering economic stimulus legislation due to concerns about a possible recession. They want to assess the effects of past policy changes, such as the tax cuts in 2001, 2002, and 2003, which were expected to stimulate the economy in the short-term. This report evaluates the impact of these tax cuts on economic indicators like GDP, employment, interest rates, inflation, labor supply, saving, capital investment, and the trade deficit up to 2004. The report evaluates the impact of tax cuts in 2001, 2002, and 2003 on economic indicators up to 2004. Forecasts predicted short-term growth and long-term reduction. Despite diverse models used, results were relatively small due to the cuts being small in relation to GDP. The tax cuts implemented from 2001-2004 included reductions in income tax rates, an increase in the child tax credit, \"marriage penalty\" tax relief, and elimination of the estate tax. These provisions were phased in gradually and scheduled to expire. Additional legislation in 2002 and 2003 accelerated depreciation for business investment, extended and expanded tax relief provisions, and reduced tax rates on dividend and capital gains income. The 2004 Working Family Tax Relief Act extended provisions of earlier tax cuts without revenue effect. Estimates of tax cuts costs are based on ex post data. EGTRRA was the largest tax cut with costs in the out years, while JGTRRA and JCWAA had mainly short-term costs. JCWAA's 10-year cost is smaller than short-term due to accelerated depreciation. JGTRRA accelerates tax cuts mainly in the short-term. The tax cuts under EGTRRA and JGTRRA are temporary and scheduled to expire, despite supporters intending them to be permanent. The focus is on the effects of the tax cuts through 2004, with certain provisions being small to date and not explored. The costs as a percentage of GDP in the years of interest are small, limiting their potential economic effects. In 2001, tax cuts were 0.4% of GDP, increasing to 1.1% in 2002, 1.6% in 2003, and projected 2.3% in 2004. Marginal tax rates under EGTRRA and JGTRRA show modest changes for wages and interest income but significant declines for capital gains and dividend income. Tax cuts in the early 2000s were largely deficit-financed, leading to an increase in government spending as a percentage of GDP. Evaluating the economic impact of tax cuts is challenging because there is no direct way to determine the contribution of tax cuts to economic performance. It is difficult to ascertain whether the economy would have performed the same without the tax cuts. Econometric research uses data variations to establish correlation between variables, such as the impact of tax cuts on individual behavior. However, determining the causal effect of tax cuts is complicated by the fact that the criteria for receiving a tax cut can influence behavior, making it challenging to isolate the true impact of tax cuts. The impact of tax cuts on individual behavior is influenced by factors such as income inequality. For example, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) gave larger tax cuts to upper-income cohorts, leading to faster income growth for those groups. This growth could be mistakenly attributed to the tax cuts if not properly controlled for. To study the economy-wide effects of tax cuts, researchers compare periods with tax cuts to periods without to determine the true impact. The difficulty in isolating the effect of tax cuts on the economy is due to various changing factors over time, making it challenging to determine causation. Comparing economic activity before and during tax cuts can lead to misleading conclusions, as other factors need to be controlled for to address the \"endogeneity\" problem. Some econometric methods can overcome this issue but limit the number of control variables that can be used. Time series analysis has been criticized for assuming individuals do not change their reactions to changes in behavior. Economists predict tax cut effects by building forecasting models and running simulations before implementation, without relying on actual data. This approach does not test the accuracy of predictions post-implementation. Economists predict tax cut effects using forecasting models without relying on actual data, which can lead to inaccurate predictions due to the limitations of econometric models in accurately forecasting economic activity. The recession has started, and there is little consensus on the correct approach to modeling macroeconomic activity. The Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation use different models to predict the effects of proposals, showing widely varying economic outcomes. It is challenging to rely on model-based predictions for the actual effects of tax cuts due to the lack of consensus on the best macroeconomic model. Each model captures certain economic behaviors well, but none can synthesize all aspects simultaneously. Economists differ on the importance of various economic behaviors, leading to conflicting predictions. Keynesian and supply side models differ in evaluating the effects of a tax cut on economic behavior. The lack of integration between these models leads to incorrect attributions of effects. Keynesian models focus on aggregate demand, while supply side models attribute output increases to factors like labor or saving. Keynesian models focus on aggregate demand in the economy, popular for short-term policymaking and forecasting. However, they lack the ability to explain the supply side when the economy is fully employed. Professional forecasters use models with Keynesian attributes to predict economic activity in the short run. Keynesian models are popular for short-term policymaking and forecasting, focusing on aggregate demand in the economy. They are limited in explaining the supply side when the economy is fully employed. Using fiscal policy to boost aggregate spending is known as \"stimulating the economy,\" often evaluated through its effects on aggregate spending using a Keynesian model. The government can increase spending by running a budget deficit, which boosts aggregate spending directly. Keynesian models focus on boosting aggregate spending through fiscal policy, such as running a budget deficit to finance government purchases or production of goods and services. The increase in spending leads to a multiplier effect, bringing idle resources back into use, increasing employment, and generating new production. This process results in a greater increase in aggregate spending than the initial budget deficit. Keynesian models predict that the increase in aggregate spending from fiscal stimulus exceeds the initial budget deficit. The effects of the stimulus are expected to be felt within two years, leading to a new equilibrium with supply. Economists rely on observing the equilibrium point, recorded as gross domestic product, to determine the impact on output. Keynesian models predict that changes in GDP are demand-driven. In recessions, this assumption holds true, but in expansions, it may not be accurate as aggregate spending matches potential production. Tax cuts during full employment result in smaller boosts to aggregate spending compared to during a recession. The 2001 tax cuts occurred during a recession, while the 2002-2003 cuts were in a period of sluggish recovery below full employment. The Keynesian framework predicts that tax cuts during a recession will stimulate aggregate demand and lead to an increase in GDP growth. The 2001 tax cuts were implemented during a mild recession, but the economy experienced growth and employment moving in opposite directions. The 2001 recession and subsequent recovery were mild, with GDP declining briefly and shallowly before quickly returning to its previous peak. The effectiveness of the tax cuts in preventing a deeper recession is debated, as historical data shows that recessions eventually end on their own through market adjustment and monetary expansion. The 2001 recession was mild, with GDP declining briefly before quickly recovering. The effectiveness of tax cuts in preventing a deeper recession is debated, as historical data shows recessions end on their own through market adjustment and monetary expansion. The recovery was sluggish despite three tax cuts, leading to debates on the need for further stimulus. The recent recession was deep and long, with slow recovery indicated by employment and related measures. The 2001 recession had the seventh largest employment decline during the recession, becoming the fifth largest when including post-recession employment decline. It was the second largest in the past four decades, with the unemployment rate not falling until mid-2003. Industrial capacity utilization remained below average through 2003, making it difficult to argue that tax cuts boosted aggregate spending. The tax cuts may have prevented a deeper decline in spending, but identifying unique circumstances that made this recession worse without tax cuts is necessary. The 2001 recession had a significant employment decline and the unemployment rate did not improve until mid-2003. Industrial capacity utilization remained low, questioning the effectiveness of tax cuts in boosting spending. Recent events like the September 11 attacks and stock market crash are mentioned, but the role of monetary policy in mitigating recessionary forces is highlighted. GDP data may understate the severity of the recession due to strong productivity growth. The economy's long-term sustainable growth rate has increased since the late 1990s. Recent tax cuts were criticized for delivering little stimulus impact due to their low multiplier effect on aggregate spending. The recent tax cuts were criticized for their low multiplier effect on the economy compared to government spending. Arguments include the belief that tax cuts for upper income groups have less impact than those for lower income groups due to higher saving rates. Additionally, temporary tax cuts may result in more savings, but the perceived permanency of the cuts could negate this effect. The recent tax cuts were criticized for their low multiplier effect on the economy compared to government spending. Legislators intended to make the tax cuts permanent, with provisions aimed at promoting saving rather than spending. However, it is uncertain whether the tax cuts could have been designed to have a larger impact, as different economic models predict contradictory factors that would make a tax cut more effective. The size of fiscal stimulus, not the specific form it takes, is the most important factor in its effect on the economy. Lower interest rates from monetary policy were more impactful than tax cuts in mitigating the recession, as seen in the decline of the federal funds rate from 2000 to 2003. The recent decline in interest rates during the 2003 recession was smaller than in previous decades, indicating that monetary policy did not play a significant role in mitigating the recession. Additionally, the increase in short-term interest rates between 1999 and 2000 was much smaller compared to previous episodes of significant monetary tightening. Keynesian models are based on the assumption of \"price stickiness,\" where prices are slow to adjust to changes in aggregate supply and demand. A tax cut can push up inflation by increasing aggregate demand, especially when the economy is near full employment. In such cases, the increase in inflation is likely to be quick and substantial because production cannot be increased enough to match the rise in spending. On the other hand, when the economy is below full employment, the increase in inflation would likely be smaller and slower as there is more room for production to meet the increase in spending. When evaluating the effects of fiscal policy on inflation, it is important to consider that the Federal Reserve plays a key role in determining inflation through its manipulation of the money supply. The Fed typically aims to maintain a low and stable inflation rate. Therefore, it is realistic to assume that any inflationary effects of a fiscal policy change would be offset by the Fed taking steps to tighten monetary policy. In the case of a tax cut, it is more likely to lead to higher short-term interest rates rather than higher inflation, especially when the economy is near full employment. When evaluating the effects of fiscal policy on inflation, it is important to consider the role of the Federal Reserve in controlling inflation through the money supply. In the case of recent tax cuts, inflation remained low, and the Fed accommodated the fiscal expansion by not raising interest rates. Despite the tax cut, monetary policy was limited in its ability to further ease due to short-term interest rates being close to the zero bound. Aggregate spending, composed of personal consumption, private investment, government spending, and net exports, can cause a recession if any component falls short. The 2001 recession was not caused by insufficient consumer spending, but rather by weak private investment spending. Investment spending growth has historically been lower than GDP growth in post-war recessions. The 2001 recession was not caused by insufficient consumer spending but weak private investment spending. Tax cuts may have helped sustain personal consumption, but other factors were also at play, such as one-time automobile sales incentives and expansionary monetary policy. Keynesian models are useful for understanding short-term fluctuations in the business cycle but provide little insight into long-term growth. Keynesian models focus on short-term fluctuations in aggregate demand, neglecting long-term growth factors. When the economy is not in a recession, advice from Keynesian models may not be relevant as the Federal Reserve and market forces can sustain steady growth without activist fiscal policy. The 2001 tax cuts, enacted during a recession, can be evaluated using Keynesian models. The 2003 tax cuts, if made permanent, will impact the supply side of the economy but not the demand side. Growth models, like the neoclassical model by Robert Solow, can help evaluate the long-term effects of these tax cuts. It is sensible to assume full employment when analyzing tax cuts and omit demand-side effects. Inputs like labor and physical capital drive production and output in the growth model. Technological change and productivity growth drive long-term per capita output growth, overshadowing the effects of tax cuts. Output is influenced by labor and capital inputs, with government policies indirectly affecting them. Capital investment equals national saving, which can be done by individuals, businesses, or the government through budget surplus or deficit. Deficit-financed tax cuts reduce economic growth by lowering national saving, leading to decreased private investment. This is known as the \"crowding out\" effect, where interest rates rise as firms compete for resources to finance their investments. The Solow model predicts a decline in growth due to budget deficits, assuming that private saving does not increase to offset government saving reductions and that investment is not financed from abroad. The tax cuts led to a 6 percentage point shift in the budget deficit between 2000 and 2004, with 2.3 percentage points attributed to the tax cuts. Private saving did not increase enough to offset the decline in public saving, resulting in a 4.6 percentage point decrease in national saving. Investment demand also decreased by 3.1 percentage points due to the recession and stock market decline, which did not cause interest rates to rise as saving and investment demand fell simultaneously. The reduced investment demand was a temporary factor caused by the recession. Certain provisions of JCWAA and JGTRRA aimed at boosting capital investment, including accelerated depreciation and increased expensing for unincorporated businesses. However, capital investment fell by 2.0 percentage points of GDP between 2001 and. Between 2001 and 2003, capital investment fell by 2.0 percentage points of GDP. The efficacy of tax provisions aimed at boosting investment was hindered by uncertainty and deficit financing, leading to a concentration of the decline in structures rather than equipment. The decline in public saving caused by the deficit can be offset by an inflow of foreign saving, preventing an increase in interest rates and crowding out of private investment. However, this leads to some income accruing to foreign lenders, causing the trade deficit to increase as the dollar appreciates. The increase in the trade deficit equals borrowing from abroad, as the U.S. buys more imports than foreigners buy U.S. exports. Foreign borrowing partly offsets the decline in government saving. Private investment fell, but borrowing from foreigners rose to a record high. Some economists question the sustainability of this borrowing pace. Tax cuts may boost long-run growth by incentivizing work and saving. Tax cuts may boost long-run growth by incentivizing work and saving, but there are three main problems with this reasoning. Capital investment is determined by national saving, not private saving, and when the government runs a budget deficit, public saving is negative. Recent tax cuts were deficit financed, so any increase in private saving would need to exceed the increase in the budget deficit to prevent investment spending from falling. Some provisions may promote saving, but others are likely to encourage consumption. Tax cuts can have mixed effects on growth as they may increase work and saving through substitution effects but also decrease growth by making individuals wealthier on an after-tax basis, requiring less work and saving to achieve financial goals. The net effect on growth depends on the strength of the substitution effect relative to the income effect. Some provisions of recent tax cuts, like the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief, may have a negative impact on growth due to their income effect. The empirical evidence on the size of supply side effects is inconclusive, with varying studies showing both positive and negative effects of tax cuts on labor supply. Most estimates on the effects of tax cuts on personal saving are modest and some are statistically insignificant. Research suggests that working-aged males are not very sensitive to changes in tax rates and tend to work full-time regardless of the tax rate. Labor supply elasticity assumptions vary, with the Joint Committee on Taxation assuming a small labor response and the CBO assuming different elasticities for primary and secondary earners. Some married women, older workers, and younger workers may be more sensitive to tax rates, but estimates of their sensitivity vary significantly. Cultural factors may play a more important role in labor supply than tax policy. Private saving has increased since 2000, but by less than one third of the decrease in public saving. The deficit caused by tax cuts alone exceeded the increase in private saving. The deficit from tax cuts exceeded the increase in private saving. Factors like precautionary saving and recession may have influenced private saving. The increase in saving was mainly from business saving, while personal saving decreased. Labor supply also fell due to the recession, overshadowing any supply side incentives. The tax cuts did not have a significant impact on the economy despite some marginal effects. Reductions in tax rates caused a small revenue loss, and any change in labor supply in response to tax cuts would be temporary. On the other hand, deficit-financed tax cuts could lead to a decline in national saving, negatively affecting growth in the long term. In a recession, tax cuts may lead to higher aggregate spending, bringing unemployed workers back into the labor force. However, this response could be misinterpreted as evidence in favor of supply-side economics. Many workers may not be able to take advantage of supply-side incentives during recessions due to underutilized labor. Many economists shifted from Keynesian and Solow models to intertemporal models in the 1970s, focusing on rational optimization by individuals over time. These models, like infinite horizon and overlapping generation models, aim to maximize lifetime utility through work, leisure, saving, and consumption decisions. While these models offer logical decision-making processes, they rely heavily on complex assumptions and theoretical grounding rather than empirical evidence. Intertemporal models focus on rational optimization by individuals over time, aiming to maximize lifetime utility through work, leisure, saving, and consumption decisions. These models are grounded in theory rather than evidence, with complex assumptions like infinite horizon models assuming individuals live forever and not accounting for uncertainty in future earnings, prices, or government policies. This theoretical complexity makes empirical estimation difficult and limits the evaluation of policies like deficit-financed tax cuts. When evaluating tax cuts using intertemporal models, assumptions about future higher taxes or lower spending are crucial. These models predict changes in saving and labor supply due to the wedge created between current and future after-tax wages and interest rates. For instance, individuals may work and save more when taxes are low today, anticipating higher taxes in the future. Tax cuts can lead to changes in labor supply and saving behavior. Higher interest rates can make people work more today to save for the future. If tax cuts are financed through lower government spending, there is a smaller response in labor and saving. Ricardian equivalence theory suggests that deficits won't raise interest rates as individuals anticipate future tax increases or spending cuts. Private saving increases to prepare for future consumption losses. Private saving rises today to prepare for future consumption losses, replacing the fall in public saving, resulting in no net effect on national saving and capital investment. In intertemporal models, such as life cycle models, the Ricardian effect is only partially applicable due to certain generations being affected by tax changes. The complexity of these models limits direct empirical estimation, requiring simulation with inferred parameters from empirical evidence. Model results should not be taken as direct evidence of tax effects. Most economists believe that economic models do not accurately explain short-term economic activity due to the lack of demand-side effects and modeling of monetary policy. These models assume that work and saving patterns fluctuate greatly in response to tax cuts, but they are unsuitable for evaluating short-term stimulus in a recession. Before the enactment of tax cut proposals like EGTRRA and JGTRRA, simulations were conducted to estimate their economic effects. These estimates were made before the policies were enacted and showed positive short-term effects but negative long-term effects. The long-term impacts often did not fully materialize within the 10-year forecast window, making it difficult to determine if the tax cuts were ultimately beneficial or detrimental. The private forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers (MA) used a model with Keynesian properties to estimate the short-term effects of the tax cut, projecting a boost in growth by 1.2 percentage points in the second half of 2001 and 0.3 percentage points in 2002. They also predicted that the Fed would keep interest rates 0.75 percentage points higher as a result of the tax cut. The Auerbach-Kotlikoff model, an intertemporal life-cycle model, was used to evaluate the economic effects of EGTRRA over the next 150 years. Auerbach predicted an increase in growth in the second half of 2001 by 0.4 percentage points through a boost to aggregate spending. The model did not contain short-term business cycle properties and assumed that a permanent deficit-financed tax cut would cause the national debt to grow indefinitely. Auerbach ran simulations where either the tax on labor or capital was raised, finding that an increase in the wage tax reduced output more than other scenarios. The Auerbach-Kotlikoff model evaluated the economic effects of tax changes. It found that an increase in the wage tax reduced output more than an increase in the capital tax. Lower tax rates temporarily increased saving rates and output, while higher tax rates in the long run decreased saving rates and output. Tax cuts led to a 1% increase in output by 2004, while tax increases caused a 1%-2.5% decrease in output in the long run. Institution used a neoclassical Solow model to estimate the effects of EGTRRA tax cut on the economy. The tax cut was projected to reduce GNP by 0.68% in 2011 due to budget deficits crowding out effect. Incentive effects on labor and private saving partially offset this reduction. One provision of EGTRRA provided a \"rebate\" of up to $600 as an advanced tax credit. Studies on this credit's effects on consumption and saving were based on ex post empirical evidence, not macroeconomic models. The study by David Johnson, Jonathon Parker, and Nicholas Souleles used regression analysis to assess the impact of rebate checks on nondurable consumption. They found that 23%-37% of the rebate was spent on nondurable goods within the first three months. The remaining amount may have been saved or spent on other goods and services, but this was not included in the study. Most of the remaining rebate was spent within the next two quarters, although these findings were not statistically significant. Econometric studies face challenges such as self-reporting errors, random fluctuations in data, and omitted variable bias. The study by David Johnson, Jonathon Parker, and Nicholas Souleles found that 23%-37% of rebate checks were spent on nondurable goods within the first three months. However, omitted variable bias and differences in the control group made the results statistically insignificant when non-recipients were excluded from the calculations. Joel Slemrod and Matthew Shapiro analyzed survey results before and after the rebate was sent, showing that only spending the rebate would lead to an increase in aggregate spending. The study found that a significant portion of rebate checks were saved or used to pay down debt, indicating limited stimulative effects. Survey responses may not accurately reflect actual behavior. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the economic effects of JGTRRA using three models, assuming the tax cuts would expire in 2013. The Joint Committee on Taxation used two models to estimate the economic effects of tax cuts, predicting a GDP increase of 0.2% to 0.9% after five years with different Fed responses. A third model suggested a potential GDP reduction due to crowding out, contingent on future tax increases or spending cuts to finance the tax cut. The life cycle model predicted that GDP would increase by 0.2% over the first five years with tax cuts financed by reduced government transfer payments or decreased by 0.1% if financed by higher taxes. Negative growth effects would start before any tax increase or spending cut. Investment in residential housing would decline as investors shift to equipment due to dividend tax cuts and accelerated depreciation incentives. The Congressional Budget Office evaluated the economic effects of the President's budget proposal for FY2004, which included various spending and revenue proposals. The Congressional Budget Office analyzed the President's budget proposal for FY2004, focusing on the tax cut proposal. The analysis used multiple econometric models and scenarios to project modest GDP increases. All models predicted higher interest rates due to the tax cuts, except under the open economy assumption. The President's proposal aimed to make EGTRRA/JGTRRA permanent. The President's budget proposals were projected to decrease GDP by 0.2% from 2004 to 2008 and 0.7% from 2009 to 2013 due to tax cuts reducing growth. The decline in GDP would be greater without ad hoc offsets assumed by the CBO. Intertemporal models showed different results, with scenarios requiring budget balance eventually. The budget proposals would reduce GNP if financed by lower government spending after 2013, but increase GNP if financed by higher taxes. Higher future taxes are considered better for the economy than lower government spending due to the oddities of intertemporal models. Individuals are assumed not to value government spending, leading to less incentive to work and save more in response to tax cuts. The CBO estimated economic effects of budget proposals using Keynesian models, predicting an increase in GDP by 0.2% in the MA model and 1.4% in the GI model over five years. Supply-side effects were negative, while demand-side effects were positive, with GDP increasing due to stimulus to aggregate spending. The Macroeconomic Advisers (MA) model projected that the JGTRRA would boost growth in the short term but reduce it in the long run. GDP would be higher for the first three years and lower for the next three years in the MA model, while the GI model predicted higher GDP for every year. The long-term effects of the JGTRRA were largely due to the proposal to make EGTRRA permanent, which was not included in the version signed into law. The JGTRRA was projected to boost growth in the short term but reduce it in the long run due to inflation and rising interest rates. It was expected to increase unemployment after 2006 and raise long-term interest rates by 0.34 percentage points over five years. The Global Insight model used Keynesian properties initially and neoclassical properties in the long run to analyze the effects of JGTRRA. Global Insight's model projected that the JGTRRA would increase growth by 0.2 percentage points in 2003, 0.9 percentage points in 2004, and 0.1 percentage points in 2005, primarily through stimulating aggregate demand. However, it was also projected to reduce economic growth by 0.5 percentage points in 2006 and increase inflation by 0.2-0.3 percentage points per year through 2006. The dividend tax cut initially boosted stock prices by 5%, but prices fell slightly by the end of the projection. The report studied the macroeconomic effects of tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2003. Estimates were made by comparing macroeconomic models with and without the tax cuts, but there is no consensus on which model is most suitable for policy simulations. Keynesian models focus on the business cycle while neoclassical growth models neglect long-run growth determinants. Keynesian models predict that deficit-financed tax cuts would boost output during a recession by increasing spending. Higher consumption in response to higher after-tax income is the channel through which spending is boosted, but the growth is temporary as it cannot exceed potential production. The economy experienced a mild recession and slow recovery after the passage of EGTRRA, JCWAA, and JGTRRA. Proponents argue that EGTRRA boosted growth, while opponents claim the tax cuts were ineffective and credit monetary expansion for the mild recession. Deficit-financed tax cuts reduce public saving unless offset by other factors. Deficit-financed tax cuts reduce national saving, leading to potential rise in interest rates. The neoclassical Solow growth model predicts reduced economic growth due to lower capital investment. Marginal tax cuts may increase work and saving, but not enough to offset deficit impact on growth. Despite a fall in national saving from 2000-2003, interest rates did not rise due to a larger decrease in investment demand. Accelerated depreciation in tax cuts aimed to boost capital investment spending, which fell sharply during and after the recession. Investment decisions may have been skewed towards equipment over structures due to tax provisions. Deficit-financed tax cuts can be funded through national saving or borrowing from abroad, leading to a trade deficit. Net borrowing from abroad in the form of a trade deficit can help mitigate the rise in interest rates and capital investment \"crowding out,\" but it leads to dollar appreciation, impacting exports and import-competing goods. The trade deficit increased from 4% in 2000 to 5.6% in 2004, typically declining during low growth periods. The prolonged employment decline post-recession was the longest since the Great Depression, with tax cuts in Keynesian models boosting employment by increasing aggregate spending. Tax cuts are believed by \"supply-siders\" to incentivize work and saving, but the actual effects on labor supply are small and positive for primary earners. Evidence of supply-side effects from tax cuts is lacking, as hours worked and labor force participation decreased after the tax cuts were implemented. The tax cuts implemented did not lead to an increase in labor supply, with private sector saving increasing due to business saving. Reductions in individual income taxes were expected to raise personal saving, but personal saving actually decreased between 2000 and 2004."
