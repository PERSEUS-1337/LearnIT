    "content": "In recent decades, Congress and the President have increasingly used hybrid organizations for public policy functions traditionally assigned to executive departments and agencies. These organizations, possessing characteristics of both the governmental and private sectors, have attracted both support and criticism. There are hundreds of hybrid entities associated with the federal government, collectively known as the \"quasi government.\" Concerns are growing about the accountability of these hybrids to elected and appointed officials, raising questions about how the public interest is being protected. The scope and consequences of hybrid organizations in the quasi government have not been extensively studied. Definitional issues and language disputes persist. Traditional tools for holding executive agencies accountable are often inapplicable, giving hybrids the freedom to pursue their own interests. The popularity of quasi government is influenced by factors like avoiding creating more bureaucracy and budget controls. The report introduces the reader to the quasi government, discussing factors such as budget controls, management flexibility, and the blurring of governmental and private sectors. It examines the legal characteristics, behavior, and policy consequences of entities within this sector. The term \"quasi government\" is challenging to define due to its intentional blurring of boundaries between the public and private sectors. The term \"quasi government\" refers to entities with legal ties to the federal government but are not considered agencies of the United States. These entities have characteristics of both governmental and private sectors, creating a hybrid organization. The term \"quasi government\" refers to entities with legal ties to the federal government but are not considered agencies of the United States. These entities have characteristics of both governmental and private sectors, creating a hybrid organization. Different categories of quasi governmental organizations can be described as artificial, with porous lines of distinction and differentiation. Two rough models suggest ways of looking at these entities: the linear spectrum model and the categoric organization model. The term \"quasi government\" refers to entities with legal ties to the federal government but are not considered agencies of the United States. These entities have characteristics of both governmental and private sectors, creating a hybrid organization. The linear spectrum approach is used to describe elements within the quasi government, starting with \"Quasi Official Agencies\" closest to the executive branch and moving towards other entities. The terms quago and quango, which classify organizations based on their government or private sector attributes, are not used in this report. The framers of the Constitution intended for the executive branch to be unified under the President, with accountability to Congress. The first Congress in 1789 established executive departments, including Treasury, State, and War, with department heads directly responsible to the President but ultimately accountable to Congress for policy purposes. The executive branch, except for mail delivery, entrusted functions to departments. While some officers have autonomy, the norm is for the executive to be accountable to the President. Authority is typically delegated from the President or department heads to subordinate officers. In the late 19th century, the concept of delegating authority from the President or department heads to subordinate officers began to shift with the creation of independent regulatory commissions. This trend continued into the 20th century with the establishment of \"independent\" agencies like the Tennessee Valley Authority and NASA, which operated outside of traditional departments but still followed general management laws. The idea of government accountability to politically responsible officials was emphasized in the Hoover Commission report of 1949. In the 20th century, the Hoover Commission report of 1949 emphasized the need for clear lines of control from the President to department and agency heads, promoting departmental integration and political accountability in the executive branch. In the 20th century, the Hoover Commission report of 1949 emphasized the centrality of public law, departmental integration, and political accountability. The President was seen as the main administrator of the system, with a focus on protecting citizens' rights. However, in the 1960s, there was a shift towards more flexible organizational structures, such as the creation of the Communications Satellite Corporation (ComSat) in 1962. This marked a departure from the traditional governmental-private sector divide, with the term \"quasi governmental\" emerging in legislation to describe these new entities. The trend towards flexibility sometimes led to less accountability, as seen in the establishment of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 to address the erosion of the accountable executive model in the federal government. The concept of distinct governmental and private sectors was questioned in the late 1980s, leading to the emergence of the \"new public management\" concept. This movement argued that both sectors were essentially alike and subject to the same economic-based norms and practices. The New Public Management (NPM) movement, along with the privatization of governmental agencies and programs, became dominant internationally. The New Public Management (NPM) movement, along with the privatization of governmental agencies and programs, became dominant internationally. Vice President Albert J. Gore's National Performance Review (NPR) aimed to \"reinvent\" executive branch units with entrepreneurial structures, focusing on improving performance through flexibility and measuring results. Entrepreneurial management encourages risk-taking by managers to achieve better outcomes, leading to improved management in many executive agencies. The rapid ascendency of \"new\" values in the United States has had consequences for the quasi government, particularly in agencies like the Internal Revenue Service. Improving performance can be politically counterproductive if it compromises other values, such as due process of law. The United States Government Manual lists quasi-official agencies like the Legal Services Corporation and the Smithsonian Institution. The National Archives and Records Administration designates certain entities as quasi-official agencies, which are not executive agencies but are required by statute to publish information in the Federal Register. These agencies occupy a realm between the private and public sectors, leading to legal status issues. Quasi-official agencies, including government-sponsored enterprises, exist in a gray area between the governmental and private sectors. They have autonomy but are still subject to political influences and pressures similar to regular executive agencies. The distinction between governmental and private sectors is blurred in these organizations, and there are no established criteria for their establishment. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the U.S. are created uniquely by Congress through enabling legislation, without established criteria or a specific listing in the U.S. Code. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 defined GSEs as corporate entities with a Federal charter, privately owned, under the direction of a board of directors elected by private owners, and with the power to make loans or loan guarantees for specific purposes. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the U.S. are created uniquely by Congress through enabling legislation. GSEs are defined as corporate entities with a Federal charter, privately owned, and have the power to make loans or loan guarantees for specific purposes. GSEs may benefit from an implicit federal guarantee to enhance their ability to borrow money. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the U.S. have four key characteristics: private ownership, implicit federal guarantee of obligations, activities limited by congressional charter, and limited competition. GSEs were created by Congress to increase credit availability to disadvantaged sectors of the economy. They provide financial services such as issuing capital stock, guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities, purchasing loans, and funding activities. GSEs have benefits and privileges in their charters not available to fully private corporations, in exchange for limitations on their activities and business lines. The GSEs in the U.S. have specific activities and lines of business limited by Congress to promote public policy objectives. There are five GSEs, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Farmer Mac, designed to be investor-owned, while others are cooperatively owned. Advocates argue that GSEs meet national needs not addressed by the private sector, are well-managed, financially sound, and assist less-advantaged mortgage borrowers. The GSEs, such as Fannie Mae, maintain that their federal implied guarantee helps lower mortgage rates for consumers. Fannie Mae claims that their special status saves families money on mortgage interest, allowing 400,000 families to qualify for mortgages. The economic rationale for GSEs is to ensure necessary debt financing is available efficiently, with government support encouraging private financial intermediaries. The GSEs, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were created by the U.S. Treasury to boost private financial intermediaries in specific markets. They successfully increased liquidity in national mortgage credit markets but face criticism for accountability issues and financial stability concerns due to their ability to borrow at lower rates than private lenders. Their size and wealth allow for heavy congressional lobbying, leading to perceived political influence. The GSEs, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, grew rapidly by borrowing money at lower interest rates. Concerns arose about their size and systemic risk, especially after accounting irregularities were discovered in 2003 and 2004. This led to congressional hearings and legislative considerations to alter regulations. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into government conservatorship due to financial instability. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under government conservatorship by Secretary of the Treasury, Henry M. Paulson, Jr., to stabilize financial markets and protect taxpayers. The U.S. Treasury provided $150 billion in direct support to the GSEs, and the Federal Reserve purchased nearly $1.4 trillion in GSE-issued mortgage-backed securities. This was not the first time the GSEs faced operational challenges, as seen in the 1980s with Fannie Mae's negative net worth of $11 billion. The federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) is a hybrid organization created during World War II to utilize private organizations to meet federal needs. National laboratories like Oak Ridge and Los Alamos were government-owned but operated by non-federal entities. The Department of Defense, especially the Air Force, retained this talent base post-war. The decision to establish private, nonprofit corporations known as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) was made to retain the talent base assembled by the government. The first FFRDC, RAND, was created by the Air Force in 1947 in California, followed by others like Mitre Corporation and Aerospace. As of April 2010, there were 39 FFRDCs according to the National Science Foundation. Despite some FFRDCs transforming into private organizations, new ones continue to be established, showing that FFRDCs are not fading away. In the past decade, new FFRDCs have been established by various federal entities, with annual federal obligations totaling approximately $9.5 billion in FY2009. Critics have raised concerns about potential favoritism, lack of competitive bidding, and the revolving door of personnel between government agencies, FFRDCs, and associated companies. Critics raise concerns about the revolving door between government agencies, FFRDCs, and associated companies, citing interlocking directorships. FFRDCs are praised for their flexibility in assembling expert teams and promoting technology transfers to the private sector. The knowledge base created by FFRDCs often leads to commercially relevant efforts in the private sector. The United States struggles to effectively commercialize basic research results compared to other nations. FFRDCs aim to facilitate this process, but some in Congress see them as a way to bypass hiring practices and salary limits. FFRDCs have advantages in competing for contracts due to their nonprofit status and government-owned facilities. Congressional inquiries have led to some changes in laws regarding FFRDCs. Some changes in law have reduced the scope of contract work available to FFRDCs, making more outsourced work available to competitive contracting. Congress has limited the power of certain agencies to create FFRDCs. Conflict of interest issues may arise with FFRDCs, especially when affiliated with non-FFRDC corporations. FFRDCs have privileged access to government information, which can be challenging to separate from private partners involved in for-profit activities. Critics argue that unbiased advice may be compromised when the advising FFRDC's future is at stake. Federal management of FFRDCs is based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides guidelines for establishing and managing FFRDCs, limiting their use to long-term research needs. Nonprofit organizations with legal relationships to federal agencies are classified into three categories: adjunct organizations, independent organizations dependent on agencies, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provides guidelines for establishing and managing FFRDCs, limiting their use to long-term research needs. Nonprofit organizations with legal relationships to federal agencies are classified into three categories: adjunct organizations, independent organizations dependent on agencies, and nonprofit organizations voluntarily affiliated with departments and agencies. These categories are not pure and have some arbitrary distinctions, but they provide a useful starting point for understanding agency-related nonprofit organizations within the quasi government. The Department of Agriculture utilizes adjunct organizations extensively. The Department of Agriculture utilizes adjunct organizations extensively, including 18 agricultural commodity organizations engaged in promoting, researching, and providing information on agricultural commodities. The Secretary of Agriculture has varying degrees of authority over these boards, regulated by the Commodity Promotion, Research, and Information Act of 1996. This law allows the Secretary to establish new commodity organizations under departmental orders. The Commodity Promotion Act of 1996 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to establish new commodity organizations under departmental orders. These organizations are required to submit plans, projects, and budgets for approval related to promoting, researching, and providing information on agricultural commodities. The Commodity Promotion Act of 1996 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to establish new commodity organizations under departmental orders. Each order must include a budget submission before the fiscal year and reimburse the Secretary for expenses. These organizations are authorized to collect assessments from members to promote products generically. The Commodity Promotion Act of 1996 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to establish commodity organizations through referenda. These organizations are supervised by the Agricultural Marketing Service and must undergo renewal referenda every seven years. The referendum majority is defined by various criteria. The Commodity Promotion Act of 1996 allows the Secretary of Agriculture to establish commodity organizations through referenda, supervised by the Agricultural Marketing Service. Advance registration procedures are outlined in the law, with subsequent changes requiring legislative approval. The AMS assists the boards in administering the referendum process. However, the promotion programs have faced criticism for inappropriate spending and lax accounting, leading to the Secretary instituting a task force to make recommendations for better oversight. The task force issued 21 recommendations in December 1999. The Commodity Promotion Act of 1996 allowed the Secretary of Agriculture to establish commodity organizations through referenda, with the AMS assisting in administering the process. In December 1999, a task force issued 21 recommendations for better oversight of promotion programs, some of which faced court challenges for fees being considered \"government compelled speech.\" Nonprofit organizations have been created by Congress to perform functions that departments find difficult to integrate into regular policy and financial processes. The National Park Foundation and other organizations receive gifts of real property and monetary gifts to support department programs. The National Park Service established a National Park Trust Fund in 1935, later superseded by the National Park Foundation in 1967, to accept and administer such gifts. The NPF, a congressionally chartered nonprofit corporation, has the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the NPS on its board. The National Park Foundation board includes the Secretary of the Interior, the Director of the NPS, and private citizens appointed by the Secretary. The board has over 20 members, with private citizens serving six-year terms. The foundation receives funding from private gifts and provides program grants and support. Membership on the board is not considered a federal office, and the foundation operates independently from the federal budget. In FY2010, the National Park Foundation (NPF) provided $22.3 million in grants and support to the National Park Service. The NPF is considered an adjunct of the department and NPS, with board appointments ensuring adherence to department policies. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) was established by Congress in 1970 to protect cash and securities in brokerage firms from losses. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is governed by a seven-member board of directors, with appointments made by various entities including the President and the Secretary of the Treasury. The SIPC operates as a nonprofit corporation under D.C. law but is effectively a subsidiary of the SEC, with its bylaws subject to SEC approval. The SIPC's unique legal characteristics exempt it from general management laws but subject it to the Administrative Procedure Act through SEC oversight. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was established by Congress in 2002 to oversee the audit of public companies subject to securities laws. The board, a nonprofit corporation under DC law, sets standards for audit reports by issuers under SEC supervision. Members of the full-time board are appointed by the SEC and can be removed for cause. The Commission can remove board members for \"good cause\" and approves the board's rules. Concerns arose when the board voted for high salaries at their organizing meeting. The SIPC and PCAOB show how the government can create hybrid organizations with private-sector characteristics to enforce regulations. The legality of delegating governmental functions to private parties is a topic of debate. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation, established in 1982, is an example of a nonprofit organization independent of the federal government but dependent on it. The foundation, originally named the Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, was renamed after Senator Henry M. Jackson. The enabling legislation ensures legal distance between the foundation and the government, emphasizing its mission. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation, established in 1982, is a nonprofit organization with a close relationship with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Its mission includes medical research, education projects, and collaboration between military and civilian medical personnel. The foundation's board includes two Senators and two Representatives. The Henry M. Jackson Foundation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the USU, supports military medical research and grants management services. It facilitates collaborations between federal military and private medical personnel, manages clinical trials, and develops private-public partnerships. The foundation employs 1,600 people and administers over 1,000 research projects, filling a vital role in enabling relationships between private industry, academia, and military medicine. The Secretary may authorize the establishment of nonprofit research and education corporations at VA medical centers to fund approved research. As of 2009, there were 86 such corporations in 41 states, receiving funds from federal and non-federal sources. These corporations reported $240.7 million in revenues and $241.9 million in expenditures. The Secretary appoints boards for nonprofit research and education corporations at VA medical centers, including key personnel. Each corporation has an executive director appointed by the board with the Chief Medical Director's approval. The corporations can hire employees, set compensation, and are overseen by the department's Inspector General. Directors and employees must adhere to federal laws on conflicts of interest. The medical center research organizations have faced criticism for their spending practices, but they have also been credited with enhancing VA research efforts. Nonprofits have used funds to improve research facilities, purchase equipment, and attract qualified physicians. Some nonprofit organizations voluntarily affiliate with government programs, as seen with the National Park Foundation. The National Park Foundation (NPF) is considered an adjunct organization under the Department of the Interior's control. Authorized by the National Park Omnibus Management Act of 1998, it aims to create nonprofit Park Partners at the individual national park unit level to promote philanthropy. These Park Partners are established by community members under state laws and are intended to affiliate voluntarily with the foundation. The National Park Foundation (NPF) was authorized by the National Park Omnibus Management Act of 1998 to create nonprofit Park Partners at the individual national park unit level. These Park Partners are established by community members under state laws and are intended to affiliate voluntarily with the foundation. The foundation is instructed to provide support for the creation of Park Partners through organizational design formats, bylaws, money-handling procedures, and training curriculum. Several Park Partner organizations are currently supporting specific parks like Grand Teton, Glacier, and Sequoia, with the potential for more nonprofit corporations to be established for the over 375 park properties in the system. The legislation allows for the creation of numerous Park Partner nonprofit corporations affiliated with the National Park Foundation. The ultimate authority and accountability of these corporations lie with the local organization's governing board. Hybrid organizations, such as venture capital funds, play various roles domestically and internationally, especially after the fall of Communism in 1989. The Support for Eastern European Democracy Act of 1990 authorized the establishment of enterprise funds in Poland and Hungary to assist in transitioning to a market economy. Similar enterprise funds have been proposed for Egypt and Tunisia to promote democracy. These funds operate as private nonprofit corporations managed by private sector executives to avoid government constraints. The Support for Eastern European Democracy Act of 1990 authorized the establishment of enterprise funds in Poland and Hungary to develop the national private sectors through various measures. These funds, chartered as private nonprofit corporations, are funded by government appropriations and operate independently from government constraints. Additionally, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) also promotes private investments through investment funds in former communist states. OPIC provides political risk insurance and loan guarantees to U.S. corporations investing in developing countries. It supports private equity funds in emerging markets and has committed over $2.6 billion in funding since 1987. The focus is on organizational characteristics rather than programmatic success. The focus is on the organizational characteristics of venture capital funds and their relationship with the executive and legislative branches. Initially, there was limited executive branch oversight of enterprise funds, but concerns over alleged excesses led to increased oversight by both Congress and the executive branch. The enterprise funds operate as nonprofit corporations under state laws. The OPIC investment funds, chartered as nonprofit corporations, are governed by a board of directors designated by the President of the United States. They provide guarantees to private lenders who then lend money to recipients. OPIC is a government corporation subject to general management laws, with a 15-member board including senior presidential appointees and direct presidential appointees. The board is chaired by the Administrator of AID. OPIC, chaired by the Administrator of AID, is overseen by a board appointed by the President. The President appoints OPIC's president, subject to Senate confirmation. OPIC undergoes annual budgetary review and is criticized for its insurance programs benefiting American corporations. The office actively oversees its investment funds by selecting fund management and negotiating loan guaranty agreements for compliance. Compliance, not performance, is the primary focus of OPIC's fund oversight. Koppell's analysis suggests that the federal government can maintain accountability over enterprise and investment funds through regulatory practices rather than direct administrative control. He questions the effectiveness of the board of directors in promoting accountability and raises the issue of whether venture capital funds should be permanent or temporary entities. In 2001, the Polish-American Enterprise Fund returned $120 million of its assets to the U.S. In 2001, the Polish-American Enterprise Fund returned $120 million to the U.S. Treasury and transferred $180 million to the Polish American Freedom Foundation. The Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund also plans to liquidate and return funds to the U.S. Treasury. Venture capital funds have been established for technology research, with In-Q-Tel being the first one funded by the CIA. In 2001, the CIA funded In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit corporation aimed at investing in technology companies for future mission needs. The board of directors includes private corporate executives, and the agency aims to adopt a more entrepreneurial and risk-taking approach. In-Q-Tel is part of a larger trend of government-backed venture capital entities. The Department of the Army created a non-profit venture capital corporation called OnPoint Technologies. NASA also established Red Planet Capital, now known as Astrolabe Ventures, to invest in companies producing unique products that NASA could potentially use. The ultimate goal is to develop technologies relevant to aerospace and commercial markets. Venture capital funds involving the federal government in private equity markets are controversial. Congress chartered nonprofit organizations with patriotic, charitable, historical, or educational purposes in the 20th century. Congress has authority to establish organizations within both the governmental and private sectors, including chartered organizations like the Agricultural Hall of Fame, Big Brothers and Sisters of America, and the American Legion. In the private sector, Congress can charter new for-profit and nonprofit corporations, with notable examples like the Communications Satellite Corporation (ComSat) in 1962. Title 36 corporations can function under both federal and state charters, often starting as state-chartered nonprofits before receiving federal charters. Controversy arises over issues of managerial accountability, fiduciary responsibility, and governmental rights. Congressional authority in chartering organizations under Subtitle II includes patriotic, charitable, and professional organizations like the National Academy of Public. Congress does not confer governmental powers or benefits to organizations under Subtitle II, like the National Academy of Public Administration. These organizations do not receive direct appropriations, exercise federal powers, or have debts covered by the US. The federal chartering process is mainly honorific, but organizations should not imply a direct relationship with the government. The privatization of the Defense Department's Civilian Marksmanship Program raises questions about Congress's authority to assign a \"private\" label to governmental functions. The Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety, a Title 36 corporation, is declared as private despite having some governmental attributes. The law allows for private, nonprofit organizations to seek federal charters under Title 36, but there are debates over whether these organizations should be considered private or governmental. There are potential risks involved, such as losing private rights and being subject to government regulations. In 1997, Congress amended the Federal Advisory Committee Act to include two Title 36 corporations, which led to them being subject to management laws applicable to government agencies. The National Academy of Public Administration and the National Academy of Sciences were included under specific provisions of P.L. 105-153, making them subject to general management laws applicable to government agencies. This diminishes the private character of these organizations and raises questions about the consequences of granting charters to private organizations without clearly established criteria. Federal supervision of congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations is limited. Private organizations seeking a federal charter must meet five minimum standards set by Congress in 1969. These organizations are required to have independent audits annually, with reports submitted to Congress. Audit reports are typically received by the House Subcommittee on Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law, and then reviewed by the Government Accountability Office. Federal supervision of congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations is limited. The Government Accountability Office reviews audits received from these organizations. Public access to their records varies, with some restrictions on the printing of reports. The House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims Chairman Barney Frank announced in 1992 that requests for charters would no longer be considered, stating that granting charters implied congressional supervision, which was not the case. In the 104th Congress, the House subcommittee stopped considering legislation for new federal charters, as they were deemed unnecessary for charitable organizations and falsely implied congressional approval. The moratorium continued through the 111th Congress, and it is uncertain if it will be renewed in the 112th Congress. Despite this, requests for new federal charters persisted. During the 110th Congress, a federal charter was granted to the Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated. Some hybrid organizations do not fit neatly into quasi-government categories and may require separate consideration. Examples include the American Institute in Taiwan, National Endowment for Democracy, and United States Investigation Services. President Jimmy Carter established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in December 1978. President Carter established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, ending the mutual defense treaty with Taiwan. Congress enacted the Taiwan Relations Act to maintain a relationship with Taiwan without official diplomatic recognition. The American Institute in Taiwan was established as a private, nonprofit corporation under the laws of the District of Columbia, with its headquarters in the United States. Most employees are Foreign Service officers \"separated\" from the Department of State, entitled to governmental benefits during their employment at the Institute. Taiwan also established a similar organization. Relations between the United States and China have fluctuated over the years. The American Institute in Taiwan serves as an effective channel for government relations between the United States and Taiwan. Despite political strains between the United States and China, the institute continues to function without major conflicts. In 1983, the Reagan Administration proposed \"Project Democracy\" to support democratic institutions abroad, leading to the creation of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was established in response to the Reagan Administration's \"Project Democracy\" to promote democratic institutions globally. NED is a private, nonprofit corporation separate from the U.S. government, utilizing American political parties, labor, and business organizations to advance its mission. Core organizations representing these groups were expected to be created as private, nonprofit entities. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) was established as a private, nonprofit organization separate from the U.S. government. It relies on core grantees like the NDI, IRI, ACILS, and CIPE to conduct democracy programs in countries where direct foreign aid is restricted. This hybrid status ensures NED is not seen as a government arm and allows for fourth-party administration of programs. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) operates as a private, nonprofit organization independent from the government, providing fourth-party administration of infrastructure promotion. The NED board, led by President Carl Gershman and Chairman Richard A. Gephardt, oversees funding from the Department of State. The NED, funded by the Department of State, received $117.8 million in FY2011. It must comply with general management laws, including the Freedom of Information Act. There is debate in Congress over whether the US government should fund organizations like the NED to promote democracy. The NED operates as a hybrid organization under both private and public law. Critics accuse the NED of mission creep and interference in democratic elections. Vice President Gore's downsizing program led to cuts in central management agencies like OPM, potentially downsizing the security and investigations unit due to declining workload post-Cold War. The Director of OPM, James King, established a private corporation through an ESOP to transfer employees from a federal agency to save jobs and money by outsourcing investigations. The Director of OPM, James King, decided to move forward with establishing a private corporation through an ESOP despite opposition regarding civil rights and privacy issues. OPM chose American Capital Strategies (ACS) to develop a business plan and selected Philip Harper to lead the management team. Philip Harper, with King's agreement, established the U.S. Investigation Service (USIS) in April 1996 in Delaware. The corporation initially had one share and one employee, Harper. By August 1996, 700 former Office of Federal Investigations employees became private employees of USIS. Employee-shareholders owned 91% of the company valued at $28.2 million, while Harper and 11 other officers held the remaining shares. USIS is governed by a nine-member board of directors, with five \"inside\" members including Harper and two others elected by employees. The board of directors at USIS, led by Philip Harper, focuses on ownership issues and oversight rather than running the company. They ensure resources are allocated in the best interests of employee shareholders and approve key strategic decisions. USIS was awarded a noncompetitive contract by OPM, providing security and access to government databases. The USIS, a government-sponsored private corporation, has access to exclusive government databases. Critics argue that background investigations should be conducted by federal employees for accountability. They believe that privatization may lead to issues such as job placement and profitability in governmental activities. The desirability of \"profitability\" for governmental activities is not a justification for creating and supporting the hybrid organization. Critics argue that personnel investigations for the government have unique legal needs and requirements. The Clinton Administration and supporters see the privatization of OPM's activities as a creative response to changing circumstances. The USIS's transition into the private sector, particularly with contracts in the casino industry, raised concerns about the privatization process and the blending of government and private sectors. Assets worth $28 million were transferred to USIS, but the Carlyle Group's purchase of shares proved to be a wise investment as the company experienced significant growth in business in 1999. The USIS underwent a surge in business, with a 702% increase in share value in 1999. Welsh, Carson, Anderson, and Stowe purchased stock from original ESOP employees for $545 million in January 2003. The reorganization of the executive branch is evident through the transition of departments into agencies and the assignment of agencies to the quasi government. The quasi government discussed in this report has consequences for the institutional presidency and Congress. Observers believe that organizational leadership seeks autonomy in policy and operations. The constitutional paradigm of management is based on laws and accountability structures, with the President as chief manager of the executive branch. The public law model of management prioritizes political accountability over efficiency. The founding fathers envisioned a unified executive structure with hierarchical lines of authority. The government and private sector were kept legally distinct to protect citizens' rights. However, in the 1960s, public choice theory challenged these traditional management values. The entrepreneurial management paradigm, influenced by public choice theory, emphasizes market principles in electing political leaders. It promotes the idea that governmental and private sectors operate similarly, leading to the adoption of New Public Management (NPM) and National Performance Review (NPR) concepts. Critics argue that this paradigm shifts focus from public law to economic norms, prioritizing customer over citizen, and replacing departmental integration with agency dispersion and managerial autonomy. Critics believe that the historic wall between the governmental and private sectors is being breached as a matter of policy, with government entrepreneurs forging public/private partnerships. Those advocating entrepreneurial management value flexibility, numerical performance standards, and oppose hierarchical leadership structures. Their attitudes towards the quasi government differ from those favoring traditional public law principles. The hybrid organization within the quasi government is seen as an attractive option due to its emphasis on change and managerial risk-taking. Advocates of public law management believe in implementing laws passed by Congress over maximizing performance or satisfying customers. They prioritize political accountability over efficiency and outcomes, viewing quasi governmental entities as serving small constituencies at the expense of democratic institutions. Supporters of performance-based criteria for government management emphasize flexibility, competition, and performance as key goals. They believe that the quasi government, free from alleged micromanagement and budgetary constraints, allows for creative and successful management. In this view, the future of management lies in quasi government entities where managers can operate within the boundaries of the law. In the new entrepreneurial management paradigm, success is measured by customer trust and satisfaction in the delivery of governmental services. The emergence of quasi government can be seen as a decline in democratic governance or a new era of creative management using market principles for national well-being. Debate over the legitimacy and utility of quasi government will likely continue in the future."
