    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 2764) was signed into law (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, 2007. It included funding for the Iraq war and allocated $37.2 billion for the Veterans Health Administration, with $2.6 billion designated as contingent emergency funding. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received $37.2 billion in funding from the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. The VA provides benefits and services to eligible veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, healthcare, education, and burial expenses. The VA operates through three administrations and the board of veterans appeals. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for healthcare services, while the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) provides compensations and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintains national cemeteries. The VA's budget includes mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, vocational rehabilitation, and life insurance. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services, including medical care. In FY2007, discretionary budget authority accounted for about 48.1% of the total VA budget authority of approximately $80 billion, with about 90% of this discretionary funding going toward supporting VA health-care programs. The VHA operates the nation's largest integrated direct health-care delivery system. The VA's health-care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) with management authority delegated to VISNs. Congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system. The VHA provides care directly to veterans through 155 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, and 717 facilities. In FY2007, the VHA operated 155 medical centers, 135 nursing homes, 717 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient clinics, and 209 Readjustment Counseling Centers. The VHA also pays for care provided to veterans by private-sector providers and collaborates with the Department of Defense in sharing health-care resources. During FY2007, the VHA had an estimated total enrolled veteran population of 7.9 million and provided medical care to about 5.2 million unique veteran patients. The number of unique veteran patients is estimated to increase by approximately 110,000 from 5.2 million in FY2007 to 5.3 million in FY2008. The total number of outpatient visits is projected to increase to 67.4 million in FY2008. VA health care is not an entitlement program, and understanding eligibility and enrollment processes is important. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, provisions of law governing eligibility for VA care were complex. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories and required the VHA to manage care through an enrollment system based on priorities. VA is not an entitlement program, and not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA care: \"higher priority\" or \"core\" veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances, and veterans of World War I, and veterans with no service-connected disabilities and higher incomes. VA was authorized to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to care. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established two eligibility categories for VA care, with a new enrollment system to manage access. P.L. 104-262 required a national enrollment system for inpatient and outpatient care, with health services dependent on available resources and discretionary appropriations. The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 established new eligibility standards to prioritize medical judgment over legal criteria for care provision. Veterans can apply for enrollment by completing VA Form 10-10EZ online, in person, or by mail/fax at any VA medical center. Once enrolled, veterans remain in the system without needing to reapply annually. Veterans enrolled in Priority Group 5 must submit VA Form 10-10EZ annually with updated financial information. Eligibility for VA health care is based on veteran's status from military service, requiring active-duty status and an honorable discharge. Certain service requirements apply, but servicemembers discharged due to service-connected disabilities are exempt. Reservists called to active duty must complete their term to be eligible for VA health-care benefits. Reservists called to active duty and National Guard members activated by federal executive order may be exempt from the 24-month active duty requirement for VA health-care services if they completed their term and received an other than dishonorable discharge. Reserve component members have limited eligibility for VA health care when not on full-time federal service. They may receive service-connection for injuries incurred during duty-related activities. National Guard members are not granted service-connection for injuries, heart attacks, or strokes that occur during state-ordered duty. Veterans with service-connected disabilities or low incomes are considered \"high priority\" by the VA and are enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 for care. The VA prioritizes veterans in need of care for service-connected disabilities, compensable conditions, POWs, Purple Heart recipients, catastrophically disabled veterans, World War I veterans, those exposed to hazardous agents, and those with low income and net worth. Income and net worth determine priority category and co-payment requirements for nonservice-connected care. Veterans must disclose health insurance coverage to the VA. The VA may bill health insurance for treatment not related to military service. Veterans with nonservice-connected conditions and higher incomes are in Priority Group 7 or 8. VHA provides priority care for service-connected veterans rated 50% or more. According to VHA policies, veterans with emergency or urgent medical needs must receive care promptly regardless of service-connected status. Those rated 50% or more service-connected must be seen within 30 days, while those rated less than 50% must also be seen within 30 days for service-connected conditions. Veterans in other priority groups should be seen within 120 days. The VHA requires outpatient appointment requests to be acted on within seven days. Priority scheduling must not impact other veterans' care. Veterans with service-connected conditions cannot be prioritized over those with more acute needs. VHA funding comes from various sources, including appropriations for medical care, research, prosthetics, and administration. Congress also allocates funds for medical facility construction. In FY2004, Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure to improve oversight and accounting of funds. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 funded VHA through four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care, treatment of veterans and dependents, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, equipment, and employee salaries. The VA's FY2008 budget request included transferring food service operations costs to medical services appropriations. The medical administration account covers hospital and nursing home expenses, quality of care oversight, and legal services. The medical facilities account includes maintenance, operation, and construction expenses for VHA facilities. The VA's budget includes funding for VA researchers to investigate veteran-centric health topics. Funding comes from various sources including DOD, NIH, and private sources. Total funding for VHA increased between FY2006 and FY2008, mainly due to increased spending on medical services. Spending on medical facilities, administration, and research has remained stable. The VHA receives funding from various sources, including medical care cost recovery collections authorized by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. These funds are retained in the Medical Care Collections Fund and can be used for medical services for veterans without fiscal year limitations. The VA can bill veterans and health-care insurers for nonservice-connected care to help defray the cost of delivering medical services. The VA changed its billing basis from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2004 and 2005 allowed funds from various accounts to be deposited into the MCCF. The VA has permanent authority to deposit funds into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. A revenue improvement demonstration project was established to restructure the revenue cycle. The VHA is collecting only 41% of billed amounts from third-party insurance companies. A pilot Consolidated Patient Account Center has been set up in VISN 6. In VISN 6, a pilot Consolidated Patient Account Center has increased MCCF collections by 31% from $1.5 billion in FY2003 to $2.0 billion in FY2006. First-party collections also rose by 26% during this period. The President's FY2007 budget proposal requested $32.7 billion for the VHA, with increases in funding for medical services, administration, facilities, and research. The House passed the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2007, providing $32.7 billion for the VHA, including $25.4 billion for medical services. This was an 11.4% increase over FY2006 funding levels. The Senate passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2007, providing $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration, including $28.7 billion for medical services, a significant increase over previous funding levels. The Senate passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2007, providing $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration, including $28.7 billion for medical services. The Senate version of H.R. 5385 also allocated $3.6 billion for medical facilities and $412 million for medical and prosthetic research. Congress did not pass the MIL-CON-VA appropriations bill for FY2007 at the end of the 109th Congress, funding most government agencies, including the VA, through Continuing Appropriations Resolutions. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 (H.J.Res. 20, P.L. 110-5) provided $32.7 billion for the Veterans Health Administration for FY2007, including allocations for medical services, administration, facilities, and research. It did not include provisions for fee increases as requested by the Administration. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (H.R. 2206) was approved by the House and Senate on May 24, 2007. The Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (H.R. 2206) provided $1.34 billion for the VHA for FY2007, including funding for medical services, rehabilitation programs, substance abuse treatment, mental health services, and prosthetics. The Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (H.R. 2206) allocated $1.34 billion for the VHA in FY2007, covering medical services, rehabilitation programs, substance abuse treatment, mental health services, and prosthetics. In addition, P.L. 110-28 provided $326 million for construction projects, $250 million for medical administration, and $595 million for medical facilities in FY2008. The President's FY2008 budget proposal requested $34.6 billion for the VHA, a 1.93% increase from FY2007. The President's budget proposal for FY2008 allocated approximately $37.0 billion for the VHA, with $27.2 billion for medical services, $3.4 billion for medical administration, $3.6 billion for medical facilities, and $411 million for medical and prosthetic research. The budget also included cost-sharing proposals and was approved by the House and Senate in May 2007, providing a total of $85.3 billion in budget. The conference agreement for FY2008 provided $85.3 billion in budget authority for veterans benefits and services, with $43.1 billion allocated for discretionary veterans' programs, mainly VA medical care. The agreement rejected proposed veterans' health-care enrollment fees and co-payment increases. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $37.1 billion for the VHA for FY2008, a 9.3% increase over the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $37.1 billion for the VHA for FY2008, a 9.3% increase over the previous year. This included $28.9 billion for medical services, with allocations for specialty mental health care, homeless veterans grant programs, substance abuse programs, and blind rehabilitation services. Additionally, funds were allocated for medical administration, facilities, and prosthetic research. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $37.1 billion for the VHA for FY2008, a 9.3% increase over the previous year, including $28.9 billion for medical services. The committee did not recommend fee increases as requested by the Administration. H.R. 2642 provided $29.0 billion for medical services, with a transfer of $125 million for the establishment of an Office of Rural Health. Representative Jerry Moran offered an amendment to transfer $120 million to increase funding for the Veterans Beneficiary Travel Program as directed by P.L. 109-461. The MILCON-VA appropriations bill provided $3.5 billion for the medical administration account, $68.6 million above the FY2008 request. H.R. 2642 allocated approximately $2.2 billion for VA construction projects, including funding for CARES projects for VA medical facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a draft version of the MILCON-VA appropriations bill, providing $37.2 billion for the VHA, including $29.0 billion for medical services and $3.6 billion for medical administration. The Senate version of the MILCON-VA appropriations bill provided $4.1 billion for medical facilities, a 14.0% increase over the FY2008 request. Additionally, $500 million was allocated for medical and prosthetic research, a 12% increase over the FY2007 enacted amount. The committee did not recommend fee increases as requested by the Administration's budget proposal for the VHA for FY2008. The Senate allocated $125 million from the medical administration account to the medical services account, increasing funding for medical services by $3.2 billion. H.R. 2642 provided $1.7 billion for VA construction projects, with specific projects funded by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The committee continued the practice of not earmarking major construction projects not requested in the President's budget proposal. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 (H.R. 2764) at the end of 2007, combining 11 appropriations bills. The bill included the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008, providing $37.2 billion for VHA for FY2008, $2.6 billion above the Administration's request. The FY2008 budget request for VHA included $2.6 billion in contingent emergency funding, which was designated for obligation after the President's budget request. The total amount appropriated for VHA was $29.1 billion, with $2 billion allocated to the medical services account, exceeding the President's request. Additional funding was provided for beneficiary travel reimbursement, substance abuse services, outpatient services for the blind, and Vet Centers. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 allocated $1.9 billion for VA construction projects, with an increase of $818 million over the Administration's request. This funding addressed insufficient levels in the advanced planning fund and cost adjustments for major construction projects. Additionally, the Act provided funding for specialty mental health care, homeless grants, and per diem programs. The Appropriations Act (H.R. 2764, P.L. 110-161) included provisions for joint efforts between DOD and VA to improve care for veterans, including joint clinics and research. There is a lack of specific diagnostic codes for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), making it difficult to quantify cases. DOD and VA are working to refine codes to better reflect the TBI patient population. The Appropriation Committees directed the Administration to include Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as a select program within the medical services account to address special needs of TBI patients. Increased funding was allocated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act to improve access to substance abuse services and maintain adequate inpatient psychiatric care. The VA was directed to reexamine the policy for reducing psychiatric inpatient care, considering the needs of OIF and OEF veterans. Inpatient psychiatric beds should not be reduced at facilities with waiting lists. The VA was also directed to address the issue of veterans' access to care in remote rural areas by providing a report on challenges and costs faced by these veterans and the need to improve access to locally administered care. Funding for alternative medical services in areas without VA facilities was also highlighted. The report should assess increasing local access to medical services for veterans in remote rural areas through partnerships with government and private healthcare providers. The DOD and VA are directed to provide a joint report on achieving an interoperable electronic medical record system, detailing ongoing and planned projects. The Administration has proposed legislative changes in its FY2008 budget request. The Administration's FY2008 budget request includes legislative proposals for health care for veterans, with concerns raised by House and Senate Appropriations Committees about long-term costs and accuracy of cost estimates. Key proposals include tiered annual enrollment fees based on family income for Priority 7 and 8 veterans. The Administration's FY2008 budget proposes tiered annual enrollment fees for Priority 7 and 8 veterans based on family income, with increased pharmaceutical co-payments and billing for nonservice-connected conditions. The proposal aims to generate over $138 million annually for the Treasury, increasing revenue by $526 million over five years. The Administration's proposal in the FY2008 budget suggests tiered annual enrollment fees for Priority 7 and 8 veterans based on family income, along with increasing pharmacy co-payments from $8 to $15 for medication for nonservice-connected conditions. This proposal aims to generate over $138 million annually for the Treasury. The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 authorized the VA to increase medication co-payment amounts and establish annual caps for veterans in Priority Groups 2-6. The medication co-payment was increased to $8 for a 30-day supply of medication for nonservice-connected conditions, with an annual cap of $960 for Priority Groups 2-6. There is no cap for veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8. The VA estimates that this proposal would contribute $311 million to the Treasury in FY2008 and increase revenue by $1.6 billion over five years. The MILCON-VA Appropriation Act (P.L. 110-161) does not authorize the VA to increase co-payments. VA estimates show that imposing an enrollment fee and increasing pharmacy copays may deter 111,000 patients from using the system. The Administration is seeking to eliminate the practice of reducing co-payment debts with third-party health-insurance collections. This proposal aims to align the VA with the DOD health-care system and the private sector. Congress authorized the VA to collect payments from third-party health insurers in 1986. The VA can collect payments from third-party health insurers to offset the cost of treating veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities. Insured veterans with co-payment responsibilities will have their payments applied to their debt. The VA sends bills to insurance providers for reimbursement and puts veterans' co-payment obligations on hold for 90 days. The veteran's co-payment obligation is suspended for 90 days awaiting payment from third-party payers. If no payment is received within this period, the veteran will be billed for the full co-payment amount. Insurers reimbursing the VA after 90 days may result in additional costs for processing refunds. The claim payment is first applied to the co-payment, with the veteran billed for any remaining balance not covered by insurance. Veterans receiving treatment for non-service-connected disabilities will be billed the full co-payment amount under the Administration's proposal. The proposal aims to require veterans to pay their entire co-payment without reduction from third-party health plans. It is estimated to increase revenue by $44 million in FY2008 and $217 million over five years. The Congressional Budget Office predicts a significant increase in VHA medical spending from $35 billion in 2007 to $66 billion in 2025. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are concerned about the accuracy of the President's budget projections for future healthcare costs for veterans. The President's budget has inaccurately projected future healthcare costs for veterans from FY2008-FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee doubts the actuarial model used for projecting health-care demand for OEF and OIF veterans. H.R. 2642 includes a provision directing the CBO to report on annual funding levels for VHA healthcare from FY2009 to FY2012. Appendices provide details on priority groups, veterans' payments, income thresholds, and VHA appropriations for FY2005 and FY2006."
