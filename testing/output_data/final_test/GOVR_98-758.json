Pages have been employed since the early Congresses, providing messenger services as noted in debates and writings within Congress. The page system is formally provided for in law, although the rationale for using high school students is not clear. Since the early Congresses, young adults known as pages have been employed by the United States Congress to provide messenger services. The House has employed pages since the first session held in Washington in 1800, with various reforms implemented over the years to address concerns about supervision, misconduct, and age requirements. In 1982 and 1983, far-reaching reforms were made following reports of insufficient supervision, alleged misconduct, and drug trafficking on Capitol Hill. Following reports of misconduct and drug trafficking on Capitol Hill, reforms were implemented in the 110th Congress to enhance supervision and operation of the House Page Residence Hall. An independent study conducted by consultants led to the implementation of new policies to address the allegations. The House implemented new policies to improve page program safety and supervision following investigations into misconduct. In August 2011, Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced the termination of the House page program due to changes in technology and costs. In the 112th Congress, a resolution was introduced to reestablish the House of Representatives Page Program, creating an advisory panel to make recommendations. The program would have been reinstated in the first school semester after the panel's recommendations were submitted. The advisory panel would have consisted of nine members, including House members from both parties and former House pages. However, the resolution did not progress beyond being referred to the Committee on House Administration. Pages in Congress serve as messengers, carrying documents between the House and Senate, Members' offices, committees, and the Library of Congress. They assist in preparing the Senate chamber, distributing documents, and providing support to Members. The Senate page program is supervised by the Sergeant at Arms and consists of four quarters, including academic year and summer sessions. Senate pages are paid a stipend for their work. Senate pages are paid a stipend and provided with uniforms. They must cover transportation costs to Washington, DC. The Senate offers education and housing at the Daniel Webster Page Residence. The Senate Page School, located in Webster Hall, provides education accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Curriculum focuses on college preparation and unique learning opportunities in DC. Early morning classes are held before Senate convenes. The House page program in DC is overseen by the House Page Board and participants serve for one academic semester or summer session. They receive a stipend and live in a supervised dormitory near the Capitol. Pages are responsible for their uniforms and deductions are taken from their salaries for taxes and fees. Pages in the House Page program in DC wear a uniform of dark grey slacks or skirts, a long sleeve white shirt, a red and blue striped tie, and black shoes. They attend the House Page School in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress, which offers a high-school curriculum, college preparatory courses, and extracurricular activities. Classes are held five days a week starting at 6:45 a.m. before the House convenes."
