The Secretary will award grants for up to 4 years to provide psychiatry services to Indian youth, with priority given to tribes serving communities with a demonstrated need for addressing youth suicide, collaborating with tribal health programs, or serving isolated areas with limited access to behavioral health services.

The Secretary must submit a final report to Congress within 270 days after the termination of the demonstration project. The report should include information on the results of funded projects, impact of telemental health services on reducing suicides among Indian youth, and an evaluation of the demonstration project's continuation.

The Senate passed the bill on May 11, 2006. Attest: EMILY J. REYNOLDS, Secretary."
