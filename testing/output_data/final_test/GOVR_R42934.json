    "content": "On January 15, 2013, the EPA strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for particulate matter to address health effects from exposure. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set minimum standards for pollutants that endanger public health. The law also mandates the evaluation of NAAQS every five years to ensure human health protection. The EPA revised the PM NAAQS in December 2012 after a controversial review process involving various stakeholders. Over 230,000 comments were considered before the final PM standard was determined in January 2013, based on studies up to mid-2009 and recommendations from EPA staff and a scientific advisory panel. The EPA revised the PM NAAQS in 2012 based on studies up to mid-2009 and recommendations from EPA staff and a scientific advisory panel. The agency initiated the next five-year review of the PM NAAQS, leading to a change in the standard by lowering the annual health-based standard for fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns. The final rule on PM NAAQS in 2012 did not adopt a separate standard for visibility impairment or modify the standards for PM 10 particles. Stakeholders in the agricultural community were concerned about potential impacts on agricultural operations. EPA estimated that tightening the PM 2.5 annual standard would provide additional health benefits. The 2012 final rule on PM NAAQS did not include a separate standard for visibility impairment or modify the PM 10 standards. Stakeholders in agriculture were worried about impacts on operations. Tightening the PM 2.5 standard could bring more health benefits. EPA classified 14 areas as \"Moderate\" nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard. EPA designated 20 counties in four states as nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard, with five areas in Georgia classified as unclassifiable. EPA also deferred designations for 11 areas for up to one year based on air quality data for 2014. The EPA designated 20 counties in four states as nonattainment for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard, with five areas in Georgia classified as unclassifiable. The effective date for the final designation rule remained unchanged. Moderate areas must achieve attainment no later than the end of the sixth year after the effective date. EPA regulations implementing pollution control statutes received oversight during the 112th Congress. During the 112th Congress, concerns were raised about EPA's implementation of the Clean Air Act, particularly regarding the PM NAAQS. Some Members proposed legislation and urged oversight in anticipation of changes to the PM NAAQS. Industry stakeholders wanted the final rule delayed, while environmental groups pushed for a tighter standard. Litigation often follows changes to the NAAQS. The CRS report summarizes EPA's changes to the PM NAAQS, including comparisons with previous standards. Particulate matter is one of six \"criteria pollutants\" regulated under the Clean Air Act. PM 2.5 can be emitted directly or form in the atmosphere from gaseous precursors. Particulate matter (PM) is a criteria pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act, with PM 10 being an indicator used in the NAAQS to protect from slightly larger inhalable particles. These particles can come from various sources like dust from roads, construction, industrial processes, and agriculture. NAAQS represents EPA's judgment on pollutant concentration in ambient air to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards for pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare. The process for setting and revising NAAQS involves statutory steps and reviews every five years to reaffirm or modify standards. EPA has revised the PM NAAQS three times prior to January 2013. The EPA has revised the PM NAAQS three times before January 2013 to ensure public health protection. A 2009 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals remanded elements of EPA's 2006 decisions on PM standards for further consideration. The EPA revised PM NAAQS three times before January 2013 for public health protection. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals remanded EPA's 2006 decisions on PM standards. Concerns were raised about EPA's delays in proposing revisions to the standards, leading to legal actions by various organizations and states. The D.C. Circuit directed EPA to sign a proposed rule on revisions to the PM NAAQS by June 14, 2012. The EPA revised PM NAAQS multiple times for public health protection. In 2012, a consent decree required EPA to finalize revisions by December 14. The process involves designating areas as \"attainment\" or \"nonattainment\" based on air monitoring data. EPA works with states to approve or revise these designations. After EPA revises PM NAAQS for public health protection, areas are designated as \"attainment\" or \"nonattainment\" based on air monitoring data. EPA and states agree on designations, and states develop SIPs with regulations to control emissions. Approved SIPs lead to permits for facilities in nonattainment areas. EPA's 1997 revisions introduced standards for PM 10 and PM 2.5 particles. The EPA revised PM NAAQS in 2006, setting annual and daily limits for PM 2.5 and only a daily limit for PM 10. To meet the PM 2.5 annual standard, the three-year average of PM 2.5 concentration at each monitor must not exceed the maximum limit. The 24-hour standards indicate the percent of time a monitoring station can exceed the standard. The secondary NAAQS for PM 2.5 and PM 10 are the same as the primary standards. EPA published final rules on PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards on January 15, 2013. On January 15, 2013, EPA revised PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards. The new PM 2.5 annual standard is 12 \u00b5g/m3, with a daily standard of 35 \u00b5g/m3. For PM 10, the daily standard remains at 150 \u00b5g/m3 with no annual limit. Compliance is based on three-year averages at monitoring sites. EPA's final rules were published on this date. The EPA revised PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards in 2013. The new PM 2.5 annual standard is 12 \u00b5g/m3 with a daily standard of 35 \u00b5g/m3. There is no current annual standard for PM 10. Compliance is based on three-year averages at monitoring sites. EPA's final rules were published on January 15, 2013. The EPA revised PM 2.5 and PM 10 standards in 2013, setting the new PM 2.5 annual standard at 12 \u00b5g/m3 with a daily standard of 35 \u00b5g/m3. The current secondary standard for visibility protection is greater than or equal to 30 dv. Implementation changes include updates to monitoring regulations, such as relocating PM 2.5 monitors to be collocated with other pollutant measurements in urban areas with populations of 1 million or more by January 1, 2015. The EPA is proposing updates to the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM 2.5, aligning the index values with the revised annual PM 2.5 standard. The current upper ends for the \"Hazardous,\" \"Unhealthy,\" and \"Very Unhealthy\" AQIs are retained. EPA is also making changes to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations. The EPA revised the PSD permitting program rules in relation to the revised PM NAAQS to prevent delays in permits and establish a grandfather provision for permit applications meeting certain criteria. The final PM 2.5 daily standard established in 2006 was less stringent than alternative levels recommended by EPA staff. The EPA retained the annual PM 2.5 standard at levels less stringent than recommended by the CASAC. The Clean Air Act includes specific requirements for setting NAAQS, ensuring scientific integrity and procedural processes. Table 1 compares the 2013 revised PM 2.5 standard with previous standards and alternative levels recommended before 2006 revisions. The Clean Air Act specifies criteria for setting NAAQS to protect public health. The Administrator uses a \"criteria document\" summarizing scientific information, with input from the independent advisory committee CASAC. EPA also prepares a \"staff paper\" for policy options. The CASAC review process was revised in May 2009, and a Regulatory Impact Analysis is required by Executive Order 12866. Order 12866 mandates a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the NAAQS decision-making process. The EPA began the PM NAAQS review in June 2007, leading to the publication of the final Policy Assessment in April 2011. This assessment included staff conclusions and recommendations based on scientific evidence and quantitative analyses. The CASAC reviewed EPA's drafts and final documents supporting the science and policy behind the June 2012 PM NAAQS proposal. They provided their views on the validity and completeness of the assessments, recommending improvements. CASAC's final review of the \"PM Policy Assessment\" was completed in June 2010. Consultations and reviews of supporting documents for the proposal were summarized in Table B-2 in Appendix B. The 2011 EPA policy assessment and CASAC panel recommended modifying the PM 2.5 primary standard and revising the secondary standard for reducing visibility impairment associated with PM. The policy assessment included alternatives for the Administrator to consider for modifying the current PM NAAQS. The June 2012 proposal and final decision to revise the PM NAAQS were based on these recommendations, taking into account public comments. The EPA staff paper also suggested modifications to strengthen aspects of the PM 10 standard, but emphasized uncertainties and lack of data for quantitative risk assessment. The EPA staff paper highlighted uncertainties and lack of data for quantitative risk assessment to support modifications to the PM 10 standard. The agency needs to ensure decisions are based on the latest science and rigorous unbiased studies. EPA acknowledged the need for continuous review due to new scientific studies on the health effects of PM. The EPA plans to conduct a provisional review of new scientific studies on the health effects of PM published since 2009, including those submitted during the public comment period on the proposed rule. This assessment will consider the new studies in conjunction with the literature evaluated in the Integrated Science Assessment, with key conclusions summarized in the rulemaking docket. The EPA conducted a public comment period and hearings for the proposal to revise the PM NAAQS. Final determinations were made based on public input and analysis. The promulgation of NAAQS initiates a process to identify nonattainment areas. EPA revised its Regulatory Impact Analysis in response to comments received. States must submit infrastructure plans within three years of NAAQS issuance to demonstrate basic air quality management components. State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outline how states will achieve and maintain standards, often including new regulations and permitting requirements. SIPs that establish transportation-related emissions allowances trigger conformity determinations. Transportation conformity is required by the Clean Air Act to ensure federal funding for highway and transit projects align with air quality goals. Nonattainment areas are subject to new source review requirements to prevent violations of air quality standards. The NSR provisions under the Clean Air Act outline permitting requirements for new major pollution sources and modifications to existing sources, depending on whether they are subject to PSD or nonattainment provisions. The January 2013 final PM NAAQS includes revisions to the PSD permitting program to avoid delays in permits and establish a grandfather provision for permit applications. EPA controls NAAQS pollutants through national regulatory programs in addition to state implementation plans. The EPA controls NAAQS pollutants through national regulatory programs, including regulations for products and activities that emit pollutants and emission standards for new stationary sources. Recent CAA rules aim to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, and stationary diesel engines to help states meet revised PM NAAQS. The process of designating nonattainment areas involves a cooperative federal-state-tribal process where states and tribes provide initial recommendations to EPA for consideration. The statute requires governors to submit a list of areas in their state to the EPA, designating them as nonattainment if they do not meet air quality standards. The EPA Administrator has discretion to modify these designations after state and tribal recommendations, with final decisions resting with the EPA. Monitoring air quality is crucial in identifying areas not meeting NAAQS. Monitoring air quality to determine NAAQS compliance is essential for area designation. EPA developed methods for monitoring fine particles when PM 2.5 NAAQS were finalized in 1997. The monitoring network for PM 2.5 was phased in from 1999 to 2000 and has been modified over time. EPA amended national air quality monitoring requirements in 2006 to improve monitoring technology. The EPA considers various factors like population density, urbanization, traffic patterns, and geography when designating nonattainment areas for air quality standards. States can submit additional relevant information for consideration. Nonattainment areas include counties with pollutant concentrations exceeding standards and those contributing to exceedances in neighboring counties. Metropolitan areas are often designated nonattainment even if only one county is affected. The EPA designates nonattainment areas based on factors like population density, urbanization, and traffic patterns. Metropolitan areas are often designated nonattainment even if only one county has pollutant concentrations exceeding standards. The January 2013 revision to the PM 2.5 annual standard increased the number of nonattainment areas, affecting both previously designated counties and new ones. The EPA designates nonattainment areas based on factors like population density, urbanization, and traffic patterns. The January 2013 revision to the PM 2.5 annual standard increased the number of nonattainment areas, affecting both previously designated counties and new ones. States must submit area designation recommendations within one year of a NAAQS standard being promulgated, with EPA required to make final designations within one year of receiving recommendations. EPA responded to states with proposed modifications to their recommendations for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS for the annual standard in August 2014. In August 2014, EPA finalized area designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 standard, classifying 20 counties in four states as nonattainment. The remaining 3,000 counties were classified as unclassified for the standard. In contrast, nonattainment designations for the 2006 and 1997 PM 2.5 standards included 242 counties in 28 states. The EPA's amended final nonattainment area designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS included 242 counties in 28 states and the District of Columbia. The April 2015 modified designations superseded previous classifications, with 38 counties in six states classified as nonattainment for the revised 2013 primary annual PM 2.5 standard. EPA also deferred the designation period for 11 other areas. EPA reclassified nonattainment areas as \"Moderate\" under CAA. Areas failing to meet PM 2.5 NAAQS may be reclassified as \"Serious\". Court decision required EPA to implement PM 2.5 NAAQS under Subpart 4. EPA's amended final designations for nonattainment areas included 242 counties in 28 states. Based on EPA's amended final designations, 20 counties are designated nonattainment for PM 2.5, with some overlapping with previous nonattainment designations. The 2006 revisions to the PM NAAQS primarily affected urban areas. The EPA final designations published in 2009 for the 2006 PM NAAQS included 31 areas in 18 states, comprising 120 counties for nonattainment of the revised 24-hour PM 2.5 standard. Most of these areas had previously been designated nonattainment for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Tightening the 24-hour standard led to more areas being designated nonattainment based on exceedances of both the 24-hour and annual standards. States designated as attainment/unclassifiable do not need to implement additional emission control measures for PM 2.5. EPA sets nationwide standards for criteria pollutants, with states responsible for limiting emissions and regulating entities. Areas designated as attainment/unclassifiable must prevent air quality from deteriorating, while nonattainment areas must outline detailed control requirements in State Implementation Plans to meet the 2013 PM 2.5 standard. The EPA will classify initial nonattainment areas for the 2013 PM 2.5 annual standard as Moderate under Subpart 4 of the CAA. States have 18 months to submit SIPs under Subpart 4, compared to three years under Subpart 1. The EPA anticipates states will need to submit their plans by fall of 2016. EPA may reclassify nonattainment areas as \"Serious\" under Subpart 4. Under Subpart 4, EPA may reclassify nonattainment areas that cannot meet PM 2.5 NAAQS by the deadline. Serious areas must attain within 10 years, while Moderate areas have a 6-year deadline. Subpart 1 requires attainment within 5 years. Extensions are possible under both subparts. EPA expects states to submit plans by fall 2016. EPA anticipates that national regulations and strategies, such as CSAPR, MATS, and various emission standards, will help states meet the proposed PM 2.5 standards. Stakeholders and Members of Congress are skeptical about EPA's expectations regarding regulations like the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which have faced delays and reconsideration. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a petition for rehearing of the CSAPR decision, which was denied by the D.C. Circuit. EPA has not yet decided on its response. Other rules, such as the MACT standards for boilers and cement kilns, have been remanded or reconsidered, with delays in implementation and compliance deadlines extended. The revising of PM NAAQS can have far-reaching and indirect impacts, as it does not mandate specific pollution control measures. The Clean Air Act does not require direct pollution control measures but initiates a process that could lead to significant investments by emitting sources. The EPA projects potential health benefits from the revisions to the PM NAAQS, considering costs and feasibility in implementation. The CAA mandates NAAQS based on public health and welfare protection, with the EPA Administrator directed to ensure public health with a margin of safety. The EPA released regulatory impact analyses assessing costs and benefits of setting the standard for PM NAAQS, but decisions are not based on these analyses. The EPA revised its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the final rule on PM 2.5 standards in response to comments received. The estimated economic costs, monetized benefits, and net benefits associated with achieving the revised standards were presented in Table 2 of the RIA. The EPA estimated that the costs associated with the January 2013 final revised PM 2.5 annual standard would range from $4.0 billion to $9.1 billion per year in 2020, compared to annual costs ranging from $53.0 million to $350.0 million. The benefits calculations are based on health and welfare impacts attributable to reductions in ambient concentration of PM 2.5, with reductions in annual premature deaths representing a substantial proportion of total monetized benefits. EPA noted that a full accounting of benefits would include additional environmental and societal benefits not quantified in the analysis. EPA estimated total costs for meeting alternative PM standards, including engineering costs for control technologies. State and local governments will choose control programs best suited for their areas. EPA acknowledges limitations and uncertainties in benefits assumptions. Some stakeholders are concerned about potential underestimated costs. Some stakeholders and critics are concerned that EPA has underestimated the costs associated with meeting alternative PM standards. They question the validity of EPA's reliance on other national regulations to reduce burdens, potentially leading to underestimation of affected areas and necessary costs for compliance. Stakeholders have provided evidence and arguments for their preferred recommendations prior to EPA's proposed rule revision in June 2012. Business and industry opposed more stringent standards due to economic concerns, while public health and environmental advocacy groups supported stricter standards based on scientific evidence. Several states petitioned EPA for timely completion of the PM NAAQS review, with some expressing budget concerns. Proponents of stricter standards emphasize the need for PM 2.5 standards to be as stringent as recommended levels. The proposal for more stringent PM NAAQS standards is supported by scientific evidence and advocates for public health and environmental protection. Critics argue that the standards are not justified, citing economic concerns and the need to consider more recent studies. The proposed revisions to the PM NAAQS standards have faced criticism for potentially overstating benefits and underestimating costs, which could hinder compliance efforts. Data shows a decline in PM concentrations from 2001 to 2010, suggesting that revisions may be unnecessary. A hearing on the impacts of tightening the PM 2.5 NAAQS was held in 2012, focusing on regulatory costs and burdens. The debate centered on regulatory costs and burdens of implementing revised PM NAAQS standards, with some urging EPA to retain the current PM 2.5 standard. In November 2012, there were calls to delay the final rule, while others supported timely completion. Some Members recommended EPA reconsider cost and benefit calculations for the proposed rule. The January 15, 2013 final rule did not modify standards for PM 10 particles. During the 112th Congress, some Members expressed concerns to the EPA Administrator about potential impacts of stricter PM NAAQS standards on industry and agriculture, particularly regarding coarse particulates (PM 10). The House-passed Farm Dust Regulation was also a topic of discussion. During the 112th Congress, the House-passed Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act of 2011 aimed to prohibit EPA from regulating certain types of particulate matter for one year, including \"nuisance dust\" generated from natural sources and rural activities. The FY2012 House-reported EPA appropriations language aimed to restrict the modification of national air quality standards for coarse particulate matter. This provision was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The evolution and development of the PM (and ozone) NAAQS have been a significant concern for Congress, leading to extensive oversight and hearings. Legislation was enacted to specify deadlines for implementation, funding for monitoring and research, and coordination with other air quality regulations. The final rule modifying the PM NAAQS in 2013 generated mixed reactions from some Members due to potential impacts on public health and the economy. EPA's changes to the PM NAAQS in the final rule published on January 15, 2013, have sparked mixed reactions among stakeholders and in Congress. The level of scrutiny and oversight of the PM NAAQS is expected to increase in the coming months due to potential health and economic consequences. EPA's review and analysis of scientific evidence suggest that revising the PM NAAQS could lead to fewer adverse health effects. Revising the PM NAAQS could reduce adverse health effects for the general population, especially children, asthmatics, and the elderly, with improved welfare effects. Concerns remain about potential costs, as some fear more areas may be classified as nonattainment, leading to increased pollution controls and costs for industries like transportation and utilities. The EPA's establishment of the 1997 PM NAAQS faced challenges and litigation, with critics accusing the agency of over-regulation and environmental groups claiming it didn't go far enough. Despite being upheld by the Supreme Court, stakeholders on both sides continued to advocate for their positions. Stakeholders on both sides advocated for more or less stringent PM standards. The U.S. Court of Appeals partially granted challenges to EPA's 2006 PM NAAQS revisions, remanding them for further consideration. Implementation is ongoing despite potential delays from stakeholder challenges to final standards in 2013. EPA received over 230,000 comments on the June 2012 proposal. The final standards for PM NAAQS were published on January 15, 2013, potentially causing delays in designating nonattainment areas and states' SIP development. EPA agreed to issue revised PM NAAQS by December 14, 2012, as part of a court decision and Consent Agreement. Milestones post-January 2013 are driven by CAA requirements and determined by EPA and states. The EPA and states determine relevant milestones for PM standards through the implementation planning process. Nonattainment designations for PM 2.5 were predicted by EPA in December 2012. Details on final designations for the 2013 PM NAAQS revisions can be found in a CRS report. EPA predicted nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 standards in California and identified 66 counties exceeding the revised limit based on 2009-2011 data. 47 counties were previously designated as nonattainment areas. The map in Figure C-1 illustrates potential nonattainment areas for the revised PM 2.5 annual standards. The map depicts potential nonattainment areas for PM 2.5 standards in California based on 2009-2011 data. EPA predicted a possible decrease in nonattainment areas with future monitoring data from 2011-2013."
