    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Violent Crime Control Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that there is a lack of reliable information on ammunition availability, importers and manufacturers are not required to report to the Federal Government, a loophole allows unlimited gun orders, bullet-related deaths are increasing, certain calibers are used disproportionately in crime, and young males, especially young black males, are most affected by injury and death from bullets. Epidemiology can be used to study bullet-related deaths. The lack of reliable information on ammunition availability and the loophole allowing unlimited gun orders have contributed to the increase in bullet-related deaths and injuries. A tax on bullet sales is proposed to help control this issue, as there is no central agency responsible for trauma and limited funding available for studying bullet-related deaths. Increased research in bullet-related violence is necessary to understand the causes, develop control options, and overcome barriers to effective measures. Current laws and programs are inadequate to protect citizens from bullet-related trauma. The purpose of increased research in bullet-related violence is to understand causes, develop control options, and overcome barriers to effective measures. The Act aims to increase taxes on certain bullets to reduce bullet-related deaths and injuries. It also seeks to gather data on bullet-related incidents, assess trends over time, and educate the public on the issue.
