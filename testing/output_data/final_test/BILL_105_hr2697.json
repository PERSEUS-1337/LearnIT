    "content": "The Act titled \"Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Research Act of 1997\" is abbreviated as such. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that osteoporosis is a condition characterized by excessive bone loss, affecting 28 million Americans, mostly women. It also mentions other related bone diseases and the significant number of fractures caused by osteoporosis annually. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by excessive bone loss, affecting 28 million Americans, mostly women. 1 in 2 women and 1 in 8 men over 50 will develop fractures associated with osteoporosis. The direct medical costs are estimated at $13.8 billion annually in the US, with costs expected to rise due to the aging population. Technology exists for early diagnosis, prevention, and management of osteoporosis. Funding for research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases is limited at key research institutes. Further research is needed to improve medical knowledge on cellular mechanisms related to bone resorption and formation, risk factors for osteoporosis, and the effects of different agents on bone remodeling. The curr_chunk discusses risk factors for osteoporosis, bone mass measurement technology, calcium and vitamin D intake requirements for building denser skeletons. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for further educational efforts to increase public and professional knowledge of osteoporosis causes, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. SEC. 3. OSTEOPOROSIS RESEARCH. Subpart 4 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include research on osteoporosis and related diseases. The Director of the Institute and other specified Directors are required to expand research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases through mechanisms like investigator-initiated research, funding for new investigators, and mentorship research grants. Specialized Centers of Research may also be established. The Director of the Institute may provide grants for specialized centers to conduct research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases, with each center conducting basic and clinical research and developing training protocols. The Director of the Institute may provide grants for specialized centers to conduct research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases, with a focus on developing training protocols for healthcare professionals. These protocols include training programs, continuing education programs, and information dissemination to the public. Funds may be used to provide stipends for professionals enrolled in training programs, and the centers must meet specific requirements, either using the facilities of a single institution or forming a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director of the Institute may provide grants for specialized centers to conduct research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases. Support for a center may last up to 5 years, with possible extensions after a review by a scientific peer group. Related bone diseases include Paget's disease and osteogenesis imperfecta. The curr_chunk discusses various bone diseases including osteogenesis imperfecta, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, renal bone disease, osteoporosis, and other general diseases of bone and mineral metabolism. The curr_chunk discusses authorizations of appropriations for research on bone diseases through different institutes including the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institute of Dental Research, and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development are authorized appropriations for research purposes. Authorized appropriations for research purposes through the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development include $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001, with additional funding as needed. Specialized centers of research are allocated $3,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001, with additional funding as necessary. These authorizations are separate from appropriations for biomedical research on osteoporosis and related bone diseases."
