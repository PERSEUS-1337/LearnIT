    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Interstate Class Action Jurisdiction Act of 1999\" and any reference to amendments or repeals shall be considered in relation to title 28, United States Code. The Congress recognizes the need to amend current Federal diversity jurisdiction statutes to include interstate class actions, which are substantial controversies that fall outside the scope of existing laws. This amendment is necessary as these statutes were enacted before the rise of modern class actions, leading to unintended technicalities. Congress is constitutionally empowered to amend Federal diversity jurisdiction statutes to allow more interstate class actions to be brought in or removed to Federal court for fair and efficient adjudication. SEC. 3. JURISDICTION OF DISTRICT COURTS. Expansion of Federal Jurisdiction: District courts will have original jurisdiction over class actions involving plaintiffs from different states or countries than the defendants. This includes cases where a plaintiff is a foreign state and a defendant is a citizen of a state. The term \"foreign state\" is defined in section 1603(a). The district courts shall not have jurisdiction over certain civil actions, such as intrastate, limited scope, or State action cases. An intrastate case involves claims primarily governed by state laws and where the majority of plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of the state where the action was filed. A limited scope case involves all matters in controversy. The district courts do not have jurisdiction over certain civil actions, including intrastate, limited scope, or State action cases. A State action case involves class actions where the primary defendants are States, State officials, or other governmental entities. This jurisdiction limitation does not apply to claims concerning covered securities or class actions solely involving specific claims. The jurisdiction of district courts is limited in certain civil actions, including intrastate, limited scope, or State action cases. State action cases involve class actions with primary defendants being States, State officials, or other governmental entities. This limitation does not apply to claims related to internal affairs or governance of corporations, securities, or fiduciary duties. In class action cases, a member of the proposed class must be a citizen of a different state than the defendant corporation to establish jurisdiction. SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF CLASS ACTIONS. Section 1453 of Chapter 89 allows for the removal of class actions to a district court of the United States, regardless of the defendants' citizenship. Defendants or plaintiff class members not named in the action can initiate removal without the consent of all parties. This applies to class actions before or after class certification, except for plaintiff class members seeking removal before certification. Section 1453 of Chapter 89 allows for the removal of class actions to a district court of the United States. A plaintiff class member seeking removal must wait for class certification before initiating the process. The procedure for removal follows the provisions of section 1446(a) for defendants. Exceptions apply to claims concerning covered securities. The section excludes class actions related to internal governance of business entities or claims concerning covered securities as defined in specific sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 1446(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 is amended to include provisions for removal limitations, with the addition of due diligence requirements and technical amendments to chapter 89. The text discusses the removal of class actions and the application of substantive state law. It also outlines the procedure after removal, stating that if a court determines that no aspect of an action subject to its jurisdiction can be maintained as a class action, the action will be dismissed. The dismissed action can be amended and filed in a State court, but may be removed again if it falls under the original jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States. States have original jurisdiction. If a class action is dismissed and refiled by the same plaintiffs in the same State court venue, the limitations periods on reasserted claims are tolled. The limitations periods on claims from a dismissed class action that are later asserted individually are also tolled. The amendments made by this Act apply to actions commenced on or after the enactment date. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the impact of these amendments on Federal courts' workload within a year of the Act's enactment."
