    "content": "Brokers, dealers, and investment advisers are held to different standards of conduct. Broker-dealers follow a suitability standard, while investment advisers adhere to a fiduciary duty standard. The Dodd-Frank Act empowers the SEC to establish rules for these professionals. FINRA, a self-regulatory organization, oversees securities firms in the U.S. and issues rules that the SEC may supervise. FINRA enforces a \"suitability\" standard for brokers and dealers in the United States, requiring reasonable grounds for recommendations based on customer information. An individual investor pursuing action against a broker-dealer for recommending an unsuitable investment must allege violations of the general anti-fraud provision of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. To prove a violation, the investor must show reliance on a misstatement or omission of a material fact that caused their injury. Compliance with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act may also be required. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) specifies the plaintiff's burden of proof regarding the defendant's state of mind in an illegal act. It requires stating facts with particularity to show a strong inference of the defendant's state of mind. While the fiduciary duty standard typically doesn't apply to broker-dealers, there are exceptions, such as when handling discretionary accounts for customers. Investment advisers are held to a fiduciary duty standard, unlike broker-dealers who typically follow a suitability standard. They must register with the SEC and are required to act in the best interest of their clients when managing their accounts. This duty has been interpreted by court cases, even though the Investment Advisers Act does not explicitly use the term \"fiduciary.\" In 1963, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc. that investment advisers have a fiduciary duty to their clients. The case involved an adviser who bought securities for his own account before recommending them to clients, then sold them at a profit. The Court determined that advisers must disclose such practices to clients, based on the legislative history of the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was part of a series of Acts aimed at preventing abuses in the securities industry that led to the stock market crash of 1929. The Act emphasized full disclosure to promote business ethics in the industry. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 reflects Congress's recognition of the fiduciary nature of the investment advisory relationship and aims to eliminate conflicts of interest. It is essential for the highest ethical standards to prevail in the securities industry. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 emphasizes the fiduciary duty of investment advisers to act in utmost good faith, disclose all material facts, and avoid misleading clients. This duty applies to investment advisers who provide advice on securities investments, distinguishing them from broker-dealers who act on client orders in non-discretionary accounts. The traditional distinction between broker-dealers and investment advisers has become blurred, leading to calls for a unified standard of conduct. Critics highlight the rise of discretionary accounts and new account types offered by broker-dealers. Both the House and Senate versions of financial regulatory reform addressed changes to standards of conduct, with differing approaches. The House and Senate took different approaches to harmonize fiduciary standards for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was approved by conferees and signed into law in July 2010. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law in July 2010, includes Section 913 which defines standards of conduct for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. It sets out the definition of \"retail customer\" and requires the SEC to evaluate current legal standards for these professionals. The SEC is required to evaluate the effectiveness of current legal standards for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers in providing personalized investment advice to retail customers. This includes assessing any gaps, shortcomings, or overlaps in the standards of care and determining if retail customers understand the different standards applicable to these professionals.

This includes assessing potential impacts on profitability and regulatory requirements. The SEC must submit a report to Congress within six months of Dodd-Frank's enactment, detailing findings and recommendations from the study. Public comments will be sought, and rulemaking may begin based on the study's results. The SEC seeks public comments for preparing a report on legal standards for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers providing personalized investment advice to retail customers. Rulemaking may address the standard of conduct for brokers and dealers to align with that of investment advisers. Brokers or dealers may not have a continuing duty or loyalty to customers after providing personalized investment advice. The SEC may require brokers and dealers to provide clear disclosures to retail customers, obtain customer consent, and disclose any conflicts of interest. Rules may be issued to prohibit certain sales practices and compensation schemes. The standard of conduct for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers should prioritize the best interests of the customer. The SEC must ensure that brokers, dealers, and investment advisers disclose any conflicts of interest and obtain customer consent. Rules may be issued to prohibit certain sales practices and compensation schemes deemed contrary to the public interest and investor protection. The standard of conduct should prioritize the best interests of the customer. The SEC is working on harmonizing enforcement for violations by brokers, dealers, and investment advisers providing personalized investment advice to retail customers. A uniform fiduciary standard is recommended for investment advisers and broker-dealers. The SEC has not taken a formal stance on the study's findings, making it uncertain when new rules on standards of conduct will be implemented. The SEC is considering harmonizing enforcement for violations by brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. Mary Schapiro highlighted the differences in regulatory regimes and standards of conduct for various financial service providers, emphasizing the need for consistent standards regardless of the provider. All financial service providers offering personalized investment advice about securities should have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their customers. This duty includes avoiding conflicts of interest and providing full disclosure and obtaining consent when conflicts cannot be avoided. The fiduciary must prioritize the interests of clients over their own. In March 2015, SEC Chair Mary Jo White expressed support for implementing a uniform fiduciary duty for broker-dealers and investment advisers to act in the best interest of investors. This rule is a high priority for the SEC, and will be closely examined by Congress and the financial industry."
