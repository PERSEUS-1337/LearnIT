    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tobacco to 21 Act\". Congress finds that tobacco use has caused 20,800,000 premature deaths in the US since 1964, with various tobacco products linked to cancer. Despite progress, tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death, costing $170 billion in medical expenses and $156 billion in lost productivity annually, with over 42 million Americans still using tobacco. More than 42 million Americans still smoke, with the tobacco industry challenging control measures, introducing new products, and targeting youth. Around 5.6 million youth could die prematurely from tobacco-related illnesses. Adolescent tobacco use is especially dangerous due to the risk of nicotine addiction and related diseases. Adolescents are more susceptible to nicotine addiction compared to adults. Nicotine exposure during adolescence can lead to long-term adverse effects on brain development and increase the risk of smoking-related cancers. Starting smoking at a young age raises the likelihood of tobacco-related diseases and death. Data shows that most adult smokers begin before age 21, with ages 18 to 21 being a critical period for transitioning to regular smoking. Young adults aged 18 to 24 are more than twice as likely to use smokeless products compared to older adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine recommend comprehensive tobacco control programs to reduce youth initiation and prevalence of tobacco use. Strategies include regulating the retail environment, enforcing laws, and educating retailers to restrict tobacco products for youth. The Institute of Medicine's report suggests raising the minimum legal age of sale nationwide to reduce tobacco initiation, especially among young adults aged 18 to 24. Raising the minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide to 21 will reduce tobacco initiation, improve health, and save lives. It is predicted to lead to a 12% decrease in smoking prevalence, 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer, and immediate reductions in preterm birth, low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome. PROHIBITION AND ENFORCEMENT: This section outlines the rules and measures for enforcing the new minimum legal age of sale of tobacco products nationwide. Enforcement of the prohibition on selling tobacco products to individuals under 21 is authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who may conduct compliance checks, inspections, and enforcement actions to ensure nationwide compliance. Retailers are required to check identification or use other methods to verify compliance. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to enforce the prohibition on selling tobacco products to individuals under 21, including issuing guidance for retailer compliance. Violations may result in penalties under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The term \"tobacco product\" is defined in the Act. SEC. 4. NON-PREEMPTION. States and local governments can enforce laws on tobacco sales to individuals under a minimum age, as long as they are as strict as Federal law."
