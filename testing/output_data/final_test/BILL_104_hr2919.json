    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Brownfields Remediation and Economic Development Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that between 130,000 and 425,000 abandoned industrial sites need cleanup action to become economically viable again, with costs potentially reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Encouraging private investment in brownfields remediation can create jobs and promote economic development. The purpose of this Act is to establish a program for the Federal Government to remediate brownfields in cooperation with State and local entities to return them to productive use while conserving open space. The purpose of this Act is to establish a program for the Federal Government to remediate brownfields in cooperation with State and local entities to return them to productive use while conserving open space. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will certify State brownfield programs that meet the criteria outlined in section 4. Certification is only granted to programs that have jurisdiction over brownfield sites contaminated before the Act's enactment. The Administrator will review certified programs every 2 years to ensure compliance and offer technical assistance. A State brownfields program may be certified under this Act if it covers contaminated sites not listed on the National Priorities List, allows public participation before granting liability release, and allows for reopening of cleanup proposals under certain circumstances. The State brownfields program includes cleanup standards for sites that protect public health and the environment, and involves coordination among State agencies for environmental protection and economic development. The State brownfields program includes cleanup standards for sites to protect public health and the environment. Upon completion of remediation under a certified State program, the owner or operator of a brownfield site may be released from liability under certain provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Upon completion of remediation under a certified State program, lenders, developers, and prospective purchasers of brownfields sites may be released from liability under certain provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Prospective purchasers of a brownfields site and local governments not involved in site management may benefit from liability release after remediation under a certified State program. Federal waiver may be granted by the Administrator to facilitate site cleanup if the State brownfield cleanup program includes a waiver from State permitting requirements. Additionally, a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces special rules for hazardous waste remediation reserves under the Brownfields IRA. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces special rules for Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserves. Taxpayers can deduct payments made to the Reserve, with limitations on the amount that can be paid each year. Amounts distributed from the Reserve are included in the taxpayer's gross income. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows deductions for qualified hazardous waste costs when economic performance occurs. A Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve is a tax-exempt reserve established by the taxpayer for this purpose. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve, established for qualified hazardous waste costs, is subject to taxes under section 511. Contributions to the Reserve must be deductible payments, and it can only be used for qualified hazardous waste costs. The Reserve is treated as a trust under section 501(c)(21) to prevent self-dealing. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve, subject to taxes under section 511, is treated as a trust under section 501(c)(21). If the Reserve violates provisions, the Secretary may disqualify it, treating it as having distributed all funds. If funds are not spent within 10 years, they are deemed distributed. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve, subject to taxes under section 511, is treated as a trust under section 501(c)(21). A remediation plan must be prepared for contaminated sites. If funds are not used for qualified hazardous waste costs, a penalty of 10 percent applies. The term 'qualified hazardous waste costs' refers to expenses related to assessing environmental contamination and remediation of a site owned by the taxpayer. Controlled groups are treated as one entity for tax purposes, with the allocated amount determined by the Secretary. The taxpayer is deemed to have made a payment to the Reserve on the last day of a taxable year if the payment is made within 2\\1/2\\ months after the close of the taxable year. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C of part II of subchapter E of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments for hazardous waste remediation reserves under Sec. 468C will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of this Act."
