    "content": "Senator Grassley and Representative Goodlatte introduced parallel sentencing reform bills with bipartisan support to amend mandatory minimum sentence provisions in federal drug and firearms laws. The differences between S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 are noted in the prefatory remarks for each bill. These proposals build on earlier ones introduced by other members of Congress. The Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act establish mandatory minimum sentences for drug violations. Trafficking large amounts of addictive substances can result in imprisonment for 10 years to life. Smaller amounts lead to sentences of 5 years to life, with increased penalties for subsequent convictions. The proposed amendments aim to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. S. 502 / H.R. 920 would decrease imprisonment for high volume offenses to 5 years from 10 years, and for medium volume offenses to 2 years from 5 years. H.R. 2944 would eliminate mandatory minimums for certain offenses, except for cases involving organized drug enterprises. The defendant's role as an organizer of a drug enterprise could result in a longer sentence if they had a prior conviction for a serious offense. H.R. 2944 allows for reduced sentencing based on certain amendments. S. 2123 / H.R. 3713 propose a safety valve to lower mandatory minimums for high volume drug offenses. S. 2123 / H.R. 3713 would modify drug recidivist mandatory minimums by expanding and contracting them based on the severity of the offenses. Only drug convictions with a maximum penalty of 10 years or more triggering increased recidivist mandatory minimums, while serious violent crime convictions could also lead to enhanced sentencing. The bills aim to give courts the discretion to lower mandatory minimums for high volume drug offenses. The bills S. 2123 / H.R. 3713 would allow courts to resentence defendants with reduced recidivist mandatory minimums, considering factors like risks to the community and defendant's behavior post-sentencing. S. 2123 specifies that resentencing must adhere to victims' rights provisions and involve an inquiry into initial sentencing circumstances. H.R. 3713 proposes a 5-year imprisonment sentence for drug trafficking involving heroin or fentanyl. H.R. 2944 prevents enhanced punishment under the Controlled Substances Act for certain convictions, with the government needing to prove prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. The safety valve provision of 18 U.S.C. 3553(f) allows qualified defendants in drug trafficking cases to be sentenced below the mandatory minimum if certain criteria are met, including no violence used, no managerial role in group offenses, no death or serious injury caused, full disclosure of involvement, and a clean criminal record with no more than 1 criminal history point. The Sentencing Commission's report suggests expanding safety valve eligibility for defendants with 2 or 3 criminal history points due to the disproportionate impact of criminal records on drug offenders according to the Guidelines. The bill S. 502 / H.R. 920 would raise the qualification threshold to 3 criminal history points for drug offenders. H.R. 2944 would expand the safety valve to include mandatory minimums related to firearm use in drug trafficking cases and raise the criminal history point threshold to 3 for certain offenders. H.R. 2944 and S. 2123/H.R. 3713 propose changes to the safety valve for criminal offenders. The bills aim to discount convictions influenced by coercion or distress and allow for eligibility with 3 or fewer criminal history points for certain offenses. Additionally, the proposals would permit the court to waive disqualifications based on criminal history if it overstated the seriousness of the defendant's record. The so-called three strikes provision imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on offenders with three prior convictions for drug offenses or violent felonies. The ACCA limits qualifying state and federal drug offenses to those punishable by more than 10 years in prison. S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 aim to reduce the mandatory minimum penalty from 15 years to 10 years. H.R. 3713 proposes reducing the mandatory minimum penalty from 15 years to 10 years and allowing federal courts to retroactively reduce sentences for defendants without prior serious violent felony convictions. In contrast, H.R. 2944 does not reduce mandatory minimum penalties but changes the definition of a \"serious drug offense\" to one punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years. The proposed legislation, H.R. 3713, aims to reduce the mandatory minimum penalty from 15 years to 10 years for certain offenses. It also changes the definition of \"violent felony\" to require a 13-month sentence. Additionally, it requires U.S. Attorneys to specify previous convictions before sentencing under Section 924(c), which imposes minimum sentences for federal crimes involving firearms. The mandatory minimum penalties for federal crimes involving firearms vary depending on the circumstances, ranging from 5 years to life imprisonment. The proposed legislation aims to clarify that a prior conviction must be final before it can enhance the mandatory minimum sentence for repeat offenders under \u00a7924(c). It also seeks to reduce the mandatory minimum sentence from 25 years to 15 years, while expanding the types of firearms that trigger the repeat offender provision. The proposed legislation aims to reduce the mandatory minimum sentence for repeat offenders from 25 years to 15 years and expand the types of firearms that trigger the repeat offender provision. The proposals would also allow courts to apply changes retroactively, with considerations for post-conviction conduct and community safety. H.R. 3713 and S. 2123 differ in their approach to retroactive application for defendants with prior violent felony convictions. The proposed legislation aims to reduce the mandatory minimum sentence for repeat offenders from 25 years to 15 years and expand the types of firearms that trigger the repeat offender provision. Section 3771 assures victims of rights during court proceedings, and H.R. 2944 requires a final conviction for enhancing mandatory minimums without reducing them. S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 have amendments related to firearms possession during crimes. The bills S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 propose increasing the maximum sentence for certain firearms offenses from 10 years to 15 years, without imposing strict mandatory minimums. This includes offenses such as false statements in firearm purchases, sale to convicted felons, possession by disqualified individuals, and transportation of stolen firearms. In contrast, H.R. 2944 does not include similar amendments. The Controlled Substances Act initially did not differentiate between powder cocaine and crack cocaine. The 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act established a 100-1 sentencing ratio between the two, which was later changed to a 500-28 ratio by the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act. The Sentencing Commission adjusted the Sentencing Guidelines accordingly, with retroactive application at the court's discretion. The Fair Sentencing Act reductions apply to both future and past cocaine offenses. The Fair Sentencing Act allows for retroactive application of reduced sentencing guidelines for past cocaine offenses. Proposed bills like S. 2123 and H.R. 3713 aim to make the Act applicable to sentences imposed before its enactment, allowing for potential sentence reductions. S. 2123 would establish new mandatory minimum sentencing provisions for interstate domestic violence offenses, including a 10-year minimum sentence for cases resulting in death. It would also increase maximum penalties for certain offenses. The Senate proposal, S. 2123, would create new mandatory minimum sentences for certain violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including providing defense articles to embargoed countries and supplying goods for weapons of mass destruction. Violations of IEEPA can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years, but S. 2123 would impose a separate mandatory minimum sentence of at least five years for these specific violations. H.R. 2944 does not introduce new mandatory minimum sentences for crimes, unlike S. 2123 which proposes creating them for violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Additionally, S. 2123 calls for an inventory of federal crimes to be prepared by the Attorney General, detailing penalties, prosecutions, convictions, and more for each offense. H.R. 2944 requires the Attorney General to create a publicly available online index of regulatory and statutory offenses, as well as a list of federal law violations with criminal penalties. Federal agencies need approval from the Attorney General to add criminal penalties to regulations. Procedures will be developed for coordination between the Department of Justice and federal agencies, as well as between federal and state law enforcement, to determine appropriate penalties for unlawful conduct."
