    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides up to 26 weeks of income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs. Benefits can be extended for up to 13 or 20 weeks through the Extended Benefit (EB) program in certain economic situations. Currently, no state is in an active EB period. The expired Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC08) program provided additional benefits based on state economic conditions from July 2008 to December 2013. The Unemployment Compensation program offers up to 26 weeks of benefits, with extensions available in certain circumstances. Former federal workers and ex-servicemembers may also be eligible for benefits through specific programs. Each state determines the specifics of UC benefits, resulting in 53 different programs. Eligibility is based on wages and employment during a 12-month base period prior to unemployment. The Unemployment Compensation program provides benefits for up to 26 weeks, with eligibility based on wages and employment in a 12-month base period before unemployment. States have varying methods to determine eligibility, with benefits replacing about half of a claimant's average weekly wage. Recipients must have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, be able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. The program is funded by federal taxes under FUTA and state payroll taxes. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA) fund unemployment benefits. FUTA tax is 0.6% on the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings, while SUTA taxes are based on state requirements. States have flexibility in determining their SUTA structure, with the maximum state tax rate set at 5.4%. Employer's state tax rate is based on the amount of unemployment compensation paid to former employees. The EB program, established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, extends unemployment benefits at the state level based on economic conditions. It is triggered when a state's insured unemployment rate reaches certain levels, providing up to 13 weeks of benefits if specific criteria are met. As of now, the EB program is not active in any state. The Extended Benefits (EB) program provides additional weeks of unemployment benefits based on state economic conditions. States can choose optional thresholds for eligibility, including additional weeks of benefits based on the state's Insured Unemployment Rate (IUR) and Total Unemployment Rate (TUR) compared to previous years. EB benefits are not phased out gradually when a state triggers off the program, all payments cease immediately. The Extended Benefits (EB) program provides additional weeks of unemployment benefits based on state economic conditions. When a state triggers \"off\" of an EB period, all EB benefit payments cease immediately. The EB benefit amount equals the eligible individual's weekly regular UC benefits. FUTA finances half of the EB payments and 100% of EB administrative costs, while states fund the other half through their SUTA. The sequester order required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 affected some unemployment insurance expenditures, with regular UC, UCX, and UCFE payments not subject to reductions, but EB, EUC08, and administrative funding are. The FY2018 sequestration order mandates a 6.6% reduction in nonexempt nondefense mandatory expenditures, affecting EB benefits. EB was activated only in the U.S. Virgin Islands in FY2018. The FY2017 sequestration order required a 6.9% reduction in nonexempt nondefense mandatory expenditures. The sequestration order mandated a 6.9% reduction in EB expenditures for weeks of unemployment from October 8, 2016, to September 30, 2017. If a state is insolvent, it can use a loan mechanism within the UTF framework to pay UC benefits, but must repay the loans to avoid interest charges and increased FUTA rates for employers. The Virgin Islands owed $68.5 million to the federal accounts within the UTF as of November 13, 2018. The President's FY2019 budget proposes changes to the UI system, including new standards for state account balances, permanent funding for RESEA, mandatory assessments for UC beneficiaries, paid parental leave benefits financed through state unemployment taxes, and integrity measures like offsetting SSDI benefits for concurrent UI receipt. States may face increased FUTA rates until loans are repaid. The President's FY2019 budget proposal includes changes to the UI system, requiring states to maintain a UTF account balance of at least 50% of the state's AHCM. It also introduces higher FUTA rates for states with low AHCM, with additional revenue deposited into the state UTF account. The proposal also mandates permanent funding for RESEA program and requires states to provide reemployment services to UC claimants. The President's budget proposal for FY2019 includes requiring states to establish a paid parental leave benefit by 2020 using the UC program as its administrative framework. States would provide six weeks of benefits for the birth or adoption of a child, with eligibility and financing parameters determined by the states. The President's 2019 budget proposal includes integrity measures for Unemployment Compensation (UC) and Family Leave. States would need to use specific data sources to confirm eligibility for UC benefits. Additional measures include giving the Labor Secretary authority to implement corrective actions for poor state performance, allowing states to retain overpayments for program integrity, and requiring funds from penalties to be used for improving UI administration and reemployment services. The Trump Administration proposed rescissions of budget authority, including $132,612,397 from a temporary program of extended Railroad unemployment benefits created in 2008. The Government Accountability Office confirmed the classification of each proposed rescission. President Trump signed a resolution negating a rule that allowed states to drug test unemployment claimants based on their occupation. This rule was rescinded through a Congressional Review Act resolution. The ability for states to prospectively test unemployment claimants based on occupation has been revoked. States can now only drug test claimants if they were discharged for unlawful drug use or refusing a drug test. A new rule is being proposed to identify occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. President Trump signed a resolution repealing the 2016 regulation, subjecting the new rule to reissue requirements. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 includes UI-related changes, such as authorizing a deferral of interest payments. Section 20801 of P.L. 115-123 authorizes a deferral of interest payments on a federal UI loan for the U.S. Virgin Islands. Section 30206 of P.L. 115-123 codifies Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEAs) for UI beneficiaries. FEMA declared two major disasters for the USVI in September 2017, leading to economic challenges. The deadline for USVI's interest payment on the federal UI loan was extended to September 28, 2018, with no interest accruing during the deferral period. The RESEA program, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, provides discretionary funding to states for evidence-based interventions for UI claimants. P.L. 115-254 extended Disaster Unemployment Assistance for an additional 26 weeks for individuals in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) extended for 26 weeks in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. Potential entitlement of up to 52 weeks for some individuals. Remaining DUA weeks to be paid retroactively. Eligibility for DUA benefits for individuals who exhausted UC or EB entitlement. Representative David McKinley introduced H.R. 3702, the Manufacturing Economic Recovery Act of 2017, which includes a work opportunity tax credit for hiring in manufacturing facilities. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the Reducing Long-Term Unemployment Act, H.R. 4470, which would provide tax incentives for employers hiring unemployed individuals. Representative James Renacci sponsored H.R. 1091, the Flexibility to Promote Reemployment Act, which extends state UC demonstration projects through December 31, 2021. H.R. 1091 extends state UC demonstration projects through December 31, 2021, authorizing 10 states per year to conduct approved projects. The bill revises project requirements, transfers evaluation responsibility to DOL, and outlines termination procedures. Jared Polis introduced the 100 by '50 Act, allowing states to provide additional UI benefits to workers transitioning to clean energy by 2050. Earl Carter sponsored the EQUIP Act, which would require UC applicants to complete a substance abuse risk assessment and pass a controlled substances test to receive benefits. Representative Steve Russell sponsored H.R. 2861, the Hire Military Service Members Act, which would withhold payments to states for UCX benefits if they impose licensing requirements that do not accept certain professional credentials related to military training and skills. Those who fail the test would be ineligible for benefits for 30 days and then retested for eligibility."
