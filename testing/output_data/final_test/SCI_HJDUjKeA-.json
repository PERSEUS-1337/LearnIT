    "content": "In an unsupervised manner, discrete objects can be learned from pixels and used for reinforcement learning. A differentiable mapping from images to objects is created, allowing for the representation to be learned using an attention mechanism. This approach is applied to Atari games, resulting in agents that can play using objects learned in an unsupervised manner, with natural objects emerging during training. The first reinforcement learning agent for Atari introduces an interpretable object representation, enabling object-based exploration and generalization. Humans perceive the world as discrete, persistent objects that can be interacted with, aiding in planning, reasoning, and exploration. This explicit object representation and prior knowledge are lacking in artificial reinforcement learning agents like DQN. In this paper, a method is proposed to learn objects from pixels in an unsupervised manner, aiming to create a tabular representation of objects with positions and features. The challenge lies in transforming the connected manifold of input pixels into a disconnected space of object representations. The paper introduces a method to learn object representations from pixels in an unsupervised manner. It addresses the challenge of transforming connected input pixels into disconnected object representations by introducing object presence values. The model tracks objects across frames, enabling calculations using object representations. Results show the model can perform reinforcement learning on learned object representations in Atari games like Pong and Seaquest. The architecture allows for calculating global values from a collection of objects using an \"interaction net\" style architecture. The model in Attend, Infer, Repeat: Fast Scene Understanding with Generative Models BID4 produces objects from pixels in an unsupervised manner, representing each digit as an object without recurrence or spatial transformers. This allows for handling larger images with more objects efficiently. The use of spatial transformers in detecting objects is discussed, with a focus on models with a \"two-stage\" architecture for reinforcement learning. Various models utilize interaction network architecture on top of convolutional layers for object recognition and fast reinforcement learning. Various models use an interaction network architecture on top of a convolutional stack for object recognition and reinforcement learning. Visual interaction networks learn to extract objects from pixels and predict future states, while a neural network module for relational reasoning answers questions involving spatial reasoning. The mapping from pixels to objects produces a list where each object has a position, features, and a presence value. The model depicted in FIG0 learns objects by minimizing a loss function using a bottleneck object representation. Input pixels are transformed through a convolutional network to obtain a mask tensor and a features tensor. Object positions are identified using the mask tensor, and object features are associated with these positions. The model learns object positions by identifying local maxima in the mask tensor and associating object features with them. The top k objects are selected based on presence value for efficiency. Noise is added to presence values for exploration, and a loss term discourages useless objects. The model learns object positions by identifying local maxima in the mask tensor and associating object features with them. The object position is determined as the weighted average around the local maxima to ensure differentiability. Noise is added to presence values for exploration, and a loss term discourages useless objects. The model learns object positions by identifying local maxima in the mask tensor and associating object features with them. The object position is determined as the weighted average around the local maxima to ensure differentiability. Noise is added to presence values for exploration, and a loss term discourages useless objects. This encourages sharp values about the actual object positions and exploration in the latent space of positions. The final position is determined by a Gaussian sample, and the object feature vector is the average of the feature tensor in the window around the maxima, weighted by the mask. The model learns object positions by identifying local maxima in the mask tensor and associating object features with them. Each (a, b) \u2208 M indexes an object with position x(a, b) and feature vector f(a, b). The top k values of m(a, b) are selected to produce a list of objects with presence values. The final presence values are determined using a concrete transformation with temperature equal to 1. A function defined on the objects must be smoothly gated on the presence for output effectiveness. To encourage useful objects to emerge, a concrete transformation with noise is applied to presence values before gating functions. The transformation ensures that presence values close to 0 or 1 remain stable, while values near 0.5 can change significantly. This approach promotes object presence values to move towards 1, making the output more deterministic. The use of noise in the transformation improves performance, with an optimal temperature of 1 experimentally determined. Objects indexed by local maxima of the mask are important for output, with small presence values being computationally wasteful. To ensure a fixed number of objects in TensorFlow implementation, the top k objects are taken (k = 16). However, this approach may lead to useful objects with initially small presence values never being prioritized. Other sampling methods for k objects may not solve this issue. In order to prevent useless objects from appearing, a loss penalty is added to limit the \"expected slot occupancy\" to a certain threshold. Various sampling methods have been tested, but simpler schemes perform better than more complex ones. Comparing the attention with loss scheme used here to other methods highlights the importance of selecting all useful objects effectively. In our use case, it is crucial to attend to all useful objects, filling remaining slots with potentially useful ones. Unlike other models, we select top k objects and discourage useless ones with a small loss term. Additionally, we construct a bipartite graph to identify the same object across frames. In our use case, we construct a bipartite graph with edge weights to find a minimal weight perfect matching between objects across frames. Constants like s, c t, and c p control the matching thresholds. The Hungarian algorithm can be used to find the perfect matching efficiently. A minimal weight matching in a bipartite graph has a probabilistic interpretation. The matching can be seen as the maximal likelihood assignment of objects sampled from Gaussian random variables. Adding features to the weights may improve matching quality. The mechanism is deterministic but could be enhanced by introducing learnable biases to edge weights. The architecture for computing quantities of interest using object representation includes three streams: a global stream, a per-object stream, and a per-object-pair stream. The interaction network-style architectures need to be deep to effectively learn Q-values, despite having clear representations for input. The interaction network-style architectures require deep layers to effectively learn Q-values, despite having clear representations for input. The architecture should support recurrence for reinforcement learning, such as determining the direction of the ball in Pong. Ideas from interaction networks are utilized to achieve these goals. The architecture for learning to play Seaquest from objects is based on interaction networks, with precise details provided in the appendix. It consists of identical layers operating on three streams of information, representing global quantities, per-object quantities, and per-object-pair quantities. The input and output of each layer are triples, with specific values for computational efficiency. The architecture for learning to play Seaquest from objects involves layers that mix inputs and apply linear transformations to achieve invariance to object order. ReLUs are used for activations, and a reduction operation averages over object axes while gating on object presence. Self-gating allows the network to ignore unhelpful objects without penalty. The architecture for learning to play Seaquest from objects involves maintaining a per-object state vector updated using LSTM-style gates. This allows for the input and output of global and per-object information, such as object state in recurrence and Q-values. The model reconstructs objects from pixels using transpose convolutional layers and a static background. It works well for Atari games and can be combined with distributional Q-learning to build a reinforcement learning agent. The architecture described in Section 4 is used for Atari games, incorporating object reconstruction loss decoder from Section 5 and top-k loss from Section 3.3 to prevent phantom objects. The model downscales input images to 84 \u00d7 84 without stacking frames, with a per-object feature vector size of 4. The encoder is the most resource-intensive part of the model. The encoder in the model is the most resource-intensive part, with a per-object feature vector size of 4 and output mask size matching the input. The architecture downscales images to 84 \u00d7 84 without stacking frames, using convolution operations and ReLU nonlinearity to process the input tensor X. The final output mask is obtained through a series of convolution and scaling operations. The model's encoder downscales images to 84 \u00d7 84 using convolution operations and ReLU nonlinearity on input tensor X. The output mask is obtained through convolution and scaling operations, with object drawings created using transpose convolutional layers. Each object's presence is determined by splitting the output into tensors X and Y, combining them into a buffer with dimensions h\u00d7w\u00d72d. Objects are positioned using bilinear interpolation for fractional positions. The interaction network style architecture involves a repeated parameterizable layer module with non-shared parameters, operating on three streams of information: global, per-object, and per-object-pair. The layer architecture consists of a mapping that averages over the last object axis.

The layer architecture consists of a mapping that averages over the last object axis. Additionally, the restricted stream tensor for A and B is defined for computational expediency, with specific operations on A, B, and C to define one layer of the interaction-style network. These operations are stacked six times to build the network. The function f defines one layer of an interaction-style network, stacked 6 times with non-shared parameters and rectified linear unit activations. For reinforcement learning, training is done asynchronously using a modified 1-step Q-learning model to predict distributions over Q-values. 32 workers perform rollouts of length 12, with a target network updated every 1000 agent steps. The loss function includes distributional RL loss, decoder, and top components. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and = 5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 is used."
