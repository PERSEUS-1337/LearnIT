    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Energy Price and Economic Stability Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that reliable and affordable energy is crucial for economic health and public safety, especially in the western states. Despite efforts, an emergency energy situation exists, attributed to factors like a flawed deregulation plan in California and market power among generators. The Federal government should intervene to protect consumers from excessive wholesale rates. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found that wholesale electricity rates in California were potentially unjust and unreasonable under the Federal Power Act in 2000 and 2001. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found potential overcharges of more than $130 million by generators in California utilities in March 2001. The California Independent System Operator reported possible overcharges of over $6 billion between May 2000 and February 2001. Market conditions in California, Washington, and Oregon are spreading to neighboring states, leading to rising electricity costs. Without intervention, the western wholesale electricity market may face further issues. The Governors of California, Oregon, and Washington requested cost-of-service based rates in the western energy market from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Commission has failed to mandate just and reasonable wholesale rates, leading to concerns about escalating electricity prices in the region. SEC. 3. Wholesale electricity rates in the Western United States. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. A \"cost-of-service-based rate\" for electric energy includes all costs of generating, transmitting, and acquiring energy, along with a reasonable risk premium or return on invested capital. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will establish cost-based rates for wholesale electric energy in the Western Systems Coordinating Council region. These rates will not apply to sales after March 1, 2003, and new generation facilities are exempt. The State can take legal action if a wholesale electricity rate is not compliant or just and reasonable. Civil penalties are three times the value of the violation. The Commission will assess penalties following a public hearing. Refunds for unjust and unreasonable electric energy rates in the Western Systems Coordinating Council area between June 1, 2000, and the enactment of the Act must be ordered by the Commission. States can enforce this provision in court. Existing Commission authorities are not affected by this section. The Federal Power Act is amended to require guaranteed payment for emergency power sales during peacetime. If any provision of the Act is deemed unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of other provisions."
