Congress finds that the United States has been committed to providing life-saving food assistance to developing countries for over 55 years. As the largest donor of international food aid, the US can lead in improving food aid quality to target undernourished women and children. The US contributes over half of all food aid supplies to alleviate hunger and support development, playing a crucial role in global food security amidst increasing food prices and humanitarian crises. The protracted humanitarian crises worldwide have heightened the importance of United States food assistance. There is a growing demand for new, cost-effective products to address the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations. While effective in short-term emergencies, concerns have been raised about the long-term impact of US food assistance programs on meeting recipient populations' nutritional needs, particularly in reducing maternal and child malnutrition. Reducing maternal and child malnutrition, especially in the critical 1,000 days between pregnancy and age 2, is a key priority of United States global food security and health initiatives. Recent reports by the Government Accountability Office and the United States Agency for International Development recommended over 35 changes to US food aid products and programs to improve nutritional quality, quality control, and cost effectiveness. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of efficient and cost-effective food assistance programs, particularly focusing on improving maternal and child health through nutrition products.
