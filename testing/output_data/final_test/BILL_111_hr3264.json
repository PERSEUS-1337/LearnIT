The agencies must provide online information about the coordinator, application procedures, and deadlines. The Office of Personnel Management will also maintain a centralized database for this information. The Office of Personnel Management will establish a centralized database with names, contact information, and skills of interns seeking full-time Federal employment. Agencies can make noncompetitive appointments for interns who completed the program and meet certain requirements. The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe requirements for interns appointed to term employment, allowing noncompetitive conversion to career appointments. The agency must submit annual reports assessing internship programs to the Office of Personnel Management. The Federal agency must report on the number of interns, their demographics, the percentage of interns transitioning to full-time employment, steps taken to increase this percentage, and recruitment activities.
