Congress finds that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to keep and bear arms. During Hurricane Katrina, law enforcement was overwhelmed, leading to threats to citizens' safety and property. Many citizens lawfully kept firearms for self-defense. During Hurricane Katrina, agencies confiscated firearms from citizens, violating their Second Amendment rights and leaving them defenseless against crime. Confiscations were done forcefully, including gunpoint seizures, nonconsensual entries into homes, and checkpoints. Citizens were either at home or trying to escape the flooding when their firearms were taken. During Hurricane Katrina, agencies confiscated firearms from citizens, violating their Second Amendment rights and leaving them defenseless against crime. The confiscations involved intrusion into homes, temporary detention of persons, and seizures of property, constituting unreasonable searches and seizures that deprived citizens of liberty and property without due process of law. Additionally, citizens seeking refuge in emergency housing were prohibited from storing firearms, treating them as second-class citizens who had forfeited their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. During Hurricane Katrina, a highly-qualified search and rescue team was prevented from helping due to individuals with firearms, despite being deputized as Federal law enforcement officers. This action violated citizens' rights to personal security, liberty, and property, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONFISCATION OF FIREARMS DURING CERTAIN NATIONAL EMERGENCIES. Amendment to Title VII of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to include a section on firearms policies. During a major disaster or emergency, no federal officer or employee can seize firearms not prohibited by law, require registration of unregistered firearms, or prohibit firearm possession. This is in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The text prohibits the possession of firearms where not prohibited by law and allows authorized individuals to carry firearms during a disaster. Individuals can seek legal action for violations of these rights. The text allows individuals to take legal action for the return of seized firearms in violation of the law, with attorney fees awarded to the prevailing party."
