    "content": "We introduce a new dataset of logical entailments to evaluate models' ability to understand and utilize logical structure in an entailment prediction task. Different architectures were compared, showing that tree-structured neural networks outperform LSTM RNNs in exploiting logic syntax, and PossibleWorldNets perform the best among all benchmarks. The study aims to determine which neural network architectures are most effective in inferring and relating features in structural sequence-based problems. In this paper, the study aims to evaluate neural network architectures' ability to reason structurally and abstractly in sequence data. A new model called PossibleWorldNet is introduced and compared with popular network architectures across various applications like vision tasks and natural language understanding. The goal is to understand inductive biases and pave the way for agents and classifiers to reason structurally in addition to semantic representations. The curr_chunk discusses the use of neural architectures in tasks such as textual entailment, sentiment analysis, and reading comprehension. It highlights the importance of understanding the inductive biases of different neural architectures, particularly in capturing input structure for language and reasoning tasks. The paper introduces a new dataset for training and aims to study these biases in isolation by focusing on tasks primarily about sequence structure. The paper introduces a new dataset for training and evaluating neural models for tasks like textual entailment. It proposes a variant of TreeNet that outperforms benchmarks by evaluating formulas in multiple \"possible worlds\". The structure of the paper includes introducing the dataset, baseline models, and a new neural model called PossibleWorldNet. Formal logics provide a symbolic toolkit for encoding patterns of reasoning, focusing on codifying correct thought norms. The meanings of statements are invariant, understanding entailment through semantics and syntactic rules of logical connectives. Determining entailment truth is a structural sequence-based problem, where only the meaning of connectives or inference rules matters. Logical entailment is a structural sequence-based problem where only the meaning of connectives or inference rules matters. A generic process for generating entailment datasets for any logical system is presented, focusing on propositional logic in this specific dataset. The dataset consists of triples (A, B, A B) where A and B are propositional logic formulas, and A B is 1 if A entails B, and 0 otherwise. The dataset for logical entailment consists of triples (A, B, A B) where A and B are propositional logic formulas. Entailment is a semantic notion where A entails B if every model where A is true also has B as true. Various constraints are imposed on the dataset to ensure balanced classes, similar formula length distributions, and no recognizable differences in lexical or syntactic features between positive and negative examples. To ensure balanced classes and minimize structural differences between positive and negative examples in logical entailment datasets, 4-tuples of formulas (A1, B1, A2, B2) are sampled. This approach addresses issues with formula distributions and allows models to learn without understanding the problem's structure. The generative process involves sampling 4-tuples of datapoints (A1, B1, A2, B2) and splitting them into train, validation, and test sets. The difficulty of entailment evaluation depends on the number of propositional variables and operators in the formulas. Sampling is done uniformly between 1 and 10 propositional variables in easy tests and between 5 and 10 in hard tests. The formula sampling method allows specifying the desired number of operators. The method involves sampling formulas with a specified number of operators. In the hard test set, formulas have between 15 and 20 operators. The test datasets vary in the number of variables and operators sampled uniformly. The test (massive) dataset includes pairs of formulas A, B with 20-26 variables and 20-30 operators each. The test (exam) dataset consists of 100 examples of logical entailment from various logic textbooks. The method involves sampling formulas with a specified number of operators, including true and false entailment triples extracted from logic textbooks. To prevent memorization, cases with equivalent formulas in training were pruned out by converting all formulas to de-Bruijn form. This ensures models can generalize to new unseen formulas. To encourage models to capture invariance, a data processing layer is added during training where symbols are replaced within entailments. This is similar to augmenting image classification training. PossibleWorldNet is a new model introduced after describing baseline and benchmark models for a dataset with balanced classes. Linear BoW model and a similar architecture with a multi-layer linear layer are defined as neural baselines for the task. The final linear layer is replaced with a multi-layer perceptron in the architecture. Baselines are limited in performance as they can only capture entailment by modeling symbols individually. Benchmark models are presented for comparison on a syntactic problem, categorized as encoding models and relational models. The model jointly learns an encoding function and an MLP to decide on entailment, while relational models make decisions by observing pairs of expressions. The first encoder benchmark is a Deep Convolutional Network Encoder, similar to architectures in the convolutional networks for text literature. The second and third encoder benchmarks are LSTM and bidirectional LSTM networks. The LSTM encoder embeds sequence symbols and runs an LSTM RNN over them. The bidirectional variant uses two separate LSTM RNNs in opposite directions. These benchmarks do not explicitly condition on structure but model dependencies implicitly. The fourth and fifth encoding benchmarks are TreeRNNs, which recursively encode logical expressions using parse structures. Leaf nodes represent propositional variables as learnable vectors, and logical operators combine these values to produce new embeddings. The fourth and fifth encoding benchmarks involve TreeRNNs, which encode logical expressions using parse structures. Leaf nodes represent propositional variables as vectors, and logical operators combine these values to produce new embeddings. The fifth benchmark, TreeLSTM Encoders, adapts LSTM cell updates to capture long-range dependencies within the tree. The LSTM and bidirectional LSTM models concatenate sequences into a single sequence for accurate parsing of logical expressions. The Transformer model, known as Attention Is All You Need, uses a learnable bias to distinguish symbols in embeddings. In this section, a new model is introduced that augments the Transformer's method by adding timing signals to symbols at different positions. The model evaluates pairs of formulas in different \"possible worlds\" based on a semantic definition of entailment. Entailment is defined as a semantic notion where a formula is satisfied in a particular world. The model defines variants of entailment that produce integers and operate on real values. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of a neural model using continuous functions to relax Proposition 1. It involves using vectors of real values to represent worlds and a TreeNN to evaluate propositional variables. Additional parameters and weight matrices are added to the model for evaluation in different worlds. The current world is represented using an additional weight matrix to focus on specific aspects. The PossibleWorldNet evaluates expressions in imagined worlds through a form of convolution. Increasing the number of imagined worlds improves the model's quality. This architecture is inspired by semantic approaches to entailment detection but does not impose constraints on propositional or formal logic. The PossibleWorldNet evaluates expressions in imagined worlds through convolution, improving model quality. The architecture is inspired by semantic approaches to entailment detection, applicable to various logics and natural language sentences. It generates multiple models with shared weights for predictions and uses a linear layer for overall prediction. Parameters of encoders for left and right sides of the sequent are shared in the binary classification MLP for entailment detection. The architecture for entailment detection involves model-specific expression representations and symbol embedding matrices, jointly trained using TensorFlow. Models are optimized with Adam and hyperparameters are grid-searched for learning rates, minibatch sizes, layer sizes, and other specific parameters for different types of networks. The grid search process involved exploring different parameters for various models, including the number of channels, pooling intervals, encoder and decoder layers, dropout probabilities, and filter sizes. The best model for each architecture was selected based on validation results, and test accuracies were recorded. The experimental results are presented in TAB1, with the test scores of the best overall model highlighted in bold and the best model without privileged access to syntax or semantics italicized. The baseline results show that convolution networks and BiDirLSTMs encoders obtain relatively mediocre results compared to other models, as do LSTM and BiDirLSTM Traversal models. LSTM encoders is the best performing model which does not have privileged access to the syntax trees. Their success relative to BiDirLSTMs Encoders could be due to their reduced number of parameters guarding against overfitting, and rendering them easier to optimise. The TreeLSTM model outperforms other benchmarks on both test sets, with symbol permutation data augmentation significantly improving accuracy for various models. Models that exploit structure in tasks perform better than those that must implicitly model sequences. TreeLSTM model outperforms benchmarks on test sets, indicating that tree structured networks may be better for domains with unambiguous syntax. LSTM-based encoders provide competitive results, but traversal models do not outperform encoding models in pair-of-sequences traversal problem. Existing tasks favor models that capture long-range dependencies for textual entailment recognition. Existing tasks favor models capturing representational or semantic regularities, but struggle with structural or syntactic reasoning. Poor performance of convolutional nets on certain tasks suggests they struggle with capturing sparse, structured, and distant dependencies in sequences. Transformer benchmark shows promise in capturing structure for machine translation and handling word order and relational information. The PossibleWorldNet model outperforms other models in capturing hierarchical structure in logical expressions, achieving 99.3% accuracy on easy test and 97.3% accuracy on hard test. The model's strong inductive bias includes knowledge of syntactic structure and character-level encoding capabilities. The PossibleWorldNet model excels in capturing hierarchical structure in logical expressions, achieving high accuracy on easy and hard tests. It evaluates formulas in various situations and combines results, with the number of \"possible worlds\" directly impacting its quality and data-efficiency. Increasing the number of worlds reduces validation error rate without adding model parameters. The PossibleWorldNet model excels in capturing hierarchical structure in logical expressions, achieving high accuracy on easy and hard tests by evaluating formulas in various situations. In a big test set, there are over 3,000 possible truth-value assignments on average, while in a massive test set, there are over 800,000 possible assignments. The model considers at most 256 different worlds, which is a small fraction of the total number of rows needed for the test sets. Sampling a small number of truth table rows for each pair of formulas allows for an estimate of accuracy in detecting entailment. The PossibleWorldNet model can efficiently learn based on label likelihood objective, resembling a model-based solution to entailment. It has a high chance of finding a countermodel. In contrast to other works, PossibleWorldNet exploits repeated computation across projections of random noise. The main differences between our work and BID1's are in the type of relation considered (equivalence vs. entailment) and the complexity of the dataset (single vs. multiple variables). BID1 uses a recursive neural network for equivalence, while we focus on entailment as a relational classification problem. Recognizing textual entailment (RTE) is a key task in natural language processing, involving classifying a formula into one of k equivalence-classes based on truth-conditions. Different approaches use LSTMs or convolutional neural networks with attention. Additional auxiliary information is needed for classifying new equivalence classes not seen during training. Recognizing textual entailment involves classifying formulas based on truth-conditions using neural networks with attention. Evaluating entailment between natural language sentences requires understanding non-logical terms. Current neural models may not always grasp sentence structure accurately. In BID3, neural models incorrectly claimed entailment between sentences. Isolating the structural sub-problem could be beneficial for reliable entailment prediction. In this paper, a new process for generating datasets for recognizing logical entailment is introduced. The study compares benchmarks and a new model, showing that architectures explicitly using structure perform better. The best model has a strong bias towards capturing possible world semantics of entailment. Experimental results also compare the abilities of implicit structure models like LSTM and Convolution. The study compares the abilities of LSTM and Convolution networks in capturing structure for sequence-based problems. Convolutional networks may not have the right bias to exploit deeply structured syntax in certain problems. The dataset provides new insights on neural models' understanding of structural sequence problems, particularly in logical entailment tasks. The dataset D consists of triples (A, B, A B) where A B is 1 if A entails B, and 0 otherwise. Baseline models are designed to prevent exploitation of statistical regularities in entailment recognition tasks. The baselines used in the study are designed to prevent exploitation of statistical regularities in entailment recognition tasks. Models that only observe one side of the sequent are unable to solve the entailment recognition problem. If these models outperform a random baseline, it indicates a structural or symbolic regularity on one side that helps identify some examples. These baselines verify the soundness of the generation process. The study uses baselines to verify the generation process for entailment recognition tasks. Various requirements are imposed on the dataset to prevent exploitation of syntactic differences. However, the straightforward approach results in datasets that do not meet the requirements, as shown in TAB3. Notably, there are differences in the number of negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions at the top of the syntax tree between positive and negative entailments. The mean number of satisfying truth-value assignments differs between formulas A + and A \u2212, with A + being true in 3.7 assignments and A \u2212 in 10.3 assignments. Simple heuristic baselines can be developed using these statistics to compare formulas A and B. A different dataset generation approach was taken to prevent crude statistical measurements from detecting differences between D + and D \u2212. The dataset generation approach was changed to ensure statistical measurements could not detect differences between D + and D \u2212. By sampling 4-tuples of formulas, each appearing in both positive and negative entailments, the mean length and number of operators were kept consistent for D + and D \u2212. This method also ruled out certain formulas from being impossible or tautological."
