    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that the freedom of speech and press, protected by the first amendment, are essential for the public to obtain information about the government and make informed judgments on important issues. The first amendment protects the right of the news media to gather and disseminate information to the public, as well as the right of the people to petition the government for grievances. This is essential for transparency in government operations. In the twenty-first century, the people of the United States rely on print and electronic media, especially television, for information on judicial matters. Allowing televised coverage of courtroom proceedings would greatly increase public access to the Federal judiciary, enhancing transparency and accountability. The first amendment prevents Congress from limiting freedom of speech, press, and petitioning the Government. Granting authority would help implement public trials in criminal cases as guaranteed by the sixth amendment. The guarantee of public trials in criminal cases is a safeguard against judicial abuse, as it allows for contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion. The presiding judge has the authority to allow media coverage of court proceedings. The presiding judge of appellate and district courts in the United States may allow media coverage of court proceedings, including photographing, recording, broadcasting, or televising to the public. Witnesses in trial proceedings can request their faces and voices to be disguised or obscured. The presiding judge may allow media coverage of court proceedings, and witnesses have the right to request their image and voice be obscured during testimony. The Judicial Conference can provide advisory guidelines for managing photographing, recording, broadcasting, or televising in court. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"presiding judge\" refers to the judge overseeing the court proceeding, with the senior active judge taking precedence in cases involving multiple judges. The presiding judge is the chief judge in en banc sittings of a circuit court of appeals or the Chief Justice in en banc sittings of the Supreme Court of the United States. The term \"appellate court of the United States\" is also defined. The term \"appellate court of the United States\" includes United States circuit courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. SEC. 4. SUNSET. The authority under section 2(b) will end 3 years after the enactment of this Act."
