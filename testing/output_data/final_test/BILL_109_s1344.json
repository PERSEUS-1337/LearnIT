    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Health Center Volunteer Provider Protection Act of 2005\". Congress acknowledges the significant challenge faced by health centers in providing care to the uninsured and underinsured due to financial pressures. Granting volunteer physician liability coverage is crucial to ensure access to health services for medically underserved populations. The Act (42 U.S.C. 233(g)) aims to increase the number of physicians at health centers by offering liability coverage, allowing centers to recruit full-time physicians and provide essential healthcare services to their communities. This will also lead to an improvement in the quality of healthcare services offered at these centers. SEC. 3. Health centers under Public Health Service Act receive liability protections for volunteer practitioners. Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include volunteer practitioners in liability protections for health centers. Subsections (g) through (m) now apply to volunteer practitioners, employees, and contractors. Liability protections under Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act now extend to volunteer practitioners who provide services to patients of specified entities. The term \"volunteer practitioner\" refers to licensed physicians or clinical psychologists who offer their services at designated sites without consideration of weekly service hours. The liability protections under Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act now cover volunteer practitioners who provide services without receiving compensation from patients, entities, or third-party payors. SEC. 4. STUDY ON ADEQUACY OF FUNDING FOR COVERAGE. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the funding adequacy for liability coverage under the Public Health Service Act for entities receiving federal funds for health centers and volunteer practitioners. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment."
