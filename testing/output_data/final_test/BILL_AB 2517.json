    "title": "AB 2517",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following: The Legislature finds that voter turnout has declined, especially at the local level, with only 42 percent turnout in the November 2014 general election. Research shows early voting experiences influence future voting behavior, and 16 and 17 year olds are mature enough to vote on local political decisions. Lowering the voting age for certain local elections can engage young voters on relevant issues, increase voter turnout, and strengthen democracy. Countries like Norway and Austria saw higher turnout among 16 and 17 year olds. This change would also boost the need for better civics education in schools. The bill aims to clarify if charter cities can lower the voting age for local elections. The Legislature intends to allow charter cities to authorize 16-year-olds to vote in school district elections to increase voter turnout. Any costs incurred will be covered by the city or school district. This amendment clarifies voter eligibility in local elections. A person who will be at least 18 years old can register and vote in the next election, except in cases where a city charter allows 16-year-olds to vote in school district governing board elections. The city or city and county will determine the voting process, with all votes cast by 8 p.m. on election day. If a city amends its charter, it must agree to cover costs for implementing the amendment or perform necessary duties. A charter amendment adopted after January 1, 2017, is valid regardless of approval date. Section 2000 of the Elections Code is being amended. Section 2000 of the California Elections Code states that any person who qualifies under Article II of the California Constitution and complies with voter registration rules can vote in elections within their residing territory. Individuals who will be at least 18 years old by the next election can register and vote. Those who are at least 16 years old can preregister to vote but must wait until they are 18 to vote, except in certain circumstances. The governing body of a city or city and county can amend its charter to allow individuals at least 16 years old to vote in school district governing board elections. The city or city and county will determine the voting process, with all votes cast by 8 p.m. on election day. A city or city and county can amend its charter to allow individuals at least 16 years old to vote in school district governing board elections. The charter amendment shall be valid regardless of the approval date if effective January 1, 2017, or later. The city, city or county, or school district must cover all costs for implementing the charter amendment or perform necessary duties as per agreement with the county elections official. In California, a person eligible to register to vote must be a US citizen, a resident of California, not incarcerated or on parole for a felony, and at least 18 years old. However, if a city allows voting at 16 for school district elections, individuals meeting requirements can register for that purpose. In California, to register to vote, a person must be a US citizen, a California resident, not imprisoned or on parole for a felony, and at least 18 years old. If a city permits voting at 16 for school district elections, eligible individuals can register for that purpose. The Secretary of State must certify that California has a statewide voter registration database compliant with the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 for Sections 3 and 5 to become operative."
