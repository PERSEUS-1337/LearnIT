    "content": "The Act titled \"Stormwater Enforcement and Permitting Act of 2006\" provides greater specificity in information requests and opportunities for corrective action. The Act \"Stormwater Enforcement and Permitting Act of 2006\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Act by specifying information requests and corrective actions for residential construction sites. The Act \"Stormwater Enforcement and Permitting Act of 2006\" requires the Administrator to provide written notice of permit violations at residential construction sites and allow operators a chance to correct the violation before enforcement action is taken. If a violation is found at a residential construction site after a corrective action opportunity has been given, the operator will not be given another chance before enforcement action. The Administrator cannot intervene during the correction period for non-discharged stormwater permit violations. The amendment to Section 309(g)(6)(A) of the Act limits actions during the opportunity to correct a violation at a residential construction site. The Administrator or their representative must provide the operator with a chance to correct the violation before enforcement action can be taken. SEC. 3. PAPERWORK LIMITATIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION SITES. Section 402(l) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to exempt stormwater runoff from residential construction sites from requiring a permit if certain conditions are met. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act exempts stormwater runoff from residential construction sites from requiring a permit if the site has minimal potential for soil erosion, defined as an erosivity factor of less than 5 during construction activity. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act exempts stormwater runoff from residential construction sites from requiring a permit if the site has minimal potential for soil erosion, defined as an erosivity factor of less than 5 as calculated based on the latest version of the revised universal soil loss equation developed by the Department of Agriculture. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act exempts stormwater runoff from residential construction sites with minimal soil erosion potential from requiring a permit. Section 402(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act exempts stormwater discharges from residential construction sites with minimal soil erosion potential from federal enforcement, unless specific conditions are met. After considering all terms of the permit, the Administrator may determine that a stormwater discharge from a site poses imminent and substantial endangerment to public health, welfare, or the environment if the discharge crosses a State line, onto a Federal facility, or Indian tribal lands, or if the permit was issued under a State program that has been suspended or withdrawn. The Administrator may not transfer fines or penalties to a State if a permit violation occurs during residential construction activities and poses endangerment to public health or the environment. SEC. 5. NOTIFICATION TO POINT SOURCE OPERATORS AT RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION SITES. Section 402(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a program for providing informational pamphlets to operators of residential construction sites regarding stormwater discharge permit requirements. The program under Section 402(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the development of informational pamphlets for operators of residential construction sites on stormwater discharge permit requirements, including fines and penalties for violations. The pamphlets must be distributed within 180 days of the issuance of the program. The program under Section 402(p) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the development of informational pamphlets for operators of residential construction sites on stormwater discharge permit requirements. Pamphlets must be distributed within 180 days of program issuance, operators must be informed, and consultation with relevant authorities is mandated. SEC. 6. GENERAL PERMITS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow the Administrator or a State to issue general permits on a State, regional, or nationwide basis for various discharges, sludge use, disposal practices, or facilities, with a maximum permit term of 5 years. Public notice is required before issuing a general permit. The Administrator or State must provide public notice and a 45-day comment period for permits issued under this section. They are not required to review or approve applications for discharge under a general permit. Preexisting general permits issued before the enactment of this subsection will remain in effect. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include definitions related to residential construction activity and operators. Residential construction activity refers to housing development and construction, including related structures and infrastructure. An operator, in this context, is a person or entity with operational control over construction plans and specifications for residential projects. The amendment to Section 502 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act defines an operator as someone with day-to-day operational control over construction activities to ensure compliance with permit conditions and regulatory requirements."
