It also limits treaty benefits for certain deductible payments. The \"Investing in American Innovation Act of 2012\" extends the research and development tax credit until December 31, 2012 and introduces limitations on treaty benefits for certain deductible payments under Section 894 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The text discusses the eligibility for deduction of payments between members of a foreign controlled group of entities, defined as a group of entities with a foreign corporation as the common parent. The determination of a partnership or entity as a member of a controlled group is made without considering specific sections. A foreign parent corporation is defined as the common parent of a foreign controlled group for related-party payments. The Secretary has the authority to create regulations. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for treating multiple persons as members of a foreign controlled group of entities and for designating any member as the common parent, based on economic relationships among the entities. This amendment applies to payments made after the enactment of the Act. General aviation aircraft are now treated as 7-year property. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes general aviation aircraft as 12-year property for recovery purposes. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 categorizes general aviation aircraft as 12-year property for recovery purposes, effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2012."
