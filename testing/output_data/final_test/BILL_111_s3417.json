    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Research in Aquaculture Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 2010\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act, titled \"Research in Aquaculture Opportunity and Responsibility Act of 2010,\" defines key terms such as aquatic species, coastal state, and coastline. Aquatic species include various marine life except sea turtles, marine mammals, and birds. Coastal state refers to states bordering oceans or specific bodies of water, including territories like Puerto Rico and Guam. The coastline is defined as the low water line in direct contact with the open sea. The exclusive economic zone is defined as a zone extending 200 nautical miles from the baseline, unless specified otherwise by the President. The inner boundary of the United States territorial sea or exclusive economic zone is determined by lines coterminous with the seaward boundary of coastal states, 3 marine leagues from Puerto Rico, and 3 geographical miles from American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and Guam. The coastline boundaries for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and other US possessions are determined by their authority to regulate fishing activities. Nothing in this paragraph can override these boundaries. The term \"land-based recirculating aquaculture system\" refers to a system located on land that recirculates over 85% of its water, involved in breeding aquatic species, and not operating in open waters. Offshore aquaculture refers to activities in the exclusive economic zone for marine species propagation, excluding salmon hatcheries and mollusk cultivation. Offshore aquaculture facilities are installations or structures used for offshore aquaculture, including areas of the seabed for cultivating sedentary species. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce, unless otherwise specified. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE. Prohibition on Offshore Aquaculture: No rule, regulation, fishery management plan, or permit for offshore aquaculture can be developed or approved until 3 years after required reports are submitted. Existing permits for offshore aquaculture are also subject to this restriction. The Act states that any permits related to offshore aquaculture under the Conservation and Management Act or any other Federal law will no longer be valid upon the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. Grants for land-based aquaculture. The Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture will provide grants for research on land-based recirculating aquaculture systems. SEC. 5. Report on offshore aquaculture. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on offshore aquaculture within 180 days of this Act. The report will cover environmental impacts of offshore aquaculture technologies on native fish species and the economic impacts on various aquaculture operations, fishing operations, and coastal communities in the United States. The Secretary will provide recommendations for regulatory guidelines to protect ocean ecosystems from offshore aquaculture impacts in the Gulf of Mexico, including preventing pollution, diseases, escape of marine species, degradation of wild stocks, and negative impacts on fishing. The curr_chunk discusses concerns related to offshore aquaculture, including inefficient reliance on wild fish for feed, use of chemicals for disease treatment, negative health impacts from consumption, and allocation of reconstruction costs. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, must submit a report to Congress within 180 days on the economic potential of land-based recirculating aquaculture systems, including analysis of resources required, existing systems, economic impact, and potential uses of residual products from algal technologies as fish feed."
