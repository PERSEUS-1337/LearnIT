    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Battle of Midway National Memorial Study Act\". It includes findings related to the Battle of Midway. The Congress finds that the Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in World War II, where the United States Navy defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy, leading to the consideration of establishing Midway Atoll as a national memorial. Establish Midway Atoll as a national memorial to honor the Battle of Midway, protect historic structures, and inspire future generations with the heroism of the Armed Forces. The Act aims to study the feasibility of designating Midway Atoll as a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway within the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. This includes identifying interpretative opportunities for educational purposes related to the defense of the island during World War II. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study, in consultation with various entities, to determine the suitability and feasibility of establishing Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway. Considerations include the management of the memorial and potential leasing arrangements for its administration and maintenance. The study will assess the administration and utilization of Midway Atoll as a national memorial, potential conflicts with its current management as a wildlife refuge, conditions for using facilities on Sand Island, and imposing public access conditions. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with recommendations for legislative action, an inventory of historical facilities on Midway Atoll, and how they contribute to the proposed national memorial. SEC. 5. CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS.\n\nThe Act does not prevent discussions between the Foundation and government entities about the Foundation's future role on Midway Atoll."
