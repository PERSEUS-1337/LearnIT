    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Department of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act\" and defines terms such as Department, National Laboratory, and Secretary. The purpose of the Act is outlined in section 3. The Department of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act aims to enhance the Department's expertise in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing to improve health outcomes for veterans. This includes supporting basic research, utilizing health and genomics data for innovation, and promoting collaborative research. The Department of Energy is promoting collaborative research through partnerships to improve data sharing, establishing scientific computing user facilities, and driving technology development in artificial intelligence, high performance computing, and networking. The Department of Energy is focusing on research and development in veterans' health. The Secretary of the Department of Energy will establish a research program in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing to address big data challenges in veteran's healthcare. The program will focus on developing tools to identify health risks and challenges using data from veteran populations, and will be carried out through a competitive process involving various entities. The research program in artificial intelligence and high-performance computing aims to develop algorithms for predicting disease treatment, accommodate large data sets, maximize the use of AI and machine learning, and securely store data from various sources. The Department of Energy aims to collaborate with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other entities to improve veterans' healthcare through research and development. This includes data sharing, secure data transfer capabilities, and ensuring privacy and security of data storage. Coordination involves entering into agreements, consulting with relevant agencies, and maximizing the effectiveness of research programs. The Secretary must ensure data storage meets privacy and security requirements set by the Department of Veterans Affairs. A report on interagency coordination, research achievements, and opportunities for program expansion must be submitted to relevant committees two years after the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will allocate $27,000,000 for expanding technical capabilities from 2019 to 2023 using funds for medical and prosthetic research. The government is implementing a pilot program for artificial intelligence, data analytics, and computational research. The Secretary is conducting a pilot program to develop tools for big data analytics using data from various sources to advance artificial intelligence technologies. The program involves a competitive process and considers applications from different entities. Components include a research initiative to coordinate efforts in artificial intelligence and data analytics, as well as basic research in modeling and simulation. The Department conducts basic research in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, natural language processing, and predictive analysis to develop novel algorithms for high-performance computing systems and biomedical data sets. They also develop optimization models for large data sets, establish scientific computing user facilities for data storage, and promote collaboration and data sharing between National Laboratories. The Secretary of Energy will submit a report evaluating the effectiveness of a pilot program, including research discoveries and opportunities for technical expansion through artificial intelligence and data analytics technologies. $52,000,000 will be allocated for this purpose. The Secretary of Energy will allocate $52,000,000 for a pilot program evaluating research discoveries and technical expansion through artificial intelligence and data analytics technologies in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. SEC. 6. SPENDING LIMITATION. No additional funds authorized for this Act and its amendments. Funds to be used from existing allocations."
