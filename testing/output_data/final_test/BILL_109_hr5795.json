    "content": "The Act titled \"Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act of 2006\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that rates of unintended pregnancy have increased among low-income women, with a low-income woman today being 4 times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy compared to her higher income counterpart. Abortion rates have also increased among low-income women, with a low-income woman being more than 4 times as likely to have an abortion. Contraceptive use significantly reduces the probability of having an abortion, but levels of contraceptive use among low-income women have declined. Publicly funded contraceptive services have been shown to be effective. Publicly funded contraceptive services prevent 1,300,000 unintended pregnancies annually, reducing the abortion rate. Medicaid-funded contraceptive services are cost-effective, saving $3 for every public dollar spent on family planning. Federal law mandates State Medicaid programs to cover pregnancy-related care for low-income women. 18 States have expanded Medicaid coverage for family planning services to the same level as pregnancy-related care. Equalizing eligibility levels for family planning and pregnancy-related care nationwide would maximize cost-savings for Federal and State Governments. Women should have equal access to contraceptive services to prevent unintended pregnancies and pregnancy-related care if needed.
