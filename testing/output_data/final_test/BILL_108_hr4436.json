    "content": "The \"Fair Housing Protection Act\" clarifies per-unit costs under the Section 8 Rental Housing Assistance Program. The amendment to the Housing Certificate Fund in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Act clarifies per-unit costs for expiring Section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts. This amendment applies to all renewals, aiming to end waiting lists for Section 8 rental housing assistance. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is tasked with developing a plan to reduce and eliminate delays in providing rental housing assistance to eligible families under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The plan aims to identify affordable housing needs, eliminate waiting lists over 10- and 20-year periods, and determine additional funding requirements. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must develop a plan to address delays in providing rental housing assistance to eligible families under Section 8. The plan should identify funding needs, set expenditure strategies, and propose an incentive program for landlords. A report outlining the plan must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF SECTION 8 RESERVES. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must notify a public housing agency of any withdrawal or reduction of funds from a reserve account and replenish the account before the next fiscal quarter. The Secretary cannot withdraw funds that would result in a zero balance in the reserve account for a public housing agency. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must notify public housing agencies before withdrawing funds from the reserve account to prevent the balance from falling to zero. Quarterly notifications on the reserve account balances are required for each agency. The annual contributions contract reserve account is for the tenant-based rental assistance program under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR FAIR HOUSING INITIATIVES PROGRAM. An additional $20,000,000 is authorized for investigative and enforcement activities under this section for fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007."
