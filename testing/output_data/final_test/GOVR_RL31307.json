    "content": "The President signed an omnibus appropriations resolution for FY2003, including funding for Energy and Water Development programs totaling $26.5 billion. This bill covers civil works projects for various agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers, DOE, NRC, and ARC, with an increase from the previous year's appropriation. The Energy and Water bill for FY2003, totaling $26.5 billion, was funded through a series of continuing resolutions due to the bill not passing in the 107th Congress. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 2 to fund programs in all unpassed appropriations bills for the remainder of FY2003, which was signed into law in February. The omnibus measure, signed into law in February, funded Energy and Water programs in Division D of H.J.Res. 2. The appropriations tables include funding levels requested by the Administration, recommended by House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and passed in H.J.Res. 2. The final measure included an across-the-board cut of 0.65%. The Administration requested $4.17 billion for the Corps of Engineers in FY2003, $450 million less than the previous year. The final bill funded the civil works of the Corps at $4.63 billion in FY2003, with the House recommending $4.76 billion and the Senate recommending $4.55 billion. The Administration requested $881 million for Department of the Interior programs, a decrease of $61 million from the previous year. The House recommended $947.5 million, the Senate approved $956.2 million, and the final bill appropriated $953.5 million. The request for DOE programs was $20.89 billion, an increase of $928 million from the previous year. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended different funding amounts for science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The final bill appropriated $20.89 billion for these programs. Additionally, funding for independent agencies was set at $208.0 million. The President's budget request for FY2003 included $4.173 billion for civil works projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a decrease of $450 million from the total enacted level for FY2002. In FY2002, $139 million was allocated for Site Security/Counter Terrorism in the Defense and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. The final bill (P.L. 108-7) funded the Corps at $4.63 billion, including appropriations for controversial projects like the emergency outlet from Devils Lake, North Dakota. Funding for the Yazoo Basin's Backwater Pumping Plant was set at $10 million. Senator McCain's amendment for a feasibility study before outlet construction was tabled. The final appropriations bill for FY2002 funded the Corps of Engineers at $4.63 billion, including controversial projects like the emergency outlet from Devils Lake, North Dakota. Funding for the Yazoo Basin's Backwater Pumping Plant was set at $10 million. Senator McCain's amendment for a feasibility study before outlet construction was tabled. Language related to the flow regime in the Missouri River was not included in the bill despite efforts by Senator Bond. Funding for the Corps' civil works program has been a contentious issue between the Administration and Congress. The FY2002 House bill funded the Corps of Engineers at almost 15% more than requested by the Bush Administration. The FY2003 budget recommended a cut in spending, with priorities only for projects with Administration support. The Senate Appropriations Committee noted that four projects accounted for 30% of the proposed general construction budget. The budget proposal for the Corps of Engineers in FY2003 received media attention due to the resignation of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. The Senate and House reports expressed displeasure with the relatively low budget request and noted a $21 billion project backlog used to justify a \"no new starts\" stance on construction. The Senate and House Committees criticized the Administration's budget proposal for the Corps of Engineers in FY2003, citing a growing construction backlog and maintenance issues. They funded the Corps at 11% higher than the request, emphasizing the need for new construction projects to meet the nation's water resources development needs. Additionally, there are two initiatives to change the operation of the Army Corps of Engineers: the President's Management Agenda and the Third Wave Army initiative. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) and the Army's Third Wave initiative aim to improve government operations. The PMA focuses on competitive sourcing to enhance services at a reasonable cost, while the Third Wave seeks to enhance the Army's core competencies. Both initiatives impact the Corps of Engineers' activities. The Army's Third Wave initiative is reviewing all commands, including the Corps of Engineers, to focus on core competencies. Options for non-core functions include competitive sourcing, transferring responsibilities, or divestiture. A significant portion of the Corps' workforce is in the early phase of the Third Wave. Funding restrictions are in place to prevent privatizing or transferring Civil Works missions without specific congressional direction. The Corps of Engineers faced criticism for project evaluation processes during the 107th Congress, but proposed reforms were not addressed in FY2003 appropriations. Calls for agency reforms and program reviews were made, with legislation introduced but no action taken. The 106th Congress directed a study on Corps feasibility through the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The National Academy of Sciences recommended an independent review panel for Corps projects in response to criticism. The Corps initiated internal staff reviews in FY2002, and both House and Senate Appropriations Committees generally supported the Corps' efforts. Reform issues may be addressed in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) in 2003. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) in 2003 is anticipated after the WRDA in 2002 did not pass. P.L. 108-7 made changes to authorizations for municipal water infrastructure projects, increasing funding for rural Nevada and adding authorization for Idaho. This increase in authorizations has drawn criticism from taxpayer groups and fiscal advocates. The Corps' management of Missouri River water flows during a drought has sparked debate. Two options for flow regimes are proposed, but concerns have been raised by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Consultation between the Corps and FWS is ongoing. The Corps and the FWS have renewed consultation on the 2002-2003 Operating Plan for the Missouri River dams. The Master Manual revision, ongoing for 14 years, guides dam operations impacting barge traffic, species protection, and recreation. A coalition of conservation organizations filed a suit against the Corps and FWS for adverse impacts on endangered species. Reinitiated formal consultation on dam operations began in December 2002. The Corps reconsulted on the 2002-2003 Operating Plan for Missouri River dams, challenging FWS's recommended flow regime for pallid sturgeon. Corps concluded FWS's proposed changes are not warranted, advocating for a research program instead. Missouri River management issues have been addressed in recent appropriations legislation. The final Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill for FY2002 included language prohibiting the acceleration of the schedule to finalize the Record of Decision for the revision of the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual. The provision also directed the Corps to consider views of other agencies and individuals to maintain congressionally authorized purposes, in addition to endangered species protection. This represented a temporary compromise on an ongoing issue that had led to a veto in FY2001. Senator Bond offered an amendment related to Missouri River operations in FY2003. Senator Bond offered an amendment to the Interior portion of the Stevens Amendment that would have restricted the use of funds by the FWS to require a steady release flow and prevent the Corps from relocating bird nests along its banks. The amendment was modified to a Sense of the Congress provision encouraging agreement on a flow regime for 2003 among Member States and Tribes of the Missouri River Basin Association. The final bill did not include the FWS restrictions or the Sense of the Congress language. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized in 2002 by Title VI of WRDA to restore the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem. Funding for Corps' construction projects in the region, including the Kissimmee River restoration and Everglades ecosystem, was included in the President's FY2003 request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided the same funding level as requested. The final appropriations bill funded the Central and Southern Florida project at $90 million, lower than the requested $108 million. Questions were raised about the project's heavy focus on commercial water development. The bill also authorized the Corps to implement Alternative 6D as part of the Modified Water Delivery Project for Everglades restoration. The Modified Water Delivery Project aims to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park and restore natural hydrological conditions. Implementation of the project will increase flooding risk in the 8.5 Square Mile Area, with Alternative 6D Plan expected to control flooding through measures and land acquisitions, requiring the acquisition of 77 residences. Funding for the project is provided by the Energy and Water Development bill for the Department of the Interior. More information can be found in CRS reports RL31306 and RS21331. The President requested funding for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and the Bureau of Reclamation in FY2003. The total appropriation for these programs in FY2002 was $951.5 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $947.5 million for FY2003, the Senate approved $956.2 million, and the final bill appropriated $953.5 million. Water Development Appropriations Title II: Central Utah Project Completion Account received $5 million for the contribution authorized by \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd402(b)(2) of the Central Utah Project Completion Act (P.L. 102-575). Additionally, $1.33 million was allocated for program administration and oversight, and $23.64 million for Central Utah Project construction. The Bureau of Reclamation received $30.3 million from Site Security/Counter Terrorism in the FY2002 Defense and Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Act (P.L. 107-117). The Bureau of Reclamation manages over 600 dams in 17 western states, supplying water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. They are the largest water supplier in the region and the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. The Bureau of Reclamation is the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation and manages over 600 dams in 17 western states. For FY2003, the Administration requested $844.9 million in gross current authority, with a net current authority of $805.4 million after accounting for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund. The Water and Related Resources account, BOR's largest, requested $726.2 million for traditional programs and projects. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $844.9 million for FY2003, with $813.5 million approved in the final FY2003 bill. Funds for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program have not been appropriated since FY2000. The Administration requested $15 million for the CALFED program in FY2003, with the final bill providing $23 million for CVP activities supporting CALFED goals. The House recommended $2 million for local work on the Sites Reservoir feasibility. The Senate suggested $30 million for CVP activities aligning with CALFED objectives. The conference agreement allocated funding for various CALFED program activities, including investigations in the Upper San Joaquin watershed, the Environmental Water Account, planning for the Sites Reservoir, and evaluating the impacts of raising Shasta Dam. The bill also authorized feasibility studies for the Sites Reservoir, Los Vaqueros Reservoir enlargement, and an Upper San Joaquin Storage project. Additionally, the Bureau of Reclamation requested funding for safety and security efforts at its facilities. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $26.6 million for counterterrorism measures and security equipment for facilities. The House and Senate recommended $28.4 million for FY2003, which was appropriated in the final bill. The Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for DOE's programs, such as renewable energy research and environmental cleanup. The Administration's FY2003 request for DOE programs in the Energy and Water bill is $20.53 billion, which is $650 million more than the amount appropriated for FY2002. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $147 million over the Administration's request, while the Senate Appropriations Committee bill included funding of $20.96 billion. The final bill appropriated $20.89 billion. The final bill appropriated $20.89 billion for the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Title III: Department of Energy. The Senate recommended $448.1 million for the Renewable Energy Program, an increase of $41.1 million from the previous year. The House Appropriations Committee sought $396.0 million for the Renewable Energy Program, which was $11 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate report highlighted concerns about DOE's implementation of congressionally-directed activities and slow project execution. The House report criticized DOE for not providing quantitative measures to evaluate renewable energy technologies, leading to a lack of objective basis for proposed budget changes. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $422.3 million for DOE's Renewable Energy Program in the 108th Congress, providing $15.3 million more than requested and $26.3 million more than FY2002. In FY2003, the budget for DOE's Renewable Energy Program increased by $26.3 million compared to FY2002. This includes additional funding for Electric/Storage, Hydrogen, Wind, and Renewable American Indian Resources. Funding for Nuclear Energy programs also increased by $12 million above the FY2002 level, including support for Nuclear Power 2010 and Generation IV reactor designs. Additionally, funding was allocated for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative and the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative. The DOE's FY2003 budget justification highlighted nuclear energy as a key electricity source with minimal air emissions. However, critics argue that the nuclear research program provides unnecessary subsidies to a hazardous and economically uncompetitive industry. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a decrease in funding for nuclear energy programs, while the Senate Appropriations Committee suggested a higher budget, including funding for specific programs like the Fast Flux Test Facility and the Advanced Accelerator Applications program. The final bill recommended $324.1 million for nuclear energy programs, including activities from the Advanced Accelerator Applications program. The House panel suggested cutting the budget request to $41.5 million and shifting $5 million to the nuclear energy plant optimization program. The Senate voted to increase the budget to $48.5 million. The final omnibus bill provides $45 million for nuclear energy technologies, including the Nuclear Power 2010 program aimed at identifying barriers to new nuclear power plants deployment by 2010. DOE will seek proposals for joint DOE/industry teams for Generation IV technologies. The Administration's National Energy Policy report supports plutonium recovery from spent nuclear fuel to reduce environmental impact and increase energy supplies. However, opponents argue that separating plutonium poses environmental risks and undermines nuclear weapons proliferation policy. DOE requested $18 million for studying pyroprocessing technology and electrometallurgical treatment of spent fuel from the Experimental Breeder Reactor II in Idaho. No funding was requested for waste transmutation programs involving plutonium separation. The DOE announced on July 17, 2002, that advanced nuclear reactor and reprocessing technologies would be focused at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). The Senate proposed increasing funding for DOE's advanced nuclear fuel cycle activities to $77.9 million, including $18 million for EBR-II fuel treatment. The program will concentrate on developing advanced fuel cycles, recycling spent fuel, and transmutation technologies. The omnibus bill provided $58 million for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, including electrometallurgical treatment, accelerator transmutation, and reprocessing technologies. NERI received $25 million, while NEPO was allocated $5 million. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in various program areas. DOE is a major supporter of basic research and physical sciences. In FY2003, DOE requested $3.279 billion for Science, with increases for five programs and a reduction for biological and environmental research. The House recommended a $8 million reduction, the Senate recommended a $50 million increase, and P.L.108-7 provided $3.306 billion. The largest program, basic energy sciences, received $1.020 billion, including funding for the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The funding for the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in FY2002 was $276 million, with a planned construction schedule. The final bill provided $1.030 billion, including full funding for the project. The advanced scientific computing research program saw the largest percentage increase, with a final funding of $173 million. The final bill provided $173 million for the advanced scientific computing research program, with encouragement for additional funding in response to Japanese progress in supercomputing. The biological and environmental research program saw a reduction in funding to $504 million, mainly due to the completion of medical applications projects. The Genomes to Life project funding was requested to increase to $37 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended funding at the requested level, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase of $27 million. The Senate recommended an increase in funding for the Genomes to Life program and research on arsenic removal from water supplies. The final bill provided $530 million, including funding for arsenic removal research and medical applications projects. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding high-energy physics and nuclear physics at requested levels, with the final bill providing slightly higher amounts. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in the requested budget for fusion energy sciences and directed DOE to prepare an updated fusion program plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase in funding for fusion energy sciences, including an evaluation of the \"fast ignition\" concept. The final bill provided $727 million for fusion energy sciences, with additional funding for research on arsenic removal from water supplies and medical applications projects. The final bill called for an evaluation of the \"fast ignition\" concept by August 1, 2003, with additional funding provided by the Senate committee. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. The Stockpile Stewardship Program aims to maintain nuclear warheads without testing. In early 2002, there were indications of a potential shift in this approach. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons, preferably without testing. The Administration maintained its opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and continued to adhere to a testing moratorium. A request for $15 million was made to enhance \"nuclear test readiness\" to reduce the time between decision and test conduct. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated funds for test site readiness in the FY2003 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee recommended providing the requested amount for maintaining Nevada Test Site readiness. The final omnibus resolution included $60.0 million for Nevada Test Site readiness and $15.0 million for enhanced test readiness. The FY2003 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill allocated $60.0 million for maintaining Nevada Test Site readiness and $15.0 million for enhanced test readiness. The final bill, P.L. 108-7, contained $5,954.2 million for stockpile stewardship activities, including Directed Stockpile Work and Campaigns. The FY2003 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill allocated funds for various programs including Weapons Activities, Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors. The total FY2003 request for NNSA was $8,023.4 million, compared to $7,590.5 million appropriated for FY2002. The Senate bill and H.R. 5431 also allocated funds for these programs. The FY2003 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill allocated funds for various programs including Weapons Activities, Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors. Figures for H.R. 5431 and the final bill, P.L. 108-7, differ slightly. Stewardship activities primarily occur at the nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA and operated by contractors. Directed Stockpile Work (DSW) involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, refurbishment, and R&D for specific warheads. The FY2003 DSW request includes R&D for specific nuclear warheads such as W87 refurbishment, B61 mods 7/11 development, W80 life extension, and W76 refurbishment. NNSA plans to start production engineering for W80 and W76 in FY2003. A study for the \"Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator\" (RNEP) was also requested, aimed at destroying underground targets with less explosive yield. The Senate Armed Services Committee's FY2003 defense authorization bill did not allocate funds for RNEP but required a study on its military requirements and targets. The House Armed Services Committee's bill, H.R. 4546, fully funded the requested study on the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) but barred the obligation of FY2003 funds until the Department of Defense submitted the RNEP study proposed by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee bills provided the requested funding for RNEP in the final bill, P.L. 108-7. Additionally, there are 16 campaigns for focused scientific and engineering efforts for FY2003, such as Enhanced Surveillance. 16 campaigns for focused scientific and engineering efforts for FY2003 include Enhanced Surveillance, Advanced Design and Production Technologies, Advanced Simulation and Computing, and Tritium Readiness, with allocated funding for each. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification campaign aims to develop means of producing pits for nuclear warheads, which are essential for triggering the secondary stage. The United States has been unable to produce pits since 1989, hindering the creation of new nuclear warheads. This campaign supports pit projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory and includes R&D for pit production facilities. The Pit Manufacturing and Certification campaign at Los Alamos National Laboratory aims to develop means of producing pits for nuclear warheads. The R&D, procurement, and construction costs for the projects may total $5 billion over two decades. The FY2003 request was $194.5 million, including funds for manufacturing the pit for the W88 warhead and planning for a higher-capacity Modern Pit Facility. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the project for being behind schedule and over budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the pit project for being behind schedule and over budget, recommending increased funding to fully fund activities. NNSA plans to certify a W88 pit by FY 2009 without nuclear testing, aiming for an earlier date of FY 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $246.0 million for pit manufacturing and certification in FY2003. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $246.0 million for pit manufacturing and certification, an increase of $51.5 million over the request. The committee expressed concerns about NNSA's refusal to request funds consistent with its project plan, leading to budget reductions in other areas. The House Appropriations Committee provided the requested $194.5 million, while P.L. 108-7 allocated $222.0 million for pit manufacturing and certification. The NNSA is committed to producing a certifiable W88 pit by 2003 and a certified W88 pit by 2007. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is the world's largest laser and a key project for the stockpile stewardship program. NIF aims to solve weapons problems, attract top physicists, and advance fusion power research. Its top priority is achieving \"ignition\" through nuclear fusion of deuterium and tritium. The NIF Project faced cost overruns and schedule delays, requiring an additional $1 billion and several years to complete. Despite past technical issues, the project office claims it is now on track with no obstacles. The DOE estimated total project costs at $3,448.1 million for NIF in FY2003, but the Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns over changes in project scope. The campaign title shifted from \"Inertial Confinement Fusion and High Yield\" to \"High Energy Density Physics,\" raising questions about the project's direction. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the NIF Project's shift in focus from achieving ignition to generalized physics research. They were worried about potential reductions in laser beam testing criteria and down-scoping of the project. The Committee rejected this and emphasized that ignition remains the primary objective for NIF. Additionally, they added $35.0 million to the FY2003 request for essential equipment and technology. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $35.0 million to the FY2003 request for inertial confinement fusion, bringing the total to $487.3 million. The House Appropriations Committee provided $498.8 million and directed NNSA to re-establish ignition as the primary objective for the NIF. The final bill, P.L. 108-7, allocated $504.3 million for inertial confinement fusion, including $214.0 million for NIF construction. The request for funding for the nuclear weapons complex sites includes eight categories, with the largest being Operations of Facilities. Other significant categories include Program Readiness and Construction. Of particular interest is the Nuclear Weapons Incident Response element, for which funding was provided in the House and Senate bills. The funding for nuclear weapons complex sites includes Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, and Construction. The Nuclear Weapons Incident Response element received funding in the House and Senate bills for FY2003. Additionally, nonproliferation and national security programs support U.S. efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) received funding for nonproliferation and national security programs in FY2002 totaling $1.0266 billion, with an increase to $1.1136 billion in FY2003. The final bill, P.L.108-7, appropriated $1.1136 billion, with specific funding for the Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program at $283 million. The final bill, P.L.108-7, appropriated $283 million for the Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program in FY2003. Other programs, such as International Security and International Materials Protection, also received funding increases compared to previous years. In FY2003, funding for the Fissile Materials Disposition program in P.L. 108-7 was $448.0 million, with plans to convert surplus plutonium to reactor fuel at Savannah River, SC. Funding for Russian surplus materials disposition also increased to $98.0 million. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been responsible for managing environmental contamination from nuclear weapons production since the Cold War. The Environmental Management Program was established in 1989 to clean up defense nuclear waste and civilian nuclear energy research waste. DOE ensures the safety of radioactive sites and contaminated areas for future use. The Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination from nuclear weapons production and civilian nuclear energy research. There are 114 contaminated sites in 30 states, occupying 2.1 million acres. Cleanup activities have been completed at 75 sites at a cost of over $60 billion, with the expectation of completing cleanup at all sites. DOE has completed cleanup at 75 contaminated sites by the end of FY2002, costing over $60 billion. Cleanup at remaining sites, some of the most severely contaminated, may take 70 years and cost $220 billion. DOE aims to reduce costs by $50-100 billion through risk-based approaches, but past implementation has been criticized. The annual appropriations bill for Energy and Water Development funds cleanup and waste management activities at nuclear weapons sites. This includes the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Account, Defense Facilities Closure Projects Account, Defense Environmental Management Privatization Account, and Non-Defense Environmental Management Account. These accounts support cleanup projects under various contracting approaches. The Management Account funds cleanup and waste management activities at civilian nuclear energy research and development sites, while the Uranium Facilities Maintenance and Remediation Account funds the cleanup of uranium and thorium processing sites. The DOE initially requested $6.7 billion for these accounts in FY2003, with $800 million allocated to a new Environmental Management Cleanup Reform Account. This new account aimed to reduce risk, decrease cleanup costs, and accelerate cleanup schedules by reallocating funding from sites funded under the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Account. Funding would only be restored at these sites if compliance agreements with the EPA and states were re-negotiated. The DOE has re-negotiated cleanup schedules with the EPA and states to accelerate cleanup at various sites. Concerns were raised about potential weaker cleanup standards to avoid losing funds. Letters of intent have been signed to expedite cleanup at sites including Hanford, Oak Ridge, Idaho National Lab, Nevada Test Site, Savannah River, Pantex, Los Alamos, and Sandia National Labs. The President requested an additional $300 million in FY2003 for new cleanup agreements at Pantex in Texas, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on DOE's cleanup reform initiative, focusing on risk-oriented and efficient cleanup approaches without weakening compliance agreements. The General Accounting Office testified on the status of compliance agreements with EPA. The General Accounting Office (GAO) testified on DOE's challenges in prioritizing cleanup activities and potential changes in technology or approach that could reduce cleanup costs. Representatives from Washington, Idaho, and Tennessee stated that re-negotiating cleanup agreements would not weaken standards but establish new cleanup goals. The FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations resolution does not allocate funding to the proposed Environmental Management Cleanup Reform Account. Instead, it increases funding for the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Account by $926 million above the Administration's request to accelerate cleanup activities at DOE sites. Concerns were raised during the appropriations debate about providing an unallocated sum for the reform account. Section 315 of the final bill specifies that funding for environmental management activities cannot exceed certain limits at individual sites. The FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations resolution allocated nearly $7.0 billion for DOE's Environmental Management Program, consistent with the Administration's request. The Bush Administration sought a 40% increase in funding for civilian nuclear waste disposal for FY2003. The increased budget is primarily for preparing a construction permit application for a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. DOE plans to submit a 10,000-page application to NRC in late 2004. Additional funds are needed for detailed repository design work, performance studies, and transportation planning. With sufficient funding, waste can be received at the site by 2010. The House Appropriations Committee recommended the full Administration request, while the Senate recommended a cut to $336 million. The final omnibus bill provides $460 million. The final omnibus bill provides $460 million for the nuclear waste program, with Yucca Mountain named as the sole candidate site for a national geologic repository. President Bush recommended DOE to submit an application to NRC for the Yucca Mountain repository, which was initially blocked by Nevada Governor Guinn's \"notice of disapproval.\" However, a congressional approval resolution was signed into law, allowing the project to proceed to the licensing phase. The omnibus bill provides funding for the nuclear waste program from the Nuclear Waste Fund and defense nuclear waste disposal account. The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the deadline set by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Utilities have won court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet the deadline and compensate for damages. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to market excess power generated by dams and water projects operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The PMAs include Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Southeastern Power Administration (SEPA), Southwestern Power Administration (SWPA), and Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), selling power at wholesale rates to utilities and federal agencies. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power at wholesale rates to utilities and federal agencies. Priority is given to \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and co-ops. The PMAs do not own generating facilities but own transmission facilities. The 104th Congress debated divesting the PMAs, authorizing the sale of one in 1995. The Administration's FY2003 request for SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA was $197.4 million, a reduction from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $203.5 million for FY2003, including an additional $6.1 million for the Western Power Administration. BPA planned to borrow $630.8 million for various programs, requesting an additional $2 billion in borrowing authority which was not supported by Congress. The Administration also requested $700 million in borrowing authority for BPA. The Administration requested an additional $700 million in borrowing authority for BPA in the FY2003 budget request. Senator Craig submitted an amendment to add $700 million in borrowing authority, which was approved and enacted in the final measure, P.L. 108-7. BPA was directed to submit a detailed budget justification by project to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by March 30, 2003. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested a total budget of $585.0 million for FY2003, including $6.8 million for the NRC inspector general's office. The funding request would provide an increase of $25.3 million from FY2002. Major activities conducted by NRC include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors, licensing of nuclear waste facilities, and oversight of nuclear materials. The omnibus bill provides full funding for the NRC's FY2003 budget request, including $29.3 million for homeland security activities post-9/11. This funding is used for re-analyzing threats of radiological sabotage, physical protection requirements for nuclear facilities, procedures for authorizing access, and strengthening emergency preparedness. The NRC's FY2003 budget request includes increased funding for licensing new commercial reactors, with $24.8 million allocated for this purpose. This funding will be used for early site permits, pre-licensing reviews, and updating nuclear licensing infrastructure. The NRC's licensing program aligns with DOE's efforts to promote the construction of new nuclear reactors. The NRC's FY2003 budget request includes increased funding for licensing new commercial reactors, with $24.8 million allocated for this purpose. The NRC's licensing program aligns with DOE's efforts to promote the construction of new nuclear reactors. The FY2001 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill included an NRC proposal to phase down the agency's fee recovery to 90% over 5 years. 94% of the FY2003 NRC appropriation was to be offset by fees on licensees, with exceptions for waste repository licensing and homeland security. The omnibus appropriations bill includes an extension of the Price-Anderson Act nuclear incident liability system through December 31, 2003, with a 94% offset requirement for homeland security funding. The proposed 15-year extension was not enacted due to incomplete energy conference agreement. The short extension does not change any other provisions in the Price-Anderson Act. The Price-Anderson Act limits liability for nuclear-related damages for commercial reactors and DOE contractors. The Act was extended through December 31, 2003, with a 94% offset requirement for homeland security funding. New reactors licensed after August 1, 2002, would not have been covered without the extension. The Price-Anderson Act was extended through December 31, 2004 to prevent any new DOE contracts from using alternate indemnification authority. This extension had little short-term effect on the nuclear power industry.
