    "content": "The 1997 Kyoto Protocol set emissions objectives for countries, leading to the implementation of strategies like the EU's emissions trading scheme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's Emissions Trading System covers over 10,000 energy-intensive facilities across its member countries. The EU's Emissions Trading System covers more than 10,000 energy-intensive facilities across 27 EU Member countries, accounting for 40%-45% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. The program does not include CO2 emissions from the transportation sector or non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Phase 1 ran from 2005 to 2007, Phase 2 started in 2008, and Phase 3 has been finalized. The EU's Emissions Trading System, covering over 10,000 energy-intensive facilities in 27 EU Member countries, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Phase 1 ran from 2005 to 2007, Phase 2 started in 2008, and Phase 3 began in 2013 under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU-15 agreed to reduce emissions by 8% from 1990 levels, with the EU-ETS directive entering into force in 2003. The second phase aims to achieve 3.3 percentage points of the required reduction, with the overall emissions cap set at 2.08 billion metric tons of CO2 annually for the EU-27 during the Kyoto compliance period. The EU's Emissions Trading System aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with Phase 2 starting in 2008 under the Kyoto Protocol. The European Commission believes Phase 1 prepared the community for achieving reduction requirements. Phase 1 established critical infrastructure for the emission market, improving emissions data infrastructure for Phase 2 implementation. The ETS also helped jump-start project-based mechanisms. The ETS helped jump-start project-based mechanisms like CDM and JI under the Kyoto Protocol. External credits from the Linking Directive invigorated CO2 reduction projects in developing countries, especially in China and India. Phase 1 had a significant impact on corporate behavior, with many firms incorporating the value of allowances into their decision-making processes, particularly in the electric utility sector. The ETS influenced future pricing decisions and long-term decision-making across industries. Issues like allocation, new entrant reserves, and EU expansion were contentious during Phase 2. Lessons from Phase 1 and 2 led to a different approach in Phase 3. The effectiveness of Phase 1 in achieving emissions reductions remains unclear due to the dynamic nature of emissions. Each EU Member State developed emissions baselines to capture future trends. During the first phase of the EU emissions baseline development, countries projected future emissions trends based on factors like energy and greenhouse gas policies. Uncertainties in data collection, monitoring methods, and economic growth rates led to inflated projections. The uncertainties in economic growth assumptions led to inflated business as usual baselines during the 2005-2007 trading period. Despite modest reduction requirements, emissions allocations were higher than actual 2005 emissions, raising doubts about the real reductions achieved. Verified emissions in 2005 were 3.4% below the estimated baseline, with persistently high allowance prices indicating some abatement efforts. Ellerman and Buchner noted that the high EU emissions allowance prices suggest a presumption of abatement. During Phase 1 of EU emissions trading, EU emissions allowances (EUAs) did not hold their value, becoming worthless in the final six months of 2007 due to limited transferability to Phase 2. Despite this, there were anecdotal evidence of power companies incorporating EUA prices into dispatch decisions to shift generation to less emitting plants, suggesting some abatement efforts. Only Poland and France allowed limited banking of allowances in Phase 1. The European Commission restricted the use of Phase 1 EUAs in Phase 2, rendering excess EUAs worthless by the end of 2007. Scarcity in Phase 2 EUAs led to stable prices until the 2008-2009 recession. Prices in 2010 ranged from 13-16 euros as the European economy slowly recovered, showing improvements in the Phase 2 system. The more predictable 2009-2010 market response in Phase 2 reflects improvements in the system, with the European Commission using more verifiable data for certification. Ex post adjustments were rejected to avoid disrupting the marketplace. Market development is ongoing, but remains somewhat volatile. Additional emissions reductions are needed to meet Kyoto Protocol targets, with the EU-15 already below base-year emissions in 2008. The EU-15 has shown a continuation of emissions reductions over the past five years, but existing measures are projected to be insufficient to meet Kyoto Protocol requirements. Further reduction actions are planned to achieve an overall reduction of 8.5% compared to baseline levels. Additional reduction credits are expected from activities permitted under the Kyoto Protocol. The EU-15 is projected to exceed its Kyoto commitment by about 3.5 percentage points through various reduction measures. The EU-27 as a whole is expected to be 9.6% below Kyoto baseline levels by 2010, with potential further reductions if additional measures are implemented. 24 out of 25 countries with reduction requirements are projected to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, with only Austria falling short. The EU-15 is projected to exceed its Kyoto commitment by about 3.5 percentage points through various reduction measures. Seven EU-15 member countries are already in compliance with their 2008-2012 target. Total EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 were 4.94 billion metric tons, a drop of 11.3% from 1990 levels. The European Union aims to achieve a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. The EU is working on reshaping the ETS for Phase 3 to achieve a 21% reduction from covered entities. The proposed EU-wide ETS cap for Phase 3 is set at 2,032,998,912 allowances, subject to revisions based on new information. The EC envisions a linear reduction in the ETS cap to match the overall 20% reduction program. The EU is planning structural changes for Phase 3 of the ETS to improve efficiency and address issues from previous phases. Phase 2 focused on harmonizing emissions inventories and imposing uniform rules, but struggled with differences in allocation schemes among Member States. In Phase 3, the EU plans to eliminate National Allocation Plans (NAPs) and implement EU-wide rules for allowance availability, allocations, and auctions to meet Kyoto obligations. The EU is planning structural changes for Phase 3 of the ETS to improve efficiency and address issues from previous phases. In Phase 3, National Allocation Plans (NAPs) will be replaced with an EU-wide cap and fully harmonized rules for allowance allocations, auctions, and compliance with Kyoto obligations. The EC proposed a Directive to alter the EU-ETS structure for Phase 3 in January 2008, which was adopted in April 2009. Allowances were allocated free to participating entities in Phases 1 and 2, with limited auctioning. The political challenge lies in transitioning to significant auctioning due to opposition from covered entities. The free allocation of allowances in the EU ETS has been criticized for creating windfall profits and economic distortions. Despite concerns, there was little change in allocation philosophy for Phase 2, with most countries not proposing auctions at all. Governments' reluctance to use auctions as an allocation mechanism is due to equity considerations. The EU ETS has faced opposition to auctioning allowances due to concerns about economic performance, international competitiveness, and equity. However, Phase 3 implemented harmonized rules for auctioning, stating it as the basic principle for allocation to eliminate windfall profits and ensure fair competition. The EU compromised to provide some free allocation of allowances during Phase 3 starting in 2013, with most covered industries eligible for this. Full auctioning will begin in 2013 for the power sector, with most electric powerplants receiving no free allocation. Certain eastern European Member States can receive a temporary derogation from this requirement if they meet specific criteria. Under the optional allocation scheme, Member States can allocate allowances equal to 70% of a powerplant's Phase 1 emissions free, declining to zero by 2020. The auction schedule for other covered entities is more gradual, with 80% of allocation provided free in 2013, decreasing linearly to 30% by 2020 and zero by 2027. Transitional system for other sectors covered by the Community scheme allocates 80% free in 2013, decreasing annually to 30% in 2020, aiming for no free allocation by 2027. EU carbon policies are a concern. Exceptions to the phase-out of free allowances in 2027 will be made in sectors at risk of carbon leakage. Distribution of auctioned allowances by Member States is determined by a three-part formula, with 88% based on historic emissions, 10% on GDP per capita, and 2% on past greenhouse gas reductions in certain countries. The EC finalized an Auction Regulation in November 2010. The EC finalized an Auction Regulation in November 2010 to coordinate auctions of allowances during Phase 3. The rule establishes a central platform for majority of allowances auction starting in 2013, with the option for members to set up their own platforms. Auctions will be on a spot basis, using a single-round, sealed bid, uniform price format held at least weekly. Participants include facility operators, regulated firms, and intermediaries. Provisions are included to address anti-competitive behavior and market abuse. The EU Directive on the EU-ETS addresses potential anti-competitive behavior and market abuse. It mandates that at least 50% of auction proceeds should fund climate change activities. Free allowances are allocated to new entrants for equity reasons and to prevent Member States from being disadvantaged in competition. The EU Directive on the EU-ETS mandates that at least 50% of auction proceeds should fund climate change activities. Free allowances are allocated to new entrants for equity reasons, trumping concerns about economic efficiency. The size and distribution of this subsidy is determined by individual Member States, with varying reserves set aside for new entrants in Phase 1 and Phase 2. This decision adds complexity to allocation plans and influences investment decisions of covered entities. Countries did not harmonize new entrant reserve rules with respect to size during Phase 1 or 2, leading to a lack of standardization in dispensing allowances and replenishing reserves. Member States use different formulas for determining new entrant allowances, often based on benchmarking, but the definitions and application of benchmarks vary among countries. Under Phase 3 of the Directive, there will be an EU-wide cap of 5% for new entrant reserves and harmonization of allocation rules. The EC will adopt a harmonized rule for new entrant definitions by December 31, 2010, excluding new electricity production. EU-wide benchmarks for free allowance allocation will be determined based on the top 10% most efficient installations in the EU from 2007-2008. Up to 300 million allowances in the new entrants' reserve will be available for CCS development until 2015. Draft rules for harmonized free allocation of allowances through benchmarks were proposed by the EC on December 15th, 2010. Benchmarks represent the threshold for receiving free allocations for specific facilities, based on the average greenhouse gas performance of the top 10% best performing installations in the EU. The benchmarks are developed per product, with the principle of 'one product = one benchmark'. Most studies of the competitiveness impacts of the ETS during Phase 1 have found no impact. The lack of leakage in sectors like steel, cement, aluminum, and refineries was due to free allocation of allowances and long-term electricity contracts. Rising electricity prices were softened by these factors, and the general increase in prices for products subject to carbon costs blurred any significant changes in trade flows and production patterns. The short-term impact of carbon costs on industry competitiveness is unclear due to free allocation of emissions allowances and long-term electricity contracts. The effects of the ETS on investment location decisions are not fully observable yet. Phase 3 of the ETS provides assistance to energy-intensive industries to address emissions control costs. Companies find it difficult to quantify the effects on their bottom line in the initial phase. The EC published a list of installations at risk of carbon leakage in December 2009, listing 164 industrial sectors. Eligible installations will receive allowances to cover 100% of their emissions if using efficient technology. The EC was to review its decision by June 30, 2010. The European Parliament and Council are considering proposals to address the situation regarding carbon leakage. The EC consultations suggest no changes are needed to the Directive. Member States may provide assistance to industries affected by higher electricity prices due to indirect emissions control costs. Support should be granted only when necessary and proportionate to maintain energy-saving incentives. The EU-ETS has a flexibility mechanism called Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) credits under the Kyoto Protocol, which has been controversial due to the \"supplementarity\" requirement. Developed countries must ensure their use of JI/CDM credits is supplemental to their own domestic control efforts. The EC used 10% of a country's allowance allocation as a rule of thumb for defining supplementarity in Phase 2, resulting in significant reductions in some countries' proposed limits. The EU-ETS bans the use of LULUCF credits and proposes a ban on credits from certain industrial gases in Phase 3. This ban targets projects that destroy HFC-23 and N2O, with 23 projects in China and other developing countries generating two-thirds of CDM credits. The EU ETS bans certain industrial gas credits in Phase 3, targeting projects in China and other developing countries. Companies can use CDM or JI credits for 2012 compliance but not thereafter. Phase 3 allows up to 50% of required reductions to be achieved through these credits, totaling 1.6 billion credits over eight years. Limits on Kyoto credits use are based on facility allocations or verified emissions. Existing facilities can use a minimum of 11% of their 2008-2012 allocation for Phase 3 compliance. New entrants and sectors have different criteria for credit use. Phase 3 of the EU ETS will allocate 11% of 2008-2012 allowances to existing facilities, with new entrants and sectors able to use a minimum of 4.5% of verified emissions during 2013-2020. Banking will be extended to prevent price collapses, and the trading period will increase to eight years for stability. Additional mechanisms will address price volatility and protect against insider dealing. The Directive allows for proposals to ensure protection of the environment, including measures to address high allowance prices. The coverage of industries in the ETS remains the same for Phase 2, except for aviation which will be included in two phases. The European Parliament included all intra-EU and international flights in the ETS starting in 2012, capping emissions at 97% of average 2004-2006 levels. 85% of allowances were allocated free to operators, with a reduction to 95% in 2013. The ETS expanded to include sectors like petrochemicals, ammonia, and aluminum, as well as nitrous oxide and perofluorocarbon emissions. This increased covered emissions by 4.6% in Phase 3, with further coverage expected to increase by 40-50 million metric tons. The EU Directive aims to increase ETS coverage by 40-50 million metric tons. Small installations emitting less than 25,000 metric tons annually may be subject to other control regimes. The US is not part of the Kyoto Protocol and has less stringent emission reduction proposals compared to the EU Directive. The EU gained valuable experience through five years of carbon emissions trading, highlighting the importance of a credible emissions inventory for a functioning cap-and-trade program. The lack of credible EU-wide data led to the collapse of the ETS Phase 1 allowance market in 2006. In the United States, Section 821 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments requires monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions from electric generating facilities. The EPA regulations require owners and operators of affected facilities to monitor carbon dioxide emissions through continuous emission monitoring (CEM) or fuel analysis. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule was promulgated in 2009 to expand reporting requirements for facilities. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, established in 2009, expanded reporting requirements for facilities to report greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA annually. Certain categories of sources must report emissions if they emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. The EU restricted Phase 1 ETS coverage to six sectors, increasing compliance costs compared to a comprehensive trading program. Adding new sectors to an existing trading program has proven to be challenging. The EU aims to expand the coverage of the ETS by adding new sectors, but the process has been difficult. Phase 1 did not include any new sectors, and Phase 2 only added aviation in the last year. Phase 3 will expand coverage, but still fewer sectors than most U.S. cap-and-trade proposals, which typically cover 80% to 100% of greenhouse gas emissions. Disagreements in U.S. proposals center on the inclusion of the agricultural sector and smaller sources, with some bills giving EPA discretion to exempt sources based on various considerations. The second category of bills focuses on the electric utility industry, which accounts for about 33% of U.S. greenhouse gases. These bills are less comprehensive than the ETS and may include additional controls on non-greenhouse gas pollutants like mercury. The phased-in approach may be reasonable if one believes that starting with the electric utility sector is cost-effective and that there is time to eventually add other sectors. The ETS experience suggests that setting up a tradeable allowance system is similar to establishing a new currency. The free allocation scheme in the ETS has led to windfall profits for allowance recipients, particularly in the power industry. This has sparked controversy and debate. The emissions trading scheme has allowed plant operators to mark up electricity prices to include the value of allowances. However, the free allocation of allowances in Phase 1 and 2 has created perverse incentives and distortions in the market. The expansion of auctions in Phase 3 could simplify allocations and allow market forces to play a greater role. The expansion of auctions in Phase 3 of the ETS could simplify allocations and allow market forces to influence compliance strategies more fully. Most countries did not use auctions during Phase 1 and auctions were limited in Phase 2. Efforts to increase auctions faced opposition from industry groups but gained support from environmental groups and economists. The Phase 3 plan to increase auctioning through 2020 will be a significant development for the scheme. U.S. cap-and-trade proposals include provisions for auctions, with a target of 66%-100% of total allowances to be auctioned. The U.S. cap-and-trade proposals aim to auction 66%-100% of total allowances to fund programs for new technologies. Industry groups oppose auctions, similar to the situation in the EU ETS. Congress may need to specify auction requirements to fully incorporate market economics into compliance decisions. Despite EU rhetoric, Phase 2 of the ETS embraced project credits, increasing flexibility for facilities. The embracing of project credits in Phase 2 of the EU ETS will increase flexibility for facilities in meeting reduction targets. Market mechanisms like banking will reduce compliance costs and allowance price volatility. Phase 1 did not provide useful information on the value of these mechanisms, resulting in extreme price volatility. Phase 2 will be the real test for creating a stable allowance market. Phase 2 of the ETS is testing mechanisms for a stable allowance market, showing signs of maturity but still volatile. Phase 3 introduces new mechanisms to address volatility. U.S. cap-and-trade proposals aim for stability through various tools like banking and offsets, with some including a price ceiling or a Carbon Market Efficiency Board. Some proposals aim to stabilize allowance markets by introducing mechanisms like a Carbon Market Efficiency Board and strategic reserves auctions. Concerns exist about speculation and manipulation in allowance markets, with a link observed between allowance prices and oil/natural gas prices. The linkage between allowance price changes and price changes in commodities markets raises concerns about market manipulation, prompting the Directive to require the EC to examine current protections. Congress may need to consider enhancing regulatory authority over financial instruments like options and futures contracts."
