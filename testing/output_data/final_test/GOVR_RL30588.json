    "content": "Afghanistan's modern history began with the 1747 foundation of the Durrani Empire by Ahmad Shah Durrani. After the collapse of the empire in 1823, Dost Muhammad Khan emerged as a strong ruler, becoming the emir of Afghanistan and founding the Barakzai dynasty. Afghanistan served as a buffer between the Russian and British empires in the nineteenth century. The British and Russian empires engaged in a strategic \"Great Game\" for control over Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. This rivalry led to three Anglo-Afghan wars from 1839 to 1919, with Afghan rulers seeking support from Russia. King Amanullah Khan gained independence from Britain in 1919 after launching attacks in the Third Anglo-Afghan War. He was known as a secular modernizer who included all ethnic minorities in his government. King Mohammad Nadir Shah reasserted Barakzai rule after a brief seizure of power by an ethnic Tajik, succeeding King Habibullah Kalakani. His son, Mohammad Zahir Shah, became the last king of Afghanistan in 1933. Zahir Shah is remembered for promulgating a constitution in 1964 that established a national legislature and promoting freedoms for women. Seeking U.S. support to counterbalance the Soviet Union, Afghanistan played the Cold War rivals off each other to win military and development assistance. The Soviets built infrastructure projects like the Salang Tunnel and Bagram airfield, while the U.S. provided agricultural and development assistance. In the 1970s, Afghanistan's instability began with the overthrow of King Zahir Shah by his cousin Mohammad Daoud, who established a dictatorship. Daoud was later overthrown and killed in a coup led by PDPA leaders Taraki and Amin. In September 1979, a coup led by Amin, a leader from the Khalq faction of the PDPA, sparked rebellion by Islamic parties. The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, replacing Amin with Babrak Karmal, leader of the Parcham faction. Soviet occupation forces numbered about 120,000, supported by DRA military forces and tribal militias. The mujahedin, supported by U.S. weapons, were well organized and coordinated by seven major parties forming a government-in-exile known as the \"Afghan Interim Government\" in Peshawar. The mujahedin, supported by U.S. weapons including \"Stingers,\" were effective in shooting down Soviet aircraft, leading to mounting Soviet losses. The decision to provide these weapons was made in 1985 after debate within the Reagan Administration. Soviet losses in the Afghan war led to domestic opposition, with about 13,400 soldiers killed. Mikhail Gorbachev replaced Karmal with Najibullah Ahmedzai in 1986. The Geneva Accords in 1988 required Soviet withdrawal by February 1989. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 reduced support for communist regimes, leading to efforts for a political settlement in Afghanistan. The United States provided about $3 billion in economic and covert military assistance to the Afghan mujahedin from 1980 until the end of the Soviet occupation in 1989. The Soviet pullout in 1989 was seen as a U.S. victory, leading to a reduction in subsequent covert funding. U.S. assistance to Afghanistan remained low due to a lack of support for rebuilding the country's economy. The U.S. closed its embassy in Kabul in January 1989 and did not reopen it until later. In January 1989, the Soviet Union completed its pullout from Afghanistan, but Najibullah still had Soviet support until 2001. Despite expectations, his government did not collapse immediately after the Soviet withdrawal. However, his position weakened when Soviet support was cut off on January 1, 1992. Najibullah agreed to step down in March 1992, leading to the fall of his regime and the start of the mujahedin regime on April 18, 1992. The fall of Najibullah in April 1992 exposed rifts among the mujahedin parties. Sibghatullah Mojadeddi briefly served as president before Rabbani took over in June 1992. Rabbani's refusal to step down in December 1994 led to opposition from other mujahedin leaders, including Gulbuddin Hikmatyar. Despite an agreement for Hikmatyar to serve as Prime Minister, mutual mistrust prevented him from formally taking office, leading to continued fighting. In 1993-1994, Afghan Islamic clerics and students formed the Taliban movement, disillusioned with conflict among mujahedin parties. The Taliban's leader, Mullah Muhammad Umar, was a former fighter in Khalis's Hezb-i-Islam party. Most senior figures in the Taliban regime were Ghilzai Pashtuns. The Taliban viewed the Rabbani government as weak, corrupt, and anti-Pashtun. The Taliban, led by Mullah Muhammad Umar, gained popular support due to the civil war between mujahedin groups. They took control of Qandahar in 1994 and captured Herat province in 1995. By September 1996, the Taliban seized Kabul, leading to the withdrawal of Rabbani and Masoud to the Panjshir Valley. The Taliban, under Mullah Umar's leadership, gained popular support during the civil war. They captured Kabul in 1996 and imposed strict Islamic customs, including harsh punishments and restrictions on women's rights. The Taliban's Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue enforced these practices through physical punishments. In March 2001, they destroyed Buddha statues. The Taliban blew up Buddha statues in Bamiyan in 2001 and faced international pressure to end discrimination against women. The Clinton Administration engaged with the Taliban but did not recognize them as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Women's rights groups opposed recognizing the Taliban government. In May 1999, the Senate-passed S.Res. 68 urged the President not to recognize an oppressive Afghan government. The Clinton Administration focused on pressuring the Taliban to extradite Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden after the 1998 embassy bombings. U.S. sanctions were imposed on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan to achieve this goal. The United States fired cruise missiles at Al Qaeda training camps in eastern Afghanistan in 1998. The Clinton Administration missed opportunities to strike Bin Laden, citing lack of domestic and international support for military intervention against the Taliban. Afghan factions allied with the anti-Taliban opposition, forming the \"Northern Alliance\" led by key figures like Uzbeks/General Dostam. Figures like Uzbeks/General Dostam and Hazara Shiites are key players in Afghan politics. General Dostam, a prominent Uzbek militia leader, initially opposed Rabbani but later joined the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. Hazara Shiites, mainly found in central Afghanistan, are represented by the Hizb-e-Wahdat militia. Pashtun Islamists like Sayyaf are also influential in the region. Mohammad Mohaqeq is a prominent Hazara faction leader, while Abd-i-Rab Rasul Sayyaf leads a conservative Islamist mujahedin faction among the Pashtuns in the Northern Alliance. The Bush Administration considered aiding anti-Taliban Pashtuns and applying pressure on the Taliban. In February 2001, the State Department ordered the closure of the Taliban representative office in New York. In March 2001, the Bush Administration engaged with Pakistan to reduce support for the Taliban. Despite receiving support from Iran, Russia, and India, the Taliban continued to gain control of Afghanistan, reaching 75% of the country by September 11, 2001. The Northern Alliance suffered a setback when Ahmad Shah Masoud was assassinated by Al Qaeda operatives. After the September 11 attacks, the Bush Administration decided to militarily overthrow the Taliban for harboring terrorists, seeking U.N. backing for military action. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1368 expressed readiness for necessary steps in response to the attacks, widely seen as authorization for military action. In response to the September 11 attacks, Congress authorized military force against those responsible, leading to the start of major combat in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. The U.S. initially used air-strikes and special operations forces to target Taliban and Al Qaeda forces. In October 2001, U.S. Marines were deployed to pressure the Taliban at Qandahar, leading to the unraveling of the Taliban regime. The Northern Alliance forces entered Kabul on November 12, 2001, followed by the Taliban losing control of the south and east to U.S.-supported Pashtun leaders. The Taliban regime ended completely on December 9, 2001, with U.S. and Afghan forces conducting \"Operation Anaconda\" in March 2002. Major combat was declared over on May 1, 2003. After the Taliban regime was deposed in 2001, the U.S. and its international partners aimed to build a strong, democratic Afghan central government, supported by the United Nations. The Obama Administration's strategy review in 2009 focused on preventing terrorism safe havens in Afghanistan, while also continuing the nation-building efforts. Building Afghan governance capacity and reform have been crucial for U.S. policy success, even after the 2014 security transition to Afghan lead. The 2014 U.S.-brokered leadership partnership in Afghanistan between President Ashraf Ghani and CEO Dr. Abdullah Abdullah faced difficulties, with Abdullah accusing Ghani of acting unilaterally. Despite tensions, the two have since met to resolve their differences, and the National Unity Government (NUG) remains intact. The NUG in Afghanistan faced challenges due to differences over cabinet appointments, leading to delays. In April 2016, appointments were made for provincial governorships and major ambassadorships. The Interior Minister and Attorney General were confirmed, but the Defense Minister appointment remained unresolved. In May 2015, Masoom Stanekzai, an ethnic Pashtun, was nominated as Defense Minister but was voted down in June 2015. He later became the Intelligence Director. In May 2016, General Abdullah Habibi was nominated as Defense Minister and confirmed in July 2016. However, both Habibi and Stanekzai faced challenges, with Habibi resigning after a Taliban infiltration in April 2017. The Afghan military base in Mazar-e-Sharif was infiltrated in April 2017. General Tariq Shah Bahrami is the acting Minister of Defense. The government under NUG has been more active in addressing corruption issues, including enforcing court punishments for the Kabul Bank scandal. President Ghani has established a High Council for the Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption, with U.S. support, to combat corruption. These efforts were praised by U.S. Special Representative Richard Olson in 2016. In September 2016, the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reported that Afghanistan's anti-corruption body, the High Office of Oversight, lacks independence and capability. There are concerns about increasing fragmentation along ethnic and ideological lines, with high-profile attacks targeting the Hazara minority. Vice President Dostam has been involved in violent incidents and has threatened an armed challenge against the National Unity Government. Vice President Dostam's actions suggest taking advantage of government weakness, including accusations of violence against a political rival. President Ghani's focus on governance principles may contribute to ethnic fragmentation. Dostam's departure to Turkey in 2017 raised speculation about evading justice, with his return to Afghanistan blocked by the government. The formation of a new coalition called the \"Coalition for the Salvation of Afghanistan\" was announced by senior government officials, including Vice President Dostam's Uzbek-majority Junbish-e-Milli party. The coalition urged President Ghani to implement political reforms and challenged his authority amidst public discontent. The Uprising for Change Movement and Mehwar-e Mardom-e Afghanistan have emerged as anti-government groups in Afghanistan, calling for reforms and criticizing the current government. The Uprising for Change Movement protested after a deadly bombing in Kabul, while Mehwar criticizes the National Unity Government for not meeting election conditions. Former president Karzai is associated with Mehwar and is a vocal critic of the government. Karzai, a vocal critic of the National Unity Government, aims to potentially return to power by holding a traditional loya jirga. This assembly could lead to unpredictable outcomes, including the replacement of the current government and the selection of new leadership. Karzai and his allies may seek to engineer his return as leader through this meeting. Karzai and his allies may aim to engineer his return as leader through a traditional loya jirga. The NUG's intended five-year duration has been criticized by Abdullah supporters, who see it as opposing government restructuring. The holding of a constitutional loya jirga is contingent on parliamentary and district elections, which have not been held yet in post-Taliban Afghanistan. The deadline for new parliamentary elections set by the IEC in January 2016 was not met, leading to the establishment of a commission on election reform. Ghani accepted 7 of its 10 recommendations, but they were voted down by the lower house of parliament. In late 2016, a new IEC and ECC were appointed, and an election law was enacted to facilitate parliamentary and district elections scheduled for July 7, 2018. However, due to delays and contention among electoral commissioners, there are doubts about meeting the timeline. Some suggest delaying district council elections to address broader issues of local governance before holding them. The U.S. and international civilian institutions have helped build the capacity of the Afghan government, including reopening the U.S. embassy in Kabul in late 2001. The position of U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan is currently unfilled, with plans to nominate John Bass. The Obama Administration established the position of \"Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan\" in 2009, which was reportedly slated for elimination by the Trump administration. The Trump administration considered eliminating the position of Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, but Secretary Tillerson announced that Alice Wells would serve as acting SRAP. The civilian presence in Afghanistan expanded from 2009 to 2014, with staff levels dropping by 20% by December 2014. Currently, there are 568 U.S. direct hires and 1,500 U.S. contractors supporting U.S. Embassy operations in Afghanistan. The State Department and USAID have a significant presence in Afghanistan, with 568 U.S. direct hires and 1,500 U.S. contractors supporting operations. Despite plans for new consulates in cities like Mazar-e-Sharif being abandoned due to security concerns, U.S. policy aims to establish human rights institutions and promote adherence to international standards in Afghanistan. The 2016 State Department report on Afghanistan highlights human rights deficiencies attributed to lack of security, corruption, and cultural attitudes. Reports mention torture, rape, and abuses by officials and security forces. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission oversees human rights practices but is criticized for lack of independence. Afghan organizations demand transparency on human rights issues. Groups in Afghanistan, such as the Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organization and Equality for Peace and Democracy, advocate for transparency on human rights issues. Traditional bodies like the National Ulema Council, consisting of 150 clerics, hold conservative views on free expression and social freedoms. They sometimes ban performances deemed inconsistent with Islamic values, but some rock bands have been allowed to perform since 2011. Islamist conservatives hold significant power in the country. Since 2011, some rock bands have been allowed to perform high-profile shows in Afghanistan despite the influence of Islamist conservatives. Alcohol is becoming harder to find due to conservative beliefs, but it is still available for non-Muslims. There are reports of intimidation and violence against journalists critical of the government, with some news organizations being shut down. Women's groups play a significant role in Afghan civil society, with expanded freedoms and representation in government. The Afghan government is committed to promoting gender equality through the National Action Plan for Women of Afghanistan. The Mutual Accountability Framework in Afghanistan requires implementation of the NAPWA and past commitments to strengthen women's rights. The Ministry of Women's Affairs, formed in 2002, promotes awareness of relevant laws and oversees women's shelters. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act authorized funding for the Ministry, and the US continues to support it. The Afghanistan Women's Network is a prominent civil society group with 3,500 members. The Afghanistan Women's Network has 3,500 members and oversees 125 NGOs. Afghan human rights groups focus on women's rights, with notable progress in women's participation in jobs and government roles. Women make up 22% of the civil service, 1.4% of the ANDSF, and over one-third of CDC seats. There are over 260 female judges and hundreds of female journalists in the country. Despite gains in women's rights since 2001, abuses such as forced marriages and denial of educational and employment opportunities persist in Afghanistan due to conservative traditions. Women are legally allowed to drive and some no longer wear the burqa for protection. Women in rural areas are making progress through agricultural cooperatives. Despite some progress in women's rights in Afghanistan since 2001, abuses like forced marriages and denial of opportunities persist. The practice of baad, where women are given away to settle disputes, remains common. There is no law against sexual harassment, and women can be jailed for various reasons under the penal code. Women's rights activists have been assassinated, and honor killings are punished lightly. In 2009, President Karzai issued the \"Elimination of Violence Against Women\" law to address these issues. The \"Elimination of Violence Against Women\" (EVAW) law in Afghanistan has led to increased convictions for abuses against women. Despite the decree, only a small percentage of violence reports are registered with the judicial system, and the number of women jailed for \"moral crimes\" has risen by 50% since 2011. Efforts to enact the EVAW law have faced opposition from Islamic conservatives. President Ghani has shown support for women's rights by highlighting his wife's support. President Ghani has made efforts to support women's rights in Afghanistan by appointing females to key positions, including a nomination to the Supreme Court and two female governors. The government regulates religious practices through the Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs, with around 50,000 government-funded mosques promoting the government's views through paid clerics. There are around 5,000 clerics in Afghanistan, out of an estimated 300,000 nationwide. Minority religions face discrimination, with Baha'is being declared blasphemous in 2007. Afghan Christians worship in private homes, facing harsh punishments for conversion. There are four unused synagogues and three active gurdwaras for Sikhs. The Hazaras and other Afghan Shiites tend to be less religious and more socially open than their co-religionists in Iran. Afghan Shiite leaders appreciated the enactment of a \"Shiite Personal Status Law\" in July 2009, giving Afghan Shiites equal recognition as the Sunni majority. Afghan Shiites can openly celebrate their holidays, but some Pashtuns have become resentful, leading to clashes. The Shiite community has been targeted by ISKP, and Afghanistan was ranked as \"Tier 2\" in the State Department Trafficking in Persons Report for 2017. In 2017, Afghanistan improved its ranking in the State Department Trafficking in Persons Report to \"Tier 2\" due to increased efforts in combating trafficking, including law enforcement and victim protection measures. However, the report highlights the trafficking of women from China, Africa, Iran, and Central Asia into Afghanistan for sexual exploitation, with some families selling their children for forced prostitution. Afghanistan also faces internal trafficking issues, including the practice of bacha bazi. The Obama Administration's goal in Afghanistan was to prevent terrorist organizations from regaining safe haven. President Trump's strategy focused on a conditions-based approach, avoiding timelines and public discussion of troop levels. Reports indicate the practice of bacha bazi and women turning to prostitution due to economic hardship. The President's strategy in Afghanistan emphasizes pressure on Pakistan to deny safe haven to militants and rejects past nation-building efforts. Challenges to stability include small security forces in rural areas, logistical shortfalls, safe havens in Pakistan, civilian casualties backlash, and public dissatisfaction with governance. Multiple insurgent groups in Afghanistan are generally allied. U.S. rules of engagement allow for operations against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The U.S. rules of engagement in Afghanistan have evolved to allow operations against various militant groups, including Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the Taliban. The rules were loosened in June 2016 to expand battlefield authorities, with President Trump further expanding them in August 2017. General Nicholson praised the new rules as instrumental to their successes, while the specific groups targeted under the expanded authorities remain a subject of speculation. The Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan is primarily led by the Taliban movement. After the death of Mullah Umar in 2013, Akhtar Mohammad Mansour took over but was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2016. Haibatullah Akhunzadeh was then selected as the new Taliban leader. The group also announced two deputies: Mullah Yaqub and Sirajuddin Haqqani. Non-Pashtun Taliban factions have also been reported, including Tajik or Uzbek anti-government groups. Non-Pashtun anti-government groups in northern Afghanistan are aligning with the Taliban, with reports of increased recruitment efforts among non-Pashtun populations. The rise of an Islamic State affiliate poses a challenge to the Taliban's recruitment strategy among non-Pashtuns. The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, TTP) is facing internal challenges. The Pakistani Taliban (TTP) is facing internal challenges due to infighting and leadership succession issues. Some TTP fighters have defected to join the Islamic State in Taliban-controlled areas on the Afghan side of the border. Osama bin Laden relocated to Afghanistan before the Taliban entered Kabul, and Al Qaeda was driven out of Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks. The U.S.-supported Afghan forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. The post-2014 U.S. counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan focuses on Al Qaeda and its affiliates. Al Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan was initially minimal but has since expanded, with estimates of 100-500 fighters in the country. Relations between Al Qaeda and the Taliban are increasingly close, with some cooperation noted between the two groups. Until the killing of Bin Laden in 2011, there was frustration within the U.S. government in finding Al Qaeda's top leaders. Efforts focused on locating Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was believed to be in Pakistan. A U.S. strike in 2006 reportedly missed Zawahiri by a few hours in Pakistan. Some senior Al Qaeda leaders had been in Iran. Senior Al Qaeda leaders, including Sayf al Adl and Sulayman Abu Ghaith, were in Iran but forced out in 2013. Abu Ghaith was captured by the U.S., while Adl was traded to Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen. U.S. efforts have killed several senior Al Qaeda operatives in recent years, including Abu Khabab al-Masri, operatives involved in the 1998 embassy bombings, Attiyah Abd al-Rahman, Abu Yahya al-Libi, Abu Bara Al Kuwaiti, and Faruq Qahtani. Some groups in Afghanistan are affiliated with Al Qaeda. Some groups in Afghanistan, such as Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), have affiliations with Al Qaeda. AQIS, a subfaction of Al Qaeda, includes members from various terrorist groups in South and Central Asia. IMU originated as a militant group against the Uzbekistan government and has ties to Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, with some fighters aligning with the Islamic State. The IMU is active in northern Afghanistan, with a reported 300 fighters in Konduz Province. The IMU contingent in Afghanistan, led by Qari Balal, escaped from a Pakistani jail in 2010. Jamaat Ansarullah, a splinter group, is active in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET) is increasingly active inside Afghanistan, responsible for attacks in South Asia. Lashkar-i-Janghvi, another Pakistan-based group, conducts suicide attacks in Afghanistan. Harakat ul-Jihad Islami is a Pakistan-based group. Harakat ul-Jihad Islami, a Pakistan-based militant group, trained in Al Qaeda camps. Its former leader, Ilyas Kashmiri, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in June 2011. An Islamic State affiliate, Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP), has been active in Afghanistan since mid-2014. ISKP was named a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department in 2016. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reportedly lived in Kabul during the Taliban regime and cooperated with Al Qaeda there. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) presence in Afghanistan has grown from various Taliban factions affiliating with the group. ISKP members include former fighters from the Taliban faction in Pakistan. They have received financial support from the core IS organization in Iraq and Syria. U.S. estimates put ISKP fighters in Afghanistan at 700 in April 2017, with a goal to expand further in northeastern Afghanistan. The ISKP threat in Afghanistan has been targeted by U.S. commanders, with airstrikes reducing their presence to Nangarhar province. Several ISKP leaders have been killed in U.S. operations, but the group continues to be a growing concern in U.S. and Afghan strategic planning. ISKP remains a growing concern in U.S. and Afghan strategic planning. The group has clashed with Taliban fighters over territory and differences, but there have been reports of joint operations. ISKP has claimed responsibility for large-scale attacks in Afghanistan. The \"Haqqani Network,\" led by Jalaludin Haqqani and now largely operated by his son Sirajuddin, is considered a significant threat by U.S. officials. The network has been involved in attacks against Afghanistan's Shi'ite minority and government targets, and is seen as a critical enabler of Al Qaeda. Sirajuddin is also the deputy leader of the Taliban under Mullah Akhunzadeh. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaludin Haqqani and now by Mullah Akhunzadeh, has faced losses with two brothers killed and one sentenced to death. Despite a decline in numbers, the network remains capable of carrying out operations, notably the 2017 Kabul bombing. It earns funds through various businesses and kidnapping activities. The Haqqani Network, known for kidnapping and targeting Indian interests in Afghanistan, has held several hostages including professors and a journalist. American and Canadian hostages were freed in 2017 through a joint operation by Pakistan and the United States. The network has claimed responsibility for attacks on India's embassy in Kabul and is suspected of other attacks. The Haqqani Network, suspected of conducting various attacks in Afghanistan, including on India's consulate in Jalalabad and the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul. U.S. officials have linked the group to attacks on the U.S. Embassy and ISAF headquarters in Kabul. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mullen testified that the Haqqani network acts as an arm of Pakistan's ISI. The group is also attributed to a major attack at the Qandahar governor's compound in 2017. The Haqqani Network, designated as an FTO, may participate in a political settlement with the Afghan government. Insurgent groups use various tactics like IEDs and suicide bombs. Insurgent groups in Afghanistan use tactics like IEDs, suicide bombs, and insider attacks. These attacks have targeted high-profile individuals, including former President Rabbani and President Karzai's cousin. Insider attacks were prevalent in 2012, with nearly half of the incidents occurring. Surface-to-air missiles have also been used, with an insider attack killing Major General Harold Greene in 2014. Despite efforts to ban fertilizer chemicals used for roadside bombs, attacks continue. Insurgent groups in Afghanistan benefit from narcotics trafficking, generating an estimated $70 million-$100 million per year for insurgents. The trafficking also undermines government rule of law. U.S. arms provided to Afghan military have been obtained by the Taliban, giving them an advantage in some provinces. The insurgents in Afghanistan benefit from narcotics trafficking, estimated at $400 million by some U.N. officials. Poppy cultivation area in 2017 increased by 63%, with opium production up by 87%. The Trump Administration is targeting Taliban drug production facilities. The Obama Administration aimed to reduce other sources of Taliban funding, including donations from wealthy residents of the Persian Gulf. The Administration sanctioned two money exchange networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan used by the Taliban to move funds earned from narcotics. U.S. forces and Afghan troops fought insurgent violence with focused combat operations mainly in the south and east. NATO/ISAF assumed lead responsibility for security in all of Afghanistan during 2005-2006. In 2005-2006, NATO-led operations in Afghanistan aimed to improve security, but violence increased significantly in mid-2006. Despite clearing key districts, subsequent reinfiltration occurred. The United States and its partners increased force levels, with U.S. troop levels rising from 30,000 to 39,000 by April 2009. The Obama Administration prioritized the Afghanistan mission but aimed to reduce U.S. effort over time. The Obama Administration integrated policy reviews into a 60-day inter-agency \"strategy review\" chaired by South Asia expert Bruce Riedel. President Obama announced a \"comprehensive\" strategy in March 2009, deploying an additional 21,000 U.S. forces. General Stanley McChrystal replaced General McKiernan as top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan in June 2009. General McChrystal recommended a shift in military focus to protect the population in August 2009. President Obama announced in December 2009 that 30,000 additional U.S. forces would be sent to reverse the Taliban's momentum and strengthen the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). This surge brought U.S. force levels to 100,000, with most of the additional forces deployed to the south. A transition to Afghan security leadership and a drawdown of U.S. forces would begin in July 2011, focusing on training Afghan forces. The surge announced by President Obama in December 2009 aimed to reverse Taliban control in Afghanistan and strengthen Afghan security forces. By November 2010, a gradual transition to Afghan leadership was decided upon, with the process starting in July 2011. The Taliban's control was significantly reduced, and Afghan forces took over security responsibilities by June 2013. In June 2013, Afghan forces took over security lead throughout Afghanistan. President Obama announced U.S. force levels would decrease to 90,000 by end of 2011, 68,000 by September 2012, and 34,000 by February 2014. Partner countries also reduced their forces in Afghanistan. In 2014, international forces reduced their combat missions in Afghanistan but continued to train ANDSF until the end of the year. President Obama announced plans for a post-2014 U.S. force of 9,800 troops, mostly consisting of trainers in the Resolute Support Mission. About 2,000 of the U.S. force would be Special Operations Forces. The U.S. military renamed the Afghanistan operations to \"Operation Freedom's Sentinel\" and planned to reduce the force to about 5,000 troops by the end of 2016. The remaining force would focus on security relations with Afghanistan under U.S. Embassy authority, protecting installations, processing weapon sales, and training Afghan forces. In 2014, preparations were made for the end of the ISAF mission, with reduced U.S. airpower and bases handed over to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. After the end of the ISAF mission in 2014, the U.S. military handed over bases to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. Concerns about post-2014 drawdown plans grew after the 2014 offensive in Iraq by Islamic State fighters. Despite U.S. commanders' assertions of the ANDSF's performance, concerns have increased since 2015 due to Taliban gains in Helmand Province and the capture of Konduz city in 2015. The Taliban has made significant gains in capturing parts of cities in southern and eastern Afghanistan since 2001, with many gains quickly reversed by the ANDSF. The capture of Helmand's Sangin district in March 2017 highlighted their growing strength, although some officials disputed the narrative as a planned withdrawal. Sangin is strategically important as a link between Helmand and Qandahar and symbolically significant as one of the deadliest districts in Afghanistan. According to The New York Times, more British troops and American marines died in Sangin than in any other district in Afghanistan through 2013. The Taliban's control or influence over Afghan territory has been increasing, with reports of assistance from Russia and Iran. Russia and Iran use the growth of IS-aligned fighters in Afghanistan to justify their involvement, despite differing assessments of IS strength compared to the US and Afghan officials. The killing of Taliban leader Mullah Mansour by a US strike in 2016 showed Taliban vulnerabilities, but has not significantly impacted their effectiveness. Concerns about insurgent gains have led to changes in the US mission under both Obama and Trump Administrations. The President announced that U.S. forces would remain at about 9,800 for all of 2015, instead of reducing to 5,500 by the end of the year as originally planned. In January 2016, U.S. commanders in Afghanistan were authorized to attack ISKP forces by affiliation. In June 2016, the President authorized U.S. forces to conduct preemptive combat. Secretary of Defense Carter stated on July 12, 2016, that U.S. forces can anticipate battlefield dynamics and deploy with Afghan forces to prevent situations from deteriorating. President Obama adjusted planned U.S. force levels on July 6, 2016, stating they would drop to 8,400 by the end of the year, not 5,500 as previously announced. The announcement at the end of 2016 stated that U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan would not drop to 5,500 as previously planned. General Nicholson's assessment in June 2016 influenced this decision. Other NATO countries pledged to support Resolute Support Mission (RSM) beyond 2016 with forces and donations to Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) until 2020. The specifics were not mentioned, but it was implied that around 6,000 forces and $1.25 billion per year would be contributed. General Nicholson highlighted a shortfall of troops in Afghanistan that could help break the stalemate. While Special Operations forces are sufficient for operations, more troops are needed for advising and training Afghan forces. The Trump Administration was likely to approve Nicholson's request for more troops, but disagreements within the administration have delayed a review of U.S. strategy. Some are skeptical that a few thousand more troops will have a significant impact on the conflict. The Pentagon confirmed in August 2017 that the actual number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan is between 11,000 and 12,000 on any given day, higher than the authorized level of 8,400. Secretary Mattis emphasized the need to accurately account for troops before approving new deployments. President Trump delegated the authority to set troop levels. President Trump delegated authority to set force levels in Afghanistan in June 2017, with around 3,900 additional troops authorized. By November 2017, the total number of troops in Afghanistan reached around 15,000, with NATO planning to increase forces by 3,000 more. Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan includes abandoning timetables, integrating diplomatic and economic assets, and taking a more aggressive stance towards Pakistan. President Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan includes elements similar to the Obama Administration's approach, but lacks specific details on troop numbers. Critics argue that the focus on diplomatic engagement contradicts proposed cuts to the State Department. However, some welcome the decision, preferring it over alternatives like a full withdrawal or heavy reliance on contractors. The strategy also grants broader authority for U.S. forces to operate independently and target the enemy more aggressively. The new strategy for Afghanistan allows U.S. forces to operate independently and target the enemy aggressively, including strikes against Taliban drug labs in Helmand province. General John Nicholson believes the conditions are set to win with new troops and expanded authorities. The post-2014 U.S. military presence is based on a Bilateral Security Accord (BSA). The post-2014 U.S. military presence in Afghanistan is based on a Bilateral Security Accord (BSA) that includes legal immunities for U.S. forces. The BSA was signed in 2014 between the U.S. and Afghanistan, ratified by Afghanistan's parliament, and overseen by a bilateral Joint Commission. The BSA, part of the broader SPA signed in 2012, signaled a prolonged U.S. commitment to Afghan stability. It included provisions for continued cooperation, training and arms for Afghan security forces, and designating Afghanistan as a \"Major Non-NATO Ally.\" The 2012 SPA designated Afghanistan as a \"Major Non-NATO Ally,\" allowing for defense research cooperation and U.S. training. The agreement also included provisions for long-term U.S. use of Afghan facilities and a commitment to request economic aid for Afghanistan until 2024. Key details from the curr_chunk: Secretary of State Kerry's visit to Kabul in 2016 aimed to reconvene the commission after a three-year hiatus. The final SPA was ratified by the Afghanistan National Assembly in 2012. Concerns about the effectiveness of the ANDSF include absenteeism, illiteracy, high casualty rates, and inconsistent leadership. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) face challenges such as inconsistent leadership, logistical deficits, and shortages in weaponry and supplies. Key performance metrics were newly classified in the October 2017 SIGAR report. The training component of Resolute Support Mission (RSM) replaced previous training institutions like CSTC-A and NTM-A. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) receive support from CSTC-A to build capacity and provide financial resources. The target size for the ANDSF was set at 358,000 in 2011 but the current size is about 330,000. Different target sizes were discussed within NATO but not adopted. Ethnic composition of the ANDSF has been a topic of discussion since the ousting of the Taliban in 2001. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have faced challenges with ethnic composition and literacy issues. Recruitment initially favored ethnic Tajiks, leading to underrepresentation of Pashtuns. Efforts to improve diversity and literacy levels have been made, but concerns remain about maintaining ethnic balance in leadership positions. The goal of achieving first-grade literacy for all ANDSF members by 2014 is uncertain. The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) have faced challenges with ethnic composition and literacy. Efforts to improve literacy have shown some progress, but goals set for 2014 were deemed unrealistic. Funding for the ANDSF costs around $5 billion annually, with contributions from the US and NATO partners. Afghanistan has pledged funds as well. The US has pledged $500 million in funding for the Afghan Security Forces despite budgetary difficulties. Donations for the Afghan National Defense Forces are channeled through Trust Funds, including the ANA Trust Fund and the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan. The ANA Trust Fund has received over $1.5 billion from 26 donor nations for various purposes such as transportation of military equipment and literacy training. The \"Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan\" (LOTFA) is managed by the UNDP and pays salaries and food costs for the ANP. Donors have contributed $4.96 billion since 2002, with the US contributing $1.7 billion. Japan and South Korea also contribute annually. Other bilateral donations include the NATO Equipment Donation Program, providing over $3 billion in assistance to the ANDSF since 2002. The NATO-Russia Council Helicopter Maintenance Trust Fund supports the Afghan Air Force helicopter fleet. The Afghan National Army, built from scratch since 2002, is highly regarded by Afghans as a symbol of nationhood. With 170,000 personnel, including a proficient special operations component trained by U.S. Special Operations Forces, they utilize Afghan special forces extensively to combat Taliban gains. Absenteeism is a significant issue within the ANA. The Afghan National Army faces absenteeism issues due to soldiers not serving in their home provinces. Absenteeism has decreased with electronic payments. The ANA mainly has light weapons, with some Russian tanks. The US is helping build indigenous weapons production. The Afghan Air Force is becoming crucial in combating insurgency. The Afghan Air Force, a carryover from the pre-Soviet invasion era, has about 8,400 personnel and has received over $3.2 billion in US funding since FY2010. Despite this support, equipment, maintenance, and logistical challenges persist, with the force currently operating about 104 aircraft out of a target fleet size of 140. The Afghan Air Force has a fleet of 140 aircraft. They have received 56 Mi-17s and 8 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft. Other platforms include MD-530 and 3 Cheetah helicopters. The US prohibits funding for additional C-130s until a report on Afghanistan's airlift requirements is provided. Afghanistan seeks the return of 26 aircraft, including MiG-2s flown to safety in Pakistan and Uzbekistan. In 2010, Russia and Germany supplied MI-8 helicopters to the Afghan Air Force. U.S. and Afghan officials emphasize the importance of a credible national police force in combating insurgency. Despite some progress in professionalizing the Afghan National Police (ANP), outside assessments highlight widespread corruption and citizen mistrust. The ANP faces challenges such as high desertion rates, illiteracy, and involvement in local disputes. The target size for the ANP is 162,000 personnel, with about 154,000 currently in the force. The Afghan National Police (ANP) force consists of 154,000 personnel, including 3,110 women. They have been provided with heavy weapons and 5,000 armored vehicles, but still lack adequate ammunition and vehicles in some units. There have been issues with equipment being sold by police officers for personal gain. The U.S. led police training efforts until 2005 when the Department of Defense took over. Police training has been identified as an area needing greater interagency cooperation. The United States and Afghanistan decided to develop local forces, including the Afghan Local Police (ALP), to protect communities. The ALP program began in 2008 with 100 recruits in Wardak Province and expanded to 1,200 personnel. Participants received $200 per month in salary and weapons were supplied by the Afghan government using U.S. funds. The Village Stability Operations (VSO) in Qandahar Province involved organizing villagers into armed watch groups, which later expanded into the ALP program with around 29,000 members. The ALP, also known as \"guardians,\" have the authority to detain criminals or insurgents but have been criticized for human rights abuses and serving the interests of local strongmen. The ALP, funded by the United States, operates as a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Interior to guard sites and convoys. Formed to replace private security contractors, the ALP numbers around 22,000 and bills customers for their services. They are criticized for being unaccountable militias serving local strongmen, unlike traditional local security structures called arbaki. Some experts suggest reviving the arbaki concept to secure Afghanistan, as done before Zahir Shah's reign. Criticisms of corruption in Afghan bureaucracy have been discussed. U.S. justice sector programs focus on promoting rule of law and building judicial capacity. $50 million from FY2016 funds and $7 million from FY2017 are allocated for rule of law programs in Afghanistan. The FY2017 measure allocates $7 million for rule of law programs in Afghanistan, part of ongoing efforts to reach a political settlement with insurgents. The \"Afghan High Peace Council\" was formed in 2010 to oversee the settlement process. Burhanuddin Rabbani, head of the Afghan High Peace Council, was assassinated in 2011. His son, Salahuddin Rabbani, succeeded him in 2012. U.S. diplomats met with Taliban officials in 2011 to discuss transferring Taliban captives and releasing a U.S. prisoner of war. Talks broke off in 2012 but resumed in 2013, leading to the Taliban opening a representative office in Qatar. The Taliban violated agreements with the US and Qatar by opening an office in Qatar under the name of the \"Islamic Emirate\" of Afghanistan. This led to the closure of the office, but indirect talks between the US and Taliban through Qatari mediation resumed in 2014. In 2014, Bergdahl was exchanged for five Taliban figures who were sent to Qatar with travel restrictions. President Ghani was elected in 2014. President Ghani, elected in 2014, aims to reconcile with the Taliban insurgency, despite skepticism. The Obama Administration eventually supported the idea with conditions for the Taliban to cease fighting, accept the Afghan constitution, and sever ties with terrorist groups. Taliban leaders showed some acceptance of human rights and women's rights provisions during discussions. President Ghani's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban include engaging regional powers for support in talks. Pugwash meetings in Qatar have continued despite Taliban rejection, potentially leading to reopening of Taliban office for further negotiations and possible amendments to the Afghan constitution. Possible amendments to the Afghan constitution are being considered if a settlement is reached, which was previously rejected by the Afghan government. A meeting in China with former Taliban regime figures was facilitated by China with assistance from Pakistan. Efforts are being made to prompt the Taliban to agree to a political settlement, with some Taliban figures showing interest in integration into the Afghan political process to distance themselves from Pakistani influence. Regional governments are supporting talks, and a working group involving the United States, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and China has been formed to restart government-Taliban negotiations. In December 2015, Ghani attended a regional meeting in Islamabad where Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the United States agreed to resume settlement talks. Meetings in late 2016 between Russia, China, and Pakistan excluded Afghanistan, causing anger. President Trump's new approach to Afghanistan includes a \"political settlement\" as an outcome of an \"effective military effort,\" but specific goals or conditions are unclear. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson rejected preconditioning talks with the Taliban. The Taliban's acceptance of certain arrangements is emphasized, with calls for the Afghan government and Taliban representatives to engage in dialogue. There are concerns about the effectiveness of the Taliban's Qatar office and the potential consequences of closing it. The recent reconciliation with Hizb-e-Islami-Gulbuddin is seen as a possible model for future political settlements. HIG, supported by the U.S. against the Soviet Union, later turned against its mujahedin colleagues. Accused of human rights abuses, including indiscriminate shelling in Kabul. Allied with the Taliban post-Taliban period, focused on high-profile attacks. Designated as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\" by the U.S. government in 2003. The U.S. government designated Hikmatyar as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\" in 2003. In 2010, Hikmatyar showed willingness for reconciliation with Kabul under certain conditions. HIG members participated in peace talks in 2010 and met with Afghan government representatives in 2012. Hikmatyar instructed followers to vote in the 2014 Afghan presidential elections. A reconciliation agreement was signed in 2016. In 2016, a reconciliation agreement was signed between Afghan officials and Hikmatyar representatives, leading to Hikmatyar potentially obtaining a ceremonial government post and efforts to lift U.S. sanctions against him. Hekmatyar returned to Kabul in May 2017, criticizing the NUG and raising concerns about his role in Afghan politics. A reintegration plan was adopted in 2010 to encourage insurgent fighters to stop fighting, with about 11,000 fighters reintegrated since then. Since 2010, around 11,000 fighters, mainly from the north and west, have been reintegrated through a program funded by donations from countries like Britain, Japan, and the United States. The U.S. contributed about half of the $200 million total. Funding for the program slowed in 2014 but received an additional $10 million in 2015. However, funding stopped in early 2016, halting payments to reintegrated fighters. The U.S. spent $33 million in FY2016 on programs to counter violent extremism. Some reintegrated fighters have been reported to commit human rights abuses. The reintegration process for fighters in Afghanistan has had mixed success, with some cases of human rights abuses being committed. A previous program from 2003-2008 aimed at peace and reconciliation had limited impact on the insurgency. One key demand in negotiations is the removal of Taliban figures from U.N. terrorist lists. The Afghan government submitted a list of 50 Taliban figures to be removed from U.N. sanctions lists. Russia dropped opposition to removing five Taliban-era figures, including Wakil Mutawwakil and Abdul Hakim Mujahid. U.N. Security Council adopted Resolutions 1988 and 1989, separating Taliban and Al Qaeda in sanctions decisions. On July 21, 2011, 14 Taliban figures, including four members of the HPC, were removed from the \"1267\" sanctions list. The United States has urged Afghanistan's neighbors to support a stable Afghanistan and include it in regional security and economic organizations. The Trump Administration plans to pressure Pakistan to deny safe haven to Afghan militants. At international meetings in Istanbul and Bonn in 2011, Afghanistan's neighbors pledged noninterference. The \"Heart of Asia\" ministerial process involves 14 regional countries, 14 supporting countries, and 11 organizations to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. Recent meetings were held in Islamabad and Amritsar, with the next conference planned in Azerbaijan. Afghanistan aims to enhance its regional cooperation. The seventh conference will be held in Azerbaijan. Afghanistan seeks to increase integration with neighboring states through participation in various international fora, including SAARC, SCO, RECCA, and other regional initiatives. Regional cooperation on Afghanistan is facilitated through the 50-nation \"International Contact Group\" and various summit meetings between Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, the U.S., China, and Iran. The Quadrilateral Coordination Group met in October 2017, while Russia convened a meeting with Pakistan and China in December 2016, drawing criticism from Afghanistan for not being invited. The U.S. has focused on developing a Central Asia-South Asia trading hub to support Afghanistan's stability and economic growth. Funding has been allocated to promote Afghanistan's regional connections, with a key focus on enhancing links with countries in South and Central Asia. Pakistan is seen as crucial for Afghanistan's security. Pakistan's commitment to Afghan stability is debated, with concerns about its ties to insurgent groups. Reports highlight Afghan militant safe havens in Pakistan as a threat to stability. President Trump has called out Pakistan for harboring terrorist organizations. Pakistan's strategic interests in Afghanistan, including countering Indian influence, are also noted. Pakistan's leaders are increasingly concerned about instability in Afghanistan affecting their country. The Pakistani military is struggling to combat both Pakistani and Afghan militant groups. Approximately 2 million Afghan refugees have returned from Pakistan, but another 2 million may still remain. Pakistan is urging these refugees to return to Afghanistan. Pakistan is pressing Afghan refugees to return by the end of 2017, exacerbating humanitarian problems in Afghanistan. President Ghani has made efforts to improve relations with Pakistan, including training Afghan officers and intelligence services. Pakistan aims to limit India's influence in Afghanistan by improving relations with Afghan leadership. Pakistan accuses India of supporting anti-Pakistan insurgents through its embassy and consulates in Afghanistan. Pakistan aims to limit India's influence in Afghanistan by improving relations with Afghan leadership. Many Afghans have mixed feelings towards Pakistan due to its past support for the Taliban. The border issue between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains unresolved. Afghanistan recognizes the \"Durand Line\" border agreement with Pakistan but believes it was drawn unfairly. Tensions between the two countries have led to clashes at the border, with efforts to deconflict the situation. Pakistan's cooperation against Al Qaeda post-9/11 was initially effective, with over 700 arrests and access granted to U.S. for operations. Border coordination centers were established, but Pakistan failed to set up one on its side, causing the process to falter. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been strained due to various incidents, including the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and a U.S. airstrike that killed Pakistani soldiers. Despite some improvement in cooperation, concerns remain over Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani network, leading to the Pentagon withholding some U.S. security aid. The Pentagon has withheld U.S. security aid to Pakistan due to their actions against the Haqqani network. President Trump's intentions to change the approach towards Pakistan could impact the aid and the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. There are discussions about reexamining Pakistan's status as a major non-NATO ally, increasing drone strikes, and imposing sanctions on Pakistani officials. However, some warn that these measures could have geopolitical costs and affect U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Iran seeks to exert influence in western Afghanistan, protect minorities, and prevent US forces from using Afghanistan as a base to pressure or attack Iran. Iran has backed Taliban elements in the region and allowed a Taliban office to open in Iran. Iran has supported Taliban figures and funded armed groups in Afghanistan, including Pashtun fighters. They have also provided support to Hazara Shiites in Kabul and central Afghanistan. Allegations suggest Iran has funded Afghan candidates in Persian-speaking and Shiite minority areas. Iran has close ties with Afghanistan's Shiite community, supporting Shiite leaders and recruiting Afghan Shiites to fight in Syria. Iran opposed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, especially after Taliban forces captured Herat in 1995. Iran supported the Northern Alliance with fuel, funds, and ammunition. Tensions escalated in 1998 when Iranian diplomats were killed by Taliban forces, leading to a threat of military action. Iran has built extensive ties with the Afghan government, offering assistance during the U.S.-led war and helping broker Afghanistan's post-Taliban government. Despite funding anti-government groups, Iran is considered a \"friend\" of Afghanistan by its leaders. Ghani visited Tehran in April 2015. Iran and Afghanistan have a history of cooperation, with Iran assisting in combatting the Islamic State organization. Disputes have arisen over issues such as Afghan refugees in Iran. Iran has a history of cooperation with Afghanistan, including assisting in combatting the Islamic State. A crisis occurred in 2007 when Iran expelled 50,000 Afghan refugees into Afghanistan. Iran has also been recruiting Shiite Afghans to fight in Syria. The United States and Iran have collaborated on combating drug trafficking across the Afghan border. Iran has provided economic aid to Afghanistan, pledging about $1 billion with $500 million already given. The aid has been used for infrastructure projects like roads and bridges in western Afghanistan. Iran is also working with India to build roads connecting western Afghanistan to Iran's port of Chahbahar, allowing easier access to the Persian Gulf. Additionally, Iran has developed power transmission lines in bordering provinces. India's goals in Afghanistan include limiting Pakistan's influence and countering the threat posed by radical Islamic organizations. Afghanistan seeks close ties with India to access its growing economy while avoiding backlash from Pakistan. In 2011, Afghanistan and India signed a \"Strategic Partnership\" agreement, causing concerns in Pakistan. The pact between Afghanistan and India in 2011 affirmed Indian involvement in Afghan security by training ANDSF personnel. India has donated military helicopters to the Afghan Air Force. Despite initial requests for military equipment, Afghan President Ghani visited India in 2015 to engage with Prime Minister Modi, who has concerns about Ghani's outreach to Pakistan. India's past involvement in Afghanistan aims to limit Pakistan's influence and counter radical Islamic organizations. India's past involvement in Afghanistan reflects concerns about Pakistani influence and Islamic extremism. India supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban in the mid-1990s and remains connected to Alliance figures. India is a significant donor to Afghan reconstruction, pledging over $2 billion. Projects focus on civilian development and align with Afghan government priorities. India has been actively involved in Afghanistan, supporting development projects and infrastructure. President Trump called for India to assist in economic development in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Modi inaugurated various India-sponsored projects in Afghanistan, including a new parliament complex and a dam. India also financed a project to bring electricity from Central Asia to Afghanistan and signed the \"Chahbahar Agreement\" with Iran and Afghanistan to invest in developing Iran's Chahbahar port for increased trade with Afghanistan. India has been actively involved in Afghanistan, supporting development projects and infrastructure. In December 2011, the Indian firm SAIL won a bid for the Hajji Gak iron ore project in Bamiyan Province. India also provides scholarships for Afghans to study in India and some Afghans seek more Indian assistance in training Afghan bureaucrats. Regional states are interested in Afghan stability and the U.S. military presence in the region. Russia aims to counter U.S. influence in Central Asia. Russia aims to counter U.S. influence in Central Asia by cooperating in developing supply routes to Afghanistan. Despite a one-year suspension in 2009, the Northern Distribution Network was used for half of U.S. forces' ground cargo from 2011 to 2014. However, bilateral ties have deteriorated, and Russia has taken a more assertive role in Afghanistan since late 2015. Since late 2015, Russia has become more assertive in Afghanistan, challenging U.S. goals. In April 2017, General Nicholson did not deny reports of Russia supplying weapons to the Taliban, including heavy machine guns. Russia had previously dismissed these claims as baseless. Russia has denied reports of supplying weapons to the Taliban, stating their contacts are for political and diplomatic purposes only. Despite this, their actions in Afghanistan have drawn criticism, including hosting meetings without Afghan representation and inviting the US, which declined to attend. The United States declined to attend Russian-hosted meetings in Afghanistan, citing wariness about Russian goals and reluctance to legitimize their efforts. Afghan officials view Russian involvement as complementary to ongoing processes involving the US. US officials see Russia's role in Afghanistan within the broader US-Russian rivalry, with Secretary Mattis characterizing it as strategic competition. Russian interest in Afghanistan is framed as a response to the growth of ISKP, blaming the US for it. Russia is investing $1 billion in Afghanistan to develop its electricity capacity and infrastructure, implementing an agreement reached during a Karzai visit to Moscow in 2011. This investment includes projects such as expanding the Salang Tunnel, building hydroelectric facilities, a customs terminal, and a university in Kabul. Afghan views of Russia are influenced by the Soviet occupation legacy. Russia invested $25 million in the Kabul Housebuilding Factory and $20 million to renovate the former \"Soviet House of Science and Culture\" into the \"Russian Cultural Center\" in 2014. Russian officers joined U.S. and Afghan forces in 2010 to interdict narcotics trafficking. In the 1990s, Russia supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban to counter Islamic militancy from Afghanistan. Chechen fighters fighting alongside Taliban/Al Qaeda forces have been captured. Central Asian states are crucial to Afghanistan's stability and the success of the New Silk Road strategy. Trade is increasing between Afghanistan and Central Asia, with Afghanistan earning transit fees and customs duties. Concerns exist about potential ISKP expansion in Afghanistan, especially with the return of Central Asian fighters. In 1996, Central Asian states, Russia, and China collaborated against Islamic militancy in Afghanistan. In 1996, Central Asian states, Russia, and China formed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization due to the Taliban threat. Kazakhstan allowed emergency use of its air facilities for operations in Afghanistan and pledged noncombat troops in 2011. They also permitted U.S. overflights of military equipment to Afghanistan. Tajikistan, with deep ties to Afghanistan, supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban and received U.S. security assistance post-Taliban era. Uzbekistan has maintained its policy since 2016, supporting ethnic Uzbek faction leader Abdul Rashid Dostam. The country allowed the use of the Karshi-Khanabad air base by OEF forces until a rift in 2005. In 2008, Uzbekistan reached an agreement with Germany to temporarily use the air base. Uzbekistan allowed the use of Karshi-Khanabad air base temporarily, suggesting potential for resumed U.S.-Uzbek cooperation on Afghanistan. Uzbekistan also allowed the use of its Navoi airfield for shipment of U.S./NATO goods into Afghanistan. The Al Qaeda-linked IMU is active in Afghanistan, with one of its leaders reportedly killed while commanding Taliban/Al Qaeda forces. Turkmenistan maintains a position of \"positive neutrality\" on Afghanistan and does not allow its territory to be used by U.S. and NATO forces for operations or logistics. Turkmenistan actively engaged the Taliban regime to prevent spillover of radical Islamic activity from Afghanistan and facilitate the TAPI natural gas pipeline. However, after the September 11 attacks, Turkmenistan publicly supported the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan. China's involvement in Afghanistan aims to secure access to resources, support Pakistan, and reduce the Islamist militant threat to China, particularly concerning the Uighur community. China's involvement in Afghanistan includes supporting the Uighur community and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). They have signed security and economic agreements with Afghanistan since 2012, offering training and funding for Afghan policy and security forces. China is also building border access routes and supply depots in the \"Wakhan Corridor\" to facilitate their access to Afghanistan. China's involvement in Afghanistan includes providing training for Afghan security forces and offering bilateral aid. In 2014, China agreed to train Afghan bureaucrats and provide $330 million in aid over three years. This led to Taliban figures visiting China to promote a political settlement. Afghanistan also expressed support for China's stance on the South China Sea in 2016. China's involvement in Afghanistan includes economic aid, joint counterterror patrols with Afghan forces, and potential investments in mining and energy sectors. China provided $255 million in economic aid from 2002 to 2014 and continues to assess new investment opportunities. The development of the Aynak copper mine south of Kabul is a key investment, but security issues have stalled the project. China National Petroleum Co. was awarded rights to develop oil deposits in the Amu Darya basin in 2012. China's involvement in Afghanistan includes economic aid, joint counterterror patrols, and potential investments in mining and energy sectors. China provided $255 million in economic aid from 2002 to 2014 and continues to assess new investment opportunities. China National Petroleum Co. was awarded rights to develop oil deposits in the Amu Darya basin. Transportation and trade routes through Afghanistan align with China's \"One Belt, One Road\" vision. The Gulf states have been considered a key part of efforts to stabilize Afghanistan, with Ambassador Holbrooke focusing on curbing Gulf resident donations to the Taliban. Donations from Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, have been a significant source of funding for the Taliban. Saudi Arabia has a history of involvement in Afghanistan, providing financial support to the mujahedin and recognizing the Taliban government. However, Saudi Arabia later broke diplomatic relations with the Taliban and assisted in negotiations between the Afghan government and \"moderate\" Taliban figures. Despite describing the Taliban as \"armed terrorists,\" some allege that the kingdom has not effectively stopped the flow of funds to the group. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar have emerged as major donors to Afghanistan. UAE has provided over $250 million for various projects since 2002, including troops and F-16s for NATO missions. Qatar's mediation efforts have also played a role in the Afghan conflict. Qatar's mediation efforts in Afghanistan included facilitating the release of Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl and hosting talks with the Taliban in Doha. Bahrain sent police officers to Afghanistan in 2009 to support stabilization operations. Oman hosted meetings for diplomatic talks, potentially playing a role in future Taliban negotiations. The Afghan economy has faced challenges due to aid cutbacks and political uncertainty post-2014, leading to a slowdown in growth. Despite this, the government has shown improvement in budget execution and service delivery, with revenue mainly coming from taxation and customs duties. Since 2001, debates over aid to Afghanistan have included amounts, delivery mechanisms, donor coordination, and distribution within the country. Donor aid makes up over 95% of Afghanistan's GDP and two-thirds of government expenditures. Some economic sectors rely on private investment, often by well-connected Afghan officials. It is challenging to distinguish the impact of aid on Afghanistan's economy from that of investment, trade, and other factors. In 2011, the US proposed greater Afghan economic integration in the region and participation in a \"New Silk Road\" trading network. The economic integration in the region and its role in a \"New Silk Road\" trading pattern aimed to accelerate Afghan private sector growth and customs revenue. However, slow implementation is due to political differences and security challenges. Afghanistan's fragile economy and society, still recovering from decades of warfare, have left millions dead, widowed, orphaned, and displaced. Despite some refugees returning, many remain outside the country. In 2016, an accord with the EU aimed to repatriate Afghan refugees from EU countries. Afghanistan faces low literacy rates and a small, but growing, pool of skilled labor and middle managers. The United States provided assistance to Afghanistan through relief organizations during the 1990s, with no direct aid to the Taliban government. USAID had a cross-border aid program for Afghanistan between 1985 and 1994. There was no USAID mission for Afghanistan until the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in late 2001. U.S. assistance to Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban is detailed in Table 11 of the report, excluding costs for combat operations. Some laws require U.S. aid to Afghanistan to be withheld unless the Afghan government meets certain benchmarks related to counternarcotics efforts, corruption, human rights practices, and women's rights. Certifications have been made, and no funds have been withheld. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriation conditions funding on the submission of a strategy for U.S. policy in Afghanistan and certification by the Secretary of State on Afghan government benchmarks. Biannual reports are required on these benchmarks. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act extends reporting requirements and includes a provision on the Afghan Personnel and Pay System. U.S. officials leverage benefits like fuel supplies to influence Afghans suspected of corruption. The FY2008 defense authorization bill established the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) to audit Afghan governance and security, focusing on the use of U.S. funds. Executive branch agencies have criticized some SIGAR audits as inaccurate. Some agencies, including USAID, have criticized SIGAR audits as inaccurate or redundant. DOD disputed a 2013 audit claiming mismanagement of $3 billion in funds for the ANDSF. The FY2017 Consolidated Appropriation allocated $54.9 million for SIGAR operations. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act authorized $3.7 billion in civilian aid for FY2003-FY2006, but its aid strategy was not fully implemented. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act authorized various assistance targets, including counternarcotics, political development, women's rights, humanitarian aid, an Enterprise Fund, and defense drawdowns for Afghanistan and regional militaries. Subsequent laws increased funding for drawdowns. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act Amendments of 2004 mandated the appointment of a U.S. coordinator for Afghanistan policy and required additional reports to Congress. A bill in the 110th Congress reauthorizing AFSA authorized $1.7 billion in economic aid and $320 million in military aid annually. The United States currently disburses 50% of its aid funds through the Afghan government, meeting the international community's goal set in 2010. Afghan ministries to receive direct U.S. aid through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), funded by donors with about $6 billion. Funds split between Afghan salaries and development investments. Small amounts of USAID funds used for Afghan enterprises. $800 million \"New Development Partnership\" announced during Ghani visit to Washington, overseen by USAID for programs in Afghanistan after agreed reforms. The USAID will oversee the disbursement of funds for programs in Afghanistan only after agreed reforms or development results have been achieved. The United States supports the National Solidarity Program (NSP) through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), providing block grants for local councils to implement priority projects. Over $600 million has been donated to the program, with 90% coming from the U.S. The NSP has funded projects in 21,600 villages, including bridges, water wells, and hydroelectric power. The NSP, funded mainly by the U.S., has brought infrastructure projects like bridges, water wells, and hydroelectric power to Afghan villages. The Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund, managed by the Asian Development Bank, receives U.S. contributions for projects like a power grid. Non-U.S. donors also support Afghanistan's infrastructure development. Major international institutions like the EU and the Asian Development Bank provide significant funding for Afghanistan's development through pledges made at donor conferences such as Tokyo, Berlin, Kabul, London, Paris, and Brussels. The Tokyo Conference in 2012 focused on post-2014 assistance, with the United States and partners pledging $16 billion in aid through 2015. This commitment aimed to sustain support through 2017 at similar levels as the past decade. The Tokyo Conference in 2012 focused on post-2014 assistance, with major pledges from Japan and Germany. The Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework set requirements for Afghan governance and anti-corruption. A senior officials meeting in Kabul in 2013 found slow progress in meeting benchmarks. The London Conference in December 2014 assessed progress on TMAF benchmarks, with donors pledging funds for Afghanistan. The Brussels Conference in October 2016 welcomed Afghanistan's new development framework and anti-corruption efforts, with donors pledging $15.2 billion for 2017-2020, led by the World Bank's key role in Afghanistan's development. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been involved in financing projects in Afghanistan, particularly in the telecommunications, road, sewage, and railway construction sectors. Private investment has also played a significant role in the development of sectors such as luxury hotels, factories, and infrastructure in Kabul. IMF and World Bank announced $1.6 billion in debt relief for Afghanistan before the London donor's conference in 2010. Private investment has played a significant role in developing luxury hotels, factories, and infrastructure in Kabul. The Serena luxury hotel was built by the Agha Khan foundation, and a multi-billion dollar development called \"New Kabul City\" near the Kabul airport has been constructed. The Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO) sought to facilitate private investment in Afghanistan but yielded little results before concluding its operations in 2015. Some Afghan businessmen relocated outside the country due to uncertainty about the post-2014 political and security situation. Some Afghan businessmen relocated outside the country due to the uncertain post-2014 political and security situation. Taliban attacks on schools have caused closures and hindered student enrollment. Afghanistan's university system is underfunded, with only six million students attending classes after adjusting for absent registered students. The university system in Afghanistan is underfunded due to free higher education up to the B.A. level, leading to a shortage of skilled workers. The country needs $35 million annually to operate its universities. Despite improvements in healthcare, nearly 20% of Afghans have experienced difficulties accessing medical care. USAID funds for health are channeled through the Ministry of Health to international NGOs. The Ministry of Health in Afghanistan contracts with international NGOs for medical supplies. USAID's \"Partnership Contracts for Health\" program provides healthcare services in 13 provinces. Road construction, funded by the United States, has been a priority to combat Taliban influence. Over 10,000 miles of roads have been built since 2001 to support Afghan farmers. Roads are crucial for Afghan farmers to transport produce to markets. The Ring Road, funded by various donors including the Asian Development Bank, has been repaved at a cost of $4 billion. Other key projects include roads from Qandahar to Tarin Kowt, Panjshir Valley to Kabul, Salang Bypass Road, and an East-West road from Herat to Kabul. Funding has been allocated for segments of the East-West road. Several roads in Afghanistan, funded by international donors, are in need of maintenance due to lack of resources. Trade with Central Asia has increased after the construction of a bridge over the Panj River in 2007. The bridge, built with U.S. assistance, has aided reconstruction and economic development in Panjshir province. Afghanistan is developing a rail system to export minerals, with China and India funding rail lines from their mining projects. Plans include a line from Herat and Kabul to Qandahar. There are concerns that India and China may choose to truck minerals instead, slowing down mine exploitation. The Afghan government is working on developing a rail system to export minerals, with plans to connect Herat and Kabul to Qandahar and eventually to Pakistan. The railways will link Afghanistan to the former Soviet railway system and Pakistan's railway system, boosting economic integration in the region. The Afghan Rail Authority was established in 2012 to regulate this sector. Despite efforts to improve the energy sector, a large majority of Afghans still lack access to grid-connected power due to the country's complex power system. The United States has invested over $2 billion in power projects in Afghanistan to improve indigenous power production and management capabilities, connecting separate power grids. Concerns have been raised about the sustainability of these efforts. In 2017, concerns were raised about the sustainability of US efforts to develop Afghanistan's energy sector, highlighted by the underutilization of the $355 million Kabul Power Plant. Despite only 12.5% of Afghanistan's land being arable, the agriculture sector is crucial to the economy, with 80% of Afghans living in rural areas. The agriculture sector is crucial to Afghanistan's economy, contributing 25% of the GDP. USAID programs have helped double legitimate agricultural output in the past five years, focusing on commodities like pomegranates, saffron, and raisins. Over $2 billion has been disbursed since 2002 to build capacity at the Ministry of Agriculture and provide alternatives to poppy growing. The U.S. strategy in Afghanistan includes infrastructure development for a legitimate agriculture sector, such as road building, security, refrigeration, storage, and transportation of produce. Projects like IDEA-NEW and AVIPA-Plus have been implemented to promote licit crops in different regions of the country. The telecommunications sector in Afghanistan has seen significant growth since 2002, with the formation of several Afghan telecommunications firms and over $2 billion in private investment. This rapid development, supported by funding from various government agencies, has made telecommunications a key driver of the Afghan economy, contributing billions in tax revenues and providing employment opportunities. The national airline Ariana in Afghanistan is facing financial trouble due to corruption, affecting safety ratings and leading to a heavy debt load. Privately run airlines like Safi Air and Kam Air have been banned from EU airspace since 2010 over safety concerns. The U.S. military stopped contracting with Kam Air in 2013 due to alleged involvement in opium trafficking. Afghanistan's mining sector has been dormant since the Soviet invasion, with calls for more efforts to revive lucrative industries like minerals mining. The mining sector in Afghanistan has potential for lucrative industries like minerals mining, including copper, lapis lazuli, and lithium. Despite estimates of untapped minerals worth over $1 trillion, revenue has not materialized due to lack of infrastructure and investment. U.S. hopes for this sector as a driver of economic sustenance may be misplaced. The Afghan Cabinet approved a draft Law on Mines in February 2013, but the National Assembly has not acted on it. A major project with China Metallurgical Group to develop the Mes Aynak copper field has faced delays due to various factors, including the need to clear mines and excavate ancient artifacts. The Hajji Gak Iron Ore Project in Bamiyan Province, Afghanistan, involves an investment of nearly $11 billion and is expected to generate $200 million in annual government revenues by 2017. The project has not yet begun extraction, despite bids being submitted in September 2011. U.S. forces have set up small bases in the area to provide stability, but do not directly protect the project. The Hajji Gak Iron Ore Project in Bamiyan Province, Afghanistan, involves a significant investment and is expected to generate annual government revenues by 2017. SAIL denied reports in May 2015 about the project's progress, stating they had completed a cost-benefit assessment. Other mining projects in Afghanistan have been awarded to various companies. Afghanistan lacks a developed hydrocarbons energy sector, with no export industry and a small refining sector meeting domestic fuel needs. Afghanistan's fuel needs are mostly met by imports, with oil and gas accounting for a quarter of all imports. In March 2006, significant oil and gas reserves were announced, potentially making Afghanistan self-sufficient or even able to export. Major projects include the Angot field and Amu Darya basin, with China National Petroleum Co. awarded development rights in 2012. The field began producing at 5,000 barrels per day in 2013, with a potential of 145,000 barrels per day. The $3 billion development in Afghanistan includes the Angot field and Amu Darya basin, with China National Petroleum Co. awarded development rights in 2012. The field began producing at 5,000 barrels per day in early 2013, with a potential of 145,000 barrels per day. Additionally, there are large oil fields in Balkh Province and gas resources in northern Afghanistan being developed with USAID funding. A contract was awarded to the Turkish Petroleum Company to conduct gas drilling in northern Afghanistan, linking the natural gas field in Shehbergan to Mazar-e-Sharif. Test drills confirmed the presence of commercial gas reserves, with production expected to start in 5-7 years. USAID contributed $120 million to the $580 million project, which ended in 2016. Another project aims to develop filling stations and convert cars to use compressed natural gas (CNG) from the Shehbergan gas field. In March 2015, the US and Afghanistan formed a \"Joint Working Group\" to explore ways to support Afghanistan's integration into regional energy markets. In 2011, the Asian Development Bank agreed to finance a $7.5 billion Central Asia Gas Pipeline project passing through Afghanistan to Pakistan, with possible extensions into India. In 2014, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India signed an operational agreement on the $10 billion pipeline. Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan signed an operational agreement for a $10 billion gas pipeline project. India's participation is crucial for commercial viability. The project officially began in Turkmenistan in 2015, with work on the Pakistani section starting in 2017. Production is now expected to begin in 2021. The U.S. views this project favorably compared to a proposed gas pipeline from Iran to India via Pakistan. The U.S. aims to promote Afghanistan's trade relationships and regional economic integration. Afghanistan improved trade relationships through regional economic integration and bilateral agreements with neighbors. USAID funded a project to simplify customs clearance, reducing import time by 45%. Afghanistan joined the World Trade Organization in 2016. The U.S. and Afghanistan signed a trade agreement in 2004. The U.S. and Afghanistan signed a bilateral trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA), allowing duty free treatment for Afghan exports under the GSP program. The TIFA is a precursor to a potential free trade agreement, monitored by a joint TIFA Council. Another initiative is the establishment of joint Afghan-Pakistani Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs) for duty free imports into the U.S. Bills in Congress support these efforts. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to authorize duty-free treatment for imports from Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZs) designated by the President. President Obama endorsed these bills, but they were not included in the major Pakistan aid bill that became law."
