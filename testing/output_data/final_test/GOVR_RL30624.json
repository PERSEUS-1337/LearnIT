    "content": "The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornet strike fighters since FY1997, with Super Hornets and older Hornets making up the majority of aircraft in the Navy's active-duty aircraft carrier air wings. The Navy also began procuring the EA-18G Growler in FY2006 to replace older electronic attack aircraft. The Navy's proposed FY2012 budget includes funding for the procurement of 28 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and 12 EA-18G Growlers. This comes in the context of a projected shortfall in Navy and Marine Corps strike fighters. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a Navy strike fighter that addresses a projected shortfall in Navy and Marine Corps strike fighters. The Super Hornet is a more modern and capable version of the earlier F/A-18A/B/C/D Hornet and forms the core of the Navy's aircraft carrier air wings. The Navy is also procuring the F-35C to phase out Hornets. The Navy plans to phase out Hornets and include a mix of Super Hornets and F-35Cs in future CVWs. By FY2011, 489 F/A-18E/Fs were procured, with 28 more requested in the FY2012 budget at a cost of $2,369.0 million. The FY2012 budget requests $2,508.9 million for F/A-18E/F procurement, with an estimated average cost of $84.6 million per aircraft. A total of 556 F/A-18E/Fs are projected to be procured, with the final 39 aircraft to be acquired in FY2013-2014. This procurement plan exceeds the previous FY2011 budget submission by 41 aircraft. The Navy's FY2012 budget requests funding for 28 F/A-18E/F aircraft in FY2013, exceeding the previous budget by 41 aircraft. The F/A-18E/F was approved for export in 2001, with 24 sold to Australia in 2007. The EA-18G Growler, used for electronic warfare, shares the F/A-18F's airframe and avionics. The Navy is procuring EA-18Gs as replacements for aging aircraft. The Department of the Navy is procuring EA-18Gs as replacements for aging Navy and Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler electronic attack aircraft to protect aircraft in hostile airspace. The Navy's proposed FY2012 budget requests funding for 12 EA-18Gs, with a total procurement cost estimated at $1,134.4 million. This includes $55.1 million in prior-year advance procurement funding, leaving $1,079.4 million to be provided in FY2012. Additionally, $28.1 million in advance procurement funding is requested for future EA-18Gs, bringing the total procurement funding requested for FY2011 to $1,107.5 million. The Navy's FY2012 budget request includes funding for 12 EA-18Gs, with a projected fleet of 114 aircraft. Australia is considering purchasing EA-18Gs, with some F/A-18E/Fs being wired for potential conversion. The FY2012 budget submission analyzes a multiyear procurement plan for 107 F/A-18E/Fs and 58 EA-18Gs, estimating a cost avoidance of $580.9 million. The Navy and Marine Corps operate strike fighters, with the Navy planning to retire older Hornets and shift to Super Hornets and F-35Cs. The Navy operates about 380 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, while the Navy and Marine Corps together operate about 620 older F/A-18A-D Hornets and the Marine Corps operates about 125 AV-8B Harrier II aircraft. The Navy and Marine Corps plan to retire older Hornets and Harriers, replacing them with Super Hornets and F-35s. The current inventory of strike fighters falls short of requirements, with a projected shortfall of about 100 aircraft by 2018. To address this, the DOD is adding 41 aircraft to the F-18 force. The Navy faces a shortfall of 177 aircraft by 2017, with estimates reaching as high as 243 aircraft. Rear Admiral Allen G. Myers explained the forecasted shortfall in Strike Fighters for the Navy, ranging from 69 to 125 aircraft. Despite the current inventory being 60 planes short of the validated requirement of 1,240, Secretary Gates emphasized the need to focus on addressing gaps rather than just discussing requirements. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of evaluating criteria for requirements in a real-world context, rather than focusing solely on alleged gaps in military resources. The Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall could be impacted by extending the service life of F/A-18A-D Hornets to 8,600 hours through a High Flight Hour inspection effort. Further extension to 10,000 hours would require significant depot work and cost for a service life extension program. The Navy is planning a service-life extension program for F/A-18A-D Hornets to increase their flight hours from 8,600 to 10,000. The estimated cost for this program is over a billion dollars for 421 aircraft. This extension is expected to address the strike fighter shortfall, with projections showing a peak shortfall of 125 aircraft in 2017. The Navy projects a strike fighter shortfall if older F/A-18A-D Hornets are not extended to 10,000 flight hours, with a peak shortfall of 243 aircraft in 2018. Delays in HFH inspections may cause the shortfall to peak in 2015. Projections assume F-35 procurement will increase to 50 aircraft per year. The Navy is facing a projected strike fighter shortfall due to delays in HFH inspections and lower than assumed production rates. In March 2010, 104 Hornets were grounded for early cracks, with seven needing depot-level maintenance. To address the shortfall, the Navy is considering accelerating F-35C Joint Strike Fighter purchases. Lockheed Martin could potentially increase F-35 production by 30 additional aircraft. The company could increase F-35 production by 30 Navy aircraft in the future years defense plan. However, delays have pushed back the F-35 initial operating capability for the Navy to FY2016. The Marine Corps initially planned to address their shortfall by extending the life of Hornets, but now the F-35B delivery is delayed to around 2015. The projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, as discussed in Appendix B, is significant. Secretary Gates projected a shortfall of \"about a hundred aircraft,\" while the Navy's earlier estimate was as high as 243. This difference is more than two carriers' inventory of strike fighters. Congress can choose among proposals to address the shortfall, such as accelerating F-35 acquisition, SLEP more Hornets and Super Hornets, or retiring carriers and/or air wings. DOD has proposed acquiring 28 Super Hornets and 12 Growlers in FY2012 to mitigate the operational risks associated with the shortfall. Increasing the number of F/A-18E/Fs procured in FY2012 could reduce costs, extend the production line, and provide insurance against F-35 delays. However, opponents argue that this could lead to operational risks in other areas, restrict Navy combat capability, and not benefit the Marine Corps committed to F-35s. The House funded the F-18 program at requested levels, while the Senate cut $495 million and nine aircraft from the request for F/A-18E/Fs. The Navy increased the request for additional aircraft to reduce fighter shortfall to a manageable level of 65 aircraft. The committee recommends a reduction of $495.0 million and nine aircraft from the fiscal year 2012 authorization request for F/A-18E/F aircraft. H.R. 2219 also reduced the EA-18G request by $77.8 million for various cost growth reasons. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended cutting $63.5 million from the F/A-18E/F request for various cost growth reasons, including reductions in engineering change orders and multi-year procurement savings. Additionally, $99.7 million was cut from the request, with reductions in excess engineering change orders and government-furnished equipment costs. In FY2011, there were various funding adjustments made for different programs such as Logistics Support, Digital Communications System, Other support growth, and Net Centric Operations. Congressional action was summarized in Table A-1 regarding the procurement of EA-18Gs and F/A-18E/Fs. The House Armed Services Committee added $500 million to the president's request for 22 F/A-18E/Fs in the FY2011 defense authorization bill. The House report highlighted concerns about the Navy and Marine Corps' management of tactical aircraft inventory, emphasizing the need for operational risk mitigation. The committee expressed doubts about meeting future strike-fighter requirements if the current inventory management plan remains unchanged. The committee remains concerned with five areas of the Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft portfolio: strike-fighter inventory requirements, sustainment of the legacy fleet, operational risk levels, F\u201335B and F\u201335C affordability, and the closure of the F/A\u201318E/F production line. The committee is disappointed with how Navy officials have conveyed inventory requirements and estimated shortfalls, noting discrepancies in the actual shortfall of tactical fighters in the inventory. The committee is concerned about the inaccurate depiction of the shortfall of tactical fighters in the Navy and Marine Corps inventory. The ongoing development problems with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are noted, with delays and cost overruns. By fiscal year 2017, there could be a shortfall of 250 aircraft, equivalent to 5 carrier air wings. The committee will not support budget requests that do not address this shortfall. The committee recommends extending production of the F/A-18E/F series aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter shortfall. An increase of $500.0 million is recommended for the procurement of eight additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornet strike-fighters. The Marine Corps should consider procuring F/A-18E/F aircraft to resolve their strike-fighter inventory shortfall. The Senate report recommends a provision for the Secretary of the Navy to conduct a business case analysis comparing a service life extension program for legacy F/A-18 aircraft beyond 8,600 hours versus buying new F/A-18E/F aircraft. The analysis must be submitted to congressional defense committees before any SLEP effort can begin. The Department of the Navy is considering a SLEP for a portion of the F/A-18 fleet to manage the projected shortfall in tactical aircraft inventory. The Senate report recommends a provision for the Secretary of the Navy to conduct a business case analysis comparing a service life extension program for legacy F/A-18 aircraft beyond 8,600 hours versus buying new F/A-18E/F aircraft. This analysis must be submitted to congressional defense committees before any SLEP effort can begin. The Department of the Navy is planning to ask for funding to extend the service life of F/A-18 aircraft in fiscal year 2012 and will start reducing the size of its land-based F/A-18 squadrons in fiscal year. The Navy plans to reduce the size of its land-based F/A-18 squadrons in fiscal year 2012. They also intend to reduce squadron sizes for expeditionary F/A-18 squadrons from 12 to 10 planes starting in fiscal year 2011. However, the committee is concerned about the lack of operational risk assessment and analysis for these reductions. They recommend making final decisions only after completing these analyses and reporting to congressional defense committees. The Navy plans to reduce the size of its F/A-18 squadrons in fiscal year 2012, with expeditionary squadrons decreasing from 12 to 10 planes in fiscal year 2011. The committee is concerned about the lack of operational risk assessment for these reductions and recommends making final decisions after completing analyses and reporting to congressional defense committees. The committee also recommends amending the National Defense Authorization Act to reflect delays in meeting contract dates for F/A-18 aircraft procurement. The committee recommends authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to sign a multiyear contract for F/A-18 aircraft despite delays, citing substantial savings identified by the Secretary of Defense. This decision is not seen as setting a precedent for future acquisitions, but is deemed necessary given challenges in managing tactical aviation shortfall. The committee approves the Department's proposal to implement cost reduction initiatives, avoid certain cost sources, and adopt a fixed price-type contract for F-18 aircraft procurement. The Navy's budget request includes funds for EA-18G and F/A-18E/F aircraft purchases, with potential savings from a proposed multiyear contract for F-18s. The committee recommends a $130.5 million reduction to the budget request for F-18 aircraft procurement, with savings of $45.9 million for EA-18G and $84.6 million for F/A-18E/F. The budget request includes funds for purchasing 22 F/A-18E/F aircraft, an increase from previous years due to concerns about aircraft inventory gaps. The committee raised concerns about a projected shortfall in Navy tactical aviation, with a potential gap of up to 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. The Navy now projects a maximum shortfall of around 150 aircraft through management techniques. The committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense has not made any decisions on force structure despite promises to review tactical aircraft force structure in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. They are seeking details behind the changed assumptions that lead to new estimates, such as changing the fielding plan for the Marine Corps F\u201335B. The committee is concerned about the changes in assumptions regarding tactical aircraft force structure, particularly the decision to reduce the number of AV-8B aircraft. They question the impact on war fighting capability and fear arbitrary modifications to requirements. The Navy has not yet decided on a service life extension program for older F/A-18s. The committee expects the Navy to present a business case analysis for addressing the potential shortfall of aircraft, including SLEP and new procurement, with an estimated cost of $26.0 million per plane for extending the life of legacy F/A-18s. They are encouraged by the increase in F/A-18E/F procurement in the fiscal year budget to achieve substantial savings through a multiyear procurement contract. The Navy is working on negotiating a multiyear contract for F/A-18E/F aircraft to save money. The committee recommends buying six additional aircraft in fiscal year 2011 to address potential delays in the F-35 program. The Senate reduced funding for the EA-18G by $45.9 million in the FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act. The Senate reduced funding for the EA-18G by $45.9 million and for the F/A-18E/F by $84.6 million in S. 3800 for \"savings from multiyear procurement.\" The F-18 program overall was reduced by $9.4 million for \"unjustified cost growth.\" Additionally, the F-18 Squadrons line in Research and Development, Navy was increased by $3.2 million for \"High Performance Military Aircraft Noise Reduction.\" S. 3800 also included a general rescission from funds appropriated for the F-18 program in FY2009 of $14.1 million. H.R. 1473 provided DOD funding for FY2011, including $495.0 million for 9 F/A-18E/Fs. It cut funds from various accounts, totaling $195.9 million for different purposes within the F-18 program. H.R. 1473 increased the F-18 program budget by $287.7 million, including $2.5 million for unjustified cost growth and $9.4 million for a strike fighter shortfall. A hearing on naval aviation programs in May 2009 addressed the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter inventory issues. Representative Gene Taylor outlined program and policy concerns for the Navy and Marine Corps strike fighter inventory. Defense committees have heard testimony about an impending strike fighter shortfall, predicted to peak in the next decade. Analysis shows a peak shortage of 312 aircraft in fiscal year 2018, with a disconnect between the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Department of the Navy on this issue. OSD claims there is no shortfall, but will use the Quadrennial Defense Review to support their predetermined answer. The Department of the Navy is facing a significant strike fighter shortfall, with a predicted peak shortage of 312 aircraft in fiscal year 2018. The Chief of Naval Operations testified to a fighter shortfall of approximately 125 planes. Representative Todd Akin questions the position of the Department of the Navy on this issue, emphasizing the importance of aircraft carriers having an embarked air wing. The Navy is facing a fighter shortfall of over 240 planes, which could increase to over 300 if full requirements are not met. This would leave five carriers without fighter aircraft or limit the number available for training, posing a significant strategic risk. The budget cuts in buying Super Hornets could worsen the shortfall. The Navy is facing a fighter shortfall of over 240 planes, which could increase to over 300 if full requirements are not met. The budget cuts in buying Super Hornets could worsen the shortfall, with the Navy only asking for nine Super Hornets despite needing more planes. Congress has been struggling with the issue, as the Department of Defense has not been transparent or compliant with required reports and plans. The Department of Defense has not been transparent or compliant with required reports and plans, leading to a fighter shortfall of over 240 planes for the Navy. Congress is concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability in the defense program's budget. The Department of Defense is facing a fighter shortfall of over 240 planes for the Navy due to retiring aircraft with high hours. Congress is concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability in the defense program's budget. The Department of Defense is facing a fighter shortfall of over 240 planes for the Navy due to retiring aircraft with high hours. Concerns have been raised about the impact on training and readiness with fewer planes available for practice missions. The question is also raised about the effectiveness of an aircraft carrier with fewer aircraft onboard. The Department of Defense is facing a fighter shortfall of over 240 planes for the Navy due to retiring aircraft with high hours. Last year, there was a forecasted Strike Fighter shortfall with the U.S. Navy of 69 aircraft and the Department of Navy, 125. The numbers have changed since then, with potential shortfalls of 125 and 243 aircraft. The analysis for service life extension of aircraft has revealed multiple focus areas for when they go to the depot. The exact number of aircraft that can be processed is uncertain, with 39 aircraft already through the depot and 50 additional areas of interest identified. Each aircraft will have unique needs as they undergo maintenance. The Navy currently has the necessary aircraft for missions. The focus is on understanding the Strike Fighter shortfall and how to mitigate it through support for Joint Strike Fighter, F-18 EF buys, funding for logistics, and assessing the number of F-18s that can be utilized. The Navy's focus is on understanding the Strike Fighter shortfall and mitigating it through support for Joint Strike Fighter, F-18 EF buys, and assessing the number of F-18s that can be utilized. The requirement for carriers is 44 Strike Fighters for effective operations. Deploying carriers with significantly fewer planes is not ideal. The Navy's focus is on understanding the Strike Fighter shortfall and mitigating it through support for Joint Strike Fighter, F-18 EF buys, and assessing the number of F-18s that can be utilized. The requirement for carriers is 44 Strike Fighters for effective operations. When asked about potential shortfalls, the response indicated that decisions on carrier airwing loadouts are made by fleet commanders based on combatant commander needs. The current focus remains on meeting the requirement of 44 aircraft carriers. The Navy is working to address the Strike Fighter shortfall by supporting Joint Strike Fighter and F-18 EF buys. The number of F-18s that can be utilized is being assessed. The focus is on meeting the requirement of 44 aircraft carriers. There is ongoing analysis to determine the exact number of planes falling within a certain range, with the possibility of some falling outside that range. The bracket is the best information we have at the moment regarding aircraft repairs. Costs for repairs vary, with a center barrel costing around $5 million and an inner wing costing up to $4-5 million. The focus is on aircraft that have gone through the depot, but it is uncertain if all aircraft will require these repairs. The cost of aircraft repairs varies, with a center barrel costing around $5 million and an inner wing costing up to $4-5 million. It is uncertain if all aircraft that go through the depot will need these repairs. The current cost estimate for extending the service life of the aircraft is unknown, as it depends on the individual plane. The analysis is expected to be completed by March 2010 to feed into future planning. The Navy completed analysis on benefits of multiyear procurement of F-18As, saving $710 million in first multiyear for 210 aircraft and $1.1 billion in second multiyear for economic ordered quantities. In a discussion about multiyear procurement, the speaker emphasizes the need for economic ordered quantities and a lengthy period of time to achieve a return on investment. Significant savings of around 10 percent or $500 million are targeted in a multiyear procurement. The conversation also touches on the savings achieved in multiyear one and two, with a focus on the importance of a five-year timeframe for economic order quantity buy. In 2010, there are concerns about the JSF program meeting its 2015 deadline. The discussion revolves around the economic order quantity needed for procurement and the challenges of incorporating single-year buys into multiyear contracts. The focus shifts to the timeframe from 2011 to 2015 and the uncertainty surrounding the JSF's availability by 2015. The discussion revolves around the challenges of incorporating single-year buys into multiyear contracts for the Marine Corps and Navy programs. There is uncertainty about the department's direction on aircraft numbers and timelines, hindering the ability to enter into a multiyear agreement. The goal is to pursue multiyear contracts aggressively for programs like B22, 60 Romeo, and 60 Sierras. The discussion focuses on the need for planning and clarity on aircraft numbers for the Marine Corps and Navy programs. There is concern about the aging Harriers and the importance of the STOVL version. The issue of fighter plane shortages is highlighted, prompting the hearing to address the current status. General Myers corrects the number range for the U.S. Navy's aircraft from \"69 to 129.\" The discussion addresses the need for clarity on aircraft numbers for the Marine Corps and Navy programs, focusing on the shortage of fighter planes. General Myers corrects the U.S. Navy's aircraft range to \"69 to 129.\" Architzel mentions the need for 30 aircraft per year for five years to achieve 10 percent savings in a multiyear production plan. Architzel explains that significant savings can be achieved in a multiyear production plan by purchasing 150 aircraft over five years. This quantity allows for economic order quantity buys and assures a 10 percent savings. Architzel suggests significant savings can be made through a multiyear production plan by purchasing 150 aircraft over five years, leading to economic order quantity buys and a 10 percent cost reduction. Myers highlights a shortfall of about 70 aircraft for U.S. carriers based on PB '09 data, with ongoing discovery and options to address the issue. The numbers provided include both Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, with the PB '09 figures no longer considered relevant. Architzel discusses potential savings through a multiyear production plan, proposing the purchase of 150 aircraft over five years for cost reduction. There is a shortfall of about 70 aircraft for U.S. carriers based on PB '09 data, with ongoing efforts to address the issue. The service life assessment and extension program for existing A through D Hornets is in progress, with approximately 330 identified as \"prime candidates\" for extension. Architzel identifies 330 out of 623 existing A through D Hornets as prime candidates for extension, with no technical impediments. Additional funding may be required on a case by case basis for extensions, with variability in costs depending on the area of interest. Options for wings include repair or replacement, with costs provided for new wings by the admiral. The Marine Corps is considering options for extending the life of existing A through D Hornets, with 330 aircraft identified as candidates for extension. The options include repairing, removing and replacing wings, or taking wings from the \"Boneyard\" and replacing them for free. There is uncertainty regarding the cost of addressing issues in the aft-end of the aircraft. Additionally, there are four F/A 18 fighter squadrons with no allocated aircraft, which were not included in the shortfall assessment. The Marine Corps proactively cadre fighter attack squadrons in anticipation of the Joint Strike Fighter arrival. Transitioning to the V-22 highlighted the need for a manpower pool for aircraft changes. The first fleet readiness squadron, VMFAT-501, will stand up this summer with selected aviators. The Marine Corps is proactively cadre fighter attack squadrons in anticipation of the Joint Strike Fighter arrival. The first fleet readiness squadron, VMFAT-501, will stand up this summer with selected aviators. Plans are in place to bring back active cadre squadrons as Joint Strike Fighter squadrons in 2012 and 2013, while reserve cadre squadrons will be brought back later in the transition. The strategic decision made three years ago involved reducing squadrons from four to two to account for the transition and reduced aircraft availability. Trautman explains the challenges of transitioning between aircraft and the decision to set aside a manpower pool. Akin questions the ability to maintain half strength during the transition, highlighting the higher operational tempo for Marine TacAir. Trautman acknowledges the risk but states they are meeting current obligations. Trautman discusses the proactive decision to set aside a manpower pool for the Joint Strike Fighter in 2012 and '13. Akin questions the availability of old aircraft for squadrons, including the possibility of reworking some F-18s depending on analysis. Trautman discusses the uncertainty of estimating the cost of extending a Hornet from 8,000 to 10,000 hours due to the ongoing phase B process. Akin questions the cost effectiveness of reworking F-18s compared to acquiring new ones, mentioning lower cost estimates and inquiring about the central component, the center barrel. Trautman explains that $1.1 billion is already allocated for 417 center barrels, serving as a risk mitigator for service life expansions. Akin raises concerns about the cost implications of replacing center barrels and wing sections, to which Trautman suggests that if the center barrel is budgeted, replacing 24 wings would incur no additional costs. Admiral Architzel and Admiral Myers discuss the cost of replacing center barrels and wings for Hornets. The estimated cost for a center barrel replacement is $2.5 million, while the cost for wing replacements is being quoted at $4.5 million. The cost of replacing center barrels and wings for Hornets is estimated at $2.5 million and $4.5 million respectively. Additional costs may be incurred for reworking existing wings and high-flying hour inspections, which can exceed $75 million. It is uncertain what will be found in the airplanes during inspections. The cost of replacing center barrels and wings for Hornets is estimated at $2.5 million and $4.5 million respectively. Additional costs may be incurred for reworking existing wings and high-flying hour inspections, which can exceed $75 million. The current shortfall in fighter aircraft is about 70, but the exact cost per aircraft is unknown until inspections are done. The analysis presented by Admiral Myers indicates a shortfall in fighter aircraft starting in mid- to later-2013, peaking in 2016 to 2017. The ongoing process involves refining technical baseline and cost estimates to determine the feasible options. Last year's estimates were based on 295 aircraft, with current efforts focused on better understanding the requirements. The current analysis shows a shortfall in fighter aircraft starting in mid- to later-2013, peaking in 2016 to 2017. The number of aircraft targeted for Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) has increased to about 330, with more information expected by next March. The focus is not only on SLEPing aircraft but also on maintaining the JSF buy, logistics support for the current fleet, and the F/A-18E/F buy. The discussion revolves around the total number of fighter aircraft and the analysis being conducted to address potential shortfalls. The numbers mentioned in a chart are being reviewed for accuracy, with updates expected in the future. The focus is on understanding assumptions that could impact these numbers and making necessary adjustments. The timeline for when more concrete information will be available is estimated to be within the next year or by next March. The discussion involves analyzing fighter aircraft numbers and potential shortfalls. Updates are being made to ensure accuracy in the data, with a focus on adjusting assumptions that could affect the figures. Concrete information is expected within the next year or by next March. The model for aircraft deployment efficiency is being reviewed by the Marines and U.S. Navy to improve warfighter support. The discussion with TRAUTMAN focuses on the need for more current and reliable information regarding F-35 production numbers and future projections. AKIN seeks clarity on when accurate numbers will be available, aiming for a +/- 10 percent margin by the end of summer or March of next year. TRAUTMAN commits to providing updated information after consulting with leadership. AKIN and TRAUTMAN discuss the need for accurate F-35 production numbers and budget planning. AKIN emphasizes the importance of having reliable information to work with. TRAUTMAN acknowledges the need for updated information and commits to providing it after consulting with leadership."
