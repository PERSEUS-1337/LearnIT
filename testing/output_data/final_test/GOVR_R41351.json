    "content": "Housing counseling organizations provide information on housing issues to various populations, including prospective homebuyers, homeowners, renters, and the homeless. The federal government supports private housing counseling agencies through financial assistance primarily from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD certifies agencies meeting specific criteria and provides funding through competitive grants. HUD provides competitive grants to certified housing counseling agencies, but not all certified agencies are guaranteed funding. Grants do not cover full costs, with agencies relying on other funding sources. Funding for HUD's housing counseling program fluctuates annually, with increases seen over the last decade. Congress did not allocate funding for the program in FY2011 but resumed in FY2012. Additional funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling has been provided separately since FY2008. NeighborWorks America has been receiving funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling since FY2008 through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. Various government agencies, including HUD, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Defense, provide support for housing counseling aimed at specific groups. Housing counseling is often required for participation in certain programs. The federal government supports housing counseling by requiring it for certain programs, increasing demand for counseling. However, agencies may need to counsel more people with less time and money. This report outlines how housing counseling organizations become eligible for federal funds, particularly through HUD, and how the funds are distributed. Housing counseling is related to financial literacy counseling, helping individuals manage finances and make sound decisions. It can be provided alongside financial counseling, with some overlap between the two. Financial literacy counseling can include information on housing and homeownership, but housing counseling focuses specifically on housing-related decisions. Some organizations offer both types of counseling, while others focus on one. Housing counseling covers a range of activities for different populations with various housing goals. Housing counseling targets various groups such as homebuyers, current homeowners, renters, the homeless, and senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. It can include pre-purchase counseling for first-time homebuyers and post-purchase counseling on topics like maintenance, budgeting, and mortgage delinquency. Counseling topics vary and are not standardized across the industry. Housing counseling covers a range of issues for different groups, including renters, Section 8 voucher holders, the homeless, and senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. Counseling can help with navigating housing programs, fair housing laws, and finding suitable housing. Possible alternatives to reverse mortgages can be provided through housing counseling, which can be offered in various settings such as individual or group sessions, in person or over the telephone, and can vary in length from one session to several spread out over weeks or months. HUD generally recommends individual, face-to-face counseling for housing issues. HUD generally prefers individual, face-to-face counseling for housing issues, but allows for other forms of counseling in certain situations. These include counseling over the phone for seniors or persons with disabilities, and group education classes for those unable to travel for in-person sessions. Counseling is seen as beneficial in housing programs. Supporters of housing counseling programs believe that counseling can help households achieve positive housing outcomes such as making sound decisions regarding homes and mortgages, avoiding default or foreclosure, and assisting renters in finding suitable housing units. Pre-purchase counseling for homebuyers is seen as beneficial in preparing them to understand mortgage terms and responsibilities of homeownership. Housing counseling programs aim to prevent mortgage default by helping households manage circumstances that could lead to default. Critics argue that the effectiveness of housing counseling is not well-established due to limited research on outcomes. There is little consensus on the effectiveness of housing counseling and what constitutes a successful outcome. Pre-purchase counseling often occurs after a borrower has already chosen a home and mortgage, potentially limiting its benefits. Housing counseling is voluntary for various populations, but some federal programs require it, such as Section 255 of the National Housing Act for senior citizens. Section 255 of the National Housing Act mandates housing counseling for senior citizens to qualify for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a reverse mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The USDA also requires housing counseling for first-time homebuyers under its Section 502 direct loan program. Additionally, housing counseling is a prerequisite for participation in HUD's Homeownership Voucher Program, an extension of the Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8), allowing some first-time homebuyers to use vouchers for monthly payments on a purchased home. Housing counseling is mandatory for certain participants in the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) to prevent foreclosures by modifying loans. Participants with a debt-to-income ratio of 55% or higher post-modification must receive counseling. Homebuyers using funds from the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) must also undergo housing counseling. The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) allocate 10% of their net income annually for the Affordable Housing Program (AHP), which includes a competitive grant program and a voluntary homeownership set-aside program. Housing counseling is required for first-time homebuyers assisted through the AHP. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also mandate housing counseling for certain borrowers using their affordable mortgage products. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require housing counseling for certain borrowers using their affordable mortgage products. State housing finance agencies offer low-cost mortgage programs for low- or moderate-income households, often encouraging housing counseling for participants. Some programs may require counseling for specific subsets of homebuyers, such as those receiving downpayment assistance or first-time homebuyers. FHA generally does not require counseling except for HECMs. The Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to require pre-purchase housing counseling for borrowers of high-cost mortgages. FHA has the authority to charge lower insurance premiums to borrowers who receive counseling but currently charges the same premiums to all homebuyers. Most people seek housing counseling voluntarily to be eligible for certain mortgage products. HUD-approved agencies primarily assist prospective homebuyers and homeowners, with a small portion of counseling activities focused on renters and the homeless. In FY2011, rental counseling accounted for 15% and counseling for the homeless accounted for 2% of total counseling activities. Housing counseling is provided by various organizations, including for-profit and nonprofit agencies. Only nonprofit organizations certified by HUD are eligible for HUD grants. Agencies vary in size and mission, with some specializing in housing counseling and others having broader missions. Some agencies focus on specific types of housing counseling. Some housing counseling agencies specialize in specific types of counseling, while others offer comprehensive counseling on various housing issues. HUD-approved agencies must be nonprofit organizations, but a significant portion of housing counseling is also provided by for-profit entities like banks and mortgage insurers. HUD-approved agencies may provide individualized in-person counseling, while non-approved agencies may offer more telephone counseling or group education classes. There are no standardized curricula or training requirements for housing counselors, but NeighborWorks America has attempted to standardize training in the past. NeighborWorks America promotes standardized requirements for housing counseling through its NeighborWorks Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling. Studies on the effectiveness of housing counseling have been limited in scope, with some early studies funded by HUD in the 1970s and 1980s showing evidence of positive outcomes. Some early studies funded by HUD in the 1970s and 1980s found evidence that pre-purchase and post-purchase counseling could reduce default or foreclosure rates. However, these studies had limited focus, varied definitions of success, and methodological issues. A 2001 review described the results as \"highly ambiguous.\" Few empirical studies on housing counseling effectiveness were done until the mid- to late 1990s. Since then, new studies have been conducted to assess whether housing counseling achieves desired outcomes. Abdighani Hirad and Peter M. Zorn studied the impact of housing counseling on reducing default rates among homeowners with Freddie Mac's Affordable Gold mortgage product. They found that pre-purchase counseling decreased the likelihood of borrowers becoming delinquent on their mortgage. Face-to-face counseling was more effective than phone or self-study methods. Studies over the past 15 years support the effectiveness of pre-purchase and post-purchase education and counseling in reducing delinquency rates. Some studies suggest positive effects from pre- and post-purchase housing counseling, but research faces challenges in attributing these effects solely to counseling. Issues include a lack of data tracking counseling recipients and outcomes, as well as difficulties in defining housing counseling and measuring its effectiveness. Overall, housing counseling lacks a standard curriculum or method, making it challenging to generalize its effectiveness. While some evidence suggests positive outcomes for borrowers and lenders, more empirical work is needed to fully understand its impact on housing outcomes. The federal government supports housing counseling through HUD's Housing Counseling Assistance Program by certifying agencies and providing grants. The program's history, types of certified agencies, criteria for certification, and funding process are outlined under legislative authority at 12 U.S.C. Section 1701x. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 authorized HUD to provide advice and technical assistance for housing for low- and moderate-income families. It also allowed for counseling services for homebuyers in federal housing programs. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 expanded HUD's housing counseling services to include renters and homeowners, not just those in specific housing programs. It also allowed HUD to provide monetary grants to housing counseling agencies for the first time. HUD expanded its housing counseling services in 1974 to include renters and homeowners, allowing the agency to provide grants to organizations for counseling services. HUD can now contract with public or private organizations for counseling services, in addition to providing counseling directly. Since 1974, HUD has been authorized to provide grants for housing counseling, with regular funding starting in FY1977. Funding has been provided every year except FY2011. HUD certifies different types of housing counseling agencies, including state housing finance agencies, to be eligible for grants. HUD certifies four types of housing counseling agencies: local housing counseling agencies, multi-state organizations, regional intermediaries, and national intermediaries. Local housing counseling agencies and multi-state organizations provide counseling services directly to clients within limited geographic areas, while regional and national intermediaries cover broader areas through a network of branches and affiliates. Regional and national intermediaries, defined by HUD as agencies that operate housing counseling programs through branches and affiliates in specific regions or multiple regions, provide administrative and financial support services to their affiliates. They help in applying for and distributing HUD funding to offer housing counseling directly to individuals. State Housing Finance Agencies (SHFAs) are eligible for HUD housing counseling funding and are established to address affordable housing needs in their states. They administer various federal and state housing programs without needing HUD certification. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies can apply for funding, with the application process being similar for different types of agencies. HUD approval for housing counseling organizations requires meeting specific criteria: being a tax-exempt nonprofit organization with at least one year of experience in the geographic area they plan to operate, having adequate resources, and meeting other requirements. The agency seeking HUD approval must have adequate resources, including funding and trained staff with relevant experience. They must also have appropriate facilities, be familiar with housing programs, have relationships with community resources, and have reporting and monitoring systems in place. The agency seeking HUD approval must have an automated client management system compatible with HUD's databases. They must not be suspended or debarred, indicted for a crime limiting their counseling program, or have unresolved federal investigation findings. The agency must provide housing counseling directly, meet state and local requirements, and follow specific approval processes. The process for HUD approval differs for LHCA, MSO, and national/regional intermediaries. LHCA submits preliminary and final applications to a regional HUD Homeownership Center, while others submit a single application to HUD headquarters. Approved agencies are authorized for up to three years and undergo periodic performance reviews by HUD. Housing counseling agencies can be unconditionally reapproved, conditionally reapproved, placed on inactive status, or terminated from the HUD program based on performance reviews. Branch offices and affiliates do not need separate approval from HUD, but must meet criteria for approval. LHCA, MSO, or intermediaries applying for HUD approval must include branches and affiliates in their application. State housing finance agencies do not need HUD approval to receive housing counseling funds. HUD-approved agencies are expected to provide individualized, face-to-face counseling to homebuyers, homeowners, and tenants. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies must provide individualized, face-to-face counseling to clients, with the option for telephone counseling if preferred. They are also required to offer group educational sessions and refer clients to other agencies if they cannot provide specific services. Counseling fees may be charged under certain circumstances, but services must be provided free of charge for clients unable to pay. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide free counseling services to clients unable to pay, funded through HUD grants. Agencies can accept fees from lenders but must disclose them to clients. Each agency must submit a housing counseling work plan outlining services for the community. Minimum client counseling requirements exist, except for agencies offering only reverse mortgage counseling. Congress has regularly funded HUD for housing counseling since FY1977, except for FY2011. Funding for HUD's housing counseling program has fluctuated over the years, with appropriations generally staying flat during the 1980s, trending upward in the 1990s, and rising sharply in FY2003. After remaining flat for a few years, funding began to rise again in FY2008, peaking in FY2011 when Congress did not provide any funding. Funding resumed in FY2012 but at a lower amount. Policymakers' interest in housing counseling has varied in response to housing program results and policy changes. Interest in housing counseling increased in the 1990s due to national housing policy goals focusing on increasing homeownership rates, especially among low-income and minority groups. This was driven by new requirements encouraging mortgage lending to underserved populations, including amendments to the Community Reinvestment Act and Affordable Housing Goals set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As a result, lenders showed greater interest in lending to traditionally marginalized borrowers. Congressional appropriations for housing counseling rose significantly in the mid- to late 1990s and again in FY2003, driven by increased interest in lending to underserved populations. This funding increase was attributed to the high demand for housing counseling, the need for training, and support for new homeownership initiatives. In response to the increase in foreclosures starting in 2006, Congressional appropriations for housing counseling rose in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010. This increase was aimed at providing more funding for delinquency and default counseling to help homeowners avoid foreclosure and for pre-purchase counseling to prevent future foreclosures. However, in FY2011, Congress did not allocate funding for HUD's housing counseling program due to the fiscal environment for discretionary spending. HUD's housing counseling program faced challenges in FY2011 due to delays in fund distribution and concerns over duplicative funding. Critics argued that the funding overlapped with NeighborWorks America's foreclosure mitigation counseling, while supporters highlighted the program's versatility in offering various counseling services. The FY2012 HUD appropriations law provided $45 million for HUD's housing counseling program, the lowest funding level since FY2007. The President's budget for FY2013 requests $55 million for housing counseling. HUD-certified agencies are eligible for competitive grants, but not all will receive funding. HUD announces grant opportunities for housing counseling funds in a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). HUD-approved agencies can apply for grants for specific counseling categories, awarded competitively. Maximum grant amounts are set by HUD. LHCAs and MSOs apply directly for grants to support their counseling programs. Intermediaries receiving grants pass on funding to their branches or affiliates. HUD-approved intermediaries can pass on housing counseling funds to their branches or affiliates without the need for separate approval from HUD. Branches or affiliates may also be HUD-certified as LHCAs or MSOs and can apply for funding directly or through the intermediary. However, they cannot double dip by applying for funds both ways in the same year. Local housing counseling agencies may choose to receive funding as a branch or affiliate for various reasons. Local housing counseling agencies may choose to receive funding as a branch or affiliate of an intermediary for various reasons, such as easier application processes and potential for increased funding. Agencies are evaluated based on criteria outlined in HUD's NOFA, including capacity, geographic need, program quality, resource leverage, and results. Grant amounts are determined by the points awarded, with agencies needing a minimum number of points to be eligible for HUD funding. The distribution of HUD's housing counseling grants is based on the number of points awarded to agencies. Grant amounts are determined by the agency's request or points scored. Funding trends vary for different types of agencies and counseling. HUD may fund more agencies with smaller grants or fewer agencies with larger grants, depending on funding appropriations and priorities. In FY2012, HUD awarded nearly 540 housing counseling grants to various organizations, which was about 100 fewer grants than in FY2010. The number of grants awarded may differ from the number of organizations receiving grants, as some may receive multiple grants for different types of counseling services. In FY2012, HUD awarded around 540 housing counseling grants to local agencies, intermediaries, and state housing finance agencies. The number of distinct organizations receiving HUD funding varied between approximately 360 to 515 between FY2004 and FY2010, before decreasing to about 470 in FY2012. In FY2012, HUD awarded funding to around 470 distinct agencies, with intermediaries receiving a larger total amount of funding compared to local housing counseling agencies and state housing finance agencies. Intermediaries received almost $28 million, LHCAs received almost $12 million, and SHFAs received about $2.5 million in FY2012. The average grant size for an intermediary was about $700,000, for an LHCA was about $24,000, and for an SHFA was about $168,000 in FY2012. The average grant amounts for housing counseling in FY2010 reflected lower funding in FY2012. HUD primarily awards grants for comprehensive counseling, with funding increasing from $31.5 million in FY2004 to $54 million in FY2010 before decreasing to $36 million in FY2012. The number of grants for comprehensive counseling also increased from 360 in FY2004 to 510 in FY2010, then dropped to nearly 470 in FY2012. The average grant size fluctuated between $77,000 in FY2012 and over $107,000 in FY2008. The average grant size for comprehensive counseling fluctuated from $77,000 in FY2012 to over $107,000 in FY2008. Funding for specialized counseling varied from $3 million in FY2006 to nearly $19 million in FY2010. HUD's total awards for specialized counseling have changed over the years. HUD's specialized counseling grants have evolved over the years. In FY2004 and FY2005, grants were awarded for homeownership voucher, predatory lending, and colonias counseling. In FY2006, only HECM counseling grants were awarded. Subsequent years saw funding for HECM, housing counseling training, and loan document review counseling. By FY2010, grants included Mortgage Modification and Mortgage Scams Assistance (MMSA) counseling. In FY2012, grants were primarily for HECM and housing counseling training, totaling almost $4 million. In FY2012, HUD awarded almost $4 million to 57 local housing counseling agencies and 9 intermediaries for HECM counseling. Additionally, $2 million was awarded for housing counseling training to three intermediaries. The majority of counseling activities focused on homeownership counseling, including pre-purchase, mortgage delinquency, and post-purchase counseling. In FY2010, about 85% of counseling activities assisted with HUD grants were related to homeownership. In FY2010, homeownership counseling accounted for over 80% of counseling activities, with mortgage delinquency counseling making up about 65% of total counseling activities at HUD-approved agencies. Pre-purchase and rental counseling each accounted for 10-15% of activities, while other post-purchase counseling accounted for under 10%, and homelessness counseling for under 2%. In FY2011, mortgage delinquency counseling accounted for about 56% of total counseling activities, while pre-purchase, post-purchase, and rental counseling each accounted for 10-15%. Homelessness counseling was just over 2%. The total number of counseling units provided by HUD-approved agencies decreased to 1.4 million from 2.2 million in FY2011. Funding for housing counseling primarily comes from HUD's housing counseling program, with additional support from other federal sources. NeighborWorks America, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Defense also provide federal funds for housing counseling. NeighborWorks administers federal funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling. HUD's Community Development Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnerships Program allow funding for housing counseling under certain circumstances. States and localities receive funds from block grant programs like HOME and CDBG, which can be used for affordable housing and community development activities. Some of these funds can also be allocated for housing counseling, with HOME funds primarily for counseling homeowners benefiting from HOME-assisted housing and CDBG funds for supporting HOME-assisted projects. Additionally, CDBG funds can be used for fair housing initiatives. NeighborWorks America, established by Congress in 1978, is a nonprofit corporation with a national network of organizations focused on community revitalization and affordable housing. It operates under the name NeighborWorks America since 2005, with over 235 affiliates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To become an affiliate, organizations must meet certain criteria. NeighborWorks America, established by Congress in 1978, has a national network of over 235 affiliates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Organizations must meet criteria to become an affiliate, which can take up to two years. Affiliates are eligible for funding and technical assistance. NeighborWorks receives congressional appropriations for various housing counseling programs, including the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program. NeighborWorks America uses its regular appropriation to provide grants, training, and technical assistance to its network of affiliates, including housing counseling activities. While not specifically dedicated to housing counseling, NeighborWorks also receives housing counseling grants from HUD and passes this funding on to its affiliates. Additionally, NeighborWorks is a leader in housing counseling training. NeighborWorks administers funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling separate from its regular appropriation. Congress provided funding for housing counseling as foreclosures increased, leading to the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). NFMCP funding is distributed competitively to HUD-approved intermediaries, state agencies, or NeighborWorks affiliates. NeighborWorks administers funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), which receives funding from Congress. The NFMCP funding is distributed to HUD-approved intermediaries, state agencies, or NeighborWorks affiliates. Congress has provided funding for the NFMCP multiple times since its inception in 2008, with varying levels of funding each year. NeighborWorks, through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), has distributed funding to over 170 organizations by 2011, providing counseling to 1.2 million homeowners. States like California, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois received the most assistance. The Department of Veterans Affairs also offers loan counselors to help veterans facing foreclosure, in addition to HUD's housing counseling program. The VA recommends veterans consider pre-purchase counseling with HUD-approved housing counselors for VA-guaranteed loans. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created a program for financial literacy counseling for prospective homebuyers. This program focuses on housing-related decisions and aims to help homebuyers with budgeting, credit improvement, and savings. The Financial Education and Counseling pilot program, funded by Congress with $2 million in FY2009, is administered by the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund. Organizations receiving grants must be HUD-approved housing counseling agencies or approved by Treasury's Office of Financial Education. Applicants must demonstrate experience and capacity to conduct financial education and counseling programs. In FY2009, Congress provided $2 million for the Financial Education and Counseling pilot program administered by the CDFI Fund. $4.15 million was allocated in FY2010, with $3.15 million designated for an organization in Hawaii. Funding recipients were announced in October 2010. No funding was provided in FY2011 or FY2012. P.L. 110-289 directed the Department of Defense to establish a foreclosure counseling program for servicemembers returning from active duty. HUD was also directed to conduct a demonstration program on pre-purchase counseling effectiveness. The effectiveness of various forms of housing counseling for first-time homebuyers with FHA-insured loans is being studied through a demonstration program. Funding from HUD's Transformation Initiative is being used for this study, which involves 4,000 participants and is being carried out by Abt Associates. Securing adequate funding is a common challenge for housing counseling agencies. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies face funding challenges, with HUD funding accounting for only 13.5% of total funding. Other sources of funding include federal programs and state/local governments. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies receive funding from various sources including federal programs, state and local governments, financial institutions, foundations, public housing authorities, and government-sponsored enterprises. The amount of total funding from these sources ranges from under 1.5% to nearly 12.5%. Additionally, funds from HUD's HOME program and CDBG can be used for housing counseling in some cases. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies receive funding from various sources, including federal programs, state and local governments, financial institutions, foundations, public housing authorities, and government-sponsored enterprises. Federal sources account for about 37.5% of agencies' funding, with just under 25% coming from sources other than HUD's housing counseling program. Fees from clients make up a small portion of overall funding, and agencies were allowed to charge fees for counseling services starting in 2007. The Final Rule allows housing counseling agencies to charge reasonable fees for services, as long as it does not create a financial burden for clients or result in anyone being denied services due to inability to pay. Agencies can also receive fees from lenders as long as there is no conflict of interest and disclosure is made to clients. Observers note a lack of standardization in the industry, including training procedures and counseling curricula. HUD certifies agencies but not individual counselors. The lack of standardization in housing counseling agencies raises concerns about poor advice, conflicts of interest, and fraud. There is no certification for individual counselors or agreed-upon standards for their qualifications. Additionally, there is no standard curriculum for counseling sessions, leading to uncertainty about what constitutes housing counseling and the potential for illegitimate agencies posing as counseling services. Standardizing training and approval processes for housing counseling agencies and counselors can help deter illegitimate organizations and ensure the best interests of clients. Approval by reputable organizations like HUD or NeighborWorks can guide people to experienced agencies. Efforts to develop industry-wide standards have been driven by both the housing counseling industry and the federal government, such as Fannie Mae's American Homeowner Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) in 1996. The Education and Counseling Institute (AHECI) aimed to establish national accreditation standards for housing counseling providers, develop a core housing counseling curriculum, research costs and benefits, establish self-financing means, and create a housing counseling informational clearinghouse. Despite progress, AHECI no longer exists today. NeighborWorks's Center for Homeownership Education and Counseling (NCHEC) has taken on some of AHECI's goals, working on standards for housing counseling curricula and counselor certification. The certification of housing counselors is overseen by organizations like NCHEC, NeighborWorks, and NAHCA. HUD published a Final Rule in 2009 specifying requirements for HECM counselors, establishing a HECM Counselor Roster for homeowners applying for HECMs. To be eligible for the HECM Counselor Roster, counselors must be employed by an approved agency, pass an exam, receive training, have technology for tracking, and not be on certain lists. The SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 requires states to set licensing requirements for mortgage originators. The SAFE Act mandates minimum standards for mortgage originators and directs HUD to establish a licensing system. Responsibility for the SAFE Act shifted to the CFPB in 2011. HUD issued a Final Rule in 2011 outlining licensing standards and procedures for non-compliant states. HUD's Final Rule under the SAFE Act applies to housing counselors involved in pre-purchase or foreclosure mitigation counseling, requiring them to comply with licensing and registration. The rule covers anyone engaging in loan origination activities, with no exemptions based on job titles. Traditional housing counseling activities may not fall under loan origination. The Final Rule under the SAFE Act applies to housing counselors engaging in loan origination activities, with exemptions for certain organizations. The CFPB published an interim final rule in December 2011 to implement the provisions of the SAFE Act. The interim final rule under the SAFE Act, effective from December 30, 2011, focuses on housing counseling to reduce mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. NeighborWorks is one agency that has initiatives like the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program and the Center for Foreclosure Solutions offering training, certification, and research on foreclosure. For Foreclosure Solutions and the Homeownership Preservation Foundation provide housing counseling and assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure. The hotline 888-995-HOPE connects homeowners with counselors to apply for the Home Affordable Modification Program. Counseling is also required for homeowners with high debt-to-income ratios receiving mortgage modifications through HAMP. Counseling is encouraged for participants in HAMP, with certain borrowers required to receive counseling if their debt-to-income ratios exceed 55%. Funding for foreclosure mitigation housing counseling primarily comes from NeighborWorks America. Increased demand for counseling services may be seen due to the rise in mortgage troubles. NeighborWorks allows grantees to use NFMCP funds to counsel HAMP participants with high debt-to-income ratios. Fewer referrals than expected have been occurring, with over 7,000 borrowers in HAMP trial modifications receiving counseling through NFMCP. The lower number of HAMP borrowers receiving counseling may be due to servicers not consistently referring or borrowers not pursuing counseling, despite the requirement. The average total debt-to-income ratio of participants in the program was over 59% through February 2012. The debt-to-income ratio of participants in the program was over 59% even after a mortgage modification. Securing funding can be an issue for housing counseling agencies, despite increased funding from Congress in recent years. The lack of funding for HUD's housing counseling program in FY2011 may increase the burden on agencies providing counseling, although funding was provided in FY2012. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes provisions related to housing counseling. The Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law in 2010, establishes an Office of Housing Counseling within HUD. It includes provisions for expanding housing counseling, setting standards, and providing outreach to the public. The Secretary of HUD or the Director of Housing Counseling are directed to undertake various activities to support homeownership and rental housing counseling. The legislation directs the Secretary of HUD to provide advice, technical assistance, and financial aid to housing counseling agencies and SHFAs. It also emphasizes the importance of educating consumers on mortgage products and home inspection counseling. The Director of the Office of Housing Counseling is tasked with developing rules and a public awareness campaign for housing counseling, collaborating with community-based organizations, and building capacity in underdeveloped areas. Only HUD-approved agencies can provide housing counseling for HUD programs as per the Dodd-Frank legislation. Additionally, the legislation amends the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994. The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) to require certification from a HUD-approved housing counselor before a high-cost mortgage can be offered to a borrower."
