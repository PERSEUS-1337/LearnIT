The Congress finds that many States and school districts will need to build new schools to accommodate increasing student enrollments, with a predicted need for 6,000 more schools by 2006. Due to reduced class mandates and increased enrollment, districts have resorted to temporary classrooms and year-round schedules. Research shows a direct link between school facilities' condition and student achievement, with students in poor condition schools falling behind by 10.9 percentage points. Many States and communities struggle to provide acceptable school facilities, with the poorest communities facing the greatest difficulty. Local educational agencies have trouble securing financing for school construction and renovation, especially in States with strict voter approval requirements. The Federal Government can help by offering interest subsidies and other support to lower costs for States. The United States competitive position in the global economy is at risk if the workforce is not properly educated in 21st-century equipped schools. Lowering costs for state and local school infrastructure investments can incentivize businesses to support improvement efforts. America must prioritize education to compete globally. The Act aims to promote public-private partnerships for school construction financing and improve school facilities to accommodate the increasing student population.
