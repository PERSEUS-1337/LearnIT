    "content": "Streamgages provide foundational information for diverse applications and have been supported by Congress for 130 years. They operate in every state, the District of Columbia, and territories like Puerto Rico and Guam, garnering interest from Members of Congress. Data from streamgages informs decision-making on hazard preparations, infrastructure design, water use allocations, ecosystem management, and recreation. Users include government agencies, utility companies, consulting firms, scientific institutions, and recreationists. National streamgage programs exist globally in North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil. The USGS Streamgaging Network operates globally with national programs in North America, Europe, Australia, and Brazil. In the United States, it includes 10,300 streamgages recording water height or streamflow, with 8,200 measuring streamflow year-round. The network is funded at $189.5 million in FY2018 through congressional appropriations and agreements with nonfederal partners. The USGS Streamgaging Network is funded at $189.5 million in FY2018 through congressional appropriations and cooperative agreements with nonfederal partners. Funding agreements are signed to share the cost of streamgages and data collection, with a 50% match provided by the USGS Cooperative Matching Funds Program. Other federal agencies and entities may also provide funding for streamgages without USGS contributions. Federal policies and user needs have influenced the network's size, organization, and function. The USGS streamgage program is shaped by user needs and federal policies. It collects data on water levels and streamflow to create rating curves for converting stage heights. Funding for the program comes from congressional appropriations and cooperative agreements with nonfederal partners. Streamgages are used to create rating curves for converting stage heights into streamflow estimates. They house instruments to measure and transmit stream stage height data, often every hour. Some streamgages also provide water quality measurements and transmit photos of streamflow conditions. USGS personnel make periodic streamflow measurements every six to eight weeks to capture a range of stage heights and streamflows. The USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) converts stream height data from streamgages into streamflow estimates. NWIS provides free and publicly accessible data, with over 670 million requests for streamflow information in 2018. The NWIS website is the main repository for current and historical streamflow data, along with tools like WaterWatch for summarizing stream conditions. The USGS Streamgaging Network provides streamflow information to assist during natural disasters and inform water management decisions. Individual streamgages serve multiple purposes, such as reservoir management and water quality assessments. The network enhances the value of each streamgage for research and forecasting purposes. Streamgage data is essential for water use and infrastructure planning in the United States, providing long-term hydrologic records to monitor changes in streamflow due to land use, water use, and climate. The value of streamflow records increases over time, with at least 20 years of continuous coverage needed for many applications. Technological advances allow real-time access to streamflow information, expanding the uses of streamgages for forecasting and decision-making. Streamgage data supports various federal agency activities and is accessible to the public through web and phone applications. Streamgage data is used for water management, energy development, and supporting federal agencies. It informs design and operation of water projects, helps make daily decisions, and ensures compliance with environmental regulations. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) mandates hydropower companies to support USGS streamflow and water-level monitoring for licensing. Streamflow data is crucial for infrastructure design, including bridges, culverts, and stream stability. Federal streamgages are also used for interstate and international water rights, informing compacts, decrees, and treaties. Additionally, federal agencies rely on streamflow data for water science research. The USGS provides long-term streamflow data for various federal agencies like USACE, NOAA, EPA, DOI, USDA, and NASA for water research and modeling. FEMA uses streamflow records to create floodplain maps and determine flood risk zones for the NFIP. The USGS collaborates with FEMA on flood mapping projects. The USGS collaborates with FEMA to develop inundation maps using streamflow data from streamgages to forecast floods and support emergency response efforts. Real-time data from over 3,600 streamgages enables NOAA's National Weather Service to model watershed response, forecast streamflows, and issue flood warnings for effective emergency planning and response. Additionally, streamgages are used by the USDA for various purposes such as water supply forecasting, drought management, hydroelectric production, irrigation, and navigation in western regions. Water quality is measured using streamflow data for developing standards and managing pollutants. The Clean Water Act requires TMDL management plans for impaired water bodies, with agencies using historic streamflow data for evaluations. Current flow conditions are considered for proper wastewater release to comply with TMDL standards and permitting. The USGS provides streamflow data for compliance with TMDL standards and permitting, ecosystem management for endangered species, and recreational activities such as fishing and boating. The USGS partners with the National Park Service to provide water science data for park management and interpretive programs. The USGS Streamgaging Network is part of the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program. The President's budget proposes a Water Observing Systems Program combining various water observation programs. USGS streamgages are operated by regional and state Water Science Centers, measuring year-round streamflow. Approximately 8,200 out of 10,300 streamgages measure streamflow year-round, with others measuring stage height or on a seasonal basis. Streamgages are also categorized based on cooperative funding and federal interest. The USGS Streamgaging Network is funded through cooperative agreements with tribal, regional, state, and local partners, with up to a 50% match from the USGS. In 2018, 5,345 streamgages were supported through this Cooperative Matching Funds program. This cooperative funding model has been in place since 1895, with Congress passing legislation in 1928 allowing for cost-sharing with tribes, states, and municipalities. The Cooperative Matching Funds Program (CMF) provides funding for streamgages across the USGS Water Mission Area. Potential partners approach the USGS to discuss the need for a streamgage, and if feasible, a joint funding agreement (JFA) is signed specifying each party's contribution and payment schedule. Agreements last up to five years with the flexibility to alter the cost-share annually for multi-year agreements. If a partner can no longer contribute funds, the USGS seeks alternative arrangements. The USGS operates streamgages with funding from partners, including nonfederal and federal sources. Approximately 36% of USGS streamgages are funded without matching funds from the USGS. Partners sign joint funding agreements (JFAs) and agreements last up to five years with the flexibility to alter the cost-share annually. The USGS assumes liability responsibility for the streamgages. The USGS operates streamgages funded by partners, with the agency assuming liability. Public and private entities may own independent streamgages tailored to their needs. The SECURE Water Act of 2009 directs the USGS to operate federally funded streamgages with flood-hardened infrastructure and water quality sensors. Out of 4,760 designated FPS locations, 3,640 were operational in 2018. In 2018, out of 4,760 designated FPS locations, 3,640 were operational with USGS funding of $24.7 million. The USGS proposed a federally funded NSIP to address the decline in streamgages due to partners discontinuing funding and varying needs for streamflow information. The creation of a stable \"backbone\" network of streamgages was suggested to meet national needs based on five criteria. The NSIP program was created to fulfill legal obligations regarding water flow monitoring. It involved forecasting flow, measuring river basin outflows, monitoring benchmark watersheds, and measuring flow for water quality needs. The program aimed to fund 4,700 sites by FY2019 and study the relationship between streamflow dynamics and climate change. In FY2018, $189.5 million was provided for the USGS Streamgaging Network, with funding from congressional appropriations, nonfederal partners, and other federal agencies. The funding included $24.7 million for FPSs and $29.8 million for CMF, with nonfederal partners contributing $94.3 million. The appropriations bill for the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies funds the USGS share of the network, which is part of the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program under the USGS Water Resources Mission Area. The Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program received $74.2 million in FY2018 and $82.7 million in FY2019. Congress allocated $8.5 million for NextGen water observing equipment in FY2019. The President's FY2020 budget proposes a new Water Observing Systems Program with a budget of $105.1 million, a decrease from previous funding. The budget request for FY2020 includes a decrease in funding for Tribal Water and Urban Waters Federal Partnership, resulting in reduced water quality monitoring at select streamgages. Funding from other federal agencies for streamgages has doubled since FY2012, possibly due to inflation, new monitoring needs, and additional funding partners like the EPA. From FY2012 to FY2018, nonfederal partners funded half of the costs for the USGS Streamgaging Network. Various cooperative partners, including tribal, regional, state, and local agencies, irrigation districts, riverkeeper partnerships, and utility agencies, contribute to funding. USGS funding for FPS streamgages increased from $11.7 million to $24.7 million from FY2003 to FY2019. However, this funding has not met the SECURE Water Act of 2009 mandate for an entirely federally funded suite of not fewer than 4,700 streamgage sites. In FY2018, 35% of FPSs were solely funded by the USGS FPS program funds. Contributions by nongovernmental partners to streamgages are limited and not eligible for cost-sharing through the USGS CMF program. In FY2018, 35% of FPSs were funded solely by the USGS FPS program funds, while the rest relied on other federal agencies or nonfederal partners for funding. USGS funding for CMF has remained relatively level over 15 years, with nonfederal cost-share contribution increasing to about 63% in FY2018 for the entire USGS Streamgaging Network. As demand for streamgages rises, the USGS cost-share available has declined. Congress plays a crucial role in determining funding levels and policy priorities for the USGS Streamgaging Network. This includes deciding on the amount of federal funding allocated to FPS, CMF, and other initiatives. Stakeholders have highlighted funding considerations such as user needs, partner priorities, federal coverage, and infrastructure repair. Congressional appropriations can impact the network's size and streamgage design, with decisions influenced by mandates like the SECURE Water Act of 2009 and the NextGen system. Additionally, newer streamgages may receive less USGS contribution, with partners expected to provide full funding in subsequent years after initial installation and operation support. The USGS Streamgaging Network's funding and maintenance are influenced by various factors such as user needs, partner priorities, federal coverage, infrastructure repair, disaster response, inflation, and technological advances. Congress may decide to maintain, decrease, or expand the network, and consider investing in streamgage restoration and modernization. Stakeholders have differing views on the network's size, with some advocating for expansion while others suggest reducing it to prioritize other activities. The Administration continues to request funding for the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program to support the network's stability and long-term tracking of streamflow conditions. The FY2020 budget requests level funding for the USGS Streamgaging Network, which may not fully maintain operations due to inflation. 71% of the network is funded by partners, making some streamgages vulnerable for discontinuation. Congress may consider reducing the network, including FPSs or cooperative streamgages, as maintaining streamgages through partners can be challenging. USGS has discontinued some streamgages due to funding priorities or lack of alternative funding. The Administration requested reductions for the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program in FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020. Decreases in funding would impact national streamgaging and groundwater monitoring networks. The USGS proposed a decrease in Tribal Water CMF funding for select streamgages, which Congress did not approve in FY2018 and FY2019. The possibility of reducing the USGS Streamgaging Network to cut federal spending is being considered for FY2020. Some stakeholders suggest building and operating separate streamgages tailored to specific needs, similar to what states like California and Oregon already do. This approach may pose challenges such as varying data quality, restricted data access, and different standards. Congress may increase funding to expand the USGS Streamgaging Network, which currently has 3,640 operational streamgages out of the mandated 4,700. Additional funding of $125 million per year is estimated to be needed to complete the network. USGS estimates that $125 million annually is needed to complete the Streamgaging Network, but only about $25 million was allocated each year between FY2014 and FY2019. Congress may prioritize funding for other projects like the NextGen system instead. Some suggest seeking funding from federal agencies and nonfederal partners for streamgages, especially in less active river basins. There are differing views on increasing federal funding for cooperative streamgages to address localized needs. Some propose increasing nontraditional funding sources for streamgages, such as businesses, homeowner associations, and academic institutions. Congress could encourage wider participation by nontraditional partners through cooperative matching opportunities. Traditional stakeholders may oppose making matching funds available to new entities, leading to more competition for limited funds. Congress increased appropriations for the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program by $1.5 million in FY2018 and $8.5 million in FY2019, with a focus on streamgages for the NextGen system. Funding constraints for FPSs and CMF streamgages may intensify as a result. Streamgages need to be properly hardened to prevent hazards, with the USGS directed to ensure flood hardening by FY2019. Structural restoration is typically funded through emergency measures, such as disaster supplemental appropriations or diverting funds from operational budgets. The 2017 hurricane season caused damage to over 100 streamgages, leading Congress to allocate $4.6 million in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 for repairs. Stakeholders advocate for $238 million to update half of the streamgages to withstand major flood events. Funding constraints may impact the maintenance of streamgages for the NextGen system. Investments in new technologies for the USGS Streamgaging Network are being considered to enhance streamflow information while reducing costs. However, concerns exist about the quality and consistency of data from these modernized systems and the potential impact on existing operations. The SECURE Water Act of 2009 mandated the upgrade of telemetry systems for all FPSs by FY2019 due to vulnerabilities in the current U.S. streamgage telemetry infrastructure. The USGS streamgage telemetry infrastructure is at risk of failure, with an 11% network outage in September 2018 due to telemetry equipment error. Redundancy in telemetry using cellular signals or camera streaming could have prevented the issue. The IMAGES Act of 2018 aimed to modernize hardware and increase data transmittal speed, but lacked specified funding. Stakeholders suggest $112 million is needed to upgrade data management systems and real-time data delivery capabilities. The USGS is considering cloud computing to enhance its data delivery capabilities and modernize the National Water Information System (NWIS). The FY2020 budget request includes plans for a centralized platform aligning with the Federal Cloud First Computing Strategy. Alternative data infrastructure funding is proposed to ensure reliable data capacity at reduced costs, although some argue these strategies are not yet fully developed. The USGS also suggests using modern models and computational methods to estimate streamflow in areas with limited streamgages as an alternative to traditional methods. The USGS initiated a NextGen system pilot project in the Delaware River Basin with $1.5 million in FY2018 and received $8.5 million for the NextGen system in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. Reports from the House and Senate in the 115th Congress addressed the NextGen system, with the Senate committee encouraging a cost-effective strategy and the House committee requesting a report on the system's limitations, enhancements, modernization needs, and implementation costs. The USGS received funding for the NextGen system in the Delaware River Basin to enhance data infrastructure and expand streamflow coverage. There are concerns about the effectiveness of modeling streamflow and potential impacts on traditional operations. Congress may consider innovative observation technologies for river monitoring. The USGS is evaluating advanced technologies like drones equipped with cameras and radars for streamflow data collection in hard-to-reach areas. High-density sensing and sensor networks using miniaturization and artificial intelligence could increase data coverage. Some believe these technologies could reduce the need for traditional streamgages, but others caution about their reliability compared to traditional methods. Congress may consider these innovative observation technologies for river monitoring. The USGS is exploring advanced technologies like drones for streamflow data collection in remote areas. Congress may need to outline the future direction for the USGS Streamgaging Network through oversight or legislation. By the end of FY2018, 3,640 of the 4,760 FPS locations designated by the USGS were operational, with 52% of their funding from the USGS. Congress directed the USGS to invest in the NextGen system to meet the SECURE Water Act mandate. Financial constraints may limit this. The USGS is exploring new methods to obtain streamflow information, but financial constraints may limit this approach. Congress may consider revising the SECURE Water Act of 2009 to extend the deadline for FPSs and reassess program goals. Some suggest that national interests have evolved, and streamflow monitoring for ecological purposes should be a priority. The Act directed the USGS to conduct periodic reviews of FPSs to ensure objectives are met. The USGS is considering changes to the FPS network to ensure national goals are met. Congress may replace FPSs with the NextGen system, similar to the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017. This could involve reallocating funding, discontinuing streamgages, or adding new ones based on evolving national interests. The USGS is considering changes to the FPS network to meet national goals, potentially replacing FPSs with the NextGen system. There are debates on which basins should be chosen for improvements and concerns about the effectiveness of new streamgaging approaches compared to traditional methods. Some worry that altering the network design could lead to gaps in coverage."
