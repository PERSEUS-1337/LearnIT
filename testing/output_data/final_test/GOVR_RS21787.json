    "content": "The report analyzes the policy implications of constructing a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 states. The 108th Congress has included provisions in H.R. 6 to incentivize the construction of the pipeline, which would connect Alaskan gas supplies to the market. The report uses the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) to assess the impact on natural gas imports with or without the pipeline. The EIA's reference case forecast projects natural gas prices to support the construction of an Alaska natural gas pipeline after 2009. Deliveries from the pipeline are expected to start in 2018, with full capacity reached by 2024. Policy incentives could accelerate pipeline construction, potentially altering forecast results. The report will compare forecasts for 2020 and 2025, focusing on international trade effects. The current account balance effects of the pipeline will be calculated to focus on international trade impacts. It measures a nation's trade position by comparing exports and imports. The forecasts do not consider construction costs or trade effects from sourcing decisions. The effects discussed are limited to the natural gas delivered by the pipeline. The Alaska natural gas pipeline is expected to deliver 2 trillion cubic feet of gas per year by 2024, starting at 0.8 tcf in 2018 and growing to full capacity. By 2020, there is a projected gap between domestic production and demand, requiring imports of 6.47 tcf. Canadian natural gas imports are expected to decline to 2.5 tcf by 2020, with the majority of additional import requirements coming from liquefied natural gas. By 2025, U.S. import requirements for natural gas will mainly come from LNG, with a projected gap of 7.24 tcf to be filled by imports. Canadian pipeline imports are expected to be 2.56 tcf, while LNG will fill the remaining gap. LNG demand is forecasted to grow from 2.16 tcf in 2010 to 4.8 tcf in 2025, with a projected wellhead natural gas price of $4.40 per thousand cubic feet in real terms. The no pipeline case scenario projects a decrease in Alaskan natural gas production compared to the reference case, leading to price increases in the natural gas market. This results in reduced total demand for natural gas and an incentive for producers in the U.S. and Canada to increase production. Canada is set to increase gas production due to a lack of a pipeline from Alaska, leading to projected increases in natural gas imports. The estimated import prices for 2020 and 2025 are $4.81 and $4.90 per thousand cubic feet respectively. The lack of a pipeline from Alaska is projected to increase natural gas imports, with estimated import values of $3.46 billion in 2020 and $3.09 billion in 2025. This could potentially impact the current account deficit, but other related effects in the economy may influence these projections, such as a decrease in industrial demand for natural gas leading to reduced production of chemicals. The EIA analysis focuses on energy issues and does not provide a detailed picture of all the secondary economic effects of higher natural gas prices. An Alaska natural gas pipeline is projected to deliver 2 tcf of gas in 2025 when operating at full capacity, but imports increase by only 0.63 tcf due to the lack of pipeline construction. In 2020, a pipeline is expected to deliver 1.6 tcf, but imports increase by only 0.72 tcf if no pipeline is constructed. In 2025, projected natural gas demand is lower in the no pipeline case, with aggregate demand 0.71 tcf lower compared to the reference case. Industrial and electric generators show the largest declines in consumption, while residential and commercial sectors reduce consumption by a smaller margin. In 2020, natural gas consumption decreases in residential, commercial, industrial, and electric generator sectors. Domestic production increases due to higher prices, with a total of 1.38 tcf in 2025 when considering reduced demand and additional imports. In 2020, natural gas consumption decreases in various sectors. The reduction in demand is 0.72 tcf, with added production from onshore and offshore sources in the lower 48 states projected at 0.28 tcf. Imports are expected to increase by 0.72 tcf. An Alaska natural gas pipeline is projected to begin deliveries in 2018, reaching full capacity in 2025 with 2 tcf per year. This affects market prices and consumption patterns. The forecasted increase in gas imports is not as significant as the loss in deliveries from the Alaskan gas pipeline if it is not constructed, indicating that energy markets adjust to compensate for the lack of Alaskan gas supplies."
