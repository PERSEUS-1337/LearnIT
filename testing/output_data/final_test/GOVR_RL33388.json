    "content": "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees national security implications of foreign direct investment in the economy, amidst changing global economic order and emerging economies like China. U.S. historical approach to international investment aims for an open and rules-based economic system, with FDI seen as beneficial except in cases of national security concerns. Some policymakers argue for greater CFIUS scrutiny of foreign investment transactions, especially those involving entities owned by foreign governments or sensitive technologies. They suggest a more robust economic component in the review process to protect certain industrial sectors. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expanded the CFIUS review process to include certain transactions not previously reviewed, while maintaining a narrow focus. FIRRMA, effective from November 11, 2018, was driven by concerns about evolving national security risks posed by certain investments. A pilot program was developed to address immediate concerns and allow time for a more permanent response in these areas. The pilot program developed by the Treasury Department under FIRRMA covers an expanded scope of transactions subject to CFIUS review, including noncontrolling investments in U.S. firms with critical technologies. The program also implements mandatory declarations for relevant transactions and is set to end by March 5, 2020. FIRRMA expanded CFIUS jurisdiction, refined procedures, and required actions to address national security risks. Treasury's interim rules updated regulations to implement these provisions. The interim rules updated existing regulations to implement FIRRMA provisions immediately, broadening CFIUS' mandate to include reviewing certain real estate transactions near sensitive locations. FIRRMA also allows CFIUS to review noncontrolling investments in critical technology, infrastructure, or data collection businesses, changes in foreign investor rights, transactions involving foreign government interests, and those designed to evade CFIUS. Global FDI inflows peaked in 2015 but have since fallen, with a significant decline in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Certain countries of \"special concern\" may face discrimination in CFIUS reviews due to strategic goals related to critical technology or infrastructure acquisitions. Global FDI inflows declined in 2017, with a 22% drop in cross-border M&A activity. Developing economies saw a slower decline in FDI compared to developed economies, while investment flows to economies in transition continued to rise. Other cross-border capital flows remained strong, with foreign affiliates employing 73 million people globally. The total FDI stock in 2017 was around $31 trillion, indicating potential global economic growth recovery. The global FDI position in the United States was around $7.8 trillion in 2017, with outward FDI at about $7.9 trillion. The EU had an inward investment position of $9.1 trillion and an outward position of $10.6 trillion in 2017. CFIUS was established in 1975 to dissuade new restrictions on foreign investment. Growing concerns over OPEC countries' investments in American portfolio assets led to public and congressional scrutiny in 2006. The proposed purchase of commercial port operations by Dubai Ports World in six U.S. ports sparked criticism and congressional action. Ultimately, DP World officials decided to sell off the U.S. port operations to an American owner. A unit of AIG Global Investment Group, a New York-based asset management company, acquired U.S. port operations, sparking concerns about foreign investment and national security post-9/11. State-owned enterprises' involvement in foreign investments raised additional worries, leading to the introduction of over 25 bills in Congress. In response to concerns about foreign investment and national security post-9/11, Congress introduced over 25 bills addressing various aspects of foreign investment. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (FINSA) was passed to increase oversight by Congress and transparency in the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) decisions. Some Members felt the law was inadequate in reviewing investment by foreign governments through sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) and unresolved issues remained regarding the role of foreign investment in national security. President Ford's 1975 Executive Order established the basic structure of CFIUS, with the Secretary of the Treasury's representative as the chairman. CFIUS is responsible for monitoring the impact of foreign investment in the US and coordinating policy on such investment. It analyzes trends, provides guidance on arrangements with foreign governments, and assesses the impact on defense industrial base, critical infrastructure, and homeland security. The 1975 Executive Order established CFIUS to monitor foreign investment in the US, provide guidance on arrangements with foreign governments, review investments with major implications for national interests, and consider new legislation. President Ford's order also emphasized confidentiality and specified the use of information for the order's functions. The Secretary of Commerce was tasked with obtaining and analyzing information on foreign investment in the US. The 1975 Executive Order established CFIUS to monitor foreign investment in the US, improve data collection procedures, observe foreign investment trends, prepare reports, and submit recommendations to keep information current. The order raised legal questions, leading to the International Investment Survey Act of 1976 signed by President Ford to clarify data collection authority. President Ford signed the International Investment Survey Act of 1976, granting clear authority to collect information on international investment. By 1980, concerns arose about CFIUS not fulfilling its mandate, with the Committee meeting only 10 times and struggling to address political or economic aspects of foreign direct investment in the US. From 1980 to 1987, CFIUS investigated foreign investment transactions, including a Japanese firm's attempt to acquire a U.S. specialty steel producer and a Japanese company's acquisition of a U.S. firm manufacturing specialized ball bearings for the military. Defense Department objections led to the withdrawal of offers or agreements to maintain production in the United States. In 1988, Congress approved the Exon-Florio amendment to the Defense Production Act, granting the President authority to block foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers of U.S. companies engaged in interstate commerce if they threaten national security. The Exon-Florio provision granted the President authority to block foreign mergers or takeovers of U.S. companies if they threaten national security. This standard was maintained in updates to the provision in 2007 and in FIRRMA. Congress passed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 after contentious negotiations with the Reagan Administration. Key issues debated included defining foreign control of a U.S. firm, defining national security, and determining which economic activities should be subject to CFIUS review. The Exon-Florio provision granted the President authority to block foreign mergers or takeovers of U.S. companies if they threaten national security. The most controversial issue was the lack of a clear definition of national security, with intense debate over the term \"essential commerce\" between Congress and the Reagan Administration. The Administration vetoed the first version of the omnibus trade legislation due to objections to the language regarding \"national security and essential commerce.\" The Reagan Administration argued that this language would broaden the definition of national security to include a strong economic component. The Exon-Florio provision, part of the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, granted the President authority to block foreign mergers or takeovers of U.S. companies for national security reasons. The term \"essential commerce\" was removed from the measure after objections from the Reagan Administration. President Reagan delegated authority to administer the provision to CFIUS through Executive Order 12661. CFIUS was transformed by President Reagan into an important component of U.S. foreign investment policy with significant authority to advise the President on foreign investment transactions. In 1990, President Bush directed CATIC to divest its acquisition of MAMCO Manufacturing due to national security concerns. Congress adopted the Exon-Florio provision to address these issues. The Exon-Florio provision was adopted by Congress to strengthen the President's authority in foreign investment policy, while balancing public concerns about certain types of foreign investment with the nation's commitment to an open investment environment. Congress aimed to limit its own role in foreign investment decisions to emphasize the commercial nature of transactions free from political considerations. The provision was not intended to change the generally open foreign investment climate of the country. The Exon-Florio provision aimed to strengthen the President's authority in foreign investment policy without altering the generally open investment climate. It restricted foreign direct investment in industries not of national security interest, reflecting the President's policies. Foreign investors face constraints in sectors like maritime, aircraft, banking, resources, and power. The Exon-Florio provision, implemented in 1991 and later amended through FINSA, established a voluntary notification system for foreign acquisitions subject to national security review by CFIUS. Despite the voluntary nature, firms largely complied with the provision to avoid indefinite scrutiny. The Exon-Florio provision, implemented in 1991 and later amended through FINSA, established a voluntary notification system for foreign acquisitions subject to national security review by CFIUS. In 1992, Congress amended the Exon-Florio statute through the \"Byrd\" amendment, requiring CFIUS to investigate proposed mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers meeting specific criteria. The Byrd amendment to the Exon-Florio provision requires CFIUS to investigate acquisitions that meet specific criteria, including cases where the acquirer is controlled by a foreign government and the acquisition could affect US national security. The DP World transaction brought scrutiny to this amendment, with some Members of Congress believing it mandated a full 45-day investigation, while CFIUS interpreted it differently. CFIUS representatives argued that the Byrd amendment did not mandate a full 45-day investigation for the DP World acquisition, despite the firm being controlled by a foreign government. They believed that the transaction did not pose a national security threat based on their 30-day review. This led to intense public and congressional reaction. The Bush Administration made an administrative change in CFIUS review process after the Dubai Ports World acquisition backlash. Alcatel's acquisition of Lucent Technologies was approved with a Special Security Arrangement, allowing CFIUS to reopen and overturn approval if terms were not met. The Bush Administration's administrative change in the CFIUS review process introduced uncertainty for foreign investors acquiring U.S. firms. Previously, CFIUS reviews were considered final, but now a determination may not be conclusive, leading to objections from various business groups. Representative Maloney introduced H.R. 556 in response to this policy shift. H.R. 556, the National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007, was introduced by Representative Maloney. It was approved by the House Financial Services Committee and later amended and approved by the full House. Senator Dodd introduced S. 1610, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, which was adopted by the Senate in lieu of H.R. 556. The House accepted the Senate's version and President Bush signed it into law on July 26, 2007. Executive Order 13456 was issued by President Bush to implement the law, which codified the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and made significant changes. The National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007 established statutory authority for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), with added permanent members and increased factors for consideration by the President. It also required certification to Congress for transactions and provided for confidential briefings and reports. During the 115th Congress, concerns were raised about China's increasing investment in the US, especially in the technology sector. Senators and Representatives introduced the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) to revise the CFIUS process. The Senate version of FIRRMA was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and passed on June 18, 2018. FIRRMA, identified as P.L. 115-232, grants the President authority to block foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that could threaten national security. The President must have credible evidence that other U.S. laws are inadequate before invoking this authority. CFIUS interprets FIRRMA to mean that any investment posing a risk to national security will be reviewed. The assessment includes evaluating the intent and capabilities of the acquirer, vulnerabilities in the U.S. business, and potential consequences if vulnerabilities are exploited. FIRRMA expands CFIUS' jurisdiction to include real estate transactions near sensitive locations, nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies, and changes in foreign investor rights. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS' jurisdiction to include real estate transactions near sensitive locations, nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies, changes in foreign investor rights, and transactions involving foreign government interests. It mandates various deadlines for reports and assessments, including a plan for CFIUS members to recuse themselves in conflict of interest cases, an assessment of resources and plans for additional staff, and a feasibility study on assessing fees for transactions. Allows CFIUS to discriminate among foreign investments. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS' jurisdiction to include real estate transactions near sensitive locations and nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies. It allows CFIUS to discriminate among foreign investors by country of origin, labeling some as \"countries of special concern\" with strategic goals that could affect US national security. The act shifts the filing process for foreign firms from voluntary to mandatory in certain cases and provides for a two-track method for reviewing investment transactions. Transactions involving investors from countries of special concern would receive greater scrutiny. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS' jurisdiction to include real estate transactions near sensitive locations and nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies. It formalizes CFIUS' use of risk-based analysis to assess national security risks and lengthens time periods for reviews and investigations. It provides for more staff and funding through a filing fee structure and annual appropriation. It also mandates separate reforms related to export controls. FIRRMA expands CFIUS' jurisdiction to include real estate transactions near sensitive locations and nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies. It formalizes CFIUS' use of risk-based analysis to assess national security risks and lengthens time periods for reviews and investigations. It mandates separate reforms related to export controls, including establishing controls on the export or transfer of emerging and foundational technologies. The CFIUS foreign investment review process consists of an informal step and three formal steps: a Declaration or written notice, a National Security Review, and a National Security Investigation, with the possibility of forwarding a transaction to the President for a Presidential Determination. FIRRMA increases the allowable time for reviews and investigations. FIRRMA expands CFIUS' jurisdiction to include real estate transactions near sensitive locations and nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies. It formalizes CFIUS' use of risk-based analysis to assess national security risks and lengthens time periods for reviews and investigations. The concept of national security was broadened to include issues relating to 'homeland security,' including its application to critical infrastructure. Treasury Department officials expect CFIUS members to apply a definition of national security consistent with their agency's legislative mandate. FIRRMA broadens CFIUS' role by including real estate transactions near sensitive locations, nonpassive investments in critical industries or technologies, and transactions designed to evade CFIUS. It allows potential discrimination among foreign investors by country of origin. FIRRMA expands CFIUS' oversight to include certain investment transactions tied to specific countries and factors that may threaten U.S. national security. This includes considerations such as a country's strategic goal of acquiring critical technology, foreign control of critical infrastructure, compliance with U.S. laws, and more. The CFIUS process evaluates transactions based on compliance with U.S. laws, control of U.S. industries, exposure of sensitive data, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The informal review stage before formal CFIUS filing allows firms to address potential issues early and avoid negative publicity. FIRMMA directed CFIUS to consider charging a fee for these reviews. The informal CFIUS review process allows for more time to negotiate and address security concerns, potentially avoiding negative publicity and stock price impacts for firms involved in transactions. FIRRMA shifts the filing requirement for foreign firms from voluntary to mandatory in certain cases and provides a two-track method for reviewing transactions, allowing some firms to file a declaration with CFIUS for an expedited review process. This change raises concerns about the impact on financial markets and the costs of redefining national security in relation to foreign investment. Under FIRRMA, foreign investments involving a foreign government's substantial interest require written notification and greater scrutiny. The CEO must certify compliance with CFIUS requirements. Declarations must include any mitigation agreements from CFIUS approval. Mandatory filings are required for foreign investments in critical U.S. businesses. The new regulations under FIRRMA expand CFIUS reviews to include noncontrolling foreign investments in U.S. businesses that produce critical technologies in specified industries. These investments are subject to review if they provide access to sensitive technical information, board membership, or substantive involvement. The new regulations under FIRRMA expand CFIUS reviews to include noncontrolling foreign investments in U.S. businesses that produce critical technologies. This change was made to address concerns that even noncontrolling interests could impact decisions or access critical technology. The Treasury Department's pilot program includes provisions for declarations and written notices. The program under FIRRMA expands CFIUS reviews to cover noncontrolling foreign investments in U.S. businesses producing critical technologies. Declarations are short notices not exceeding five pages, with CFIUS required to respond within 30 days. Written notices have a 45-day response time. CFIUS can request a written notice or inform parties of incomplete review in response to a declaration. Under FINSA and FIRRMA, parties can file a notice with CFIUS, initiate a unilateral review, or be notified of completion of CFIUS action. The President has the authority to suspend or prohibit mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers. Parties can withdraw and refile their notice to discuss CFIUS's proposed resolution. Resubmitted filings after withdrawal face additional requirements. During a CFIUS review, members assess 12 factors from FINSA and six new factors from FIRRMA. If no national security threat is found within the 45-day review period, the process ends. The Director of National Intelligence analyzes potential threats within 30 days of notification. CFIUS conducts a national security review upon notification, involving various government agencies. Transactions involving foreign government-owned entities may be exempt from review if deemed not a threat to national security. If certain conditions are met, a National Security Investigation is required, leading to potential actions by the President through CFIUS. CFIUS, through a National Security Investigation, can take necessary actions if a transaction threatens national security, involves a foreign government-controlled entity, or could result in foreign control of critical infrastructure. The Committee can recommend to the President to suspend or prohibit the investment after a 45-day review period. During a review or investigation, CFIUS and a designated lead agency can negotiate agreements to mitigate threats to U.S. national security. The Committee has the authority to impose conditions on transactions based on a risk-based analysis. If a transaction notification is withdrawn before completion of a CFIUS review, the Committee can develop interim protections, set resubmission time frames, and track actions taken by the parties. The President can block or suspend foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that pose a threat. The President can block or suspend foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that threaten national security. Before invoking this authority, the President must determine that other U.S. laws are inadequate and have credible evidence of national security impairment from the foreign investment. If CFIUS lacks credible evidence, it may argue against a full investigation, even for foreign entities owned by governments. The President has almost unlimited authority to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction that threatens national security, with determinations not subject to judicial review. President Bush's Executive Order 13456 made changes to the law regarding foreign investments. Executive Order 13456 implemented changes to the law regarding foreign investments, adding five executive office members to CFIUS. The Committee consists of nine Cabinet members and two ex officio members. The President can also appoint temporary members to the Committee. FIRRMA added two new positions within the Treasury Department for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). One position is an Assistant Secretary for Investment Security, responsible for CFIUS under the Treasury Secretary's direction. CFIUS reviews foreign investment transactions to assess national security threats, foreign government control, or critical infrastructure control. Covered transactions include mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that could result in foreign control of a US business. The term 'national security' includes issues related to 'homeland security' and critical infrastructure and technologies. When reviewing a covered transaction, CFIUS and the President may consider the control of US industries by foreign persons and its impact on national security, including the availability of resources and potential employment losses of US persons. FIRRMA expanded CFIUS reviews to include unaffiliated businesses affected by foreign investment if they are involved in critical infrastructure or sensitive data that could threaten national security. FIRRMA expanded CFIUS reviews to include businesses involved in critical infrastructure, critical technologies, or sensitive personal data of US citizens that could threaten national security. FIRRMA mandated regulatory changes, including broadening the scope of covered transactions and allowing CFIUS to define real estate transactions that qualify for review. No deadlines were specified for these regulatory changes. CFIUS, under FIRRMA, has expanded its reviews to include real estate transactions that are in close proximity to sensitive U.S. government facilities or military installations, posing a risk of foreign surveillance. Regulations on defining \"close proximity\" are to be developed. Additionally, CFIUS can regulate foreign investments in U.S. businesses involved in critical infrastructure. Under FIRRMA, CFIUS has expanded its reviews to include transactions involving critical technologies, sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens, and changes in investor rights that could result in foreign control of a U.S. business. Real estate exceptions exclude single housing units or real estate in \"urbanized areas.\" CFIUS is directed to develop regulations concerning material nonpublic technical information and critical infrastructure investments in U.S. businesses that are likely to be of importance to U.S. national security. CFIUS is directed to develop regulations concerning indirect investments by foreign persons in U.S. businesses and exceptions for extraordinary circumstances. They are also tasked with defining the term \"foreign person\" further to limit its application to certain categories based on connections to foreign countries or governments. CFIUS is directed to define \"substantial interest\" in covered transactions with foreign government interests, considering means of foreign government influence. Regulations are required for transactions arising from bankruptcy. CFIUS must develop regulations for the type of information required in a declaration. CFIUS is required to develop regulations for the type and extent of information parties must provide in a declaration for investment transactions. They may also develop regulations for mandatory declarations and cooperation with allies and partners to protect national security. CFIUS is mandated to harmonize investment and technology trends that could threaten national security, share information on specific technologies and entities, and consult with allied governments regularly. Compliance measures include evaluating mitigation agreements without diverting resources. CFIUS can set filing fees for covered foreign investment transactions to cover administrative costs. CFIUS fees are limited to administrative costs, periodically adjusted to match expenses. Consensus among member agencies is sought for each transaction, with the ability to escalate differing national security assessments. Before clearing a transaction, each agency confirms no security concerns. Treasury and designated agencies represent CFIUS in the review process. The CFIUS review process involves Treasury and designated lead agencies assessing transactions for national security concerns. A written certification is provided to Congress upon completion of the review. Transactions not subject to CFIUS review are those solely for investment purposes. Investments solely for investment purposes are defined as those where the transaction does not involve owning more than 10% of the voting securities of the firm or those undertaken by specific financial entities in the ordinary course of business. Transactions not covered include stock splits, acquisitions of non-U.S. businesses, securities underwriting, and acquisitions related to insurance contracts. The CFIUS process, governed by Treasury regulations, includes reviewing transactions related to fidelity, surety, or casualty obligations made by insurers. Foreign loans to U.S. businesses are not investigated unless they involve profit rights or management transfers. FINSA and FIRRMA expanded CFIUS's scope to include \"critical industries\" and \"homeland security\" for national security reviews, following the precedent set by the Patriot Act and Homeland Security Act. After the September 11th attacks, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001, defining \"critical industries\" as vital systems and assets with a significant impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety. This definition is further expanded in the act to include certain sectors of the economy. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 incorporated the language on critical infrastructure from the Patriot Act, identifying key sectors like telecommunications, energy, financial services, water, and transportation as critical to national defense and economic prosperity. The Department of Homeland Security later defined critical infrastructure/key resources as essential resources for the economy and government operations. The economy is considered critical infrastructure, with various federal departments designated as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). Critical Manufacturing was added as the 18th sector on the CI/KR list in 2008. In 2013, the list of critical industries was revised through a Presidential Policy Directive (PPD-21) focusing on strengthening critical infrastructure security and resilience. The Federal Government has established data and systems requirements and implemented an integration and analysis function to inform decisions regarding critical infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for identifying critical industries and coordinating efforts among government agencies. Sixteen sectors have been designated as critical to U.S. infrastructure, including chemical, commercial facilities, communications, energy, and transportation systems. FIRRMA added language on critical infrastructure. FIRRMA added language on critical technologies, defined as defense articles or services on the United States Munitions List and Commerce Control List, controlled for reasons relating to national security, proliferation, or regional stability. The curr_chunk discusses materials, software, and technology covered by specific regulations related to foreign atomic energy activities, export and import of nuclear equipment, select agents and toxins, and emerging technologies controlled under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018. The definition of \"control\" in CFIUS regulations is not based on numerical benchmarks but on a functional definition. The definition of \"control\" in CFIUS regulations is based on a functional definition, focusing on the influence ownership permits the foreign entity to affect decisions by the firm. Control means the power, direct or indirect, to determine matters affecting an entity, such as asset transfers, reorganization, and decision-making processes. The curr_chunk discusses various significant events that may require notification to CFIUS, such as reorganization, major expenditures, appointment of officers, or amendments to corporate documents. The curr_chunk provides guidance on when firms should notify CFIUS of proposed mergers or acquisitions involving products essential to U.S. defense. This notice is not required for firms with no special relation to national security, such as those in the toy, food, hospitality, or legal industries. CFIUS aims to protect national security while allowing foreign investment to flow freely. FIRRMA defines control as the power to determine important matters affecting an entity, subject to regulations. Congress added six additional factors for CFIUS to consider in reviewing investment transactions. The CFIUS statute includes 12 factors for the President to consider in blocking a foreign acquisition, although it is not required. Members can use these factors in their review process to assess if a transaction threatens national security. The CFIUS review process includes factors such as domestic production for national defense, capacity of domestic industries, control by foreign citizens, potential effects on military sales to certain countries, and transactions posing regional military threats. The CFIUS review process considers factors such as potential effects on U.S. technological leadership, critical infrastructure, energy assets, and technologies. It also evaluates if the transaction is foreign government-controlled and assesses long-term projections for U.S. energy and critical resources. The CFIUS review process considers factors such as potential effects on U.S. technological leadership, critical infrastructure, energy assets, and technologies. Factors 6-12 were added through the FINSA Act potentially broadening the scope of CFIUS's reviews and investigations. FIRRMA offered six new elements CFIUS and the President \"may\" consider as part of their deliberations, incorporating economic considerations into the review process. CFIUS is required to consider the impact of an investment on critical infrastructure and critical technologies when making recommendations to the President. Critical infrastructure is defined broadly as systems vital to national security, including economic security and public health. FIRRMA added six factors for evaluating national security implications, including transactions involving countries with strategic goals. The curr_chunk discusses the factors that CFIUS must consider when evaluating national security implications of transactions, including a country's strategic goals, control of critical infrastructure, compliance with US laws, and the impact on US industries and commercial activity. The factors that CFIUS must consider when evaluating national security implications of transactions include the availability of human resources, exposure of sensitive data of US citizens to foreign entities, and the potential exacerbation of national security threats. The Exon-Florio provision originally applied to various types of transactions that could pose cybersecurity risks to the United States, including joint ventures and licensing agreements. However, these were later removed from the proposal due to arguments that they were beneficial for U.S. companies and could be addressed by other existing laws. FIRRMA later added additional provisions to address national security concerns. FIRRMA added joint ventures as a consideration during CFIUS reviews. Confidentiality requirements similar to Exon-Florio and Executive Order 11858 are maintained, allowing disclosure to Congress or authorized committees with assurances of confidentiality for proprietary information. Since the 1980s, CFIUS has developed informal practices for negotiating conditions with firms to address national security concerns, often during the formal review period. These agreements, not always based on statute and untested in court, aim to mitigate or remove problematic business arrangements. CFIUS has developed informal practices for negotiating conditions with firms to address national security concerns, often during the formal review period. FINSA required CFIUS to designate a lead agency to negotiate, modify, monitor, and enforce agreements based on a \"risk-based analysis\" of the threat posed by the transaction. CFIUS is also required to develop a method for evaluating compliance of firms with mitigation agreements without diverting resources or placing unnecessary burdens. CFIUS can take actions if a transaction notification is withdrawn before completion of review, including interim protections and specific time frames for resubmission. Federal entities involved in mitigation agreements must report any modifications to CFIUS and relevant agencies. CFIUS can conduct periodic reviews of mitigation agreements, negotiate, enter into, or impose agreements to mitigate national security risks, and review the appropriateness of agreements to terminate or amend if threats no longer require mitigation. Mitigation agreements must resolve national security concerns posed by transactions. FIRRMA established a fund within Treasury and appropriates $20 million to CFIUS for each fiscal year from 2019 through 2023. CFIUS is authorized to develop a fee schedule for transactions, with the fee restricted to 1% of the transaction value or $300,000. Regulations must consider impact on small businesses, expenses, and foreign investment. Total fees collected cannot exceed administrative costs. CFIUS is directed to study establishing a fee structure for prioritizing responses. CFIUS is required to study the feasibility of establishing a fee structure to prioritize responses to informal notices before formal written notices of transactions. FIRRMA also mandates the President to assess if additional resources are needed for CFIUS' expanded responsibilities and to request them in the annual budget. Both FINSA and FIRRMA increased the types and number of reports CFIUS must send to specific Members of Congress, including briefings upon request and annual reports on reviews and investigations. CFIUS provides a classified report to Congress annually and a less extensive report for public release. CFIUS provides a classified report to Congress annually, including details on concluded reviews, investigations, business activities of parties in investment transactions, status of reviews, withdrawn transactions, roll call votes, extensions of time, and presidential decisions. FIRRMA imposed new reporting requirements on CFIUS in the classified report, including outcomes of reviews, mitigation agreements, parties involved, business activities/products, compliance plans statistics, and trend information on declarations and actions taken. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is required to provide Congress with information on compliance plans, nonnotified transactions, hiring practices, and recommendations to suspend transactions threatening national security. Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce must report on Chinese foreign direct investment transactions every two years, along with trend information on filings, investigations, withdrawals, and presidential decisions. The report mandated by FINSA includes information on business sectors and countries involved in filings, status of investments, security arrangements, compliance with mitigation agreements, and adverse effects on national security from investment transactions. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other departments, conducts a study on foreign investment in critical infrastructure and industries affecting national security in the United States. CFIUS is required to evaluate potential threats to national security from foreign entities, including those complying with boycotts of Israel or not banning designated terrorist organizations. An annual report must assess coordinated efforts by countries or companies to acquire US companies in critical technology sectors. Industrial espionage activities by foreign governments targeting US companies for commercial secrets related to critical technologies are also evaluated. During 2008-2015, foreign investors sent 925 notices to CFIUS for acquiring U.S. firms, accounting for 96% of total foreign direct investments. In 2015, there were over 1,800 foreign investment transactions, with almost half being acquisitions of existing U.S. firms. About 4% of notified transactions were withdrawn during the initial 30-day review period. During the period, 4% of notified transactions were withdrawn in the initial 30-day review, and 36% required a 45-day investigation. 6% of investigated transactions were withdrawn before a final determination. Out of 925 proposed investment transactions, 89% were completed. 43% of foreign investment transactions from 2008 to 2015 were in the manufacturing sector, with finance, information, and services sectors making up 31% of total notified transactions. In the manufacturing sector, 43% of investment transactions between 2013 and 2015 were in computer and electronic products. In 2013-2015, the majority of foreign investment transactions notified to CFIUS were in computer and electronic products, accounting for 49% in 2015. Other active sectors included transportation equipment, machinery, and professional services. Notified transactions in publishing, telecommunications, and real estate were also notable. Chinese investors were the most active in acquisitions, takeovers, or mergers during the 2013-2015 period, accounting for 19% of the total number of transactions. The United Kingdom and Canada were also top countries of origin for investors notifying CFIUS. Investment notifications from China and the UK were concentrated in manufacturing, finance, information, and services sectors, with some Chinese transactions in mining, construction, and utilities. The ranking of countries differs from data on foreign direct investment in the US. According to CFIUS, the most active countries for foreign investment in the United States are Kingdom, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Canada, and Switzerland.
