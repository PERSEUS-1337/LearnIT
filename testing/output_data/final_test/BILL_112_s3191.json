Section 166 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to define 'alternative fuel vehicle' as a vehicle operating solely on specific fuels like methanol, ethanol, natural gas, hydrogen, electricity, or fuels derived from biological materials. The term 'alternative fuel vehicle' is defined in Section 166 of title 23, United States Code as a vehicle running solely on specific fuels like methanol, ethanol, natural gas, hydrogen, electricity, or fuels derived from biological materials. Additionally, the term 'HOV facility' refers to a high occupancy vehicle facility, and 'public transportation vehicle' is defined as a vehicle providing designated public transportation or public school transportation. The term 'State agency' in relation to a HOV facility refers to a government agency at the state or local level overseeing the facility's operation, including state transportation departments. State transportation department establishes occupancy requirements for vehicles on HOV facilities, requiring a minimum of 2 occupants per vehicle. Exceptions include allowing motorcycles and bicycles to use the HOV lane. The State agency can restrict motorcycles or bicycles from using the HOV facility if it poses a safety hazard, with certification from the Secretary required after public notice and comment. Public transportation vehicles are also subject to State agency regulations. The State agency can allow public transportation vehicles to use the HOV facility if they meet certain requirements for identification and enforcement. High occupancy toll vehicles can also use the facility by paying a toll and enrolling in a program for toll collection. The State agency can allow alternative fuel vehicles and new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles to use the HOV facility by paying a toll and following specific policies and procedures for toll collection and enforcement. The State agency must develop procedures for enforcing restrictions on the use of HOV facilities by eligible vehicles, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the agency is required to revise existing HOV facility programs within one year of the enactment of this section. The State agency must update HOV facility programs and procedures within 3 years of enactment, including notifying the public of changes in vehicle eligibility. Tolls may be charged under certain conditions, with excess revenues subject to specific regulations. If a State agency certifies excess toll revenues, they must prioritize projects for alternative travel and highway safety. The agency allowing vehicles on HOV facilities must ensure no degradation and commit to facility management, operation, monitoring, and enforcement. The responsibilities for managing an HOV facility include establishing and supporting performance monitoring, evaluation, and reporting programs, enforcing compliance with regulations, and limiting or discontinuing vehicle use when necessary for facility operation. Maintenance of operating performance for degraded facilities includes bringing them back into compliance with minimum average operating speed standards within 180 days. This can be achieved by increasing HOV occupancy requirements, raising tolls for certain vehicles, and implementing tolls for specific vehicle classes. The curr_chunk discusses the actions that can be taken if a state fails to bring a facility into compliance with minimum average operating speed standards, including charging tolls to certain vehicles and limiting vehicle access. If compliance is not met, the state may face program sanctions. The Sense of Congress is that the Secretary and States should provide incentives for advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles, including the use of HOV lanes on highways and the Interstate System. The Sense of Congress is to provide incentives for advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles to minimize air emissions and decrease fossil fuel consumption."
