    "content": "The Act is titled the \"MRSA Infection Prevention and Patient Protection Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines terms such as \"acute care hospital,\" \"hospital,\" \"MRSA,\" and \"other infection.\" The Secretary, in consultation with public health officials, determines serious infections in healthcare facilities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. SEC. 3. HOSPITAL INFECTION PREVENTION PROGRAMS. The Secretary must establish regulations within 150 days of the Act's enactment, in consultation with experts, to prevent MRSA infections and other antibiotic-resistant pathogens in high-risk hospital departments. The Secretary must establish regulations within 150 days of the Act's enactment to prevent MRSA infections and other antibiotic-resistant pathogens in high-risk hospital departments. The regulations will define \"serious source of morbidity and mortality\" quantitatively and include screening, recordkeeping, and other requirements related to reducing MRSA infections, consistent with the Act's requirements. The regulations under the Act must be implemented within 30-180 days after publication in the Federal Register. Acute care hospitals must screen patients entering high-risk hospital departments within 180 days of the Act's enactment, with an extension process established by the Secretary in consultation with the CDC Director. The Secretary, in consultation with the CDC Director, must establish a timetable for extending screening requirements to all hospital patients by January 1, 2014. The Secretary may waive these requirements if MRSA infections decline to a level where further screening is unnecessary. Medicare requirements for acute care hospitals now include compliance with MRSA screening as per the MRSA Infection Prevention and Patient Protection Act. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2011, regarding potential Medicare payment adjustments to help hospitals cover the costs of screening and treating MRSA infections. The Secretary will consider the needs of various types of hospitals in a report to Congress. Hospitals must follow best practices, including implementing contact precautions for MRSA-positive patients and isolating them with appropriate staffing ratios. Patients who test positive for MRSA must be informed of the results and have it noted in their medical records. Hospitals must implement contact precautions for MRSA-positive patients, isolate them with appropriate staffing ratios, control and monitor their movements within the hospital, and take steps to prevent transmission to other patients. The Secretary may suspend these measures in emergencies. Each hospital must adopt a policy by January 1, 2010, for MRSA-infected patients to receive aftercare instructions. Discharged ICU patients must be retested for MRSA, with positive results noted in their records. Staff must be educated on MRSA transmission, protective measures, and disinfection policies. Additional interventions for MRSA control may be required by the Secretary. The Secretary mandates hospitals to report MRSA infections using the National Healthcare Safety Network by January 1, 2011. Hospital-specific infection rates, including MRSA, will be published. Non-hospital Medicare providers must report MRSA infections using identified information. The Secretary will define \"infected transferred patient\" and establish systems for identifying and informing facilities about such patients. Non-hospital Medicare providers treating infected transferred patients must meet specific requirements. The Secretary will establish systems for identifying infected transferred patients and require non-hospital Medicare providers to submit action plans to reduce MRSA infections. Regulations will be developed to provide assistance and educational materials for preventing MRSA infections, with non-compliant providers facing public disclosure. The Secretary will publish the name of providers with MRSA infections and the number of infections from the previous year. Hospitals can apply for increased capital-related costs payment for MRSA screening programs, which will be approved if deemed reasonable and necessary. Repayment is required within 4 years. The Secretary will publish providers with MRSA infections and the number from the previous year. Hospitals can apply for increased capital-related costs payment for MRSA screening programs, with repayment required within 4 years. The Secretary will develop a certification system for appropriate MRSA screening and support services within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The MRSA testing pilot program is established under Section 4 of the Act. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will award a grant for a collaborative project between a hospital and testing corporation to develop a rapid, cost-effective method for MRSA testing using PCR or other molecular methods. The pilot program aims to create a low-cost PCR-based system for timely MRSA testing, ensure affordability for hospitals, and establish centralized reporting of results. The grant aims to develop a system for centralized reporting of testing results to government agencies and a technology platform for detecting and treating priority infections. Eligibility requirements include collaboration between a nonprofit hospital and a testing corporation, with the hospital serving as the beta test site for MRSA screening methods."
