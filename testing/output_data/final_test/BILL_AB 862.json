    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 405 of the Food and Agricultural Code is amended to allow the department to reproduce or distribute biological control organisms with approval, as long as they are not harmful to public health and are effective in reducing plant or animal damage from pests or diseases. The department is prohibited from producing beneficial organisms if they are readily available for purchase. Section 409 is also amended to allow the department to issue and renew licenses or certificates every two years as needed. The Department of Food and Agriculture can set fees for licenses not exceeding twice the annual fee. The Legislature intends to develop nonstate funding sources with county officials and industry reps. The committee will reimburse the secretary for all expenses related to carrying out duties under the Food and Agricultural Code. Certified farmers' markets in California must comply with regulations and operate under specific provisions. The operator of a certified farmers\u2019 market must establish a defined marketing area for selling only agricultural products. Only the producer or their authorized representative can sell products within the market. Sales of products purchased from others are not allowed, and producers cannot sell products to be resold in violation of regulations. Vendors must comply with specific requirements when selling agricultural products in a certified farmers\u2019 market. In a certified farmers' market, vendors must post a sign stating the farm's name, county of production, and a statement indicating that they grew or raised the products being sold. Each farm must display their products separately with the required sign. All processed agricultural products offered for sale must clearly state that they consist only of products grown or raised by the selling farm or ranch, along with necessary information about the processing facility. This includes the farm or ranch name, location, and registration number or identity reference of the processing facility. Meat or poultry products must also identify where they were cut and wrapped according to regulations. Processed agricultural products for sale must adhere to USDA or California inspection standards, including details of the manufacturing facility. (3) All organic products must be clearly labeled or have signage identifying them as organic. The representations required are subject to penalties specified in Section 890. Operators of certified farmers' markets cannot allow the sale of certain fresh produce by vendors in close proximity to the market. Operators of certified farmers' markets must keep accurate participation records of direct marketing producers and submit quarterly reports to the department. They can establish more restrictive rules as long as they do not conflict with state laws. Operators of certified farmers' markets, except for government agencies, can set rules and requirements for market operation. Government agency operators must comply with state laws and regulations. Operators of certified farmers' markets must annually register with the department to obtain a certificate from the county agricultural commissioner's office. The application includes market details, operator information, and agent for service of process. Upon approval, a certified farmers' market certificate is issued. A certified farmers\u2019 market certificate issued by a county agricultural commissioner is valid for 12 months and can be renewed annually. The commissioner must inspect each market at least once every six months and may charge a fee for certification and inspection based on actual expenses. Before selling at a certified farmers\u2019 market, a producer must register with the department and obtain a certificate from the county agricultural commissioner\u2019s office. The producer must declare compliance with good agricultural practices outlined in the Small Farm Food Safety Guidelines. The county agricultural commissioner will issue a certified producer\u2019s certificate upon approval of the application. This declaration does not exempt the producer from complying with other state or federal laws regarding food safety and agricultural practices. As part of obtaining or renewing a certified producer certificate, a producer farming crops must annually submit specific crop information to the county agricultural commissioner's office. The secretary may specify the required information through regulations. A certified producer\u2019s certificate issued by a county agricultural commissioner is valid for up to 12 months and can be renewed annually. Inspections are conducted by the commissioner to verify production of commodities being sold at farmers\u2019 markets. Inspections may occur during harvest or sale of the commodity. The county agricultural commissioner provides a fee schedule for certification or inspection to producers. The fee charged can equal the actual expenses incurred. Renewal of a certified farmers\u2019 market certificate or certified producer\u2019s certificate may be denied if delinquent in fee payment. Renewal is possible after payment of all outstanding balances and associated penalties. The act does not require reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. However, if the Commission on State Mandates finds other mandated costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts."
