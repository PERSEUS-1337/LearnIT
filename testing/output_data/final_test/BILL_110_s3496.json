    "content": "The \"Air and Health Quality Empowerment Zone Designation Act of 2008\" establishes criteria for designating specific geographical areas as air and health quality empowerment zones. These zones can apply for grants to replace or retrofit polluting vehicles or engines to improve the health of the population living in the zones. The San Joaquin Valley faces serious air quality challenges impacting development, health, and economy. It emits high levels of nitrogen oxides and does not meet federal standards for PM2.5. Children miss school days and residents suffer from asthma attacks and premature deaths due to elevated ozone levels. Valley residents in the San Joaquin Valley face severe air quality issues, with 23,300 asthma attacks annually, 1 in 5 children diagnosed with asthma, and a cost of $3.2 billion due to nonattainment of Federal air quality standards. The Valley also struggles with high unemployment rates. The Federal Government needs to collaborate with the Valley and the State to address air quality, health, and economic development by designating the Valley as an air quality empowerment zone eligible for Federal grants and assistance. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Agency, Clean Air Act, PM2.5, strategic plan, and Valley. It also outlines procedures for designating air quality empowerment zones. The Administrator may designate areas as air and health quality empowerment zones for up to ten years, or until revoked if the local air pollution control district is in attainment. Areas can be designated as in attainment with air quality standards or not complying with the strategic plan. Designations require nomination by the local pollution control district, assurances of plan implementation, and accurate information provided to the Administrator. The designated area must meet eligibility criteria and include a strategic plan for achieving the purposes of the Act, detailing partnership involvement and resource availability. The strategic plan for the nominated area must include details on private/public partnerships, funding requests from Federal programs, success measurement benchmarks, and any other required information by the Administrator. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A nominated area must meet specific criteria to be eligible for designation under section 5(a), including being in extreme nonattainment of the 8-hour ozone standard and nonattainment of the PM2.5 standard. Agricultural sources in the area must have significant emissions of oxides of nitrogen or volatile organic compounds. The nominated area must have significant emissions of volatile organic compounds from farming operations and meet specific criteria related to air-related health effects, economic impact, and state matching funds. SEC. 7. ELIGIBLE GRANT APPLICANTS: Air pollution control districts or local governmental entities authorized to regulate air quality under the Clean Air Act can apply for grants under this Act. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF AIR AND HEALTH EMPOWERMENT GRANTS. Each designated air and health quality empowerment zone is eligible to receive grants based on their needs and applications. Grants are awarded upon designation and determined by the Administrator. Each air and health safety empowerment zone designated under section 5(a) is eligible to receive grants for specific activities outlined in section 2, overseen by the local air pollution control district. Grants must be used in accordance with the zone's strategic plan. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000 is authorized for grants to air and health safety empowerment zones for activities benefiting residents through improved air quality and health, in alignment with the zone's strategic plan."
