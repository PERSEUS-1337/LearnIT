    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 32280 of the Education Code is amended. The Legislature requires California public schools to develop comprehensive safety plans in collaboration with various stakeholders to address campus crime and violence. Law enforcement agencies involved include local police departments, county sheriffs\u2019 offices, school district police, probation departments, and district attorneys\u2019 offices. The safety plan aims to prevent, respond to, and educate about potential incidents of crime, violence, or medical emergencies on campus. The safety plan for California public schools aims to address campus crime, violence, and medical emergencies, including incidents before and after school activities. Each school district and county office of education must develop comprehensive school safety plans for kindergarten through 12th grade, including activities before and after school. The schoolsite council or a safety planning committee is responsible for writing and developing the plan based on the school's needs and resources. The schoolsite council or safety planning committee must include a teacher, parent, classified employee, coach, and other members as desired. They should consult with law enforcement in developing the school safety plan. Small school districts can have a districtwide safety plan instead of a schoolsite council. A \"small school district\" is defined as having fewer than 2,501 units of average daily attendance at the beginning of each fiscal year. When a violent crime occurs at an elementary or secondary school, the principal or designee can notify parents and employees. The school district can work with law enforcement and employee representatives to develop safety plans, with the option to withhold tactical responses from the public. The article defines \"tactical responses to criminal incidents\" as measures to protect students and staff, secure school premises, and apprehend perpetrators. School districts can discuss tactical response plans with law enforcement in closed sessions, with any approval announced in open session. This does not exempt schools from complying with Section 32282 of the Education Code, which outlines comprehensive school safety plan requirements. The curr_chunk discusses assessing school crime, implementing strategies for school safety, and developing procedures for compliance with laws related to school safety, including child abuse reporting and disaster procedures for pupils with disabilities. Establishing earthquake emergency procedure system in public schools with 50 or more pupils, including disaster plan and drop procedure practice for safety. Protective measures and training program for earthquake emergencies in public schools with 50 or more pupils. Cooperation with public agencies like the American Red Cross for mass care shelters during disasters. Policies for serious student misconduct, notification procedures for dangerous pupils, and a discrimination and harassment policy consistent with anti-discrimination laws. The comprehensive school safety plan includes provisions for a schoolwide dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel and procedures for safe entry and exit of students, parents, and staff. Gang-related apparel is defined as clothing that could threaten the school environment and is not protected speech. The school safety plan includes rules on discipline, strategies for preventing incidents, and using existing resources for safety. The Legislature intends for schools to develop comprehensive safety plans and utilize the \"Safe Schools: A Planning Guide for Action\" handbook. Each schoolsite council or school safety planning committee must consult and coordinate with others when developing a comprehensive school safety plan. The plan should be evaluated annually and include policies to prevent bullying. The comprehensive school safety plan, written and updated by the schoolsite council or school safety planning committee, must be submitted for approval. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
