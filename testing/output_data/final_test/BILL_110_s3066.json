    "content": "The \"Browns Canyon Wilderness Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes definitions for key terms. The \"Browns Canyon Wilderness Act\" defines key terms such as Secretary concerned, State, wilderness area, and wilderness map. The Act designates specific responsibilities to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior for different wilderness areas. Designation of Browns Canyon Wilderness, Pike and San Isabel National Forests, and Royal Gorge Resource Area in Colorado. Designation of Browns Canyon Wilderness in Colorado includes approximately 12,104 acres in Pike and San Isabel National Forests and 7,921 acres in the Royal Gorge Resource Area. The land is designated as wilderness in accordance with the Wilderness Act. Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will provide a wilderness map and legal description. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior will file a legal description of the designated wilderness area with the relevant congressional committees. The wilderness map and legal description will have the same legal force as if included in the Act, with the Secretary allowed to correct errors. The wilderness map will be available for public inspection in designated offices. The Secretary concerned will manage the wilderness area in accordance with the Wilderness Act, with grazing of livestock permitted to continue if established before the enactment of this Act. The House of Representatives introduced H.R. 2570 in the 101st Congress, stating that the State's jurisdiction over wildlife and fish is not affected by the Act. Any land acquired by the United States adjacent to the wilderness area may be included in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Congress acknowledges the arid nature of the designated wilderness land and its unsuitability for new water development. The Act allows for the development or expansion of water resource facilities near headwaters of streams on land with limited existing facilities or water use opportunities. The designated wilderness boundaries are drawn to preserve the wilderness area. The Act allows for the development or expansion of water resource facilities near headwaters of streams on land with limited existing facilities or water use opportunities. The designated wilderness boundaries are drawn to specifically preclude conflicts with the management and use of the Arkansas River water in the State. Proper management and protection of the wilderness and other land values can be achieved in ways different from other laws. The limitation on new water resource facilities includes various types of water infrastructure. The Act restricts the development of new water resource facilities within the wilderness area, but allows for the use and maintenance of existing facilities within the boundaries. The Act does not affect existing water rights, does not set a precedent for future wilderness designations, and does not change interstate water compacts. The wilderness area is withdrawn from various activities under public land laws and mining laws. The Secretary concerned may undertake measures for fire, insect, and disease management in the wilderness area. The Secretary must review existing policies for fire management in the wilderness area within a year of this Act's enactment. No protective perimeters or buffer zones are created around the wilderness area, and activities outside the area should not be restricted if visible or audible from within."
