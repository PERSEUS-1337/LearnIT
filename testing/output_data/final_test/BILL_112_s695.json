    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act\" and includes provisions for electronic on-board recording devices. The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act includes amendments to Subchapter III of chapter 311 of title 49, United States Code. These changes involve redesignating paragraphs and defining terms like 'driving time' and 'electronic on-board recording device'. The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act amends section 31137 by requiring all commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce to be equipped with electronic on-board recording devices to improve compliance with hours of service regulations. The effective date of these amendments will be determined by the Secretary of Transportation. The Commercial Driver Compliance Improvement Act mandates electronic on-board recording devices for all interstate commercial motor vehicles to enhance compliance with hours of service regulations. The effective date of these requirements will be set by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation must finalize regulations within 18 months of the Act's enactment to implement electronic on-board recording devices for commercial motor vehicles. These regulations will establish performance requirements, including synchronization with the vehicle's engine control module, driver identification for hours of service compliance, accurate recording of driving time, and real-time recording capabilities. The regulations will require electronic on-board recording devices for commercial motor vehicles to provide real-time location tracking, allow law enforcement access during inspections, and be tamper-resistant. Certification criteria will ensure devices meet performance requirements. The regulations under this section will define a standardized user interface for vehicle operator compliance and establish a secure process for vehicle operator identification, data access, and transfer between vehicles, data storage for carriers, and data transportability for law enforcement. Beginning three years after the enactment of this Act, regulations will apply to motor carriers, commercial motor vehicles, and operators subject to hours of service and record of duty status requirements. The regulations aim to establish a standard security level for tamper-resistant electronic on-board recording devices."
