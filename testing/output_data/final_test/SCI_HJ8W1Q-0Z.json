    "content": "Our improved end-to-end differentiable neural networks utilize fast weight memories with a gate mechanism updating fast weights at each time step. Trained on a complex sequence to sequence variation of the Associative Retrieval Problem, our architecture outperforms various RNNs in terms of accuracy and parameter efficiency. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are widely used for tasks like automatic translation and speech recognition. However, they struggle with tasks requiring memorization. This work explores a generalization of the Associative Retrieval problem. In this work, a generalization of the Associative Retrieval problem is explored by turning it into a sequence to sequence problem with increased complexity. A fast weight architecture is proposed to overcome limitations of current RNNs, consisting of two networks - s and f - operating in parallel. The slow network s generates weight-updates for the fast network f, with s changing weights after every mini-batch and f predicting targets. The fast network, referred to as f, can change its weights after every time step, influenced by early work in Neural Networks. The concept of fast-changing weights emerged from biological evidence and storing activation patterns in associative networks. Networks with non-differentiable fast weights have been studied since 1981. Recent research on fast weights describes them as an attention mechanism that increases the flexibility of learned programs. The concept of fast-changing weights in neural networks emerged from biological evidence and storing activation patterns in associative networks. Fast weights increase the flexibility of learned programs but cannot store long-term knowledge. The approach involves using a first network to generate context-dependent weight updates for a second network, with the weights of a network referred to as its program. An adaptive program like f can be described through the concept of time-varying variables. The fast weight architecture allows for adaptive programs in neural networks, increasing flexibility without storing long-term knowledge. The Hypernetwork by BID9 uses adaptive interpolation of LSTM cells for language modeling, outperforming traditional LSTM on various datasets. The fast weight architecture consists of a big network s and a small network f, both RNNs. The weights of s change after every batch, while the weights of f change after every time step. The slow network s(x t , h S t ) and the time-varying fast network f t (x t , h F t ) use the same input embedding and output projection. The paper uses a 2-layer transition RNN in both cases. The fast weight architecture involves a big network s and a small network f, both RNNs. The weights of s change after every batch, while the weights of f change after every time step. The slow network s(x t , h S t ) and the time-varying fast network f t (x t , h F t ) use the same input embedding and output projection. The paper utilizes a 2-layer transition RNN in both cases. The fast network incorporates a non-linear activation function like tanh, with fixed parameters W and changing parameters F(1) and F(2). The slow network is defined similarly with hidden states h S. The calculation of F t+1 involves outer products H and T to generate weight matrices in an Hebb-like manner. The use of layer normalization (LN) in the fast network stabilizes learning. The fast weight architecture utilizes layer normalization (LN) to stabilize learning, especially in the beginning of training. Different configurations of LN were tested, with post-activation LN consistently yielding the best results. A gating matrix is used to blend the current fast matrix with a matrix update, similar to a highway network mechanism. Multiplicative and additive interactions were evaluated, with the specific update mechanism providing the best results. Additionally, the slow network generates weights. The architecture utilizes layer normalization for stable learning. A gating matrix blends fast and slow matrices. A challenging sequence task is created based on Associative Retrieval. Storage tokens are key-value pairs, query tokens have only a key. The network outputs values for query tokens based on seen storage tokens. The network outputs values for query tokens based on seen storage tokens. Query tokens must be valid keys seen after the previous query token. Truncated BPTT is used to train the network on concatenated query tokens and storage tokens. An example with 2 queries is provided. The text chunk discusses the generation of queries for training and testing sets, the use of partial accuracy to evaluate predictions, the choice of optimization algorithm (Nadam), and the observation that Adam converges slower than Nadam in experiments. The final architecture uses an embedding size of 15, with a fast network defined as h DISPLAYFORM0 \u2208 R 40\u00d740 and a slow network as h S \u2208 R 40 , S (1) \u2208 R 55\u00d7100 , S (2) \u2208 R 100\u00d7394. Different configurations are possible, with a larger s helping the model converge faster but not improving performance. Preliminary experiments with different RNNs showed promising results. Results show that the model achieved the best performance with a learning rate of 0.002 across all architectures, using a sequence length of 32 and a batch size of 256. Comparison was made with other architectures such as LSTM, AttentionFW, and HyperNetworks, with experiments on feed-forward and recurrent fast weights yielding trivial outputs. Our model outperforms others in terms of accuracy and bits per character, using significantly fewer parameters. Previous works struggled with generalizing memory mechanisms, but our novel fast weight architecture integrates computer-like memory effectively. The validation results of the best models across architectures show the superiority of our approach. The model integrates computer-like memory into the architecture, avoiding the need for the model to learn the mechanism itself. This approach is more biologically plausible and allows for better learning and generalization. The approach of improving the artificial neural substrate for higher-level functions through training is favored over reverse engineering every human capability for intelligence. Fast weights show positive effects in architectures but have practical limitations, such as increased memory consumption compared to RNNs. Fast weights in neural networks can increase memory consumption compared to RNNs, limiting their size and practicality in applications like neural machine translation. However, using soft, end-to-end differentiable attention mechanisms can help RNNs control their own attention spotlights and quickly associate patterns through fast weights. This approach can significantly increase the number of time-varying variables while maintaining a relatively small model size. We improved the update mechanism for fast weights in neural networks, allowing for a small model with memory-expensive fast network. The fast weights are active memory for context-specific computation, used to predict current output by delaying weight updates from the slow network. The fast network has 3840 time-varying variables, significantly increasing the total number of variables. In this paper, a new approach to the Associative Retrieval problem is introduced using a complex sequence to sequence variation. The model learns to store, retrieve, and forget associations from input sequences using a standard RNN to generate weight updates for a fast weight RNN. By updating weight matrices with a gate and two generated matrices, the model outperforms other architectures in convergence, accuracy, and parameter efficiency."
