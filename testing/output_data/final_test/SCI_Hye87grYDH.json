Sparse Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in English-to-Vietnamese and German-to-English translations. Qualitative analysis highlights its superior performance by focusing on relevant information, emphasizing the importance of attention in natural language understanding. Attention is a crucial component in models for language processing, as demonstrated by the Transformer model proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The Transformer model proposed by Vaswani et al. in 2017 utilizes the attention mechanism for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). However, the vanilla Transformer's attention assigns credits to all components of the context, leading to a lack of focus on relevant words. In contrast, the Explicit Sparse Transformer focuses on the most relevant k words, improving performance in natural language generation tasks. The Explicit Sparse Transformer model introduces a sparse attention mechanism that focuses only on the most contributive states, improving concentration compared to the vanilla Transformer. This model is inspired by previous works on sparse attention in Transformer and LSTM models. The proposed sparse attention method in the Explicit Sparse Transformer model improves concentration by focusing on top-k positions, removing distractions from irrelevant words. Validation on three tasks and comparison with previous methods show its effectiveness. Additionally, it serves as a regularization method during training, enhancing alignment quality. The paper introduces the Explicit Sparse Transformer model, which improves attention concentration through explicit selection. Extensive experiments show better performance in NMT, Image Captioning, and Language Modeling tasks. The model achieves state-of-the-art results in English-to-Vietnamese translation and is faster in training and testing compared to previous sparse attention methods. The importance of attention concentration for information extraction is highlighted. The Explicit Sparse Transformer model improves attention concentration by selectively focusing on key elements, removing irrelevant information. This method enhances information extraction and outperforms traditional attention models. The Explicit Sparse Transformer model enhances attention concentration by selecting key elements and removing noise. It utilizes sparse attention masking to focus on the most contributive elements, improving information extraction compared to traditional models. The Explicit Sparse Transformer model improves attention concentration by selecting key elements using top-k selection and normalization. This explicit selection ensures important components are preserved and simplifies the model. The back-propagation process of top-k selection is also discussed. The output representation of self-attention in the Explicit Sparse Transformer model focuses on key components through top-k selection, improving attention concentration. This selection process ensures important elements are preserved, leading to a more simplified model. The Explicit Sparse Transformer model improves attention concentration by sparsifying attention weights, focusing on key elements in the decoding states. Experimental results show its effectiveness in NMT tasks like English-to-German, English-to-Vietnamese, and German-to-English translation. For En-De translation, the Explicit Sparse Transformer model was trained on a dataset of 4.5 million sentence pairs with a shared vocabulary of 32K sub-word units. Results were reported on the newstest 2014 set. For En-Vi translation, the model was trained on a dataset of 133K sentence pairs from translated TED talks with vocabularies of 17,200 and 7,800 for the source and target languages respectively. For De-En translation, a dataset of 160K sentence pairs was used for training. The dataset for image captioning task includes 160K sentence pairs for training and 7K sentences for validation. The model was evaluated on the Microsoft COCO 2014 dataset, which contains 123,287 images with descriptive sentences. Results show that the Explicit Sparse Transformer outperforms baseline models on the COCO Karpathy test split. The Explicit Sparse Transformer outperforms baseline models on the COCO Karpathy test split, showing improvements in BLEU-4, METEOR, and CIDEr scores. Additionally, the Transformer-XL model achieves better performance compared to other strong baselines on the enwiki8 test set. The Explicit Sparse Transformer outperforms baseline models on the COCO Karpathy test split, showing improvements in BLEU-4, METEOR, and CIDEr scores. Transformer-XL achieves better performance compared to other strong baselines on the enwiki8 test set. In comparison, the proposed top-k selection method in the Transformer model is faster and comparable in BLEU scores to previous sparse attention methods. Various analyses were conducted to discuss the effectiveness of the top-k sparse attention method in training. The proposed sparse attention method in the Transformer model achieves comparable results to previous methods but is 2x faster during training and 10x faster during inference. This speed improvement is due to reduced computation for calculating sparse attention scores. Other sparse attention methods with local attention constraints do not perform well in neural machine translation. The proposed sparse attention method in the Transformer model achieves comparable results to previous methods but is 2x faster during training and 10x faster during inference. Results of the ablation study show the impact of sparsification at different phases on the En-Vi test set. The optimal value of k is discussed, with experiments showing that setting k to 8 achieves consistent performance. The study explores the impact of sparsification in the training phase of the Transformer model, showing that setting k to 8 consistently improves performance. A 0.3 BLEU score increase suggests that sparsification simplifies the model. A case study comparing attention distributions of the Explicit Sparse Transformer and baseline model on the En-Vi test set reveals differences in attention patterns. The study shows that sparsification in the training phase of the Transformer model improves performance. The attention distribution of the Explicit Sparse Transformer focuses on specific positions, enhancing alignment and confidence in phrase generation. In contrast, the vanilla Transformer decoder tends to focus on the last source token, leading to wrong alignment and insufficient extraction of relevant information for generation. The Explicit Sparse Transformer improves alignment and focuses on relevant source context, unlike the vanilla Transformer. Attention mechanism has been a key focus in NLP studies, with various enhancements proposed by different researchers. The curr_chunk discusses different approaches to attention mechanisms in image captioning and memory networks, including soft attention, hard attention, and sparse access memory. The authors propose a new method, Explicit Sparse Transformer, which does not require blocking sentences and can capture long-distance dependencies effectively. This approach is shown to be important in sequence to sequence learning. The curr_chunk introduces the sparsemax method for machine translation tasks, demonstrating its efficiency compared to other sparse attention methods. The attention mechanism in NMT aligns target-side and source-side contexts by mapping query and key-value pairs to an output. The attention mechanism in NMT aligns target-side and source-side contexts by mapping query and key-value pairs to an output. Transformer, based on the attention mechanism, shows state-of-the-art performance in natural language generation tasks. Self-attention focuses on the context itself, with linear transformations of input x for query Q, key K, and value V. The attention mechanism in NMT aligns target-side and source-side contexts by mapping query and key-value pairs to an output. In the multi-head attention, the computation is separated into g heads, allowing multiple parts of the inputs to be computed individually. Each head computes the output using query, key, and value, which are then concatenated for the final output. Soft attention assigns weights to more words, but to improve concentration, a linear transformation is applied for the final output. In order to improve concentration in attention for effective information extraction, the problem of sparse attention in Transformer is studied, and the model Explicit Sparse Transformer is proposed. The model is implemented using default settings from Vaswani et al. (2017), with hyperparameters tuned on the valid set. For En-Vi translation, default scripts and hyperparameter settings of tensor2tensor 4 v1.11.0 are used, while fairseq 5 v0.6.1 scripts preprocess the De-En and En-De dataset. Training is done on the En-Vi dataset for 35K steps with a batch size of 4K, 90 epochs for IWSLT 2015 De-En dataset, and 72 epochs on 4 GPUs for WMT 2014 En-De dataset. For WMT 2014 En-De dataset, the model is trained for 72 epochs on 4 GPUs with an update frequency of 32 and a batch size of 3584. Different initializations are used to reduce the impact of random initialization. Evaluation is done using case-sensitive tokenized BLEU score for WMT14 En-De and case-insensitive BLEU for IWSLT datasets. Compound splitting is used for WMT 14 En-De. Averaged checkpoints are saved and the best valid BLEU score is reported on the test set. For IWSLT 2015 En-Vi, checkpoints are saved every 600 seconds and the last 20 are averaged. The model uses the default setting of Transformer and reports BLEU scores using the COCO captioning evaluation toolkit. Language models are evaluated using BPC, with lower BPC indicating better performance. The model implemented is Explicit Sparse Transformer-XL, based on Transformer-XL. The masking function M(\u00b7, \u00b7) in Transformer-XL is defined for top-k selection and normalization during back-propagation. The implementation is shown for single head self-attention, making it easy to plug in. The proposed method for single head self-attention is easy to implement and can be plugged into the successful Transformer model."
