Some funds were reallocated into regular base funding due to less than requested regular budget. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 26, 2007, included $2.385 billion in emergency international affairs spending. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act included $2.385 billion in emergency international affairs spending, with additional funds allocated for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. H.R. 2764 was used as the vehicle for the omnibus bill, passing through the House and Senate with amendments for increased military spending. Division J of the omnibus bill covers international affairs programs, subject to a 0.81% across-the-board cut to meet budget targets. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes $2.385 billion in emergency international affairs spending, with additional funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Division J of the omnibus bill covers international affairs programs, subject to a 0.81% across-the-board cut. The Act provides supplemental funds for State Department operations, Foreign Operations, and military funding for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes $2.385 billion in emergency international affairs spending, with additional funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Supplemental funds for Foreign Operations accounts include various allocations for Global Health & Child Survival, International Disaster Assistance, USAID Operating Expenses for Iraq, Economic Support Fund, Migration and Refugee Assistance, Foreign Military Financing, and Peacekeeping Operations. Approximately $4.5 billion of the President's emergency request remains outstanding, with the possibility of an additional supplemental measure in the spring of 2008. In spring 2008, a potential supplemental measure could be considered for international affairs spending. This includes funds for foreign aid activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, and Central America. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for international affairs amounts to $6.897 billion, with the largest portion allocated for State Department operations. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request for international affairs amounts to $6.897 billion, with the largest portion allocated for State Department operations and foreign assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as programs in Mexico, the West Bank and Gaza, North Korea, Sudan, and Pakistan. The State Department estimated emergency supplemental funding needs of $3.220 billion for various programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, including Diplomatic and Consular Programs, Worldwide Security Upgrades, staff housing, and contributions to international organizations. Foreign Operations comprise $3.678 billion, with nearly half allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Bush Administration has faced criticism for relying heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, particularly for expenses related to Iraq and Afghanistan. In February 2007, the original FY2008 State Department portion of the emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for operations in Iraq and $53 million for Contributions to International Organizations. This was later amended to add nearly $1.3 billion. The Administration amended the supplemental budget by adding $1.3 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, Embassy Security, and Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities. The total emergency funds requested for FY2008 for the State Department's Administration of Foreign Affairs equal $3.220 billion. The Mission in Iraq consists of about 1,000 direct-hire Americans representing 12 U.S. government agencies. The Department requested $2.283 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, with $2.120.6 billion allocated for emergency needs in Iraq. The Administration requested $978.7 million for security needs in Iraq, including local guards, compound guards, regional security, personal security details, armored vehicles, and equipment. Another $907.1 million would go towards Provincial Reconstruction Teams for salaries, operations, living accommodations, and security. Additionally, $162.4 million was sought for other support and overhead cover protection. The Administration requested $162.4 million for worldwide security upgrades in Afghanistan, including securing facilities, high threat protection teams, election support, unbudgeted security costs, and armored vehicles for the embassy and PRTs. Other expenses covered by the FY2008 emergency supplemental request for the Department of State included U.S. staff housing in Afghanistan, U.S. assessments for U.N. activities combatting terrorism, and U.S. Contributions for International Peacekeeping activities in Darfur. The Consolidated Appropriation Act (P.L. 110-161) provides regular and supplemental funding for the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors. The enacted law includes $1.262 billion in supplemental funds for the Department of State, with $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $468.0 million for U.S. Contributions to International Peacekeeping. The emergency supplemental amounts are lower than the Administration's request. $575.0 million is allocated for Iraq operations and $206.6 million for worldwide security protection, with $162.4 million still pending for security protection in Afghanistan. The CIPA emergency supplemental funds include $550.4 million for a new UN/AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur. $390 million is allocated for Darfur, $78 million for FY2008 U.N. Peacekeeping funds, and $12.0 million for the BBG. $333.6 million for Darfur is still pending. No specific allocation requirements for the BBG funds are mentioned. The Foreign Operations portion of the supplemental request totals $3.678 billion, with $1.367 billion requested with the President's budget on February 6, 2007. The amended request for $2.311 billion, including P.L. 480 food aid, was sent to Congress on October 22nd. One-third of the request consisted of $2.217 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) for various countries. Anti-narcotics emergency supplemental funding for FY2008 totaled $734 million, with the largest portion allocated for Mexico and Central America. Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) totaled $230 million, mainly for Iraqi and Palestinian refugees. International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) totaled $80 million for programs in Iraq to assist internally displaced persons (IDPs). The request for emergency supplemental funds for foreign operations includes $5 million for the Afghanistan Presidential Protection Service and $350 million for P.L. 480 food aid in the Horn of Africa, Kenya, and Sudan. Congress approved $1.123 billion in emergency funds, but the amounts approved are less than requested, leaving discretion to the Administration on where to allocate the funds. Congress approved supplemental funds for various foreign operations, including $115 million for Global Health & Child Survival, $110 million for International Disaster Assistance, $20.8 million for USAID Operating Expenses, $542.6 million for Economic Support Fund, $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. No funds were provided for counter-narcotics programs in Mexico and Central America. In FY2008, almost $42 billion in U.S. funds were appropriated for Iraq reconstruction through annual supplemental legislation. The Administration requested $392 million for security assistance in State and Foreign Operations appropriations, but Congress rejected the request in both House and Senate versions. Funding for Iraq reconstruction in FY2008 was expected to come from an emergency supplemental measure. The FY2008 emergency supplemental appropriations request, revised on October 22, 2007, included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction. This funding has two main components: security aid funded by the Department of Defense and political/economic/social sector assistance funded by State and Foreign Operations. The DOD reconstruction appropriations totaled about $3.7 billion, primarily for training Iraqi troops and providing reconstruction grants through the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). CERP allows military commanders to support various local economic activities. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) provides assistance in Iraq, including repair of infrastructure and payment of salaries to local security forces. A $100 million request was added to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for economic stabilization efforts. The Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations aims to stimulate the economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request of $1.2 billion for Iraq includes funding for various assistance programs, such as the Economic Support Fund (ESF), International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA), and International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) accounts. The Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) receive funding from ESF to help stabilize Iraq, with 31 teams in total, including embedded PRTs with U.S. combat battalions in Baghdad and Anbar province. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) is used to support Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Baghdad and Anbar province, helping stabilize areas secured by U.S. and Iraqi forces through economic projects, job training, and capacity building for local government officials. ESF also supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts in Iraq. Additionally, the October budget revision added $25 million to the ESF supplemental request and proposed establishing a new Iraq enterprise fund. Enterprise funds in the former Soviet Union were U.S. government-funded bodies that provided loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses. The funds aimed to support the growth of the private sector, including mortgage lending markets and private equity funds. While some funds, like the Polish Fund, were successful in making profitable investments, others struggled due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Critics question the funds' effectiveness, as their development goals sometimes conflict with the pursuit of economic profit. The INCLE account supports rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform efforts. The MRA request addresses the refugee crisis in the region, providing relief to millions of displaced Iraqis. Emergency funds were also requested for operational costs in reconstruction programs. In considering requests for Iraq reconstruction, Congress allocated $1.9 billion for security aid but only $250 million for economic assistance, with exceptions for humanitarian programs like demining and refugee support. Congress appropriated funds for various purposes in Iraq, including assistance for refugees, disaster relief, the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund, and the rescue of Iraqi scholars. This brings the total funding for Iraq reconstruction since 2003 to $44.8 billion. However, further funding is needed for PRT operations and other programs to support the surge and enhance the capacity of the Iraqi government. The Administration is seeking additional emergency Iraq reconstruction aid of about $3 billion from FY2007 funds. Afghanistan's political transition was completed in December 2005, but insurgent threats escalated in 2006, raising concerns about U.S. stabilization efforts. The new constitution was adopted in January 2004, successful elections were held in 2004 and 2005, and the parliament has become a platform for resolving differences peacefully. Afghan citizens are experiencing new personal freedoms. Afghan citizens are enjoying new personal freedoms, especially in the northern and western regions, previously forbidden under the Taliban. Women are participating in economic and political life, with upcoming elections planned for 2009. The insurgency led by remnants of the Taliban escalated in 2006, posing a threat to peace and security. Despite recent successes in counter-insurgency operations, slow reconstruction, corruption, and lack of government authority in rural areas have contributed to the Taliban resurgence. Political leadership in the more stable northern part of the country has shown progress. The Afghan government and U.S. officials are concerned about the distribution of reconstruction funding, as narcotics trafficking and independent militias continue to pose challenges. Some Taliban commanders are operating across the border from Pakistan, beyond the reach of U.S./NATO forces. The Reconstruction Opportunity Zones (ROZ) initiative aims to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped regions. Stabilization efforts focus on strengthening the central government, security forces, and promoting reconstruction while combating insurgent threats. The international community has been running PRTs to secure reconstruction in Afghanistan, but weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to democracy. The Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction in FY2008, with additional funding for embassy operations and security. The total request was later amended to $839 million for continued stabilization and economic reconstruction efforts. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, with additional funding for democratic governance and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. This included $275 million to strengthen provincial governance and support ongoing programs like the National Solidarity Program and the Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund. The FY2008 emergency supplemental requests included funding for the ESF, with additional funding for democratic governance and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. This included $40 million for the Solidarity Program, $25 million for the Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund, $50 million for the Provincial Governance Fund, $50 million for basic social services, $170 million for economic growth and infrastructure, and $5 million for Reconstruction Opportunity Zones. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) to support the Afghan leadership. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are strategically important in combating terrorism, with ongoing terrorist and militant activities posing a threat to US interests in Afghanistan. The Government of Pakistan has a 10-year FATA Sustainable Development Plan, supported by a five-year $750 million development assistance strategy from the State Department and USAID. The aim is to improve economic and social conditions in FATA to counter terrorist and militant use of the region. Programs include governance, health, education, and economic development initiatives. In November 2007, President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in Pakistan, leading to a review of U.S. assistance. However, after a national election in February 2008, a new civilian government took office, allowing for the removal of coup-related sanctions and the resumption of assistance. The Administration did not initially request funding for Pakistan in FY2008 but later asked for $90 million for the frontier region development plan. President requested $90 million for the frontier region development plan, leaving a $60 million gap in the total U.S. pledge of $150 million. The FY2008 amended supplemental request for $60 million for ESF would address this funding gap, with investments in governance, health, education, and local economic development. This emergency supplemental request is in addition to regular appropriations from various accounts in the FY2008 budget. No funding was initially requested for Sudan in the FY2008 emergency supplemental, but the Administration sought a total of $868.6 million in the amended emergency supplemental for humanitarian and peacekeeping support in the Darfur region. Sudan received $334.8 million in the regular FY2008 budget and an additional $468 million for the African Union/United Nations. In FY2008, $70 million was requested for Sudan to support upcoming national elections as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United Nations estimates the elections could cost nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment. Additionally, $723.6 million was allocated for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). In the amended FY2008 supplemental, $468 million was appropriated for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). The pending FY2008 emergency supplemental includes $333.6 million. A $550 million request was made for the Mexico and Central America Security Initiative, with $500 million allocated to Mexico for border security technology and $50 million for Central America to improve border security. In FY2008, $50 million was allocated to improve border security, deter smuggling, and enhance justice and gang prevention programs. Mexico received $65.4 million in regular funding, while Central America received $134.8 million in FY2007. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request included $375 million for the Palestinian Authority, focusing on rule of law, economic growth, and governance. In FY2008, $130 million is allocated for job creation, infrastructure, trade, and agriculture programs, with an additional $150 million for budget support. $25 million is for training the Presidential Guards and National Security Force, and $35 million for Palestinian refugees. Congress included $542.6 million in emergency funds, allocating $155 million to the West Bank and Gaza. $200 million in emergency funds was provided, with $106 million proposed for North Korea as part of the Six Party Talks. North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility, allow IAEA monitors, and disable nuclear facilities. The US and other Six Party Talks members agreed to provide 1 million metric tons of fuel oil as North Korea fulfills its commitments, costing the US $131 million. $25 million was authorized in FY2007, with $106 million from FY2008 funding. The omnibus bill allocated $53 million in ESF funds for North Korea. The Administration seeks funding for humanitarian needs, including $350 million for emergency food in Darfur and eastern Chad, $230 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million for Iraqi refugees, $35 million for Palestinian refugees, and $200 million for other worldwide needs. $200 million was appropriated for Migration and Refugee Assistance, with $195 million allocated for Iraqi refugees. $30 million remains pending for assistance to Iraqi refugees in FY2008."
