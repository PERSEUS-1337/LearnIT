    "content": "The \"Medicare-X Choice Act of 2017\" establishes a public health plan under the Social Security Act as the Medicare Exchange Health Plan. The Secretary will establish a low-cost health plan called the Medicare Exchange health plan to provide quality healthcare. The plan will be available in the individual market for plan year 2020 and subsequent years, expanding to all residents in the United States. The Secretary will prioritize rating areas with limited health insurance options or high healthcare costs for the Medicare Exchange health plan in the United States for plan year 2023 and beyond. The Secretary will establish a Plan Reserve Fund in the Treasury for the Medicare Exchange health plan, with appropriations for administering the plan in all rating areas for plan year 2024. The Secretary will establish a Plan Reserve Fund with a $1 billion appropriation for fiscal year 2018. Additionally, a Data and Technology Fund will be created to update technology and collect data for setting premiums in all U.S. regions. The Secretary is authorized to make regulations for these funds. The Secretary may promulgate regulations to carry out this title. The health plan is available to eligible individuals through the American Health Benefit Exchanges. Eligibility criteria include being a qualified individual under the Affordable Care Act and not eligible for Medicare benefits. Plan requirements are outlined in section 2203. The health plan must comply with specific requirements under the Affordable Care Act and the Public Health Service Act to be considered a qualified health plan. The plan must offer silver and gold level versions, with a maximum of 2 versions for each of the 4 coverage levels. Administrative contracting is also addressed in section 2204. \"Section 2204 allows the Secretary to enter contracts for administrative functions related to health plans, including the public health insurance option. Insurance risk cannot be transferred, except in specific cases like alternative payment models. Section 2205 addresses data collection.\" The Secretary is authorized to collect data from State insurance commissioners and other entities to set premium rates and improve quality in health plans, while also addressing disparities. The Secretary establishes premiums for the health plan to cover full actuarial costs, varying geographically and between markets. Excess premiums collected remain available for future beneficiary costs. Enrollees in a State are in a single risk pool, with potential separate pools for individual and small group markets. The Secretary may establish a nationwide mechanism to pool the costs of high-cost patients, separate from existing pooling under the Affordable Care Act. \"SEC. 2207. REIMBURSEMENT RATES.\" The Secretary shall reimburse health care providers for items and services under the health plan at rates determined for equivalent items and services under the original Medicare fee-for-service program. Reimbursement rates may be increased by up to 25 percent for items and services furnished in rural areas. Payment rates for prescription drugs will be negotiated by the Secretary. The Secretary may establish reimbursement rates for additional items and services not covered by original Medicare fee-for-service. Innovative payment methods, including value-based arrangements, can be used for payments under the health plan, including prescription drugs. \"SEC. 2208. PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS.\" The text outlines that health care providers enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid will automatically be participating providers in the health plan. Additional providers can apply to participate. Providers can opt-out if they choose. Starting January 1, 2019, providers must participate in the health plan to be enrolled in Medicare. SEC. 2209 outlines delivery system reform for an enhanced health plan. For plan years starting in 2020, the Secretary can use innovative payment methods for health plan services, including patient-centered medical home payments, value-based purchasing, and telehealth. These methods aim to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities. The health plan aims to address disparities, provide efficient care, and promote integrated, patient-centered services. It encourages the use of high-value services and promotes delivery system reform to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities. The Secretary will implement successful payment and delivery system reforms on a large scale, prioritize implementation in high-cost areas, and may delay implementation in areas where it would disadvantage the public health insurance option. Non-uniform payments are permitted. The Secretary is prohibited from varying payments based on different models under the health plan for different geographic areas. Processes will be established to integrate medical care with social services like food, housing, transportation, and income assistance to reduce spending or improve patient care quality. Telehealth tools will be integrated to increase patient access to medical care in remote or underserved areas. The Secretary will evaluate integrating incentives for enrollees in the health plan who receive services from providers in alternative payment models. The use of alternative payment models under traditional Medicare is allowed. The text chunk discusses the impact of a new Act on Medicare benefits and trust funds, ensuring no effect on benefits or trust funds. It also mentions an amendment to allow negotiation of fair prices for Medicare prescription drugs, with an effective date upon enactment of the Act."
