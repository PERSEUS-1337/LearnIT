    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19780 of the Government Code in California is amended. Section 19780 of the Government Code in California is amended to provide reinstatement rights for employees returning to state service after military leave within specified timeframes. Any period of rehabilitation following active duty in the United States or the state is considered military service. Termination of the state military emergency by the Governor is considered termination of military service. Within 30 days of an employee's return to state service, the appointing authority must inform them of their rights under Section 20997 and provide the necessary form. Before April 1, 2017, all appointing authorities must notify employees of their rights as per Section 20997. Section 20997 of the Government Code is amended to require employers to contribute to members absent due to military service, based on their compensation earnable and contribution rates. If a member returns to state service within six months after military discharge, the employer must make contributions. The member can return to state service within six months after completing rehabilitation, granted a leave of absence, placed on a reemployment list, retire or die during military service absence. Any member on leave from state service for military service who elects to continue contributing to the system is entitled to a refund of contributions upon request. Members who withdrew contributions during military service are entitled to benefits regardless of redepositing contributions, with future contribution rates based on age at the start of the military leave. The employer's contributions can be made in a lump sum or included in monthly contributions. These contributions are used for retirement and death benefits and not refunded to the member. The employer must inform the member of their rights within 30 days of returning to state service. The board provides a unique form for members to receive credit for military service without obligation to pay for employer contributions. Public service for local members includes active service with the Armed Forces or Merchant Marine, including rehabilitation periods. Any eligible member may request costing of service credit between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003, and make a payment calculated under the previous article instead of contributions. The public service credit does not include military service if credit is already given or if it would exceed four years. Members can choose which service period qualifies for public service credit. Section (e) applies to members who elect to receive credit while in state service for an employer subject to this section. Section (f) does not apply to contracting agencies or their employees until the agency elects to be subject to this section. Employers must inform new employees of their rights to purchase service credit. Section 21029 of the Government Code is amended. Section 21029 of the Government Code is amended to read: 21029. (a) \"Public service\" for state or school members, or retired former state/school employees who retired after December 31, 1981, includes prior active service of at least one year in the US Armed Forces or Merchant Marine before joining the system. Credit is limited to four years regardless of total service years. The public service credit for state or school members, or retired former state/school employees, requires at least one year of state service at the time of election or retirement. An election for public service credit under this section can only be made while the member is in state, university, or school employment. The retirement allowance of a retired former state or school employee will be increased only for payments after the election date. Members or retired former employees choosing to be subject to this section must make specified contributions. The board is not required to notify retired former members or provide their contact information. Employers must inform new employees of their rights to purchase service credit."
