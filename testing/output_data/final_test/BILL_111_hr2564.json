    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paid Vacation Act of 2009\". It includes findings related to paid vacation. Congress finds that the average American works more hours today than in 1976, job-related stress costs businesses billions annually, and many health issues are stress-induced. Additionally, the United States lacks a minimum annual leave law, unlike 147 other countries. China and Canada provide more vacation time for their employees compared to the U.S. The Pew Research Center reports that middle-class Americans prioritize having more free time, with 68% considering it a high priority. In 2008, only half of American workers took a vacation of a week or longer. Men who don't take regular vacations have a higher risk of heart attacks and early death, while women have a greater risk of heart attack and depression. The travel industry contributes $740 billion annually to the economy, while work-related stress costs over $300 billion. Vacations boost productivity, reduce stress-related health costs, and strengthen family bonds, contributing over $300 billion annually to the economy. The entitlement to vacation is outlined in Section 3. Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to provide eligible employees with paid vacation time based on the size of their employer. Employees of companies with 100 or more employees are entitled to 1 workweek of paid vacation per year, while employees of companies with 50 or more employees will be entitled to 1 workweek after 3 years and 2 workweeks after their first anniversary of employment. An eligible employee must give the employer 30 days' notice before taking paid vacation, starting on their first anniversary of employment. An eligible employee is someone who has worked for the employer for at least 12 months and 1,250 hours in a 12-month period. Paid vacation is separate from sick leave and other required leaves. Paid vacation must be taken in a continuous series of 7 calendar days within a 12-month period, and exemptions provided in section 13 do not apply to this rule. The Department of Labor is authorized to conduct a public awareness campaign to inform the public about leave entitlements under the Act. Additionally, a study on workplace productivity and the effects of the leave requirement will be conducted, with a report to be submitted to Congress within 3 years."
