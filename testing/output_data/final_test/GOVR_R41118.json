Stolen goods are resold through fencing operations like flea markets and online marketplaces. ORC is different from shoplifting as boosters steal for resale rather than personal use. Organized retail crime (ORC) involves professional thieves known as boosters who steal merchandise for resale. This poses economic, public health, and domestic security risks in the United States. Retailers, manufacturers, consumers, taxpayers, and states are all affected. A survey found that 96% of retailers were victimized by ORC in 2012, with estimated annual losses ranging from $15 billion to $37 billion. The economic impact of Organized Retail Crime (ORC) extends beyond retailers to taxpayers and states. Consumers pay higher prices for goods, states lose tax revenue, and there are safety risks from stolen products being resold. Concerns also exist about ORC proceeds funding terrorist activities. The theft and resale of infant formula have been linked to terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. State laws may not be sufficient to combat Organized Retail Crime (ORC), leading to debate over the federal government's role in deterring and sanctioning criminals. Congress is considering criminalizing ORC in the U.S. Code for more effective prosecution and regulating resale marketplaces to increase information. The report provides an overview of organized retail crime rings, their operations, and goods targeted. It examines the domestic impact of ORC on the economy, public health, safety, and domestic security. Current efforts by retailers, resale markets, and the federal government to combat ORC are outlined. Policy issues for Congress to consider include the adequacy of federal resources for investigations, criminalizing ORC in the U.S. Code, and regulating resale marketplaces used as fences for stolen goods. The concept of organized retail crime involves criminal networks engaging in large-scale theft and fraudulently obtaining goods for resale. There is a lack of consensus on the specific activities that constitute ORC, with some including activities like cargo theft while others do not specify. The concept of organized retail crime (ORC) involves criminal networks engaging in large-scale theft and fraudulently obtaining goods for resale. Federal law enforcement agencies and retail organizations have varying definitions of ORC, complicating analysts' abilities to evaluate its exact impact. Currently, ORC is not a federal crime, and the debate over whether it should be included in the federal criminal code is ongoing. Organized retail crime (ORC) involves criminal networks engaging in large-scale theft and fraudulently obtaining goods for resale. Congress defines ORC as violating a state ban against shoplifting or retail merchandise theft, stealing for reselling, receiving, possessing, concealing, or disposing of stolen property, and coordinating criminal activities. ORC rings consist of boosters who steal merchandise and fences who resell stolen goods. Boosters steal merchandise and sell it to fences for a percentage of the value. Fences then resell the stolen goods to consumers and businesses. Boosters often work in groups and use shopping lists provided by fences to target specific items. They may transport stolen merchandise across state lines to deliver to fences. Fencing operations can vary in complexity. Fences play a key role in the illegal sale of stolen merchandise, operating at different levels of sophistication. Street fences sell goods directly to the public or to mid-level fences who run \"cleaning operations\" to remove security tags and repackage stolen goods. These cleaned goods may be sold to the public or higher-level fences who supply merchandise to retailers, mixing stolen goods with legitimate ones. The illegal activities of fences raise concerns for public health and safety, as well as for policy makers and federal law. Fences play a crucial role in the illegal sale of stolen goods, operating at various levels of sophistication. They may purchase stolen goods from boosters in one state and sell them to illegitimate wholesalers in another state. Fences selling goods online may ship stolen goods across state or national lines. Organized retail crime rings target a wide variety of goods, with CRAVED items being more frequently stolen due to their ease of removal and conversion into cash. Desirable stolen products include cigarettes, alcohol, new movies, video games, ephedrine-based cold medications, lithium batteries, razor blades, printer cartridges, designer clothing, grocery items, over-the-counter medicines, health and beauty items, and clothing. Boosters steal a variety of items including electronics, clothing, and home goods. They often work in groups with lookouts to distract employees and avoid detection systems. Boosters use tactics like cutting off electronic tags or concealing merchandise in foil-lined bags to steal goods. Boosters use various tactics to steal merchandise, including filling shopping bags in stores and conducting smash-and-grab burglaries. They may also hide in stores after hours or conspire with employees to steal goods. Employee theft is a significant contributor to retail losses, with estimates suggesting about 45% of losses are due to employee theft. Some employees collude with individuals outside the store, and a portion of these cases may involve organized retail crime groups. Organized retail crime involves various tactics to defraud retailers, such as receipt fraud and gift card fraud. Thieves create counterfeit receipts for stolen goods or reprogram gift cards to resell for profit. Ticket-switching scams are also used to fraudulently obtain merchandise. Thieves use fake barcodes to switch prices on items, allowing them to pay less and resell goods for profit. Cargo theft may also be considered part of organized retail crime, highlighting vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Cargo theft, part of organized retail crime, involves criminals stealing goods from cargo trucks or retail stores to fence for profit. This impacts the economy, public health, and domestic security. Thieves use various methods like hijacking trucks or compromising security locks to steal desirable products. Researchers are studying how cargo theft affects retailers. Cargo theft, a part of organized retail crime (ORC), impacts retailers significantly. According to the National Retail Federation's 2012 survey, over half of respondents reported being victims of cargo theft within the past year. Most thefts occur en route from the distribution center to the store. Fences use various methods to sell stolen goods, including illegitimate wholesale operations and operating legitimate businesses as fronts for their illegal activities. Fences sell stolen goods at resale marketplaces like flea markets, where illegitimate wholesalers operate. Flea markets also serve as recruitment grounds for fences and boosters. With the rise of online transactions, organized retail thieves have turned to e-fencing on the Internet. 73.4% of retailers have identified stolen merchandise being fenced online. E-fencing has revolutionized organized retail crime by providing criminals with anonymity, global reach, and increased profitability. Unlike traditional physical fencing locations like flea markets, e-fencing allows for anonymous transactions and distribution of stolen goods across the United States and globally. Criminals can make more profit, about 70 cents on the dollar, through e-fencing compared to 30 cents on the dollar at physical locations. The impact of organized retail crime extends beyond monetary losses to retailers, affecting consumers, taxes, and safety. There are concerns about stolen goods funding terrorist activities. The exact loss to the retail industry is unknown. The impact of organized retail crime on the retail industry is significant, with estimated annual losses ranging from $30 billion to $37 billion as of 2007. It is unclear what these estimates include, such as only the retail value of stolen merchandise or additional costs like replacement and loss prevention measures. There is also uncertainty about whether these losses overlap with estimates of losses from cargo theft, which the FBI estimates to cost $15 billion to $30 billion annually in the United States. Cargo theft costs $15 billion to $30 billion annually in the United States, with estimates suggesting about half of these losses attributed to organized retail crime (ORC) groups. The FBI's estimate of cargo theft losses may be influenced by the proportion of thefts by ORC groups or differing criteria for counting incidents as losses. The National Retail Security Survey (NRSS) collects data on inventory shrinkage caused by shoplifting. The National Retail Security Survey (NRSS) collects data on inventory shrinkage in the retail sector, including causes such as shoplifting, theft, and errors. Total sales for 2010 were estimated at over $2.374 trillion, with shrinkage costs amounting to about $35.3 billion. The NRSS surveys only sectors able to provide shrinkage data, making conclusions generalizable to about 54% of total retail sales. In 2010, retail shrinkage amounted to $35.3 billion, with theft accounting for $26.8 billion. Internal/employee theft cost retailers $15.9 billion, while shoplifting led to $10.9 billion in losses. Retailers may take measures like hiring more loss prevention personnel to combat organized retail crime groups and recoup lost profits. Organized retail crime leads to increased costs for retailers, which are then passed on to consumers. This can result in decreased sales and revenue for retailers. Measures such as hiring more loss prevention personnel and locking up products are taken to prevent theft. Additionally, stolen goods lead to a loss in state tax revenue as sales tax is not collected on stolen merchandise. The Institute estimated that in 2007, organized retail crime caused a loss of $1.6 billion in sales tax revenue in the United States. Goods targeted by these groups include consumable items like infant formula, diabetic test strips, and medications. The theft and resale of these products pose public health and safety risks, as they may be repackaged, relabeled incorrectly, and stored in uncontrolled environments before being sold back to retailers or the public. Organized retail crime poses risks to public health and safety by tampering with or selling expired perishable goods. There are concerns that proceeds from ORC may finance terrorist activities, with federal law enforcement tracing illicit proceeds to groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Operation Green Quest was established to combat this link between ORC and terrorism. Operation Green Quest was a task force aimed at combating terrorist financing, including the theft and resale of infant formula. While profits from organized retail crime rings have been linked to countries supporting terrorism, no members have been convicted of providing direct support. Investigations have shown that ORC ringleaders have transferred profits to these countries, but it is unclear if the funds reached terrorist organizations. The ORC ringleaders transferred profits from their fencing operations to countries supporting terrorists. Investigations uncovered money-laundering operations funneling proceeds to countries where crime ring members had ties. Ringleaders like Samih Fadl Jamal and Mohammed Khalil Ghali were involved in selling stolen infant formula and laundering proceeds to countries like Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Palestine. Some profits were wired to financial institutions, while others were smuggled out of the US on international flights. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) revealed ties between the Ghali organization and terrorist acts. The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force found the Hamed Organization involved in criminal activities like selling stolen goods and transferring proceeds to the Palestinian territories. Reports also mentioned Hamas receiving support from NGOs in the United States. Some NGOs in the United States, possibly funded by criminal activities like selling stolen goods, supported organizations like the Holy Land Foundation of Relief and Development (HLF), which was shut down in 2001 for funding Hamas. Policy makers are exploring the link between organized retail crime and terrorism, noting that both are driven by financial gain rather than ideology. Terrorist organizations and organized criminals both require money, leading to concerns that organized crime groups may partner with terrorists for financial gain. Retailers are increasingly aware of organized retail crime, with a growing number reporting victimization. The National Retail Federation's 2012 survey showed a rise in retailers affected by organized crime, highlighting the financial motivations behind these activities. In 2012, 66.1% of retailers reported an increase in organized retail crime (ORC) activity. Nearly half of retailers in 2011 allocated more resources to combat ORC. It is unclear if reported victimization and ORC activity reflect actual levels. Only 23% of loss prevention departments had special ORC task forces in 2009. The proportion of annual sales spent on loss prevention has decreased, with retailers spending an average of 0.46% in 2010. In 2010, retailers spent an average of 0.46% of annual sales on loss prevention strategies, including pre-employment integrity screening, employee awareness programs, and various security systems like burglar alarms and CCTV. Some retailers also partner with law enforcement for information sharing. Retailers and retail organizations partner with law enforcement to share information about organized retail crime. Almost 58% of ORC investigations in 2009 involved coordination with law enforcement, leading to prosecution in nearly 49% of cases. Internet marketplaces like eBay and Overstock are now focusing on combating ORC by educating sellers and consumers, monitoring suspicious activity, and collaborating with retailers and law enforcement. Internet auction sites like eBay combat the sale of stolen goods by creating filters, collaborating with retailers and law enforcement, and removing prohibited items. eBay claims to be a leader in working with law enforcement to prevent the online sale of stolen goods. eBay is a leader in combating the online sale of stolen goods by creating programs like PROACT with retailers and law enforcement. They received 2,340 requests for information through the PROACT program between 2008 and 2011. eBay also partnered with the NRF in 2010 to fight organized retail crime using technologies like LERPnet. To combat organized retail crime (ORC), collaboration with the FBI is essential to identify crime enterprises and promote legislation for law enforcement tools. Federal involvement has increased as ORC has become more transnational, utilizing interstate routes and the Internet for selling stolen goods. Multilateral coordination, both domestically and internationally, is crucial for effective law enforcement against ORC. Federal law enforcement, including the FBI, has partnered with the retail industry and online markets to combat organized retail crime (ORC). The FBI established an Organized Retail Theft (ORT) Initiative in December 2003 to dismantle multi-jurisdictional crime rings by sharing information between law enforcement and the private sector. This collaboration aims to investigate and understand the extent of ORC nationwide. The FBI's Organized Retail Theft (ORT) Initiative collaborates with federal statutes like RICO to investigate and prosecute ORC rings. Seven Major Theft Task Forces led by the FBI investigate major theft areas, including ORC, with a partnership between law enforcement agencies and retail industry experts. LERPnet, established under the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, facilitates information sharing between retailers and law enforcement. The FBI, ICE, local police departments, retailers, and retail organizations like FMI, NRF, and RILA collaborate in the LERPnet system, linked with the FBI's LEO system for crime reports. Despite efforts like the ORT Initiative and Major Theft Task Forces, the FBI's focus remains on counterterrorism due to limited resources for combating retail crime. Requested funding for ORC investigations has not been realized yet. ICE has become increasingly involved in investigating Organized Retail Crime (ORC), especially if reports of ORC rings using unauthorized aliens as boosters are true. In July 2009, ICE launched an ORC Pilot Program in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York to develop an ORC threat assessment and tracking system. The USSS, originally focused on investigating counterfeiting, expanded its efforts to combat Organized Retail Crime (ORC) through the SEARCH Initiative. By November 2011, SEARCH had initiated 129 cases, resulting in 84 arrests, 56 indictments, and 23 convictions, seizing $8.2 million in assets. The USSS is renowned for protecting high-profile individuals but has also made significant strides in tackling ORC. The USSS investigates a range of crimes including counterfeiting, financial fraud, identity theft, and organized retail crime. They receive case referrals from various sources and have task forces dedicated to investigating financial crimes, including ORC. The USSS investigates various crimes, including ORC, with task forces comprising investigators from retail stores, online auction houses, and finance industries. The USPIS works to prevent mail fraud and illegal substances. ORC investigations involve individuals using the mail for shipping stolen products or payments. ORC schemes include Internet auction fraud and re-shipper fraud, where criminals sell stolen goods domestically and internationally or recruit accomplices to receive and ship stolen goods. The federal government debates its role in combating organized retail crime, considering issues such as retailers' preventive measures, criminalizing ORC at the federal level for better investigation and prosecution, and regulating online marketplaces to improve investigations and decrease theft. The NRSS reports trends in retail industry loss prevention measures since 1991, showing that retailers spent 0.46% of annual sales on security measures in 2010. This included about 33 loss prevention employees for every $100 million in sales, a decrease from previous years. The trend in spending on loss prevention measures decreased through 2008 before rising to 0.46% in 2010. The trend in loss prevention spending decreased through 2008 before rising to 0.46% in 2010. Retailers are facing an increase in ORC activity, with more than 66% reporting an increase in 2012. It is challenging to determine if retailers are allocating budgets based on overall shrinkage or specific threats like ORC. Retailers aim to balance protecting merchandise from theft while providing a welcoming shopping environment for honest consumers. Retailers face a dilemma in preventing retail theft - locking up products may deter customers, while keeping them out in the open may attract thieves. There is a lack of research on effective loss prevention strategies for combating organized retail crime (ORC). Policy makers may consider options to enhance retailers' abilities to combat ORC, such as commissioning a national study. Congress could potentially commission a national study to examine loss prevention strategies for combating organized retail crime (ORC). Another option is to establish a grant program for retailers to upgrade security systems and implement loss prevention measures, with requirements such as working with law enforcement and joining LERPnet. Currently, state law enforcement primarily handles retail theft under state criminal laws, particularly major theft laws used to investigate and prosecute ORC. States have varying major theft laws to investigate and prosecute organized retail crime (ORC), with thresholds ranging from low to high. Some states criminalize ORC with felony theft thresholds exceeding $1,000. While there is no federal law specifically prohibiting ORC, federal law enforcement uses provisions in the U.S. Code, such as money laundering and engaging in monetary transactions from unlawful activity, to prosecute ORC rings. The federal law addresses theft by prohibiting the transportation, sale, or receipt of stolen goods with a value exceeding $5,000. Congress may consider amending current laws to create new provisions for penalties against organized retail crime (ORC). Proponents argue that criminalizing organized retail crime (ORC) could help law enforcement by highlighting the issue and providing a framework for tracking ORC cases. Opponents believe existing laws are sufficient for investigating and prosecuting ORC, with the main challenge being a lack of resources. Congressional testimony from federal law enforcement agencies supports the view that current laws and tools are adequate for addressing ORC. Congress may consider enacting provisions to lower the monetary threshold for prosecuting the sale, receipt, or transportation of stolen goods across state lines. Savvy criminals steal just under the felony theft level in each state to avoid charges. Federal investigators rely on the total value of stolen goods moved across state lines to prosecute thieves. The average value of goods stolen by ORC rings is unknown. Decreasing the current $5,000 threshold may be supported if the value of goods is below this limit. Congress may face challenges in amending the threshold. One policy consideration for Congress is whether to provide dedicated funding to law enforcement to combat organized retail crime (ORC). Law enforcement may need additional resources to investigate and prosecute ORC cases, as they currently prioritize other areas like counterterrorism and fraud. Another option is to allocate directed resources to federal law enforcement for ORC investigations, as criminals use physical and online marketplaces to sell stolen goods in a globalized society. One policy option for Congress to consider in combating organized retail crime is increased regulation of certain actions on the Internet, such as online auction websites. This could involve requiring these websites to document, retain, and disclose information about specified sellers, including those suspected of selling stolen goods. Enforcement\u2014information about specified sellers suspected of fencing stolen goods. Proponents argue it could help law enforcement track suspected fences and deter potential thieves. Opponents say online marketplaces already share such information to prevent sale of stolen goods. Another option is regulating physical marketplaces like flea markets. Some argue for state regulation due to local transactions, while others suggest federal oversight for goods sold at flea markets. The federal government could regulate goods sold at flea markets, potentially focusing on products already regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
