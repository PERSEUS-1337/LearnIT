The \"Nurse And Patient Safety & Protection Act of 2006\" highlights the high rate of musculoskeletal disorders among direct-care registered nurses, particularly back injuries caused by patient lifting. These injuries lead to chronic back pain and force many nurses to leave the profession. The development of assistive patient handling equipment has reduced manual patient lifting in nursing care, improving safety for both patients and healthcare providers. This technology aligns with ergonomic principles, allowing healthcare facilities to incorporate patient handling technology for better patient care. Implementing patient handling technology has led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff, resulting in fewer lost work days and lower staff turnover. Cost-benefit analyses show that this technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Establishing a safe patient handling standard for healthcare providers is crucial for increasing patient safety and addressing the nursing shortage. The Federal Safe Patient Handling Standard is crucial for increasing patient safety and addressing the nursing shortage. The Secretary of Labor will establish a Federal Safe Patient Handling Standard within 1 year to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare providers. The standard mandates the use of mechanical devices for patient lifting, except during emergencies, and requires health care facilities to have a musculoskeletal injury prevention plan. The Federal Safe Patient Handling Standard requires the use of mechanical devices for patient lifting, input from direct-care registered nurses, a program to identify and solve problems, a system to track injuries and make data public, staff training on safe handling policies and equipment, and annual evaluations of safe handling efforts and new technology. The process for implementing the Federal Safe Patient Handling Standard includes using mechanical devices for patient lifting, input from nurses, problem-solving programs, injury tracking, staff training, and annual evaluations of safe handling efforts and new technology. Documentation should include equipment selection and evaluation. The requirement for health care facilities is outlined in Section 3. Health care facilities must develop and implement a safe patient handling plan within 6 months of the standard publication. The plan must ensure patient safety, prevent musculoskeletal disorders, involve input from direct-care registered nurses, and restrict the use of safe lifting devices to qualified healthcare providers. Health care facilities are required to post a notice explaining the Federal Safe Patient Handling Standard, including policies, training, and reporting procedures for patient handling-related injuries. The Secretary will conduct unscheduled audits to ensure compliance with the standard. The Safety and Health Administration will conduct unscheduled audits to ensure the implementation of safe patient handling plans and compliance with reporting and reviewing findings for continual improvements. SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF DIRECT-CARE REGISTERED NURSES AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS. Direct-care registered nurses and other healthcare providers have the right to refuse assignments that violate standards or compromise patient safety. Healthcare facilities are prohibited from retaliating against nurses who refuse assignments, including through discharge, discrimination, or retaliation. Direct-care registered nurses and other healthcare providers have the right to refuse work assignments that violate standards or compromise patient safety. Healthcare facilities are prohibited from filing complaints or reports against nurses who refuse assignments. Complaints can be filed with the Secretary against facilities that violate this Act. The Act protects direct-care registered nurses and healthcare providers from retaliation for reporting violations. Healthcare facilities cannot discriminate or retaliate against individuals who report violations to the Secretary or regulatory agencies. The Act protects individuals who report violations to the Secretary, regulatory agencies, or accreditation bodies from retaliation. Acting in good faith is defined as reasonably believing the reported information is true. The Act allows direct-care registered nurses or healthcare providers who have been discharged, discriminated against, or retaliated against to bring a cause of action in a United States district court. They may be entitled to reinstatement, reimbursement of lost wages, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other damages. A health care facility must inform direct-care registered nurses and other individuals of their rights to file a complaint with the Secretary if the facility violates the standards issued under the Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as direct-care registered nurse, health care provider, employment, and health care facility. The term \"facility\" refers to various healthcare facilities that employ direct-care registered nurses. A \"declared state of emergency\" is an officially designated emergency declared by the Federal Government or appropriate state/local agency, excluding emergencies due to labor disputes or under-staffing in the healthcare industry. SEC. 6. Financial assistance for needy healthcare facilities to purchase safe patient handling equipment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a grant program to provide financial assistance for healthcare facilities to purchase safe patient handling equipment if they demonstrate financial need and compliance with established standards. Facilities must apply to the Secretary to show true financial need for eligibility. The grant program requires healthcare facilities to demonstrate financial need for eligibility. $50,000,000 is authorized for financial assistance under this program."
