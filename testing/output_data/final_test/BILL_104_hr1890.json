    "content": "The \"California Ocean Protection Act of 1995\" aims to protect the unique historical, ecological, recreational, and economic values of the California coast from threats such as fossil fuel exploration, mineral extraction, and toxic waste dumping. Establishing an ocean protection zone off the coast would enhance fisheries and promote the use of renewable resources. The California Ocean Protection Act of 1995 establishes a California Ocean Protection Zone, including waters of the Exclusive Economic Zone off the coast of California and the outer Continental Shelf. This aims to protect the California coast from threats like fossil fuel exploration and promote renewable resources. The California Ocean Protection Act of 1995 establishes a California Ocean Protection Zone to protect the coast from threats like fossil fuel exploration. Federal agencies are prohibited from issuing leases, permits, or licenses for mineral exploration, development, or production in the Zone. Individuals are also restricted from engaging in these activities after the cancellation or expiration of existing permits. The Act prohibits mineral exploration, development, or production in the California Ocean Protection Zone. Regulations determine the status of operations and leases, permits, or licenses. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits ocean incineration and harmful ocean dumping within the Zone, as of January 1, 1986. No lease, permit, or license can be issued for these activities or for onshore facilities facilitating them within the Zone. The Act does not regulate fishing in the Zone. The Act defines key terms such as Administrator, Development, Exclusive Economic Zone, Exploration, and Harmful ocean dumping. The Administrator determines disposal of vessel waste, dredged material, and authorized discharges under specific criteria and permits. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, including terms like \"lease,\" \"minerals,\" and \"Outer Continental Shelf.\" These definitions are important for understanding regulations and activities related to the Act. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"person,\" \"production,\" \"territorial sea,\" and \"Zone\" in relation to the Continental Shelf Lands Act and the California Ocean Protection Zone."
