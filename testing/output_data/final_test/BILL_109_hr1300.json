    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Civic Participation and Rehabilitation Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that the right to vote is fundamental to citizenship and reintegration into society. It must not be denied based on race, color, gender, or past servitude. Congress has the authority to oversee Federal elections and discrepancies in State laws regarding felony convictions create unfairness in voting. The Congress must ensure that State laws regarding voting rights after felony convictions are in line with the Constitution to prevent disparities in Federal elections. Approximately 4,700,000 Americans, or one in 44 adults, are affected by these unequal laws. Approximately 4,700,000 Americans, or one in 44 adults, currently cannot vote due to felony convictions. Disenfranchisement is a result of varying State laws that restrict voting during criminal justice supervision or after completing a felony sentence. Maine and Vermont do not disenfranchise felons, while other States have laws depriving offenders of voting rights during prison, parole, and probation, with some even disenfranchising ex-offenders who have completed their sentences. Approximately 1,700,000 out of 4,700,000 disqualified voters are not in prison but are on probation, parole, or are ex-offenders. In some States, regaining the right to vote for ex-offenders is difficult, requiring a pardon or order from the Governor or a parole board. Federal offenders face additional barriers to restoring their voting rights, with the only method provided by Federal law being a Presidential pardon. Approximately 1,400,000 African American men and Hispanic citizens are disenfranchised, with three in ten black men expected to lose their voting rights at some point. Congress should address these disparities to ensure equal voting opportunities. This Act aims to restore fairness in Federal elections and promote the reintegration of former offenders. The Act aims to promote reintegration of former offenders into society as law-abiding citizens during the election process. SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS. The right to vote for a US citizen shall not be denied due to a criminal offense, except for those serving a felony sentence. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can take legal action to address violations of the Act, while individuals affected by violations can notify the state election official and seek relief through a civil action if the violation is not corrected within a specified timeframe. If the violation occurs close to a federal election, notice to the election official may not be required. Individuals affected by violations of the Act can notify the state election official before taking civil action to obtain relief. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The term \"correctional institution or facility\" refers to prisons, jails, or similar facilities for convicted individuals, excluding residential community treatment centers. The term \"election\" includes various types of elections and political party events for candidate nominations. The term \"Federal office\" refers to the office of President, Vice President, Senator, Representative, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner in the United States Congress. SEC. 6. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. This Act does not prevent states from enacting less restrictive voting laws for federal elections. The rights and remedies provided by this Act do not override the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act. SEC. 7. FEDERAL PRISON FUNDS. No State, local government, or person can use Federal grants to build or improve prisons without a program to notify incarcerated U.S. citizens of their rights upon release."
