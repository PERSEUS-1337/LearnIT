    "content": "Momentary fluctuations in attention correlate with neural activity fluctuations in primate visual areas. Investigating this link in the human brain using a real-time cognitive brain machine interface (cBMI) based on SSVEPs, researchers found that stimuli triggered during high SSVEP power epochs led to increased discrimination accuracy at the cued location. This suggests a direct link between attention's effects on perceptual accuracy and neural gain in EEG-SSVEP power in the human brain. The study compared acquisition software for EEG data, finding Fieldtrip had the least overhead. Scalp EEG recordings were done with occipital electrodes, streamed at 128 Hz, and stored at 4096 Hz for analysis. Spectral analysis was performed using Chronux and EEGLAB functions, with data re-referenced to average. The EEG data was re-referenced to the average reference, showing higher activity for AI-high trials compared to AI-low trials (p < 0.01)."
