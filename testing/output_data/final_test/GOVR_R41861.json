    "content": "President Obama signed H.R. 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2012, providing the Department of Defense with $646.3 billion in new discretionary budget authority, $25.3 billion less than requested. $22.5 billion was taken from DOD's base budget to meet caps on non-emergency discretionary spending in FY2012 set by the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control Act (BCA) defined a category including DOD base budget, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, National Nuclear Security Agency, State Department, and international activities. The BCA did not specify the amount of budget reduction from security agencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted spending ceilings, requiring cuts from defense and military construction programs in FY2012. The Senate Appropriations Committee set spending ceilings for FY2012, treating it as the de facto spending limit for DOD funding. The Administration requested $689.0 billion for national defense programs, including DOD military activities and defense-related nuclear activities. The House passed a version of the FY2012 authorization bill adding $1.1 billion to the request, while the Senate Armed Services Committee's version cut $6.4 billion. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a new defense authorization bill (S. 1867) cutting $25.4 billion from the Administration's request. The Senate debated and amended S. 1867 before passing the amended H.R. 1540, authorizing FY2012 appropriations for DOD totaling $645.4 billion, $25.4 billion less than the President's request. $530.0 million is for DOD's \"base budget,\" $23.1 billion less than the President's request, and $115.5 billion for \"overseas contingency operations (OCO).\" The defense authorization bill authorized $115.5 billion for overseas contingency operations (OCO) and $16.9 billion for defense-related nuclear activities. The bill was approved by the House and Senate in December 2011, and signed by the President on December 23, 2011. One issue addressed in the bill was the treatment of detainees held in military custody, including those at Guantanamo Bay. The House passed a defense bill on May 26, 2011 (H.R. 1540) with provisions on detainee treatment. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid delayed Senate debate on S. 1253 due to objections. The Senate Armed Services Committee's revised bill (S. 1867) addressed some objections, but the Administration opposed the detainee provisions in a statement on November 17, 2011. The House passed a defense bill with provisions on detainee treatment, including reaffirming the authority of the Armed Forces to detain certain individuals. The bill also prohibits the use of DOD funds to bring Guantanamo detainees to the United States and places conditions on transferring or releasing detainees to foreign countries. On June 14, 2012, the House passed a defense appropriations act that would have reduced the President's requested base budget by $8.9 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted spending reductions to the FY2012 defense budget, cutting $25.9 billion from the President's request. A House-Senate compromise on DOD funding, largely following the Senate's bill, was enacted as Division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Senate committee-reported bill, enacted as Division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2012 (H.R. 2055), was signed into law by the President on December 23, 2011 (P.L. 112-74). President Obama's FY2012 budget request for the Department of Defense (DOD) was reduced by nearly 5.3% compared to FY2011, mainly due to cuts in funding for combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2012 budget request for the Department of Defense includes a planned drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and assumes all troops will be out of Iraq by the end of the first quarter. The request includes $553.7 billion for DOD's base budget, a 3% real increase in purchasing power compared to FY2011. Additionally, the request for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) is $117.8 billion, a 27% inflation-adjusted decrease. The FY2012 base budget request for the Department of Defense includes $528.7 billion for Defense programs, $14.8 billion for military construction and family housing, and $10.7 billion for Tricare-for-Life program. Military construction funding has decreased for the third year due to BRAC-related construction reductions. The FY2012 budget for the Department of Defense includes reduced funding for military construction and family housing, with a significant decrease in BRAC-related construction projects. The budget for construction projects in Iraq and Afghanistan has also been significantly reduced. The FY2012 proposal includes fewer cuts to major weapons programs compared to previous requests, but cancels the Marine Corps's Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle development and restructures the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2012 budget for the Department of Defense includes reduced funding for military construction and family housing, with a significant decrease in BRAC-related construction projects. The budget proposed to continue longer than planned the purchase of F/A-18E/F carrier-based jets to replace aging Navy fighters. It also funded efforts to develop new long-range bombers, missile-launching submarines, and mid-air refueling tankers, emphasizing equipment acquisition for current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2012 budget request for the Department of Defense includes funding for various types of helicopters and unmanned aerial systems (UASs) to prepare for potential peer competitors like China or Russia. The budget also includes efficiency savings of $178 billion over FY2012-FY2016, with $100 billion in savings to be identified by the armed services and Special Operations Command. $28 billion will cover operating costs, while $72 billion will be reinvested in high priority weapons programs. The FY2012 budget for the Department of Defense includes funding for high priority weapons programs like the Air Force's new long-range bomber and additional F/A-18E/F fighters. DOD officials aim to reduce the budget request by $78 billion over FY2012-FY2016 through measures such as a freeze on federal civilian pay and organizational streamlining. The budget reflects an initial installment of $10.7 billion towards a projected total savings of $100.2 billion through FY2016. The FY2012 DOD budget request aims to wrap up the U.S. combat role in Iraq by the end of 2011 and begin drawing down military efforts in Afghanistan. President Obama announced a surge in Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaeda and a conditions-based withdrawal of troops. No funds are requested for training and equipping Iraqi forces in the FY2012 budget. In December 2010, President Obama announced plans to hand over lead responsibility for Afghanistan's security to the Afghan government by 2012. The DOD budget for training and equipping Afghan Security forces increased to $12.8 billion in FY2012. Congress approved $11.6 billion in FY2011 for this purpose. The FY2012 DOD budget request was evaluated in the context of reducing the federal budget deficit. The FY2012 defense budget proposal faced calls for substantial cuts in defense spending, with recommendations for up to $100 billion reduction annually by the middle of the decade. This was in contrast to the FY2011 DOD budget request. In November 2010, the Domenici-Rivlin Debt Reduction Task Force recommended a cut in defense spending by the middle of the decade. President's long-term budget proposal included an additional $400 billion cut in security-related programs over 12 years. The Defense Department is adjusting plans to absorb some of the cuts, with opposition from some defense advocates. McKeon criticized the proposal to cut $400 billion from security-related budgets, stating it lacked consideration for threats, deterrence, logistics, and national security impact. The House incorporated defense projections in its FY2012 budget resolution, setting a funding target requiring a $8.9 billion cut from the President's FY2012 request for DOD base budget. Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged the inevitability of future defense budget cuts in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute. Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged the need for future defense budget cuts as part of deficit reduction efforts. He stated that the proposed reductions are not as drastic as past cuts, amounting to about a 5% reduction in constant dollars. However, tough decisions will be required regarding military personnel's pay, pensions, medical care, and the readiness of U.S. forces for various missions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set new caps on discretionary spending, potentially leading to reductions in Defense appropriations. This could impact the security of the country and military operations worldwide. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set new caps on discretionary spending, potentially leading to reductions in Defense appropriations. The DOD base budget accounts for 76.9% of the discretionary budget request for security agencies' funding, with a reduction of $23.7 billion from the request in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2012. The House passed the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act, authorizing $690.1 billion for defense programs. This includes $553.0 billion for DOD's base budget and $118.9 billion for OCO. The bill made minor changes to President Obama's funding request, trimming $1.7 million from the base budget and adding $1.1 billion for war costs. The House committee added $1.1 billion for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund to the DOD budget for war costs. The Senate Armed Services Committee initially authorized $6.4 billion less than requested for FY2012, with $5.9 billion cut from the base budget. A second version of the bill proposed cutting $27.3 billion from the President's request, authorizing $28.4 billion less than the House-passed bill. The Senate substituted the House-passed text of H.R. 1540 with a bill, passing it on December 1, 2011, by a vote of 93-7. The conference report on H.R. 1540, cutting the Administration's authorization request by $26.6 billion, was adopted by the House on December 14, 2011, by a vote of 283-136. The compromise bill includes a $23.1 billion cut from the Administration's base budget, with $6.9 billion shifted to cover costs associated with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The conference report authorizes $2.3 billion less than requested for war costs. The conferees cut $4.0 billion from the war cost request due to a faster reduction in U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The House bill's total authorization was the result of various additions and subtractions to the President's request, including $1.31 billion for facility maintenance and $375 million for M-1 production. The House bill included funding for maintenance, production of M-1 tanks and Bradley troop carriers, anti-missile defense systems, and equipment for the National Guard. Proposed cuts targeted specific weapons programs, including a significant reduction in funding for an Army airborne electronic eavesdropping system. The House committee proposed budget cuts for various defense programs, including reducing funding for electronic eavesdropping gear on a commercial plane, the Army's Early Infantry Brigade Combat Team, and the MEADS anti-missile system. The cuts were justified by delays in the programs and unobligated balances in DOD budget accounts. The House committee proposed budget cuts for defense programs, including reductions in funding for various accounts. The Senate Armed Services Committee made net reductions of $6.43 billion in the FY2012 NDAA. The Senate Armed Services Committee made significant budget cuts in the FY2012 NDAA, including reducing funding for Pentagon operations and U.S. operations in Afghanistan by $5 billion. The committee justified these cuts by citing program delays, excessive overhead costs, and lackluster performance. The Senate Armed Services Committee cut $5 billion from the $117.8 billion request for war costs in FY2012 NDAA due to plans to reduce U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. Additionally, $1.6 billion was cut from the $12.8 billion requested for training the Afghan Army and National Police. Other reductions in S. 1867 included $1.1 billion from operation and maintenance accounts, $684 million to address excessive unobligated balances, and $350 million for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization. The Senate Armed Services Committee cut $752 million from the $2.80 billion requested for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) due to concerns about duplicative efforts and reliance on contractor personnel. This included funding for aircraft such as nine F/A18E/F Navy fighters, one E-2D Hawkeye radar surveillance plane, two HH-60M Blackhawk helicopters, one Apache attack helicopter, and upgrades for various helicopters used by special forces. The Senate Armed Services Committee cut $752 million from the $2.80 billion requested for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) due to concerns about duplicative efforts and reliance on contractor personnel. This included funding for aircraft such as nine F/A18E/F Navy fighters, one E-2D Hawkeye radar surveillance plane, two HH-60M Blackhawk helicopters, one Apache attack helicopter, and upgrades for various helicopters used by special forces. Additionally, $200 million was cut from the $2.98 billion requested for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) due to concerns about excessive unobligated balances and doubts about the feasibility of some projects, including skepticism towards the development of a Transformer Vehicle combining attributes of a vertical take-off aircraft and a HMMWV. Furthermore, a total of $1.18 billion was cut from four major weapons programs, including $540 million from an Army airborne surveillance system (EMARSS), $407 million from the Army's new family of combat equipment, and $135 million from other programs. The final version of the bill cut the President's request by nearly 4%, with reductions in war costs and specific programs. Major cuts related to Afghanistan included $4.0 billion for troop reduction, $1.6 billion for Afghan Army and National Police training, and $75 million for infrastructure development. Additionally, funds were reduced for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and major weapons programs. The final version of the bill reduced the President's request by nearly 4%, with cuts in war costs and specific programs. This included reductions in funding for troop reduction in Afghanistan, training for the Afghan Army and National Police, and infrastructure development. Other cuts totaling nearly $3.4 billion were made, including reductions in the Army's operation and maintenance budget, offsetting unnecessary cash balances, and trimming the Tricare medical insurance program. Additionally, cuts were made to curtail certain activities, such as logistical support for weapons systems. The conference report on H.R. 1540 made significant cuts to various defense programs, including $412.0 million for logistical support of weapons systems by contractors, $150.2 million for federally funded research and development centers, and $200.0 million for DOD's Acquisition Workforce Development Fund. Specific reductions included $595.0 million for Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected vehicles, $539.6 million for the Army's EMARSS airborne surveillance system, and $435.0 million for a new armored combat vehicle development. Compared to previous defense authorization bills, there were fewer instances of authorizing more than requested for weapons programs. The conference report on H.R. 1540 authorized additional funding for various weapons programs, including upgrades for M-1 tanks, modernization of National Guard and reserve forces, and collaboration with Israel on anti-ballistic missile systems. Compared to previous bills, there were fewer Member-sponsored funding initiatives included in the report. The committee's chairman announced that the FY2012 DOD budget request would be addressed without earmarks, as per House Republican Conference policy. Any Member-sponsored amendments to the draft bill would require a vote by the full committee in open session. The House committee approved over 200 amendments during a markup session for the FY2012 defense bill, with most amendments passed by voice votes. The add-ons to H.R. 1540 were less specific compared to previous defense bills, lacking clear identification of intended recipients for the added funds. The House committee's FY2012 defense bill contained fewer Member-sponsored add-ons compared to previous bills, but the total amount added remained similar. The bill included 98 committee additions worth less than $100 million each, totaling $1.30 billion. This new approach to funding initiatives had a significant impact on military construction projects. In FY2010 and FY2012, military construction projects were funded through earmarks and lump-sum amounts. The FY2010 bill had 110 earmarks totaling $579 million, while the FY2012 bill added 22 lump-sum amounts for general classes of facilities. These additions were listed in the text of the bill (Title XVI) with specific allocation stipulations. The committee allocated additional funds based on merit or competitive procedures, covering costs by drawing from the Mission Force Enhancement Transfer Fund. $651.7 million was used, leaving a balance of $348.3 million for unfunded requirements in areas like missile defense and basic research. The House voted to eliminate $348.5 million from the Mission Force Enhancement Transfer Fund, impacting the FY2012 defense authorization bills. The Senate made additional cuts to meet spending limits set by the Budget Control Act, with no further additions. The committee made additional cuts to the budget request, reduced some additions made in S. 1253, and added $405 million to Operations and Maintenance funds. The FY2010 defense authorization bill had 336 additions totaling $5.17 billion, while the House-passed version of H.R. 1540 authorized $142.2 billion for military personnel costs. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes $142.0 billion for military personnel costs in the base budget, a reduction of $837.0 million from the request. This reduction includes shifting $448.0 million from the base budget to the military personnel authorization for war costs. The final version of H.R. 1540 does not specifically authorize the 1.6% military pay raise requested by the Administration, but the House and Senate Armed Services Committees support it. Military personnel and federal civilian employees receive annual pay raises based on the Employment Cost Index. The cost of a 1.6% increase in military basic pay for FY2012 is estimated to be $1.2 billion. The House-passed bill included a provision for the pay raise, but it was not included in the final bill. The final bill, like the Senate-passed version, authorizes reducing the active-duty force by 9,800 to 1.42 million personnel. Concerns were raised about the planned reduction potentially impacting dwell time between deployments for military personnel. The goal is for a dwell time ratio of one-to-three, allowing rest, retraining, and family time. The House committee questioned the Administration's plan to reduce active-duty Army end-strength by 22,000 in FY2013 and further reduce the size of the active-duty Army and Marine Corps by 42,300 personnel in FY2015-FY2016. It is unclear what level of forces in Afghanistan would need to be reduced to allow for the force reduction without impacting troops and their families. The anticipated reductions do not seem to align with national strategy or future warfighting requirements. The Senate committee expressed concern about the rapid drawdown of troops while large U.S. forces are still deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. H.R. 1540 includes a provision for establishing a policy on dwell time and monitoring service members' time deployed vs. time at home. The committee urged the Department of Defense to consider the impact on service members who have not yet completed 20 years of service when making further cuts in the force. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes a provision making the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with specific responsibilities for non-Federalized National Guard forces. Congress established the position of Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau in 1994. The Director of the National Guard Bureau Joint Staff was redesignated 10 years later to reflect the bureau's reorganization. H.R. 1540 includes a provision reestablishing the position of Vice Chief with the grade of lieutenant general. The conference report dropped a provision from the Senate version regarding United States Northern Command and United States Pacific. The Senate provision in H.R. 1540 specified that United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and United States Pacific Command (PACOM) are responsible for defense support of civil authorities in the U.S. It required commanders to assist states with National Guard forces, deploy active duty forces, and develop operational relationships during domestic emergencies. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes provisions for appointing qualified officers from the Army and Air National Guard to key positions in Army North Command and Air Force North Command. Additionally, the bill grants executive branch officials more flexibility to activate reserve components, allowing for involuntary call-ups of individuals and units from the Selected Reserve and Individual Ready Reserve's mobilization category. The final bill allows for the activation of reservists from the National Guard and Reserves for up to 365 days of active duty under the authority of the service secretary. This activation is limited to no more than 60,000 members at a time and is intended for preplanned missions that were budgeted for. The new authority aims to enhance the use of reserve component units to support operational mission requirements in a predictable manner, rather than for emergent operational or humanitarian missions. The final bill allows for the activation of reservists from the National Guard and Reserves for up to 365 days of active duty under the authority of the service secretary. This activation is limited to no more than 60,000 members at a time and is intended for preplanned missions in support of a combatant command. Additionally, Section 515 of the bill allows the Secretary of Defense to involuntarily order units and individuals of the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days in response to a governor's request for federal assistance in a major disaster or emergency. The final version of H.R. 1540 allows the Administration to increase enrollment fees for TRICARE Prime, a managed care plan for servicemembers and their dependents. Fees increased by $30 per year for individuals and $60 per year for families, with future increases tied to the rate of military retired pay. The fees for TRICARE Prime can increase annually based on the National Healthcare Expenditure Index, projected to rise by 5%-6% per year. The House Armed Services Committee proposed a one-year freeze on fee hikes, but the final bill limits increases to around 2% annually, tied to military retired pay raises. The final version of H.R. 1540 included a provision allowing military chaplains to decline officiating at marriages based on conscience or moral principle. This issue arose after the repeal of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in 2010. The conference report did not include provisions from the House bill that aimed to defer the repeal of the 1993 law. The final version of H.R. 1540 included provisions related to the repeal of the 1993 law, defining marriage as between one man and one woman, and dropping a provision that would have repealed Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended amending Article 120 of the UCMJ to prohibit forcible sodomy, based on recommendations from senior military lawyers and a DOD task force to reduce sexual assault in the military. The House committee addressed the issue of military women in combat, noting feedback from deployed service women. The committee acknowledges feedback from service women deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan regarding the discomfort of male-designed body armor. They recommend evaluating the need for tailored body armor for women in combat operations and commend the Army for addressing this issue. Both House and Senate defense authorization bills aim to increase competitive procedures in DOD contracting. The conference report on H.R. 1540 included provisions to promote greater competition in DOD contracting for weapons systems and their components. This includes requiring DOD to consider competitive procedures for maintenance contracts, as outlined in the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. The House Armed Services Committee criticized DOD for relying too heavily on sole-source maintenance contracts. The House Armed Services Committee criticized DOD for relying on sole-source maintenance contracts and estimated potential savings of $2 billion annually by awarding maintenance contracts competitively. The authorization bill included provisions for the Air Force to conduct a competition for engines in a new bomber and for the Navy to oversee an electro-magnetic catapult program for aircraft carriers. The authorization bill includes oversight of the catapult program, requirements for implementing WSARA provisions in the F-35 program, and restrictions on Navy spending for the UCLASS system until DOD certifies open architecture standards. The conference report rejected the Senate's proposal to shift $142.2 million for improved communication satellites into a new budget line, aiming to enhance competition. The final version of H.R. 1540 included a provision prohibiting the government from requiring disclosure of political contributions as a condition of bidding on a government contract. The Election Campaign Act of 1971 (P.L. 92-225) included provisions for DOD contractors and disclosure of political contributions. H.R. 1540 aimed to limit total compensation for contractor employees. The final version of H.R. 1540 retains the current cap on allowable compensation costs for all contractor employees, with exceptions for scientists and engineers. The bill also includes modifications to the Nunn-McCurdy rules regarding defense contractor regulations. The Senate provision in H.R. 1540 modifies the Nunn-McCurdy rules for acquisition programs exceeding cost estimates. It exempts programs with increased unit-cost due to reducing purchased units. The final bill reversed Senate mandates to slow high-profile development programs deemed risky. Section 212 would have halted funding for a new satellite communication system for the B-2 stealth bomber. The final version of the bill (Section 216) allows the Air Force to spend no more than 60% of the amount appropriated for the new satellite communication system for the B-2 stealth bomber before submitting a detailed report to Congress on the projected cost and schedule. The bill authorizes $224.5 million of the $285.0 million requested for the communications upgrade. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes funding for two programs previously denied by the Senate bill: $30.0 million for the \"free electron\" laser and $26.9 million for the electromagnetic \"rail gun\" for Navy ship defense. It also reduces funding for the Airborne Laser Test Bed by $46.3 million, less than the Senate's proposed $60.0 million cut. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes a provision that holds prime contractors accountable for detecting counterfeit electronic parts in items acquired by the DOD. Contractors must bear the cost of any necessary rework to remove suspected counterfeit parts and establish internal processes for detecting them. Failure to comply could result in payment withholding. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs. The Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 created the SBIR program to increase small innovative companies' participation in federally funded R&D. Government agencies with budgets over $100 million must set aside funds for R&D in small firms through the SBIR program. H.R. 1540 reauthorizes the SBIR through September 30, 2017, expands the set-aside to 3.2% by FY2017, increases Phase I and Phase II awards, and allows certain agencies to award funds to small businesses majority-owned by venture capital companies. The Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 created the SBIR program to increase small innovative companies' participation in federally funded R&D. H.R. 1540 reauthorizes the SBIR through September 30, 2017, expands the set-aside to 3.2% by FY2017, increases Phase I and Phase II awards, and allows certain agencies to award funds to small businesses majority-owned by venture capital companies. STTR, established in 1992, fosters commercialization of technologies developed by non-profit research institutions through small businesses. H.R. 1540 reauthorizes STTR through 2017 and gradually increases the set-aside for the program to 0.6% of an agency's R&D funding by FY2017 and beyond. The Senate bill reauthorized two programs with increased set-asides. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees objected to DOD's plan to shut down M-1 tank assembly facilities temporarily, citing potential higher costs of reopening them. The House and Senate bills authorized additional funding to sustain Abrams tank production, with the conference report allocating $255 million to bridge the production gap. The House also included $153 million for Bradley armored troop carrier upgrades, while the Senate did not approve any increase for Bradley upgrades. The House committee approved $884 million for the development of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) but added a provision requiring a report comparing it to the upgraded Bradley troop carrier before using 30% of the funds. They want to ensure the GCV is significantly more capable before starting a major development program costing over $30 billion. The Army aims for a troop carrier that can carry three more soldiers than the Bradley. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes $449 million for the new troop carrier, with a provision barring the expenditure of more than 80% of the authorized amount until a report comparing the new vehicle with alternatives is received. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees demand assurances that the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) will be significantly more capable than upgraded versions of currently fielded platforms. The Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV), intended to replace the Marine Corps's current amphibious tractor, was cancelled due to cost and technical complexity. The high speed requirement of nearly 30 mph was a major factor in the decision. The new vehicle was designed to \"plane\" over water like a speedboat to quickly transport Marines ashore from 25 miles offshore. A cheaper substitute, the Armored Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), is being considered. The Marines are now focusing on developing a cheaper substitute for the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) called the Armored Combat Vehicle (ACV). They believe that improved seating and environmental control will allow troops to tolerate longer rides to the beach. The Navy also plans to protect ships closer to shore than 25 miles. The ACV is designed to travel at about 12 miles per hour, simplifying the design and reducing costs. Additionally, the Marines are acquiring a heavily armored, non-amphibious troop carrier called the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC). The House bill authorizes funding for upgrading current amphibious troop carriers and developing the new ACV. The House Armed Services Committee added a provision to the bill requiring the Secretary of the Navy to certify the Marines' requirements for the new Armored Combat Vehicle (ACV), including the distance offshore for an amphibious assault and the speed of the troop carrier. The provision also called for an analysis of alternative vehicles, such as an improved AAV-7, the cancelled EFV, and the proposed slower ACV. The Senate version H.R. 1540 proposed cutting $25 million from the $95.7 million requested for developing improvements to the AAV-7 and the non-amphibious MPC. The Senate Armed Services Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the Marine Corps' plan to develop both the amphibious ACV and non-amphibious MPC after the EFV cancellation. They added a provision to slow the Marines' timetable by requiring a thorough analysis of alternatives before proceeding with the new ACV and an assessment of the life-cycle cost of the Marines' planned fleet of combat vehicles. The committee insisted on substantiating assumptions underlying the less demanding speed requirement for the new amphibious vehicle. The panel recommended that the ACV could be more heavily armored than the EFV, potentially eliminating the need for non-amphibious armored troop carriers. The bill authorizes funding for the proposed ACV and upgrades for the AAV-7 and MPC. A provision allows for immediate development of improvements for the AAV-7 and refinement of the ACV specifications, while comparing it to alternative vehicles. However, further amphibious vehicle development work is prohibited until the Marine Corps completes the specified tasks. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes funds to build 12 ships, including submarines, a destroyer with Aegis system, Littoral Combat Ships, amphibious landing transport, cargo ships, an oceanographic research vessel, and a Mobile Loading Platform. Additional amphibious vehicle development is on hold until the Marine Corps submits a report on ship-to-shore logistics. The bill authorizes funding for various ships, including an aircraft carrier, a helicopter carrier, and destroyers. The Senate bill would allocate $14.9 billion for shipbuilding, including components for a Ford-class aircraft carrier. The House bill authorizes similar amounts for shipbuilding projects. The House bill authorized funding for shipbuilding projects, including a $3.3 billion helicopter carrier. It included provisions to adjust funding for the carrier and spread funding over five fiscal years for aircraft carriers. The final bill cut funding for shipbuilding programs by $150.8 million due to excessive cost increases. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes a provision for funding the Ford-class carriers over five years but not for the LHA. It also authorizes DOD to pay up to $35 million to acquire two high-speed catamaran ferries. The House Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of the Navy to report on how relying on Aegis-equipped cruisers and destroyers for anti-missile defense missions would impact other Navy missions. Some observers are concerned that demands for Aegis missile defense ships will leave the Navy with too few ships for other missions. The House-passed bill authorized funding for the Unmanned Carrier-based Aircraft System (UCAS) project and an operational unmanned bomber for deployment on carriers by 2018. The Navy might be moving too quickly with drone testing for carrier landings. The House bill included a provision to limit funds for developing FUCSS until certain certifications are met, while the Senate bill authorized funding for both UCAS and FUCSS programs but imposed restrictions on Navy spending due to delays in the latter program. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes a provision (Section 213) allowing the Navy to spend no more than 75% of the funds for the FUCSS program until DOD certifies open architecture standards. Additionally, Section 1014 requires DOD to report to Congress on Navy ship naming policies. The House and Senate versions of the defense bill authorized funding for most aircraft types except for two Air Force V-22 Ospreys and denied authorization for nine F/A-18E/F strike fighters. Navy ship naming policies have evolved over time, with exceptions made for naming ships after individuals, which have been controversial. The final version of H.R. 1540 denies authorization for certain requested aircraft funding, including one F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, two Ospreys, and an E-2C Hawkeye surveillance plane. The bill authorizes the full amount for F/A-18E/F fighters but authorizes less than requested for the Air Force's KC-46A tanker development. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes $877.1 million for the tanker program, as requested by the DOD. It also includes a provision for annual GAO review and requires a fixed-price contract for F-35 purchases in 2012 to avoid cost increases. The Senate version of the bill (Section 152) would require a fixed price contract for purchasing F-35s to prevent cost increases above the target price. The Senate Armed Services Committee added this provision after rejecting an amendment to kill the program if costs exceeded the target price by more than 10%. The final version of H.R. 1540 also included a provision for DOD to outline criteria for the short-takeoff version of the plane to end its probationary status. The House Armed Services Committee supported the development of the F-136 jet engine as an alternative to the F-135 for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. They did not add DOD funds for the second engine but included a provision to help GE and Rolls-Royce continue the program with their own funds. Another provision in the House bill would prevent DOD from spending funds to improve the power of the Joint Strike Fighter. The House Armed Services Committee supported the development of the F-136 jet engine as an alternative to the F-135 for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate version of the bill included a provision prohibiting the use of funds for the alternate engine. GE and Rolls-Royce dropped plans to continue developing the F-136 engine with their own funds. H.R. 1540 drops the Senate provision and includes modifications of the House provisions. The Senate bill includes modifications to House provisions regarding DOD equipment preservation and spending limits for the Joint Strike Fighter. It does not authorize funds for purchasing Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft for pilot training. The House Armed Services Committee criticized the Air Force for not conducting a formal life-cycle cost analysis for developing a new long-range bomber. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes procurement of six planes, reducing the budget by $43.5 million. The bill also authorizes $197.0 million for the development of a new long-range bomber. The Senate version of the bill would have allocated $204.8 million for the Prompt Global Strike missile program. The House bill cut $25.0 million from the requested $204.8 million for the Prompt Global Strike missile program, citing concerns about incorporating unproven technologies too quickly. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes $179.8 million for the PGS program. Additionally, minor changes were made to the funding for upgrading the Pentagon's cargo planes, with $1.0 billion allocated for the C-5 and $330.4 million for the C-17 modifications. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorized $179.8 million for the Prompt Global Strike missile program, with minor changes made to funding for upgrading Pentagon's cargo planes, allocating $1.0 billion for the C-5 and $330.4 million for C-17 modifications. The Senate bill cut $12.0 million from the C-5 request and $33.9 million from the C-17 request, allowing the Air Force to reduce its long-range cargo fleet to 301 aircraft. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes funding for C-130 Hercules and C-27 planes, challenging DOD plans to retire smaller cargo planes and reduce the C-130 fleet. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes provisions regarding the retirement of C-23 planes, allowing states to acquire them at no cost if retired. It also requires reports on the number of airplanes and helicopters needed for homeland defense and disaster response missions. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes provisions for the retirement of B-1B bombers, with conditions attached in both the House and Senate versions. The House version requires the Air Force to keep 36 B-1B in combat-ready units and retain additional planes for training and maintenance. The Senate version allows retirement of six planes after a plan is submitted to Congress outlining specific retirements, cost savings, investment in modernization, and fleet updates through FY2022. The final version of H.R. 1540 allows the Air Force to retire six B-1s by 2016 and includes provisions for the retirement of U-2 reconnaissance planes. It also authorizes $1.1 billion for the development of new ballistic missile-launching submarines to replace the Ohio-class subs starting in 2019. The House version of H.R. 1540 included a provision to justify reducing missile launching tubes on new submarines from 20 to 16, emphasizing the importance of the ships' contribution to the U.S. nuclear deterrent. The final bill requires a report on the cost and effectiveness of alternative missile sub fleets with 8 to 12 ships, each with 16 or 20 missiles. The House-passed version of H.R. 1540 included provisions to modernize the Energy Department's nuclear weapons production complex and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Senate version had similar but less restrictive provisions. The final bill included provisions analogous to the House's, but were generally less restrictive. In the final version of H.R. 1540, the provision governing nuclear force reductions requires Congress to receive reports on the proposed smaller U.S. nuclear arsenal's net assessment and the capacity of U.S. nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities. The final version of H.R. 1540 requires reports on the proposed smaller U.S. nuclear arsenal and the capacity of U.S. nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities. It also mandates biennial assessments by senior military commanders of U.S. nuclear forces and a report by the Secretary of Defense on plans to carry out reductions required by START. The final version of H.R. 1540 mandates reports on the proposed smaller U.S. nuclear arsenal, capacity of U.S. nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities, and biennial assessments by senior military commanders of U.S. nuclear forces. It also requires a report by the Secretary of Defense on plans to carry out reductions required by START, including modernization of the nuclear weapons stockpile and implications for the flexibility and resiliency of the U.S. nuclear force. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes provisions for reports on the proposed smaller U.S. nuclear arsenal, capacity of U.S. nuclear weapons manufacturing facilities, and assessments by senior military commanders of U.S. nuclear forces. It also mandates a report on plans to carry out reductions required by START, including modernization of the nuclear weapons stockpile and implications for the flexibility and resiliency of the U.S. nuclear force. The bill does not require the retention of the current nuclear \"triad\" and makes cuts to the Missile Defense Agency budget. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes $1.16 billion for the ground-based missile defense system, requiring DOD to assess recent test failures and develop a hedging strategy for alternative missile defense. The final version of the bill did not include a provision from the House bill that required the Secretary of Defense to spend $8 million on a report analyzing space-based anti-missile interceptors. The House version also included a provision prohibiting sharing sensitive anti-missile technology with Russia. The Senate bill supported missile defense programs in cooperation with Russia to protect both countries and NATO members. The final version of H.R. 1540 included a provision requiring prior notice before Russia is given access to missile defense technology. The bill did not include a provision prohibiting international agreements affecting U.S. missile defenses not approved by the Senate. The Senate version denied funding for the MEADS system but urged DOD to negotiate for improved missile defenses. The Senate committee urged DOD to negotiate with other countries to pull out of the MEADS program at the lowest cost. The House version of H.R. 1540 reduced funding for MEADS and recommended using its technologies to enhance the Patriot defense system. The final bill authorized $390.0 million for MEADS, with restrictions on spending until a plan is presented to develop a cheaper system or terminate the program. House and Senate conferees warned of potential costs up to $800 million to end the program. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes a provision requiring an independent analysis of the strategic value and cost of U.S. bases worldwide. The study will be conducted by a federally financed research center or a non-profit organization with expertise in national security. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to critique DOD's cost estimates for overseas basing, particularly regarding the decision to leave Army units in Europe. The final version of the bill includes provisions for an independent assessment of U.S. security interests in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, as well as a review of deployment plans in the region. DOD plans to shift the focus of U.S. forces in the Pacific to South and Southeast Asia. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to develop a 20-year plan outlining changes in focus from Northeast Asia to South and Southeast Asia. An independent assessment of America's security interests in Asia, current force deployment plans, and future needs is also required. This assessment will include plans to increase U.S. troops in South Korea and shift Marines from Okinawa to Guam. The final version of the bill includes a provision that would block the implementation of DOD \"Tour Normalization\" policy in South Korea, which would allow more families to accompany U.S. troops. The bill prohibits any further increase in the number of families authorized to accompany troops until certain conditions are met. The new policy in South Korea would allow more U.S. troops to bring their families and serve for three years. The GAO report estimated costs of $5.1 billion through FY2020 and $22.0 billion through FY2050 for family housing and other support facilities. The DOD had not considered alternative policies' costs and benefits. The Senate Armed Services Committee report on S. 1253 requires a report from DOD on planned changes in the status of U.S. forces in Korea, including Tour Normalization and a plan to redeploy U.S. forces that could cost up to $18.1 billion by 2020. This plan involves moving 10,000 troops near the DMZ and 9,000 troops in Seoul to two U.S. force \"hubs\" south of Seoul, with a strategic rationale and cost estimates for military construction projects. The final version of H.R. 1540 authorizes $122 million for three construction projects in South Korea and restricts funding for relocating Marine Corps air units from Okinawa to Guam. The plan to move units to a remote part of Okinawa has faced opposition due to political concerns. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes a provision barring the use of funds for relocating Marine units on Okinawa until specific conditions are met, such as the Commandant of the Marine Corps reporting his preference for basing units in the Pacific and tangible progress being made towards relocating Marine air units to a new site on Okinawa. Additionally, specific legislative authorization is required for any spending related to the relocation. The final version of the bill goes beyond the Senate version by requiring specific legislative authorization for non-DOD federal agencies' spending on Guam infrastructure due to Marine Corps moves. It authorizes $19.2 million for construction on Guam and adds $17.4 million for a wind farm. This is part of the effort to relocate over 8,000 Marines and their families to Guam. The final bill for relocating over 8,000 Marines and their families to Guam includes provisions for health care for foreign workers under the H-2B visa program. The Secretary of the Navy must certify a system of health care before awarding additional construction contracts. The bill also denies authorization for $30 million for moving a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to Mayport, FL. The Senate version of the bill authorized $15.0 million for planning and design and $15.0 million for roads and infrastructure at Mayport. It also requires the Navy to analyze the costs and benefits of stationing additional destroyers at Mayport. The final bill includes a study on stationing destroyers at Mayport and authorizes funds for roads and infrastructure, but not for planning and design. The military base closure law set a deadline for the 2005 BRAC round of September 15, 2011. The Secretary of Defense submitted a legislative proposal with the FY2012 budget request for up to 10 BRAC recommendations. DOD notified that almost all recommendations were completed except for the closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical Depot in Oregon. The closure is pending completion of demilitarizing chemical munitions as per international treaties. The closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical Depot in Oregon is pending completion of demilitarizing chemical munitions as per international treaties. The plant in October 2011 is in the process of closing, and there is a recommendation for the location consolidation of military medical commands. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 expired in 2006, but the Secretary of Defense and military department secretaries have permanent authority to close or realign military installations. The closure or realignment of military installations requires notification to the Committees on Armed Services, evaluation of various consequences, and submission of criteria for consideration. The amendment also includes assessing the ability of local infrastructure to support military populations and costs for transportation improvements. The amendment requires the secretary to analyze transportation impacts, consult with the Secretary of Transportation, assess impacts on local businesses and governments, and include remedial intentions in congressional notification. Section 2864 expands the notification requirement to include planned reductions in service members at military installations. The amendment mandates the secretary to notify Congress of any plan to reduce Armed Forces personnel by more than 1,000 at an installation, with certain conditions. The House bill included a limitation on parking spaces at the Mark Center in Arlington, VA, while the Senate bill did not. The conference report expanded the Defense Access Road Program with regard to BRAC-related actions, requiring the Secretary of Defense to assess traffic infrastructure needs without considering local traffic levels. The amendment also mandates convening the Economic Adjustment Committee for DAR projects. The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to convene the Economic Adjustment Committee to find additional funding sources for the DAR Program and expand the pool of available funding. The Senate committee expressed concern about the growing disparity between the US and NATO members in defense spending. The House Armed Services Committee warned about the implications of NATO members spending less on defense compared to the US. They instructed the Secretary of Defense to report on any shift in the location of significant DOD assets, specifically regarding U.S. warships in Europe equipped with the Aegis ballistic missile defense system. The Senate adopted an amendment requiring the Administration to submit a plan for the transition of responsibility for military operations in Afghanistan to the Afghan government. The final version of the bill requires the President to prepare options for improving the Afghan Army and Police to enable the Afghan government to take the lead in security operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill aimed to improve the Afghan Army and Police to enable the Afghan government to take over security operations. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid delayed consideration of the bill due to objections from the White House and other Senate committees. The revised version of the bill addressed some of the objections regarding the treatment of detainees captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The Senate bill S. 1867 authorized detention of certain persons, regulated review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees, and continued funding restrictions on detainee transfers. Unlike the House bill, it did not prohibit transferring detainees to the U.S. for trial. A single amendment was made to clarify the detainee provisions during Senate consideration. The Senate bill S. 1867 authorized detention of certain persons and regulated review proceedings for Guantanamo detainees. An amendment clarified that the bill's affirmation of legal authority to detain persons captured in conflict with Al Qaeda does not modify existing authorities relating to detain U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens. The White House expressed strong opposition to many of the detainee provisions in S. 1867. The Obama Administration reiterated a veto threat after Senate approval of S. 1867. The bill reaffirms the Armed Forces' authority to detain individuals connected to the 2001 terrorist attacks, including U.S. citizens. The Senate provision for military detention of non-citizens was amended to not affect FBI or other law enforcement agencies. The House required the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for communication privileges. The bill amended the requirement for a detailed national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees to be covered in a single report. It included provisions for prosecuting terrorism suspects and consulting with relevant authorities before prosecution. The final bill also addressed status determinations for captured individuals and regulated executive branch procedures for detention reviews. Additionally, it prohibited the use of DOD funds for certain purposes. The final bill includes provisions for periodic reviews of detention cases and prohibits the use of DOD funds to bring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. It also places stringent conditions on the transfer or release of detainees to foreign countries. An amendment to the bill would have imposed economic sanctions on Iranian financial institutions, but a modified version was included in the final bill. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes provisions that modified the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and added a new section exempting military flight operations data from disclosure. The President signed the bill with a statement ensuring sanctions against Iran's Central Bank would not harm U.S. relations with allies. The final version of H.R. 1540 includes provisions that modified the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and added a new section exempting military flight operations data from disclosure. Section 2254 requires the public disclosure of certain accident investigation information before the final accident investigation report is released, as long as it does not compromise national security or the investigation process. The conference agreement to H.R. 1540 created a new section 2254a of title 10, U.S. Code allowing exemption from disclosure under FOIA for military flight operations data upon DOD determination of sensitivity. Section 1082 of the conference agreement to H.R. 1540 defined \"data file\" as part of the military flight operations quality assurance system, exempting it from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 3. The House rejected an amendment to narrow the scope of information covered, ensuring that maintenance records of military aircraft are not withheld for public disclosure to protect tactical information. This prohibition extends to reports of aircraft accidents. The prohibition on disclosing reports of aircraft accident investigations in Section 2254, title 10 remains unclear. Section 1082 of the conference agreement to H.R. 1540 requires the Secretary of Defense to issue regulations regarding FOIA exemptions for military flight operations data files. The Secretary can delegate this authority to the DOD Director of Administration and Management. Each exemption determination must be in writing, include the basis for the decision, and be available upon request. New Section 2254a of Title 10 applies to military flight operations data files before, on, or after the enactment of the Act. The House and Senate bills included provisions exempting military flight operations quality assurance systems data files from the Freedom of Information Act. The conference agreement incorporated transparency standards and a delegation limitation into the provision, inserting a new section into the U.S. Code. The new Section 130e of the U.S. Code authorizes the Secretary of Defense to exempt DOD critical infrastructure security information from disclosure under FOIA if it is determined that the public interest does not outweigh preventing disclosure. This exemption is based on FOIA's Exemption 3 and applies to sensitive but unclassified information that could reveal vulnerabilities. The new Section 130e of the U.S. Code authorizes the Secretary of Defense to exempt DOD critical infrastructure security information from disclosure under FOIA if it is determined that the public interest does not outweigh preventing disclosure. This exemption is based on FOIA's Exemption 3 and applies to sensitive but unclassified information that could reveal vulnerabilities in DOD's critical infrastructure, including information on securing explosives, hazardous chemicals, and pipelines. This provision aims to address concerns about protecting information following a Supreme Court decision limiting the scope of FOIA Exemption 2. FOIA Exemption 2 shields internal personnel rules and practices. Section 1091 allows critical infrastructure security information to remain under DOD control. The secretary can delegate exemption authority to the DOD Director. Each exemption determination must be in writing and publicly available. Section 1091 creates a federal statutory exemption from FOIA. Exemption 3 requires a federal law to qualify as a withholding statute. Federal laws, other than FOIA, must meet specific criteria to qualify as withholding statutes and cite Exemption 3. The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 requires federal statutes to cite both FOIA and subsection b(3). The House and Senate took action on selected amendments during consideration of H.R. 1540 and S. 1867. On July 8, 2011, the House passed H.R. 2219, appropriating $638.3 billion for DOD's discretionary spending in FY2012, reflecting cuts in the base budget request. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill on June 16, 2011, reflecting cuts in the base budget request totaling $8.9 billion. This reduction was partly offset by a net increase of $842 million in funds for war costs compared to the President's request. The largest component of the net increase in war costs is $1.5 billion added for unspecified equipment for National Guard and reserve units. Two-thirds of the House bill's net reduction to the President's request, $5.4 billion, would come from changes that would not adversely impact DOD operations, including reductions in new budget authority and more optimistic assumptions about inflation and economic factors. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill on June 16, 2011, reflecting cuts in the base budget request totaling $8.9 billion. The House-passed bill would cut $1.2 billion from classified procurement and research programs and $5 billion from various Army O&M accounts in the Overseas Contingency Operations part. The committee found errors in the Army's budget request for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, leading to overstatements and unjustified supply increases. The House bill transferred requested amounts to an Overseas Contingency Operation Transfer Fund for unforeseen expenses in Afghanistan and Iraq. An amendment to eliminate the fund was rejected. The bill added $884.7 million to restore DOD funds cut for maintenance and repair, while also making reductions based on anticipated efficiencies, including a $400 million cut for contractor-provided logistic support of weapons. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported an amended version of H.R. 2219 that would cut $26.2 billion from the FY2012 DOD budget request. This reduction would meet the FY2012 spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The cuts included $124.0 million for \"information operations,\" $30.0 million for telecommunications services, and $315.0 million for overhead costs at three Navy shipyards. The Senate committee's version of H.R. 2219 aimed to cut $25.9 billion from the DOD's FY2012 base budget and an additional $268 million from war costs. A significant portion of the base budget cut would have been transferred to war costs, with the largest amount ($6.2 billion) coming from Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds. The Senate committee shifted $6.2 billion from O&M accounts to cover war costs, with $4.3 billion for major overhauls of military equipment. An additional $2.9 billion was moved from procurement and R&D accounts, mainly for unmanned aerial vehicle programs. The committee planned to cut $10.2 billion from the defense budget, including $5 billion due to troop reductions in Afghanistan and $2 billion identified as unnecessary by the Army. The Senate committee bill for the FY2012 Defense appropriations cut $8.6 billion from the budget request, including $5.6 billion from unnecessary programs and $2.7 billion rescinded from prior budgets. Additionally, $1.57 billion was cut from funds requested for Afghanistan military and police forces. The final FY2012 Defense appropriations bill provided $633.3 billion in discretionary spending for DOD, a $23.6 billion reduction from the initial request. The final FY2012 Defense appropriations bill provided $633.3 billion in discretionary spending for DOD, a $23.6 billion reduction from the initial request. The bill incorporated reductions made by the Senate committee to reach the spending ceiling set by the Budget Control Act. $6.0 billion was shifted to war costs, including $1.4 billion for Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles. An additional $3 billion was cut from the base budget request. The FY2012 Defense appropriations bill included $2.5 billion in rescissions and $515 million cut from DOD's Working Capital Funds. $6.0 billion was transferred to war costs, with reductions including $4.0 billion due to troop reduction in Afghanistan. The House-passed bill for the FY2012 Defense appropriations included cuts from various programs, such as $118.7 million more for the Defense Health Program, $394 million from operating accounts, and $330 million from the TRICARE health insurance program. The House bill added $523.5 million for research and development programs focused on specific diseases and treatments, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and psychological health. The Senate committee bill would have added $337.3 million to the Defense Health Program (DHP) budget request, with increases for various R&D programs. The final version of the bill provided $32.5 billion for DHP, an increase of $283.3 million over the request, including additional funding for medical R&D programs. The House bill added funds for medical R&D, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, TBI, and psychological health. The bill also allocated funds for upgrading Army M-1 tanks with System Enhancement Package (SEP) upgrades. The bill adds $255.0 million for SEP upgrades for National Guard combat units, urging all units to be equipped with the same tank version. The Senate committee questions the cost of developing a new armored troop carrier and cuts $644.0 million from the requested amount. The final bill provides $435.0 million for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, a reduction of more than 50% justified by concerns over the Army's rushed development process. The Senate committee's version of the bill would have terminated the program, intended to replace some of the Humvees, due to growing costs and reduced planned purchases. The final bill allocates $134 million for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program and $20 million for improved Humvee armor. The House bill had proposed cutting $25 million from the JLTV request and adding $25 million for Humvee armor. Conferees praised the services for setting less demanding specifications for the new vehicle and agreeing to buy a single version. Funding for selected aircraft programs in H.R. 2219 and H.R. 2055 is also summarized in the Appendix. The Senate Appropriations Committee cut $695.1 million from the procurement budget for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, citing issues with the F-22 fighter program. They recommended deferring the plan to accelerate F-35 production due to completion of only 10% of its flight test program. The committee approved funding for 23 out of 26 requested planes for the Air Force and Navy, while also approving $1.14 billion to buy six F-35Bs for the Marine Corps. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.14 billion to buy six F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, along with $117.2 million for long lead-time components. The bill also cut $354.5 million from the request for Navy and Air Force versions of the F-35, while adding $100 million to address concurrency costs. Additionally, $225 million was included to buy a replacement C-17 cargo plane. The Senate committee bill denies $108.6 million to shut down the C-17 production line, citing recent sales extending production. None of the bill versions fund the Army reconnaissance system EMARSS. The House bill would have provided $15.7 million for the program, but the Senate committee bill and enacted version denied the request. The House bill for shipbuilding programs in H.R. 2219 and H.R. 2055 provided funding for various Navy vessels, including submarines, destroyers, Littoral Combat Ships, and amphibious landing transport. The Senate committee bill denied funding for certain programs, such as the Army reconnaissance system EMARSS. The Senate committee-reported version of the bill proposed cuts to the requested funding for the MLP and Army-funded JHSV, transferring some funds to the Navy's shipbuilding account. H.R. 2055 as enacted provided $14.9 billion for shipbuilding, fully funding the MLP and transferring funds for the JHSV as agreed upon by the Army and Navy. Other changes included small reductions for excessive price increases and overhead costs. The House rejected amendments to reduce the budget during floor debate on H.R. 2219. The House rejected amendments on H.R. 2219 that would have reduced the budget authority provided by the bill."
