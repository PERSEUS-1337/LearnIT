    "content": "The report examines the link between the environment and security in Pakistan, highlighting how environmental stress can impact national security and American interests in the region. Climate change exacerbates crises like water scarcity and natural disasters, potentially acting as a threat multiplier. The security situation in and around Pakistan is a significant concern for the United States. The security threats to the United States from Pakistani territory and the region stem from radical Islamist groups. Pakistan's limited control of its territory, economic challenges, and political turmoil hinder its ability to control these groups. Its nuclear status, rivalry with India, and proximity to Afghanistan heighten its importance to U.S. strategic interests. The environment and natural resources in Pakistan are under stress, with dwindling water supplies, high deforestation rates, and projected climate change effects. These environmental stressors have potential socio-economic and political consequences for the country, including tensions with India and protests due to reduced hydropower supplies. Environmental stress in Pakistan, including drought and reduced hydropower supplies, may lead to socio-political instability and economic stresses in agricultural regions. This could undermine American interests in the region and become a geopolitical concern when combined with existing political and socio-economic stresses. Congress may be interested in this connection due to its role in funding Pakistan. Environmental stress in Pakistan has been expanding for decades, affecting water resources and food security. J.R. McNeill's analysis shows that natural shocks can lead to social conflict, blaming minorities or foreign groups, and government authorities for failing to prevent damage. Societies with little safety net can succumb to banditry, violence, and civil war during acute drought. Pakistan faces environmental stress due to demand-induced and structural scarcity of resources. The ecosystem and political structure are fragile, making it more susceptible to depletion or degradation. Thomas Homer Dixon highlights the impact of environmental factors on security, where societal constraints can hinder adaptation to scarcity, leading to social effects like constrained agriculture. Environmental scarcity can lead to social effects like constrained agricultural and economic productivity, migration, social segmentation, and disruption of institutions. Contextual factors, such as inter-ethnic relations and state autonomy, also play a role. In Pakistan, these factors are exacerbated by threat multipliers. Jared Diamond's framework in Collapse emphasizes that environmental damage is not the sole cause of societal collapse, with contributing factors including climate change, hostile neighbors, trade partners, and societal responses to environmental issues. The society's response to environmental factors is a significant factor in societal collapse, as highlighted by Jared Diamond. As environmental degradation and climate change impact security, there is a need for international climate change mitigation efforts. Developing nations will face increasing stress from environmental degradation, climate change, and demographic pressure. Climate change is just one of many security threats, including failed states, terrorism, economic security, and humanitarian disasters. The physical impacts of climate change can lead to socio-economic effects, posing a threat to security and stability. Pakistan, heavily reliant on the Indus River system, faces water stress with inequitable water allocations. Data on these issues are relevant globally. Pakistan faces water stress with inequitable water allocations, impacting human health, livelihoods, and ecosystem services. Most households lack access to adequate water, with increased demand due to irrigation, population growth, and economic development. Climate change will further challenge water resources, exacerbating regional tensions. Development for agriculture in Pakistan has led to economic growth and the country being a regional food basket. With agriculture accounting for 97% of water withdrawals, there is little left for other uses. Pakistan has the world's largest irrigated area, mainly from the Indus River system and groundwater wells, contributing significantly to the GDP. However, the imbalance between water supply and demand has caused shortages, regional competition, conflicts, and constraints on economic development, exacerbated by climate change. The imbalance between water supply and demand in Pakistan has led to shortages and conflicts. Developing new water sources and improving efficiency are key solutions, but face challenges due to financial constraints and climate change predictions of glacier melt affecting the Indus River. Climate change predictions indicate that glacier melt affecting the Indus River will lead to decreased river flows, threatening food security for those reliant on irrigation. Additionally, climate change is expected to increase monsoon variability, decrease precipitation predictability, worsen water-stress in arid regions, and increase salt-water intrusion in coastal freshwater supplies, impacting Pakistan's agriculture sector. Pakistan's agriculture sector contributes significantly to the economy, with about 70% of the population dependent on it. However, expected water shortages and soil degradation may constrain its expansion. Major crops include wheat, rice, barley, corn, millet, sorghum, and livestock products like buffalo, cow, and goat. Other commodities include fruits, vegetables, cattle, mutton, and eggs. Livestock in Pakistan are primarily pasture-fed, with major production in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco are the main cash crops. Agricultural production has grown due to high-yielding crops and government support. Agricultural production in Pakistan has been declining in recent years due to various factors such as shortage of irrigation water, soil degradation, low technology use, uncertain land tenure, poor government investment, dominance of large landowners, lack of crop diversification, and governance issues. Pakistan's agriculture sector faces challenges such as shortage of irrigation water, soil degradation, low technology use, uncertain land tenure, poor government investment, dominance of large landowners, lack of crop diversification, and governance issues. The country has become a large net importer of food products, with less than 30% of its total land area under cultivation. Punjab and Sindh provinces account for nearly 90% of Pakistan's irrigated agriculture, with most arable land in these regions. Pakistan heavily relies on irrigation due to its arid climate, with nearly all available water used for agriculture. Pakistan's arable land is mainly classified as \"arid\" or \"hyper-arid,\" with low organic matter in soils being a major factor contributing to land degradation. Other factors include soil erosion, lack of organic fertilizers, salinity, and waterlogging. The country heavily relies on irrigation, covering 83% of cultivated land, with Punjab region being the main area for irrigated agriculture. About 72% of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan is concentrated in the Punjab region, with 10.3 million hectares under irrigation. Sindh province accounts for another 2.5 million hectares (17%) of irrigated agriculture. Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province each have about 700,000 hectares under irrigation. The UN highlights fluctuations in food availability as a factor contributing to micronutrient deficiency disorders in Pakistan. Energy from wheat and cereals makes up 38% of the total dietary intake, with milk products at 11% and sugar products at 10%. Despite this, over 20% of the population suffers from food deprivation. The U.N. reports severe malnutrition among Pakistani children under five, with high rates of underweight, stunting, and wasting. Malnutrition varies among provinces, with Baluchistan having the highest rates. Baluchistan, NWFP, and FATA, along with areas with IDPs, face food insecurity. Pakistan is prone to natural disasters like earthquakes and floods, causing significant fatalities and infrastructure damage. Pakistan has faced major earthquakes and flooding, leading to significant fatalities, displacement, and infrastructure damage. The 2005 earthquake resulted in over 73,000 deaths and $5.0 billion in recovery costs. Flooding during the monsoon season displaces thousands, damages infrastructure, and affects croplands. Climate change may impact flooding patterns. Natural disasters in South Asia have killed 60,000 and affected 750 million people, causing $45 billion in damages between 1990 and 2008. In July and August of 2010, Pakistan experienced devastating floods, killing over 1,100 people and causing $45 billion in damages in South Asia. The floods affected the Swat Valley and led to a Pew Research poll showing only 17% of Pakistanis holding a favorable view of the United States. The US provided $10 million in assistance to aid flood victims, which may improve perceptions. Melting glaciers in the Himalayan region could lead to glacial lake outburst floods, impacting downstream communities. Glacial lakes in the Himalayan region of Pakistan can pose a danger, leading to displacement and infrastructure damage. Natural disasters stress governments, potentially fueling internal conflicts. Radical groups may exploit these situations to recruit members by providing assistance to affected populations. Existing environmental concerns in Pakistan could worsen, acting as a threat multiplier when combined with other challenges. Environmental stress in Pakistan, exacerbated by factors like high population growth, low economic development, and resource scarcity, could increase the risk of conflict. This stress could weaken the state, making it vulnerable to pressure from militants and potentially leading to a return to military rule. Food production is crucial for development in Pakistan due to limited arable land and resources relative to the population. Pakistan's population has almost quadrupled from 1960 to 2010 and is expected to reach 335 million by 2050. Limited arable land, increasing population size, and poverty put Pakistan at extreme risk of food insecurity. In 2009, Pakistan ranked 11th on the Food Security Risk Index, with the number of insecure people increasing from 35 million to 45 million. Economic factors, such as a 95% increase in wheat flour prices from 2007 to 2009, contribute to this status. Pakistan faced a severe food security crisis from May 2007 to October 2009, with food inflation increasing prices by 28%. Approximately 85% of Pakistanis live on two dollars a day or less and spend at least 50% of their income on food. The country produces 20 million tons of wheat but consumes 23 million tons, leading to the need for wheat imports. Riots broke out during this period, prompting the deployment of 6,000 soldiers to secure food distribution centers and escort supply trucks. The food security situation was particularly dire in Pakistan's northern and western border areas, with 20 out of 25 districts in Baluchistan considered food insecure. The Federally Administered Tribal Areas and 20 out of 25 districts in Pakistan were food insecure due to regional conflict and influx of refugees. Internal fighting in northwest Pakistan in 2009 led to 3 million Internally Displaced Persons, contributing to food scarcity and overtaxed infrastructure. Refugees reduce the resilience of regional governments in facing environmental stress. The adversarial relationship with India and conflict in Afghanistan limit cross-border migration options for Pakistan's populations. Political-military strife hinders effective deployment of state resources for environmental and other issues. Constitutional changes in 2010 are unlikely to resolve conflicts between the military, judiciary, and government, leading to continued political infighting and governance challenges. Corruption remains a significant issue, with Pakistan ranking 42nd most corrupt out of 180 states in 2009. Pakistan ranked 42nd most corrupt out of 180 states by Transparency International. Elite control of resources has marginalized many of Pakistan's poor. Urban poor are more vulnerable to price increases. Plans to sell or lease one million acres of farmland to foreign investors. Pakistani Taliban previously controlled Swat Valley. Plans for a special security force to protect foreign investment in farmland. Foreign investment in Pakistani farmland raises concerns about competition for water resources and potential exemption from export bans during shortages. Pakistan's poor economic performance limits its ability to cope with environmental stress, unlike developed states with stronger economies. The lack of alternative employment options could pose challenges for displaced agricultural workers. The Pakistani economy has faced challenges due to political conflict and low foreign investment. Despite some progress in poverty reduction, unemployment remains high at 15.2%. Inflation is expected to be 11.3% in 2010, down from previous years. Emergency funds from the IMF helped stabilize the economy in 2008, but challenges remain. Domestic factors may hinder government efforts to improve economic stability. Environmental stress such as low agricultural productivity, declining water supplies, and natural disasters can worsen economic problems in Pakistan. These factors could lower GDP, increase unemployment, raise food prices, and strain government resources. The impact of these stresses depends on their intensity and timing, exacerbating existing economic challenges. Additionally, a poor economy limits Pakistan's ability to address security threats due to resource constraints. Environmental stress in Pakistan, such as natural disasters, can fuel Islamic extremism. For example, militant groups provided aid after the 2005 earthquake to gain recruits. Weak government response to disasters can empower militant groups and create discord among displaced populations. The Pakistani state faces autonomous and secessionist tendencies in its western borderlands, particularly in FATA, NWFP, and Baluchistan. The central government struggles to exert control over these areas, leading to potential challenges in maintaining authority. Militants in FATA continue to pose a threat to U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. The ongoing dispute over the construction of the Kalabagh Dam in Pakistan highlights tensions over water resource sharing among different provinces. The Punjab supports the dam for energy and water shortage solutions, while Sindh, Baluchistan, and the Northwest Frontier Province oppose it. Pakistan's need for new dams to address power crisis and load shedding is emphasized. The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimates that the dam could eliminate the need to import 20 million barrels of oil annually. Sindh opposes the project due to concerns about water distribution, potential impact on the Indus River Delta mangroves, and increased salinity levels. If current water use plans continue in the lower riparian area of the Indus, Sindh faces extreme jeopardy. The lower basin may receive practically no water, leading to saltwater intrusion and migration of villages in Badin and Thatta Districts. Sea level rise from climate change could worsen the situation. Pakistan and India have a history of conflict over Kashmir. Pakistan and India have a history of conflict over their disputed line of control in Kashmir since 1947. The 1960 Indus Water Treaty allocated water from specific rivers to each country, but India's construction of a dam on the Chenab river has caused concerns for Pakistan's agriculture. This has been a point of contention between the two nations. Pakistan and India have a history of conflict over water resources, with concerns about India using dams to manipulate water flow to its advantage. Tensions over water could escalate to war or lead to enhanced cooperation. Pakistani President Zardari highlighted the water crisis in Pakistan's relation to India, emphasizing the potential for cooperation to prevent extremism and terrorism. The United States is concerned about Pakistan's ability to control its territory to prevent it from becoming a haven for terrorists and to avoid conflict with India. U.S. assistance aims to support a stable Pakistan that can prevent ungoverned areas used by anti-Western terrorists. The United States is increasingly considering the impact of environmental stress, such as water shortages, on food security in Pakistan as a threat multiplier. Special emphasis is being placed on energy and water issues in U.S. assistance programs with Pakistan. It has been suggested that focusing on improving Pakistan's water shortages is crucial for the country's future viability. Development assistance in Pakistan should prioritize improving the country's water infrastructure."
