The report outlines UNHCR's mandate, operations, and budget, highlighting challenges and concerns for Congress. UNHCR provides legal protection, long-term solutions, and emergency relief for refugees. Congress is concerned about funding shortages, burdensharing, and U.S. influence within UNHCR. Established in 1950, UNHCR addresses refugee situations worldwide. The UNHCR, established in 1950, is mandated to protect refugees globally. The current High Commissioner is Ruud Lubbers. The agency is headquartered in Geneva, with over 5,000 staff in 110 countries. Its Executive Committee oversees assistance programs and finances, supported mainly by voluntary contributions. Refugees have a special status under international law. Refugees are granted special status under international law, with rights protected by the 1951 U.N. Convention. UNHCR ensures these rights, provides resources, and coordinates humanitarian assistance. The agency was established after WWII to help resettle European refugees and is the institutional mechanism for implementing the Convention. A refugee is defined as someone fleeing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The 1951 U.N. Convention protects the rights of refugees, including non-rejection at the border, non-forced repatriation, access to fair asylum procedures, and lasting solutions. The 1967 Protocol expands on these measures without time or geographical limits, allowing states to be party to either or both instruments. UNHCR collaborates with states to implement these provisions in national laws. UNHCR works with states to implement international treaties, arguing that international law supersedes bilateral agreements. Enforcement of the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol is challenging. The U.N. General Assembly has expanded UNHCR's involvement to include those fleeing armed conflict and other circumstances. UNHCR's mandate is to protect refugees, but it also assists a broader group called \"persons of concern,\" estimated at 19.8 million worldwide. This group includes refugees, returnees, IDPs, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and others. The UNHCR provides assistance to refugees returning to their home countries, including transportation, start-up packages, and rebuilding support. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) do not have the same protection as refugees under international law and fall between the mandates of different agencies. UNHCR has provided assistance and some protection to IDPs but argues for better support. The UNHCR provides assistance to refugees returning home, including transportation and rebuilding support. IDPs lack the same protection as refugees and struggle to receive adequate support. Asylum seekers seek refuge in a second state and receive legal protection and material assistance from UNHCR. Stateless persons, like those from the former Soviet Union, also receive assistance. UNHCR's main functions include providing legal protection to those in need. UNHCR provides legal protection to refugees and seeks permanent solutions for their situations, including voluntary repatriation, local integration, or resettlement. UNHCR coordinates NGOs for emergency relief, including shelter, food, and medical care. They also provide training for border guards and resolve sensitive situations between governments and asylum seekers. As crises evolved, UNHCR expanded collaborations with various organizations within the U.N. system. UNHCR collaborates with various organizations such as WFP, UNICEF, WHO, UNDP, OCHA, and others, as well as international organizations like ICRC and IFRC, and NGOs like IRC and IOM to support refugees. They have dealt with significant population movements in the past decade, including those from Rwanda, the Balkans, and Afghanistan, with many Afghans living in refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran. Since September 11, 2001, there has been a significant return of Afghans to their home country. Since September 11, 2001, many Afghans have returned home from Pakistan and Iran, straining UNHCR programs and reducing resources for returnees. UNHCR is preparing a contingency plan for Iraq in case of war, with U.N. agencies providing most humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicine. The United Nations estimates that over 60% of Iraq's 24 million people receive monthly food distributions. War could lead to a humanitarian emergency with large population movements. UNHCR relies on voluntary contributions for 98% of its budget. The UNHCR receives nearly 95% of its total contributions from 15 donors, with the CY2002 budget at $1.05 billion. Shortfalls in funding have led to cuts in planned programs since 1999, as UNHCR relies on voluntary contributions and cannot predict annual funding levels. The CY2003 appeal is for $837 million for the annual budget and $39.5 million for supplementals. The UNHCR faces funding shortfalls and cash availability crisis due to late contributions, leading to budget cuts and program reductions. In 2002, only $678 million of the $1.05 billion budget was received, resulting in a 11% decrease in planned programs. The annual budget was cut to $710 million, affecting programs in Africa, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, and the Caucasus. UNHCR struggles to anticipate new refugee emergencies and had to make a supplemental appeal in 2002 for emergency needs in various countries. In 2002, UNHCR faced funding shortfalls and cash availability crisis, leading to budget cuts and program reductions. For CY2003, UNHCR made a supplemental appeal and introduced new mechanisms to improve funding flows. Countries often earmark their contributions, with the United States earmarking 97% of its contributions. Tight earmarking leads to some programs being well funded while others experience shortages. Countries often earmark their contributions, with some programs being well funded while others, like African crises, experience shortages. High Commissioner Ruud Lubbers emphasizes that UNHCR will only care for IDPs under certain conditions and with adequate resources, seeking a broader response from the U.N. system and international community. The lack of a designated organization focusing on IDPs has led to inconsistent and incomplete responses to IDP crises, raising questions about which organization should take on this role and what protective legal mechanisms could be established. The lack of a designated organization focusing on IDPs has led to inconsistent and incomplete responses to IDP crises. Questions arise about which organization should take on this role and what protective legal mechanisms could be established for IDPs. UNHCR has been dealing with a rise in asylum seekers, while states are becoming less willing to provide asylum. Developing countries host the majority of the world's refugees, with top refugee-hosting countries being Pakistan, Iran, Germany, Tanzania, and the United States. The international community faces challenges in covering all costs associated with large refugee populations, leading to reluctance in accepting asylum seekers due to existing refugee populations, economic issues, and security concerns. Developed countries, like the European Union, are implementing measures to restrict asylum seekers, potentially increasing illegal migration and organized crime. In November 2001, UNHCR requested an investigation into allegations of sexual exploitation of refugees. In 2001, UNHCR requested an investigation into sexual exploitation of refugees by aid workers in West Africa. The report in July 2002 found 10 cases of exploitation, leading to reforms by UNHCR to address the issue. In some conflicts, refugees are used as pawns, such as in Kosovo where leaders may have created refugee crises to manipulate the international response. Refugees are often caught in the crossfire of war, seeking to escape violence but facing it in refugee camps. The camps may house rival ethnic groups and armed rebels, leading to further violence and exploitation. UNHCR works to protect refugees and its workers, but more needs to be done as humanitarian agencies are increasingly perceived as taking sides in conflicts. The humanitarian assistance community faces challenges as they work with military forces in conflict zones, risking being perceived as parties to the conflict. To improve security for personnel, the United Nations established the Emergency and Security Service program in 2001, with UNHCR contributing $2 million. The U.S. government is the largest contributor to UNHCR, with voluntary contributions making up a significant portion. The U.S. government is the largest contributor to UNHCR, with voluntary contributions making up a significant portion. In FY2002, the U.S. government contributed $255 million to UNHCR. Concerns exist about adequate contributions from the United States in FY2003, which could lead to a shortage in refugee program funding. Other countries may follow the U.S. lead in making voluntary contributions. Both the Executive branch and Congress value the work of UNHCR. The Senate Committee on Appropriations strongly supports UNHCR's work but is concerned about a budget shortfall impacting field operations. Authorization for UNHCR is through the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. Funding for UNHCR programs is provided in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. The United States and the European Union are debating the funding of UNHCR. The EU has only contributed 15% of UNHCR's budget compared to the US's 25%. The US believes ECHO should contribute more to UNHCR. Despite this, ECHO and EU member governments have collectively provided $70 million more than the US to UNHCR in FY2002. The main issue is whether ECHO and member governments should redirect more funds to UNHCR. The debate revolves around whether ECHO and member governments should allocate more funds to UNHCR. The US has reduced refugee admissions, impacting the broader international asylum crisis. Congress emphasizes support for specific refugee programs and regions. US influence on UNHCR activities is significant. The US government significantly influences UNHCR activities through funding, policy priorities, participation in the Executive Committee, and the presence of US nationals within the organization. Congress debates the extent of US influence and how to balance it with UNHCR's global mandate. The US government debates how to balance its influence on UNHCR with the agency's global mandate."
