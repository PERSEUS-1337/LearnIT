The State of California enacts Section 13529.6 of the Water Code, requiring the state board to adopt a policy by December 31, 2016, addressing storm-induced overflow from impoundments storing recycled water. The policy aims to maximize recycled water storage capacity for beneficial and aesthetic purposes, considering water supply availability, efficient resource use, seasonal variations, economic opportunities, human health, property, and environmental protection. The Water Code is amended to define key terms related to water management, including the State Water Resources Control Board, regional water quality control boards, waste, and waters of the state. The amendments aim to address human health, property protection, environmental protection, and water conservation. The Water Code defines key terms related to water management, including beneficial uses, water quality, water quality objectives, and water quality control to protect human health, property, environment, and water resources. The Water Code defines terms related to water management, including \"water quality control plan\" for designated areas, \"contamination\" as water impairment by waste, and \"pollution\" as waste altering water quality to affect beneficial uses or facilities. \"Nuisance\" is defined as meeting specific requirements. \"Definitions of \"nuisance\" and \"recycled water\" are provided, with the former being injurious to health or offensive to the senses, affecting a community, and related to waste treatment. The latter refers to water suitable for beneficial use after waste treatment. Additionally, the definition of \"hazardous substance\" is outlined.\" \"A hazardous substance is defined as any substance determined to be hazardous under federal water pollution laws for surface water discharge or listed as hazardous waste under state laws for groundwater discharge. Exclusions include non-toxic stormwater runoff. The curr_chunk outlines exemptions for certain discharges, including pesticides applied for agricultural purposes, discharges to surface water below reportable quantities, and discharges to land that may reach groundwater below reportable quantities for hazardous substances.
