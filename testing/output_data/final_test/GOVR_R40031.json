    "content": "The report defines awards as agency payments to reward employees for past performance, distinct from pay. Title 5 award authorities vary for different types of employees. Incentives are payments to incentivize individuals to accept or remain in a position, with three types: recruitment, relocation, and retention. The report discusses the various authorities that apply to federal executive branch employees, including laws, regulations, executive orders, and administrative policies that determine how employees are appointed, appraised, compensated, and managed. These authorities can be identical, similar, or substantially different from each other, with some providing flexibility for agencies to customize their practices within broad requirements. The underlying diversity of workforces among and within agencies is highlighted in the report. This report simplifies the analysis by discussing three major types of federal employees for purposes of employee awards: federal employees generally, career SES employees, and political employees with restrictions on awards. Some employees may fall outside these categories due to exceptions in law. This report focuses on executive-branch-wide authorities for employee awards, excluding agency- or occupation-specific authorities. It discusses statutory authorities and data sources for awards granted to federal employees, including cash awards outlined in Title 5. The subchapter authorizes various types of awards for federal employees, including agency awards, presidential awards, and performance-based cash awards. Employees in executive agencies and some legislative branch agencies are eligible for these awards, which can also be granted to former employees and groups of employees. Agencies have discretion in designing and implementing their award programs. Authorities grant agencies discretion to design and implement award programs, with cash awards not exceeding $10,000 unless certified as \"highly exceptional.\" Performance-based cash awards are available to employees with a \"fully successful\" performance rating or higher. The Director of OPM can authorize performance-based cash awards for employees not covered by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4505a, with limits of 10% of annual pay, or up to 20% for exceptional performance. Chapter 45, Subchapter II allows for cost savings disclosure awards, with a maximum of $10,000 or 1% of total savings for employees who report fraud, waste, or mismanagement to the inspector general. The agency award for cost savings disclosure is limited to $10,000 or 1% of total savings determined by the IG. The President can grant a $20,000 cash award for disclosures resulting in substantial cost savings, with a limit of 50 awards per fiscal year. Additionally, agency heads can give a one-step pay increase for exceptional performance to GS employees. A Quality Step Increase (QSI) can be granted to an employee with the highest performance rating, increasing their basic pay. Senior career employees in SL or ST positions above GS-15 may receive rank awards equal to 20% or 35% of annual basic pay. OPM is responsible for maintaining information on the executive branch workforce. OPM is responsible for maintaining information on the executive branch workforce to ensure consistent application of merit system principles. Data is collected from agencies and stored in electronic databases like the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF). However, resources for extracting and presenting data are limited, with CPDF award data only available through special runs or OPM publications. OPM issues reports on federal civilian workforce statistics, but data accuracy is not guaranteed due to technology and resource challenges. Congress sometimes relies on direct agency requests or GAO field studies for information access. OPM reported over 1.2 million individual cash awards granted in 2004. In 2004, over 1.2 million individual cash awards were granted, totaling $1.1 billion, or 1.01% of total salaries. Awards to individual employees tend to be larger in number and dollar amount than awards to groups. Group cash awards amounted to about 0.11% of total salaries in FY2004. The Fact Book does not report on the percentage of employees who received awards, but a 2004 newspaper article reported that the figure was 62% for FY2002. In 2006, 39.8% of federal employees agreed that awards in their work unit depend on job performance, continuing a declining trend from 2002 and 2004. Career senior executive employees may receive various awards, while political appointees are not eligible for certain awards. SES employees are not eligible for certain awards like Presidential Rank Awards or SES performance awards. They can receive cash awards under specific regulations, with a $10,000 limit for federal employees. For Presidential Rank Awards, payments are based on the executive's rank and basic pay, determined in part by the SES appraisal system at their agency. In agencies with uncertified or certified appraisal systems, rank awards for career executives range from $22,894 to $60,270. The percentage of executives eligible for Meritorious and Distinguished Rank Awards is limited to 5% and 1% respectively. Presidential Rank Award recipients cannot receive another award for four fiscal years. SL and ST positions have similar award eligibility as career SES positions. Career senior executives can receive performance awards if rated at least \"fully successful,\" with the amount determined by the agency head between 5% and 20% of their basic pay. The total amount of performance awards an agency can pay is capped, based on previous fiscal year pay data. OPM publishes annual reports on pay and awards for SES employees, but data on politically appointed SES employees and Title 5 awards are not included. OPM's report for FY2007 provided data on awards for career SES employees, with 74.5% receiving awards averaging $14,221. Agency-specific figures were also included in the report. In 2006, the Senior Executives Association (SEA) conducted a survey on the SES pay system, raising questions about pay and awards. The OPM also conducted a survey in 2008, focusing on the impact of the new SES pay for performance system. 67.9% of respondents agreed that their performance appraisal was a fair reflection of their performance. In response to a question about bonus linkage to performance ratings, 71.5% of respondents indicated a strong connection. However, only 32.3% agreed that bonus amounts differ significantly among executives. Agency-specific data from the OPM 2008 survey showed varying responses among agencies, with 43.4% agreeing that SES pay for performance improves organizational performance. Political appointees, including \"Schedule C\" employees, are another group eligible for awards. Political appointees, SES employees, and presidential appointees subject to Senate confirmation are restricted from receiving certain types of awards, especially during presidential election years. A \"senior politically appointed officer\" may not receive awards under Title 5's Chapter 45, Subchapter I during a \"Presidential election period.\" During a Presidential election period, political appointees are restricted from receiving certain awards under Title 5's Chapter 45, Subchapter I. Cash awards are prohibited for PAS officers in specific positions listed in the Executive Schedule. However, some political appointees may still be eligible for awards under other authorities in Chapter 45, Title 5. During presidential election periods, political appointees are restricted from receiving certain awards under Title 5's Chapter 45, Subchapter I. However, Subchapter II \"cost savings disclosure\" awards can be granted to any political appointee, even during election periods. Additional restrictions on awards for political appointees were imposed and rescinded by the chiefs of staff of two Presidents in 1994 and 2002. Federal agencies have broad authority to grant lump-sum cash awards to employees. The Clinton Administration wants to maintain a stricter standard for granting cash awards to federal employees, particularly political appointees with high salaries. Agencies are advised to only give monetary rewards for exceptional performance and to use nonmonetary awards for other political appointees. In 2002, the Bush Administration allowed political appointees to receive performance-based awards, rescinding the previous policy. The Bush Administration rescinded the Clinton Administration policy on awards for political appointees, allowing them to receive performance-based awards under Title 5 provisions. Awards must be based on substantial work achievements beyond routine duties, and political appointees should be judged and rewarded like career employees. Schedule C employees are eligible for cash awards and other forms of recognition for contributions to government efficiency. Noncareer SES employees are eligible for awards based on contributions but not SES performance bonuses. The Card memorandum allowed QSIs to reward political appointees who receive the highest performance rating and meet agency criteria. OPM developed guidance on political appointee awards in 2002, but reports do not typically provide separate information on political appointees. Representative Steny Hoyer requested data on cash awards for political appointees in 2002 and 2003. OPM reports do not usually break out award data for politically appointed SES employees. However, data from OPM reports show disparities in performance ratings between politically appointed and career SES employees, with career employees receiving higher performance ratings correlating with larger awards. This suggests that performance ratings may impact award levels for politically appointed SES employees compared to career employees. Appraisal ratings for career SES employees, politically appointed SES employees, and overall SES employees are shown in Table 2. The new pay system aimed to address high percentages of SES employees receiving the highest rating, leading to a decrease in these ratings. Politically appointed SES employees consistently received higher ratings than career SES employees, resulting in higher average awards for the latter. In FY2007, highly rated career SES employees received significantly higher average performance awards compared to lower-rated employees. Politically appointed SES employees are not eligible for these awards but can receive salary adjustments and other types of awards. However, the scope of these additional benefits for politically appointed SES employees is not clear from publicly available data. Statutory provisions in Title 5, Chapter 57, Subchapter IV authorize agency use of incentives for recruiting, relocating, and retaining employees. Politically appointed SES employees may receive higher average amounts for awards compared to career employees, despite similar award levels based on performance ratings. The \"three Rs\" incentives for recruitment, relocation, and retention are authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5753 and 5754. These provisions were revised by the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, with implementing regulations found in 5 C.F.R. Part 575. Eligibility requirements for the incentives are discussed in detail. The report discusses the common aspects of incentive types, procedural implementation, distinctive parameters, and data sources for 3R incentives. Unlike award authorities in Chapter 45 of Title 5, 3R incentives in Chapter 57 share the same eligibility requirements for GS employees. The report discusses 3R incentives authorized by statutory provisions, allowing payments to employees in approved categories by OPM. OPM maintains a list of agencies approved to offer incentives, including legislative branch agencies. Statutory provisions also define eligible employees and types of incentives. Incentive payments are authorized by statutory provisions for certain employees in executive agencies, excluding political appointees in specific positions. Eligibility is determined by the definition of \"employee\" as outlined in relevant provisions. OPM regulations specify ineligible and eligible categories of employees for incentive payments in executive agencies. Ineligible categories include positions appointed by the President without Senate consent or designated as agency heads. Eligible employees are those in GS positions paid under specific statutes. Ineligible categories for incentive payments in executive agencies include positions appointed by the President without Senate consent or designated as agency heads. Eligible employees are those in specific GS, SL, ST, SES, law enforcement officer, Executive Schedule, prevailing rate positions, or other approved categories for recruitment, relocation, or retention incentives. The legislative branch agency can pay incentives to employees in GS positions under specific authorities. Procedures focus on transparency, accountability, and prevention of abuse. Agencies must establish a plan before making payments, with designated officials responsible for review. OPM's regulations give agency officials discretion to determine difficult-to-fill positions and essential employee retention. Specific factors must be considered, and employees must enter a written service agreement before receiving payments. Agencies must specify components, termination conditions, and procedures for incentives. They must document decisions on difficult-to-fill positions, incentive parameters, and service period length. Agencies must monitor incentive use to ensure compliance with regulations. OPM may take action if it determines that agencies are not using incentive authorities selectively and judiciously. This can include directing agencies to obtain approval before paying incentives or revoking/suspending incentive authority. Agencies must keep records of incentive payments and submit reports to OPM. Agencies must submit reports to OPM on the use of incentive authorities from 2006 to 2010. Recruitment incentives can be given to new employees for hard-to-fill positions. Employees must sign a service agreement before receiving the incentive. Service period must be at least six months. Targeted groups of positions can also receive incentives. The recruitment incentive payment for employees must be between 25% and 50% of their annual rate of basic pay, with a maximum of 100%. The incentive can be paid in various methods and a relocation incentive can be given to employees relocating for a difficult-to-fill position. A relocation incentive may be paid to employees relocating for difficult-to-fill positions in a different geographic area. The employee must establish a residence in the new area before the payment can be made, and it cannot exceed 25% of their annual pay. Agency determinations for relocation incentives are typically made on a case-by-case basis. Employees being relocated to a new duty station may receive a relocation incentive payment of up to 25% of their annual pay for a maximum of four years. With OPM approval, the incentive can be increased to 50% in critical agency needs, but total payments cannot exceed 100% of the employee's annual pay. Retention incentives are available for employees likely to leave federal government service without it. An agency may pay a retention incentive to a current employee if their unique qualifications or the agency's special need for their services makes it essential to retain them. The incentive can be up to 25% of the employee's pay, with OPM approval it can be increased to 50% in critical agency needs. The retention incentive can be increased to 50% based on critical agency needs and may be paid in installments or as a lump sum after completing the required service period. The agency cannot offer the incentive before employment or as an initial lump sum. A written service agreement is not required if the incentive is paid in biweekly installments at the full rate. An agency may pay a retention incentive to a current employee if there is a special need to retain the employee before office closure or relocation, and if the employee would likely leave without the incentive. The incentive can only be paid if the employee's performance rating is at least \"fully successful\" and a written notice is provided. An agency may establish a retention incentive rate for an employee affected by office closure or relocation, not exceeding 25% of the employee's basic pay. With OPM approval, this rate can be increased to 50% for critical agency needs. The incentive must be paid in a way that encourages the employee to serve the full service period, with a written service agreement required. The determination to pay a retention incentive must be reviewed annually by the agency. An agency must review retention incentives annually to determine if payment is still warranted. Service agreements must be terminated if closure or relocation is cancelled. Additional employee entitlements and agency obligations upon termination are specified. Reporting requirements for this authority are also mandated. OPM regulations prohibit simultaneous payment of multiple incentives and concurrent service agreements. Relocation incentives can be initiated during a previously authorized retention service agreement. The Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004 allows agencies to terminate one incentive and authorize a different one to support staffing needs. Congress expressed concerns about the use of incentives affecting agency missions. The Director of OPM must be notified within 60 days of any incentive changes. The Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004 established reporting requirements for OPM regarding incentives for federal employees, with a focus on recruitment, relocation, and retention. Congress expressed concerns about the impact of incentives on agency missions and mandated annual reports for the first five years of the program. OPM is required to submit annual reports to Congress on the use of incentives for federal employees under the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004. The reports detail the number and amount of incentives given, but do not include information on independent agency authority payments. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) submits annual reports to Congress on the use of incentives for federal employees, including recruitment, relocation, and retention incentives. In 2007, there was a significant increase in the use of recruitment and relocation incentives compared to 2006. The Department of Defense was the largest user of these incentives. In 2007, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs were the biggest users of 3R incentives. GS employees received the most retention incentives, with budget constraints being a significant barrier for some agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of effective human resources management tools in agencies, including recruitment, motivation, rewards, and retention of high-performing workforces. It also addresses the need for oversight and regulation of agency practices within the executive branch and congressional oversight over a decentralized civil service system. The potential scope of lawmaking related to awards and incentives is highlighted, along with the role of OPM and agencies in implementing and monitoring these laws. The curr_chunk discusses how Congress can oversee the implementation of laws related to human resources management tools in agencies, including awards and incentives. It poses questions on how agencies are using statutory authorities, how Congress can direct OPM and agencies through law, and how Congress can exercise its oversight power. The report concludes by discussing potential options for congressional study, oversight, and lawmaking in government-wide and specific agency contexts. The federal civil service is customized to individual agencies and workforces, with a decentralized execution. It is divided into the competitive service, excepted service, and SES, each with its own appointment provisions in Title 5. Employees in the excepted service work outside of Title 5's appointment provisions. Different statutory provisions apply to workforces outside of Title 5's appointment provisions, with functions now delegated to agencies or contracted out. This customization and decentralization result in varying pay, award, and incentive authorities across government. Agencies have extensive flexibility to customize award and incentive practices to fit their missions and resource levels. The authorities for agencies to recruit, motivate, reward, and retain high-performing workforces vary and may require case-by-case analysis. Questions arise regarding the balance between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, including monetary compensation, autonomy, and professional development. These issues are influenced by an agency's circumstances and mission. The use of agency authorities for workforce management raises questions about how agencies utilize their powers, balance flexibility with oversight, and address emerging challenges. Understanding agency practices can provide insights into recruitment, motivation, and retention strategies, highlighting the need for potential changes in statutory authorities, management capacities, and resource levels. Without study and investigation, it may be difficult to identify the true sources of problems related to workforce retention within an agency. Questions arise about the competition from nongovernmental employers, the attractiveness of alternative places of employment, and the use of awards or incentives to address salary competition. Recruitment and retention issues may also stem from outmoded management practices, program design, or organizational structures. The appropriateness and legitimacy of awards and incentives usage are also important considerations. The appropriateness and legitimacy of awards and incentives are being questioned regarding their use in addressing retention issues within federal agencies. Concerns include whether incentives are truly necessary for employees to stay, how determinations are made, and if they are being used to combat pay compression or as salary enhancements for certain groups. Additionally, the validity and reliability of performance appraisal systems underlying award decisions are being scrutinized. The oversight and regulation of agencies and the executive branch play a crucial role in ensuring awards and incentives are appropriate and free from bias. Congress has implemented institutional checks to prevent rating errors and ensure the legitimacy of incentive authorities. In the oversight of agencies and the executive branch, institutional checks are crucial to ensure the legitimacy of incentive authorities. This includes creating checks within agencies or the executive branch to ensure laws are faithfully executed to congressional intent. These checks may lead to some inefficiency but are necessary to prevent problems and involve multiple parties in decision-making. Congress has established oversight and regulatory capacity in agencies and the executive branch through planning, transparency, and reporting requirements to address issues of congressional oversight. With a decentralized civil service system, Congress may struggle to conduct in-depth oversight and investigations into all areas of public policy and management. This is particularly relevant to HR authorities and practices, including employee awards and incentives. Congress faces the challenge of overseeing a fragmented civil service system. Congress may struggle with oversight due to a fragmented civil service system. Additional transparency and oversight on employee awards and incentives may be needed. Challenges include identifying governing authorities and obtaining timely data on agency practices. The need for additional transparency and oversight on employee awards and incentives is highlighted, with challenges in obtaining specific data on agency practices. Possible solutions include establishing formal reporting requirements for OPM and agencies, focusing on long-term IT solutions for data accuracy, and amending relevant statutes to ensure information accessibility to Congress and the public. OPM's implementation of the statute from enactment through 2008 focused on producing information for internal use under the President's Management Agenda. Options for increasing transparency include oversight hearings and formal reporting requirements for agencies and OPM."
