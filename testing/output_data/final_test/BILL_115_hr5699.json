    "content": "The Act titled \"Hospital Opioid Solutions Toolkit Act of 2018\" or \"HOST Act of 2018\" aims to provide guidance on pain management and opioid use disorder prevention for hospitals receiving Medicare Part A payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop guidance for hospitals receiving Medicare Part A payments on pain management and opioid use disorder prevention by January 1, 2019, consulting with various stakeholders. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide guidance to hospitals on pain management and opioid use disorder prevention for Medicare beneficiaries and other relevant entities. The guidance will include best practices for screening, education, treatment protocols, and resources for individuals at risk of opioid use disorder. Best practices for hospitals include educating practitioners on pain management and substance use disorders, emphasizing adverse effects of prolonged opioid use, non-pharmacological treatments, monitoring programs, and prescribing naloxone. Hospitals should also inform individuals about opioid risks using a notification template provided by the Secretary. The Secretary has developed a notification template for individuals prescribed opioids, explaining risks, side effects, and the importance of adhering to treatment regimens. It also highlights non-opioid alternatives for pain management and encourages discussions with healthcare providers. The notification template for individuals prescribed opioids includes easily understandable information in multiple languages and additional details determined appropriate by the Secretary. Best practices for hospitals include tracking opioid prescribing trends by practitioners, establishing target levels for opioids prescribed, and checking medical records against provided information. The Secretary may include information on strategies to reduce long-term opioid prescriptions and methods to identify practitioners who may be over-prescribing opioids, as well as other relevant information from the Opioid Safety Initiative and Opioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit."
