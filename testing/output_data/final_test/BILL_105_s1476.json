Congress finds that the success of the peace process in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is crucial for stability and trade benefits. Economic development in these regions is vital for political stability and peace, and tariff concessions can incentivize this development. The EU and GATT regulations apply to tariff issues in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. A free trade agreement in this region would support EU efforts for social cohesion and benefit the EU, United States, and international community. The President should be authorized to negotiate concessions in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Act, benefiting the EU, United States, and international community. SEC. 2. FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH NORTHERN IRELAND. The President may enter into a trade agreement for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to harmonize, reduce, and eliminate trade barriers, prohibit trade barriers, and reduce US duties. No trade benefit can be extended to a country due to a trade agreement with another country. The President can enter into a trade agreement with Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to harmonize trade barriers and reduce US duties. Proclamations under the agreement cannot reduce duty rates below 5 percent or increase rates above the current levels. The trade agreement allows for duty reductions, with limitations on the aggregate reduction based on annual percentages. Duty reductions for articles not produced in the US are exempt from staging requirements. The US International Trade Commission advises the President on duty reductions. The International Trade Commission advises the President on duty reductions, including exempting articles from staging requirements. The President can round annual reductions for simplification purposes. Duty rate changes must be included in an implementing bill to take effect if not proclaimed under the trade agreement. SEC. 3 outlines the criteria for duty-free treatment of articles. SEC. 3 outlines the criteria for duty-free treatment of articles, specifying that the reduction or elimination of duty on articles imported from Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland applies only if the article is grown, produced, or manufactured in those areas. The duty-free treatment of articles imported from Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland requires that the materials produced in those areas, along with processing costs, make up at least 35 percent of the appraised value of the article at the time of entry into the United States. In determining the duty-free treatment for imported articles, up to 15 percent of the appraised value can be attributed to United States cost. Simple combining, packaging, or dilution operations that do not materially alter the article are not considered to meet the requirements. Direct costs of processing operations include labor costs. When determining duty-free treatment for imported articles, costs included are labor costs, fringe benefits, on-the-job training, engineering costs, and depreciation on machinery. Excluded costs are profit and general business expenses not directly related to the specific merchandise. The Secretary of the Treasury will prescribe regulations for duty-free treatment of imported articles, excluding expenses not related to merchandise production. Before any duty reduction is proclaimed, the US International Trade Commission must advise the President on the economic impact of providing duty-free treatment to articles from Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. Congress must be consulted before any agreements are made. Before entering into any trade agreement, the President must consult with relevant congressional committees to discuss the nature of the agreement, its relation to party obligations, and implementation details, including the need for supplemental legislation. SEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS. Implementation of trade agreements under this Act requires notification to Congress, submission of necessary law changes, and providing the final text of the agreement. The implementation of trade agreements under this Act requires submitting the final text of the agreement, along with a draft of an implementing bill if necessary, a statement of proposed administrative action, and supporting information. The supporting information includes an explanation of how the implementing bill and administrative action will impact existing law, and a statement from the President on how the agreement benefits U.S. commerce. If needed, the implementing bill must be enacted into law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The term \"qualifying area\" in this Act refers to a county contiguous to Northern Ireland experiencing severe economic deprivation as defined by reports from the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Act defines a \"qualifying area\" as a county contiguous to Northern Ireland with high unemployment rates and a history of workplace discrimination. This includes specific areas in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. The Act requires counties to comply with the MacBride Principles, which aim to increase representation of underrepresented religious groups in the workforce, provide security for minority employees, and ban provocative symbols at the workplace. The MacBride Principles require workplaces to remove political emblems, advertise job openings publicly, make special recruitment efforts for underrepresented religious groups, ensure fair layoff procedures, abolish discriminatory employment criteria based on religion, and develop training programs for all employees. The MacBride Principles mandate training programs to prepare minority employees for skilled jobs, establish procedures for recruiting and advancing minority employees, and appoint a senior management staff member to oversee employment efforts. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of principles in clauses (i) through (viii) and defines the term \"GATT 1994\" as per the Uruguay Round Agreements Act."
