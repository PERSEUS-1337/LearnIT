The \"Zero Downpayment Act of 2004\" amends the National Housing Act to allow the Secretary to insure zero-downpayment mortgages for single-family properties. The \"Zero Downpayment Act of 2004\" allows the Secretary to insure mortgages for single-family properties, including 1-family dwelling units in multifamily projects, cooperative housing corporation units, and manufactured homes meeting specified standards. Eligible mortgages must have a maximum principal obligation. The \"Zero Downpayment Act of 2004\" allows the Secretary to insure mortgages for single-family properties with a principal obligation not exceeding 100% of the property's appraised value. Mortgages under this subsection are not subject to certain loan-to-value requirements. Eligible mortgagors must meet specific criteria, including being a first-time homebuyer. The \"Zero Downpayment Act of 2004\" requires first-time homebuyers to receive counseling from an approved third party before applying for a mortgage loan. The \"Zero Downpayment Act of 2004\" mandates counseling for first-time homebuyers on homeownership options, including non-insured mortgages and low-downpayment options. Counseling is provided individually by an approved third party in person whenever possible. The mortgagor must receive counseling on the financial implications of a mortgage, including recovery details and appreciation requirements. The mortgagor must receive counseling on the financial implications of selling the property at different anniversaries of the mortgage, including real estate property management for 2- or 3-family residences. The mortgagee must offer notice of foreclosure prevention counseling availability to be eligible for insurance. The mortgagee must offer the mortgagor an optional written agreement at the time of mortgage execution, allowing notice to be provided to a housing counseling agency if the mortgagor becomes delinquent. The notice must be given when the mortgagor is 60 days delinquent on any payment. The housing counseling entity must notify the mortgagor if they are 60 days delinquent on payments, offering foreclosure prevention counseling and providing contact information for assistance. Failure to provide the optional written agreement may impact the ability to cure the delinquency. The optional written agreement required under subparagraph (A) must be corrected promptly after the mortgagor becomes 60 days delinquent on payments. Insurance cannot be terminated or penalties imposed if the failure is corrected as per this subparagraph. The Secretary may establish penalties for mortgagees failing to provide the required agreement. The mortgagee is not liable for housing counseling entity's failure to provide notice. There is no private right of action for the mortgagor. The delinquency period starts when the mortgagor misses payments and ends when payments are current. The mortgage insured under this subsection is not subject to downpayment requirements or any other cash payments for acquisition. The Secretary will review program performance and make necessary adjustments, such as altering insurance premiums and underwriting standards. The subsection (c)(2) focuses on adjusting underwriting standards and limiting mortgage insurance availability to maintain a negative credit subsidy for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. Eligibility for insurance requires evaluation of the mortgagor's credit and ability to pay using approved credit scoring systems. The Secretary may establish additional underwriting standards for multi-unit properties with 2- or 3-family residences. Mortgagees must meet criteria set by the Secretary to participate in the insurance program. Required disclosure of incremental costs is necessary for insurance eligibility. The mortgagee must provide the mortgagor with a written disclosure at the time of loan application, detailing the cost of borrowing under the insured mortgage compared to a non-insured mortgage. The disclosure must include the annual interest rate for the first 5 years of the mortgage. Upon default of an insured mortgage, the mortgagee must engage in loss mitigation actions to prevent foreclosure, as required by regulations. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress comparing default and foreclosure rates for the fiscal year. The Secretary may establish additional requirements for mortgage insurance under this subsection as needed. The aggregate number of mortgages insured under this subsection in any fiscal year cannot exceed 10 percent of the total mortgages and loans. The Secretary can establish extra requirements for mortgage insurance. The total number of mortgages insured in a fiscal year cannot surpass 10 percent of all mortgages and loans. The authority to insure mortgages may be suspended if the claim rate exceeds 3.5 percent, remaining in effect until the rate is 3.5 percent or lower. The claim rate is the ratio of claims on mortgages for 1- to 4-family residences insured under this program in the preceding 12 months. The Secretary may suspend the endorsement or insurance of mortgages if the claim rate exceeds 3.5 percent, with the suspension remaining until the rate is 3.5 percent or lower. No mortgages can be insured under this program after September 30, 2009, except for those duly executed before that date. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit reports to Congress on mortgage performance. The Secretary may implement subsection on an interim basis by issuing a rule, solicit public comments, and issue a final rule after consideration of comments. Amendments are made to mortgage insurance premiums and the General Insurance Fund."
