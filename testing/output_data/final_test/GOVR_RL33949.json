    "content": "The operation of an airport involves various activities that can impact the environment, including air and water quality, as well as aircraft noise levels affecting property values and residents' quality of life. Federal funding, such as the $354 million requested by the FAA in FY2008, can be used for projects addressing airport environmental impacts like noise abatement, water quality control, and reducing air emissions. Funds are authorized for research into new aircraft technology to reduce noise and air emissions. FAA reauthorization proposals have been passed by the House and reported by the Senate, including environment-related provisions for minimizing environmental impacts and helping airports comply with regulations. The report discusses funding for projects to minimize environmental impacts at airports, research on quieter and more fuel-efficient aircraft technology, and amendments to environmental regulations. It also provides an overview of environmental impacts related to airport operations such as noise, water, and air quality, as well as requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and proposed legislation for FAA programs. The report does not address global aviation's environmental impacts or its contribution to global warming. In the next 15 years, air travel is expected to grow significantly, leading to increased importance of airport development and expansion projects. Community concerns about airport environmental impacts may pose challenges to project completion. Airport operations involve various activities that impact the environment, especially during expansion projects. More information on global warming's connection to aviation is available in the \"For Additional Information\" section. Airport expansion projects may face delays or cancellations due to community concerns about environmental impacts. All airports, regardless of size or location, must comply with local, state, tribal, or federal environmental regulations. The anticipated growth in air travel has increased the complexity of environmental issues for airport managers. New requirements may lead to significant changes in airport operations. Potentially significant changes to airport operations include community concerns about noise, EPA regulations for aircraft and airfield deicing, oil spill prevention planning, and air pollution control directives from state and local agencies. These issues are unique to airport operations and involve compliance with noise, water quality, and air quality requirements. Aviation noise can negatively impact the quality of life and property values of surrounding communities. Despite advancements in technology and noise reduction efforts, noise from aircraft remains a significant issue due to increasing air traffic and concentration of noise at a small number of airports. Various approaches are used to address airport noise issues. Various approaches are used to address airport noise issues, with decisions made by the airport authority in accordance with state or local government requirements. Federal funding is available for mitigation measures and operational changes, with debates on how funding should be allocated between short-term strategies and research. The National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) has set noise reduction goals, but lacks funding for research programs to achieve them on schedule. Airport operations contribute to pollution through various activities like deicing, fuel storage, and maintenance. The Clean Water Act regulates activities such as fuel storage, refueling, cleaning, and maintenance at airports. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program controls pollutant discharges, including stormwater and wastewater, with all airports required to have a stormwater permit. Airports with stormwater permits may also need an NPDES wastewater permit for other wastewater discharges. Managing stormwater is challenging for airports due to their large surface area and numerous outfalls. Best management practices are used to control stormwater discharges and prevent pollution. Permit requirements can vary depending on the airport. To comply with the Clean Water Act, airport operators focus on managing deicing chemicals and preventing oil spills, which are key concerns. Deicing and anti-icing chemicals pose the greatest challenge, as they are necessary for passenger safety but can impact water quality. Factors like local climate, adjacent water bodies, and airport size influence permit requirements for controlling airport discharges. Airport deicing operations are necessary for passenger safety but can have environmental impacts if discharge controls are not in place. Discharges from deicing operations can harm aquatic life, contaminate water sources, and reduce oxygen levels in surface waters. Concerns also exist about the toxic effects of deicer solutions and unknown additives. The environmental impact of aircraft deicing additives is not fully understood. Airlines handle aircraft deicing, while airports manage airfield pavement deicing. Airports are responsible for managing resulting wastewater as outlined in stormwater permits, which can vary significantly. Some permits may restrict deicing locations, require vacuuming of deicing fluid, or allow direct discharge into water bodies. EPA notes disparities in airport permitting. The EPA is considering implementing national standards for airport deicing operations to control wastewater discharges. Effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) would provide uniform guidance for NPDES permit writers and aim to reduce deicing discharges from 21 million to 4 million gallons a year. Many airports have varying permit provisions for managing deicing chemicals, with some needing to make capital improvements to comply with new requirements. The EPA is collecting data to determine the best technology for treating and discharging deicing liquids. Airports must develop SPCC plans to store fuel onsite. EPA plans to publish a proposed rule in December 2007 and take final action by September 2009. The SPCC plan is required for facilities storing oil to prevent environmental damage from spills. It includes procedures to prevent spills, control measures like dikes or containment curbs, and countermeasures for cleanup. A primary requirement is a secondary containment system for oil storage containers. The EPA amended the SPCC Rule in response to disagreements with airport operators regarding secondary containment requirements for mobile airport refueling trucks. Airport operators argued that it was impractical to require mobile refuelers to provide secondary containment equal to the size of the tank due to the need to move to various areas of the airfield during refueling operations. The EPA amended the SPCC Rule to exempt mobile refuelers from specific containment size requirements, but they still need to comply with general secondary containment rules. Compliance date extended to October 31, 2009. Airport operators may need to install secondary containment mechanisms. Airport emissions come from aircraft, vehicles, and ground service equipment. Airport operations produce various regulated pollutants, including VOCs, CO, PM, lead, SOx, and NOx. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to regulate emissions of air pollutants and establish emission standards based on health and environmental criteria. The Clean Air Act directs the EPA to regulate emissions of air pollutants based on health and environmental criteria. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) specify allowable concentrations for pollutants, with areas classified as \"attainment,\" \"nonattainment,\" or \"maintenance.\" The aviation industry has a limited contribution to overall pollutant emissions, but individual airports can have significant impacts. Individual airports, especially large ones in urban areas, can significantly impact local pollutant levels. Airports in nonattainment or maintenance areas may need to make changes to comply with SIP provisions, especially during expansions. Since aircraft emissions are a major source, airports may need to focus on reducing emissions from ground vehicles, GSE, and energy systems. Vision 100 has measures to reduce airport ground emissions. The Vision 100 program aims to reduce airport ground emissions in nonattainment and maintenance areas through the Voluntary Airport Low Emission program (VALE). This program allows airport sponsors to use funding for low-emission vehicles, refueling stations, and other air quality improvements. Participation in VALE is voluntary for airport sponsors and state air quality agencies, with a focus on analyzing health impacts of aircraft and airport-related air toxics when conducting environmental reviews. The information on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) is crucial for environmental reviews under NEPA and at the request of local or state agencies. Ten HAPs commonly found in aircraft and GSE exhaust include lead, formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, and others. Unlike criteria air pollutants, data on emission levels, transformation, and health impacts of airport-related HAPs is limited. Environmental reviews are mandatory for airport projects receiving federal funding or requiring federal decisions. The airport authority, as the proponent of the project, is responsible for identifying environmental issues for NEPA documentation. This includes preparing an environmental assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) based on the significance of environmental impacts. The project may be categorically excluded if it has no significant environmental impact. The NEPA documentation addresses issues and analyzes alternatives for project decisions. The FAA issues a Record of Decision (ROD) for projects requiring an EIS, documenting the final decision and any required mitigation efforts. Mitigation actions may be mandated by local, state, tribal, or federal requirements. NEPA specifies the process for analyzing environmental impacts but does not mandate specific outcomes. The NEPA process involves environmental review and compliance requirements that may dictate specific outcomes, such as selecting the least environmentally harmful alternative. Mitigation measures specified in the Record of Decision (ROD) are agreed upon by airport authorities to gain local acceptance, not necessarily mandated by law. Vision 100 directed the FAA to develop an expedited environmental review process for aviation projects at congested airports, focusing on capacity enhancement, safety, and security projects. The FAA is required to complete environmental reviews for airport projects within a set timeframe established by the Secretary of Transportation. The process involves coordination between federal and state agencies, with the FAA defining the scope of the project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Order 5050.4B outlines the FAA's new NEPA policies and procedures, including streamlining requirements specified in Vision 100. The FAA proposal and bills under consideration in the Senate and House include funding for research into technology to reduce environmental impacts, grants for programs to mitigate regulated impacts, and regulatory procedures to assist airports in complying with requirements. Provisions in the bills also establish requirements to reduce noise, with H.R. 2881 including unique provisions. H.R. 2881 includes provisions to implement sustainable practices in air traffic control facilities to reduce energy use and improve environmental performance. It also seeks to modify the Air Tour Management Program to regulate commercial air tours over national park units to mitigate noise and adverse impacts. Additionally, it specifies the Congress's stance on the EU's emission trading proposal for international civil aviation. The bill proposes changes to international civil aviation, criticizing the EU directive for not working through consensus. It also authorizes increased funding for the Airport Cooperative Research Program, with a focus on research for reducing noise, air emissions, and improving water quality. Additionally, a consortium would be created to research aircraft technologies for lower energy use and emissions. The FAA proposal aims to establish a research consortium with PARTNER to develop CLEEN engine and airframe technology, targeting a 25% increase in fuel efficiency, 50% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions, 10 dB noise reduction, and exploring alternative fuels for aircraft systems. The FAA proposal includes funding for the Next Generation Air Transportation System program and a research consortium for reducing noise, emissions, and energy consumption from civilian aircraft. NASA and relevant industries will conduct research through a designated institution. The consortium, directed by S. 1300, aims to achieve performance objectives similar to the FAA proposal. Section 603 focuses on developing synthetic jet fuel from clean coal, funded by the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. H.R. 2881 authorizes funds for environmental and energy projects, including a Center of Excellence for Coal-to-Jet Research. H.R. 2881 authorizes $125 million for environmental and energy projects, $20 million for ACRP environment projects, and creates a consortium for CLEEN engine and airframe technology. It specifies funding limits and environmental responsibilities for the Next Generation Air Transportation System Joint Planning and Development Office. The Next Generation Air Transportation System Joint Planning and Development Office is directed to establish specific quantitative goals for environmental impacts, including noise pollution reduction concerns of affected communities. H.R. 2881 includes environmentally related research and development requirements, such as an interagency research initiative on the impact of aviation on climate. The bill includes provisions for a research program on space weather and aviation impacts, as well as a program to study technologies for unleaded gasoline in piston-engine aircraft. Funding is authorized for these programs for FY2008 through FY2011. The bill includes provisions for research on alternative jet fuel technology for civil aircraft, funded through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. It also provides grants for environmental mitigation pilot projects to reduce aviation impacts on noise, air quality, and water quality. The bill proposes grants for environmental mitigation pilot programs to reduce aviation impacts on noise, air quality, and water quality near airports. The federal share of project costs would be 50% up to $2.5 million, apportioned under the AIP. Provisions in the bill align with FAA proposals to amend the state block grant program, expedite NEPA requirements, and address noise compatibility program requirements. The bill proposes grants for environmental mitigation pilot programs to reduce aviation impacts near airports. It aligns with FAA proposals to amend the state block grant program, expedite NEPA requirements, and address noise compatibility program requirements. Federal environmental requirements would apply to the program, and federal agencies must consult with states during the approval process. FAA can accept funds to expedite environmental activities for airport development projects. The proposal in Section 605 of the bill would allow FAA to accept funds for hiring additional staff to conduct special environmental studies, support noise compatibility measures, and implement environmental mitigation efforts for airport projects. It also amends noise compatibility program requirements to assist airport operators with meeting environmental review requirements for flight procedures. Additionally, Section 210 of the bill is similar to Section 602. Section 210 of S. 1300 is similar to FAA's proposal regarding the state block grant program. S. 1300 includes a pilot program for states not in the block grant program. Sections 211 and 212 of S. 1300 are similar to FAA's proposal on expediting NEPA requirements. H.R. 2881 also mirrors FAA's proposal and S. 1300 on the state block grant program and NEPA requirements, with the addition of an \"aircraft departure queue management pilot program\" at five airports. H.R. 2881 includes a pilot program for aircraft departure queue management at five public-use airports to test new technologies for better air traffic flow management. It also directs a review of FAA and EPA regulatory responsibilities for engine noise and emission standards. Congress previously phased out non-Stage 3 aircraft over 75,000 pounds by 1999, allowing smaller Stage 1 and Stage 2 aircraft to continue operating. The curr_chunk discusses the disproportionate noise contribution of non-Stage 3 turbojet aircraft under 75,000 pounds at certain airports, leading to efforts to restrict their access. Section 711 of S. 1300 aims to prohibit the operation of such aircraft, with exceptions. The bill aims to address noise issues by prohibiting non-Stage 3 turbojet aircraft under 75,000 pounds, with exceptions. It also proposes an exploratory program for airport-compatible land use and expands passenger facility fee eligibility for noise projects at LAX. The funds in the section are designated for a project in the Lennox School District near LAX as part of a settlement agreement. H.R. 2881 prohibits aircraft under 75,000 pounds from operating unless they meet Stage 3 noise levels, effective after January 1, 2013. Additionally, the bill calls for a noise compatibility planning study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for LaGuardia and JFK airports. The curr_chunk discusses various reports and findings on the impacts of aviation on the environment, including recommendations from different organizations such as the General Accounting Office and the National Academy of Sciences. It provides links to resources for information on airport environmental activities and compliance processes.
