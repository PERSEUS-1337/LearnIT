    "content": "Training conditional generative latent-variable models can be challenging due to posterior collapse when the conditioning signal is strong. The proposed solution involves making the latent variables depend on the condition to prevent the model from discarding variations. This is achieved through a conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns a distribution of both the latent variables and the condition, with the latter acting as a prior on the former. Our approach involves a conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture that learns a distribution of both the latent variables and the condition, with the latter acting as a prior on the former. Experiments on human motion prediction and image captioning show the effectiveness of our approach in avoiding posterior collapse. Instructions for ICLR paper submission using L A T E X are provided in the iclr2020_conference.pdf file. The paper submission guidelines specify formatting requirements such as paper dimensions, font type, spacing, and title formatting. Authors' names should be in bold above their addresses, with the lead author listed first. Special attention should be given to instructions for figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references. The recommended paper length is 8 pages, with a strict limit of 10 pages for the main text. Additional pages can be used for citations. Authors must adhere to strict page limits for the main text, with a maximum of 10 pages. Papers exceeding 8 pages will be held to a higher standard by reviewers. Citations should follow specific guidelines using the natbib package, with references listed alphabetically in the REFERENCES section. In the REFERENCES section, list references alphabetically by authors. Use any consistent style for references. Number footnotes in the text and place them at the bottom of the page. Ensure figure captions stay with their respective figures. Consider using color figures, but ensure the paper makes sense in black/white print. The curr_chunk discusses probability distributions over discrete and continuous variables, as well as formatting guidelines for preparing PostScript or PDF files for submission. The curr_chunk provides commands for formatting PostScript or PDF files, suggests using \\includegraphics for figures, and gives tips for resolving margin and width issues in LaTeX. It also mentions the optional inclusion of author contributions and additional sections in a paper."
