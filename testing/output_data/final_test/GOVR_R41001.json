TARP allowed the Treasury to purchase up to $700 billion of troubled assets to stabilize the financial system. Oversight mechanisms like the Congressional Oversight Panel and the Special Inspector General for TARP were put in place. Treasury implemented various programs under TARP, including providing capital to banks and guaranteeing asset pools. Treasury implemented various programs under TARP, including providing capital to banks, guaranteeing asset pools, intervening on behalf of U.S. automobile manufacturers, and supporting a Federal Reserve lending facility. As of November 2009, $476 billion had been committed under signed contracts out of the planned $550 billion in TARP expenditures. Treasury has no current plans to use $150 billion of the authorized funds. Repayments have already begun to reduce the outstanding amount under TARP. The amount outstanding under TARP has started to decrease from its peak, with Treasury having the flexibility to change its planned use of available funds. Some policymakers suggest reallocating TARP funds for new initiatives, such as redirecting billions of dollars to offset costs in various programs like the Hope for Homeowners Program and infrastructure spending. The Treasury Secretary has legal authority to purchase $700 billion of assets under TARP, with no unused money that can be redirected towards new policy proposals. TARP expenditures are financed from general revenues and additional borrowing when the budget is in deficit. The Treasury Secretary can purchase up to $700 billion in troubled assets under TARP, funded by federal debt issuance. The future deficit projections depend on the Secretary's plans to increase TARP size and associated costs. Proceeds from asset sales must return to the general fund. The Treasury Secretary can purchase up to $700 billion in troubled assets under TARP, funded by federal debt issuance. Repaid TARP funds could be \"reused\" by Treasury to purchase additional assets, increasing Treasury's capacity. Funds from repayment of loan principal or repurchase of assets have the same effect on the budget deficit as reducing TARP's authorized limit. Payments beyond the initial outlay, such as dividends and interest, would not be considered a repayment of TARP funds. Under Title I, dividends and interest payments on TARP loans do not allow for the purchase of additional assets under TARP. These revenues go to the general fund to reduce the deficit and cannot be redirected to fund other proposals without increasing the deficit. Redirecting TARP funds for other uses would be considered double counting and rely on a reduction in the Treasury Secretary's purchasing authority under TARP. The impact on the budget deficit depends on whether the redirected authority leads to future spending under its new use. Reducing TARP authority by less than $150 billion would not force asset sales, thus not increasing Treasury revenues. Any new proposal using TARP funds would be deficit financed if authority is reduced by less than $150 billion. The impact on the budget deficit depends on future spending under the new use of redirected TARP funds. The proposal to reduce TARP authority by less than $150 billion would impact the budget deficit depending on future spending with redirected funds. The Congressional Budget Office assumed TARP would reach $700 billion, but later modified the baseline in August 2009. The Congressional Budget Office assumed TARP would reach $700 billion, but later modified the baseline in August 2009 to peak at $600 billion. Reducing TARP by up to $100 billion would not impact future deficit projections, as the baseline already accounted for the redirected funds. Redirecting TARP funds to finance a new proposal would increase the deficit. The 2009 budget resolution instructed CBO to use the March baseline for scoring purposes. A bill financed by redirecting TARP funds would be scored as offsetting a decline in federal spending, as the baseline assumed all $700 billion of TARP authority would be used. The cost of asset purchases under TARP is determined by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, with CBO reporting the government's net cost instead of gross cash disbursements. The government's net cost for asset purchases under TARP is calculated as the purchase cost minus the estimated market value of the assets, using present value calculations with a discount factor reflecting risk. This subsidy rate can be determined by dividing the net cost by the government's initial expenditures. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates subsidy rates for different TARP programs, with a 50% rate assumed for future spending. A reduction in TARP authority only reduces the budget deficit by 50 cents on the dollar. CBO projected TARP to increase the budget deficit by $133 billion in 2009 for expenditures already made, and by $80 billion in 2010 and $28 billion between 2011 and 2013 for future expenditures."
