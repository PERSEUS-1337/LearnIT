Title 23, United States Code, amended to include a High Risk Rural Roads Safety Program. The program aims to improve safety on high-risk rural roads through various projects like road safety audits, intersection improvements, rumble strip installations, pedestrian/bicyclist safety enhancements, and railway-highway crossing safety construction. The curr_chunk describes various safety features that can be implemented to improve highway safety, including railway-highway crossing safety, traffic calming features, highway signage improvements, priority control systems for emergency vehicles, installation of guardrails and barriers, and retrofitting structures to reduce accidents. The curr_chunk outlines measures to reduce accidents involving vehicles and wildlife, including installation of signs, skid-resistant surfaces, edge drop-off improvements, pavement widening, obstacle elimination, systemic safety infrastructure improvements, and traffic enforcement in work zones. The Secretary is responsible for apportioning funds annually for these safety initiatives. The Secretary will allocate appropriated funds among states based on the total rural lane miles for major collectors, minor collectors, and local roads, with each category receiving 25 percent of the total allocation. The Federal government will provide 90 percent of the funding for high-risk rural road projects, with States having the option to use a small percentage of allocated funds for road assessment programs. The Federal government will provide funding for high-risk rural road projects, with States having the option to use a percentage of allocated funds for a road assessment program to improve road safety through various activities like risk mapping, monitoring safety performance, and identifying eligible roads for assistance. The Secretary will annually report progress on reducing fatalities and injuries on high-risk rural roads where projects were carried out. High risk rural roads are defined as rural roads with a significant likelihood of accidents resulting in fatalities or incapacitating injuries. The authorization of appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for high-risk rural roads with increased accident risks is $400,000,000 annually from 2012 to 2017. These funds are non-transferrable and remain available until expended. Section 148 of title 23, United States Code is amended by removing subsection (f) and redesignating subsections (g) and (h) as subsections (f) and (g) respectively. Additionally, a new item \"150. High risk rural roads safety program\" is added to the analysis for chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code."
