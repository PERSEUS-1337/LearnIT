    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Assisted Living Pilot Program for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Extension Act\". Since 2001, over 265,000 members of the Armed Forces have suffered traumatic brain injuries, with more than 26,000 experiencing moderate or severe head wounds. Advances in medicine have saved soldiers with head injuries that would have been fatal in past conflicts. The Department of Veterans Affairs has a pilot program to provide assisted living services to enhance the rehabilitation, quality of life, and community integration of eligible veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has provided comprehensive care to veterans with moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries since 2008. The pilot program has successfully rehabilitated many veterans with difficult-to-treat injuries, and there are currently no alternatives offered by the VA that replicate the program's effectiveness. The pilot program provided comprehensive rehabilitative care in a residential setting, with a significant positive impact on veterans' long-term recovery. Extension and modification of pilot program on assisted living services for veterans with traumatic brain injury. Extension and modification of the pilot program on assisted living services for veterans with traumatic brain injury includes extending the program from five to eight years and selecting locations for the program, with at least one location in each health care region containing a polytrauma center. The Assisted Living Pilot Program for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury is extended for eight years, with reports required annually until 2018. The reports must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs and include specific elements. The report on the Assisted Living Pilot Program for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury must include the number of participants and completions, satisfaction levels, interim findings, and recommendations by the Secretary. The final report on the pilot program for veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs, including a description of the program, assessment of its impact on rehabilitation and community reintegration. The pilot program for veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury will include recommendations for improving community reintegration, and definitions will be modified to emphasize community-based brain injury residential rehabilitative care services. The legislation amends the definition of \"assisted living\" to \"community-based brain injury rehabilitative care\" and includes eligibility criteria for veterans with traumatic brain injuries classified as complex-mild to severe. The legislation authorizes $46,000,000 for a pilot program for veterans with traumatic brain injuries classified as complex-mild to severe. The amendments made by this section will take effect on October 1, 2014."
