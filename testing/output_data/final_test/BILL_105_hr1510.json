    "content": "The \"Television Improvement Act of 1997\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are also included in the legislation. Congress finds that television is a pervasive presence in American homes, with the average household having 2.5 televisions and a TV being on for 7 hours daily. Children spend an average of 21 hours per week watching TV, which can influence their perceptions and behaviors. The influence of television, especially on children, can be harmful to their development. Research shows a strong link between children's exposure to televised violence and behavioral issues. Numerous studies confirm that children who regularly watch violent TV programs are more likely to display aggressive behavior and become desensitized to real-life violence. Additionally, sexual content on television can also have a significant impact on children. Research suggests that heavy exposure to programming with strong sexual content can lead to early sexual activity among teenagers. The National Association of Broadcasters adhered to a code of conduct emphasizing the careful selection of program subjects to responsibly use television's influence. Broadcasters have a special responsibility towards children, ensuring programs cater to their interests and contribute to their balanced development. Violence, whether physical or psychological, should be carefully handled in programming. (C) Violence, physical or psychological, should be portrayed responsibly in programs, showing the consequences to victims and perpetrators without excessive or gratuitous details. (D) Marriage, family, and material with sexual content should be treated sensitively and not exploitatively. (E) Broadcasters must consider the family viewing atmosphere and avoid graphic portrayal of sexual acts. The NAB abandoned its code of conduct in 1983 after legal challenges, but its programming standards were never found to violate antitrust laws. Since then, broadcast and cable television programming standards have evolved. The decline in programming standards on broadcast and cable television has led to an increase in public concern about the impact on children and society. More than 80 percent of Americans are worried about the graphic nature of content and the glorification of criminal behavior. The television industry has made some efforts to address these concerns at the urging of Congress. The television industry responded to public concerns by adopting voluntary guidelines to limit violence in programming, conducting independent studies on violent content, and implementing a rating system for harmful or inappropriate content for children. Despite these efforts, many Americans, especially parents, remain upset about the impact of television on children. Americans, especially parents with young children, are frustrated with the declining TV standards, industry's lack of self-regulation, and the negative impact of television on children and American values. In 1993, the Department of Justice ruled that voluntary programming guidelines by the TV industry would not violate antitrust laws and could benefit advertisers and viewers. The Children's Television Act of 1990 requires U.S. television broadcasters to provide educational and informational programming for children. However, independent analyses show that broadcasters have not met these obligations since the Act was enacted. The Children's Television Act of 1990 requires U.S. television broadcasters to provide educational and informational programming for children, but broadcasters have not met these obligations. SEC. 3 states the purpose of the Act. The Children's Television Act of 1990 aims to allow the television industry to collaborate in addressing concerns about harmful programming for children by creating voluntary guidelines similar to the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters. The Act seeks to reduce negative impacts on children's development and promote educational programming. The Children's Television Act of 1990 does not grant the Federal Government any new authority to restrict television content beyond existing laws. SEC. 4. EXEMPTION OF VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ON GUIDELINES FOR TELECAST MATERIAL FROM APPLICABILITY OF ANTITRUST LAWS. Exemption from antitrust laws for joint development of voluntary guidelines in the television industry to promote positive content and restrict negative material, with limitations on boycotts and advertising agreements. Exemption from antitrust laws for joint development of voluntary guidelines in the television industry, including restrictions on advertising and program interruptions. Definitions include antitrust laws and persons in the television industry. The curr_chunk defines \"telecast\" as any program broadcast by a television station or transmitted by a cable system. It involves various organizations in the television industry."
