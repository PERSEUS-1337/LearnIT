    "content": "The people of California enact the following. A new Affordable Housing Special Beneficiary District is established in Division 24 of the Health and Safety Code. It defines affordable housing as dwellings for low to extremely low-income households and creates a beneficiary district to receive rejected property tax revenues for promoting affordable housing. (c) \"Distributions of property tax revenues\" refer to property tax revenues a city or county would receive under Section 34170. Upon receiving a finding of completion, a successor entity establishes an affordable housing special beneficiary district within its jurisdiction. A beneficiary district will cease to exist either 90 days after approval to dissolve by the Department of Finance or on the 20th anniversary of receiving a completion finding. Once ceased, the district loses authority to conduct business, and funds transfer to the city or county rejecting property tax revenue distributions. Board members' terms expire when the district ceases to exist. Any legal rights of the beneficiary district upon dissolution, including repayment of loans, transfer to the city or county rejecting property tax revenue. The board of a beneficiary district consists of three city council or board of supervisors members and the treasurer of the city or county forming the redevelopment agency. The board of a beneficiary district consists of three city council or board of supervisors members, the treasurer of the city or county forming the redevelopment agency, and one member of the public appointed by the city council or county board of supervisors. The board elects a chairperson and each member serves a four-year term without compensation. Vacancies are filled for a new four-year term. Each member of the beneficiary district board serves without compensation. A city or county can reject property tax revenue distributions as per Section 34191.45. Once rejected, the city or county loses control over the revenue, which is then transferred to the beneficiary district. This does not apply to entities that formed a redevelopment agency. A beneficiary district must use funds for affordable housing development, which can be done through issuing bonds or providing financial assistance like loans and grants. A beneficiary district must comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act and the California Public Records Act. The board can take actions to promote financing for affordable housing within its boundaries, but cannot undertake obligations that extend beyond its existence, such as issuing bonds with repayment obligations after its cessation. When a beneficiary district ceases to exist, its public records become property of the city or county that rejected its tax revenues."
