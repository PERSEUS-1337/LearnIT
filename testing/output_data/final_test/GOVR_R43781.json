It establishes the State Department position of United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. The Special Coordinator's main duty is to coordinate U.S. government policies, programs, and projects concerning Tibet. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 mandates various U.S. government assistance programs for Tibetan communities in China, educational and cultural exchanges, broadcasting into Tibet, refugee assistance, scholarships, and democracy programs. The Act also requires the promotion of Tibet's distinct identity and human rights, as well as encouraging dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama for a negotiated agreement on Tibet. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 mandates U.S. government assistance programs for Tibetan communities in China, promoting Tibet's identity and human rights, and encouraging dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama for a negotiated agreement on Tibet. The Act also requires the release of political and religious prisoners in Tibet, access for humanitarian organizations, medical parole for ill prisoners, and the establishment of an office in Lhasa to monitor developments. These provisions have caused tension in U.S.-China relations. China accuses the U.S. Congress of supporting challenges to Chinese rule in Tibet, particularly by showing consistent support for the Dalai Lama. In response, China urges Congress to stop interfering in Tibet-related affairs and to promote friendship between the two countries. The report provides background on the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 and discusses recent bills seeking to update it. Three bills have passed the House, but none were acted on by the Senate. The report concludes with questions for Congress to consider if updating the TPA. The Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) established by China in 1965 covers just under half of historical Tibet, with 2.7 million ethnic Tibetans out of a total of 6 million in China. Tibetan exile groups consider historical Tibet to be much larger, including the TAR, 10 Tibetan autonomous prefectures, two Tibetan autonomous counties in other provinces, and part of Qinghai Province, where approximately 3 million ethnic Tibetans reside. In 2008, representatives of the 14th Dalai Lama submitted a proposal to Beijing for a single autonomous administrative unit for Tibetans living in designated areas outside the TAR. Beijing rejected the proposal, calling the idea of a \"Greater Tibet\" sheer fantasy in a 2015 White Paper on Tibet. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011, referred to Tibetan areas in Chinese provinces outside the TAR, broadening the definition of \"Tibet\" but leaving ambiguity about its political status. In autonomous areas of China, Han Chinese usually lead the local Communist Party Committee. In China, Han Chinese lead the local Communist Party Committee, while ethnic minority officials head the government. The current Party Secretary of the TAR is Chen Quanguo, an ethnic Han Chinese, and the Chairman of the TAR People's Government is Lobsang Gyaltsen, an ethnic Tibetan. The Chinese Communist Party established the PRC in 1949 and sent the PLA into eastern Tibet in 1950. In 1951, a 17-point agreement was signed with Tibet, but after a failed uprising in 1959, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet. In 1959, after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet and settled in Dharamsala, India. He leads the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism and established the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in exile. The CTA operates \"foreign missions\" in 11 cities worldwide. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) in exile, based in Dharamsala, India, represents the Tibetan exile community. The U.S. government does not recognize Tibet as an independent state and does not have official diplomatic relations with the CTA. In 2011, the Dalai Lama devolved political leadership to the head of the Kashag, Dr. Lobsang Sangay, who was elected as Sikyong. Sangay's term expires in 2016, and a new election process is scheduled for 2015-2016. The Tibetan exile community has extended the Dalai Lama's leadership role as the symbol of Tibetan identity and unity. The demographic survey in 2009 showed a Tibetan diaspora of 128,000, with the majority in India and smaller numbers in Nepal, Bhutan, and other countries. The State Department estimates 110,000 Tibetan refugees in India and 15,000 to 20,000 in Nepal, including new arrivals from Tibet. The Tibetan exile community, led by the 14th Dalai Lama, faces uncertainty over the future of Tibet and the exile movement after his death. The Chinese government aims to control the reincarnation process for the 15th Dalai Lama, citing its own regulations on religious affairs. Beijing's insistence on governing the process under Chinese law disregards Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The Dalai Lama has asserted his authority over the reincarnation process, stating that he may choose not to be reincarnated at all to thwart China's plans. He also mentioned that he will re-evaluate the continuation of the Dalai Lama institution when he is around ninety years old. The Chinese government asserts control over the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, stating that the title is conferred by Beijing. The U.S. government has criticized China's involvement in reincarnation matters. In June 2015, Under Secretary of State Sarah Sewall emphasized that the decision on the next Dalai Lama should be made by the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders, and the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama's relationships with Members of Congress since his first visit to the United States in 1979 have increased congressional interest in Tibet. In 1985, 91 Members of Congress called on China to engage in direct talks with the Dalai Lama. In 1986, Congress urged China to engage in direct talks with the Dalai Lama and recognized Tibet as separate from China. The Dalai Lama denounced China's occupation of Tibet in 1987 and presented a five-point peace plan. The Dalai Lama called for an end to Chinese population transfer into Tibet, respect for human rights, restoration of Tibet's environment, and negotiations on Tibet's future status. His speech on Capitol Hill led to pro-independence protests in Lhasa. Chinese police fired on Tibetan demonstrators in October 1987, resulting in casualties. The unrest was blamed on the Dalai Lama's political activities. The U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus passed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 with provisions related to Tibet inspired by events in September and October. President Ronald Reagan signed it into law on December 22, 1987, including statements on the treatment of Tibetan people and urging China to resolve human rights issues in Tibet. The United States urged China to engage in dialogue with the Dalai Lama on Tibet's future. The legislation earmarked funds to assist Tibetan refugees and provided scholarships for study in the United States. Congressional support for Tibet and the Dalai Lama increased after events in 1989. After major protests in Tibet in 1989, Chinese authorities imposed martial law. The Chinese military fired on unarmed protestors in Beijing. The Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1989. Congressional scrutiny of China's human rights record increased in the 1990s, leading to the establishment of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China in 2000. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China was established in 2000 to monitor China's human rights compliance and compile lists of those imprisoned for civil and political rights in Tibet. Congress has passed multiple laws and resolutions related to Tibet since then, with the Dalai Lama and his successor regularly visiting Congress. The House and Senate passed resolutions addressing Tibetan grievances and the earthquake in Nepal. Pending legislation in Congress includes acts related to Tibet such as the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act and the Tibetan Refugee Assistance Act of 2015. The U.S. Congress has legislated inconsistently on Tibet's political status, sometimes treating it as an \"occupied country\" and other times accepting it as part of China, leading to suspicion among Chinese officials. The U.S. Congress has shown inconsistency in its stance on Tibet's political status, sometimes treating it as separate from China, while the executive branch considers Tibet as part of China. This tension was highlighted in 1986 when Congress listed Tibet separately in a law. In 1986, the Export-Import Bank Act Amendments listed Tibet separately from China, barring financing to both as \"Marxist-Leninist countries.\" President Reagan considered Tibet's inclusion as a separate country a technical oversight. In 1989, the International Development and Finance Act again treated Tibet separately, allowing for a waiver on financing if China showed progress in political reform. In addition to multiple resolutions, public laws have taken the position that Tibet is a separate country from China. This includes the designation of May 13, 1990, as the \"National Day in Support of Freedom and Human Rights in China and Tibet\" and the declaration in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act that Congress considers Tibet \"an occupied country.\" Tibet, incorporated into Chinese provinces, is considered an occupied country under international law. The Dalai Lama and Tibetan Government in exile are recognized as Tibet's true representatives. Tibet has a distinct national, cultural, and religious identity separate from China. US declarations have recognized Tibet's right to self-determination and the illegality of China's occupation. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act reinforces these positions. The US Congress passed legislation titled \"Reporting Requirements on Occupied Tibet\" which emphasizes establishing a dialogue with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile. It also calls for separate reports on Tibet in country-by-country reports and authorizes grants for Radio Free Asia broadcasts to China and Tibet. The US Congress passed legislation authorizing funds for Tibetan refugees who fled Chinese-occupied Tibet and activities to support democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in China, Hong Kong, and Tibet. Some public laws imply congressional acceptance of Tibet as part of China. Public laws related to China include the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (P.L. 101-246) which states that sanctions on China will continue unless political reform is made, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 (P.L. 106-113) mentioning Tibet and Xinjiang as minority areas, and the Kentucky National Forest Land Transfer Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-429) providing funds for NGOs to support Tibetan communities in China. Public laws have appropriated funds to support NGOs in Tibetan communities in China, including the Fourteenth Dalai Lama Congressional Gold Medal Act. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated funds to establish a U.S. Consulate in Lhasa, Tibet. The legislation suggests that a consulate in Tibet would be part of the U.S. mission to China, requiring China's consent due to sovereignty over Tibet. Congress has allocated funds for Tibetan communities in China and earmarked appropriations for Tibetans. The legislation allocated funds for Tibetan communities in China, specifying that ESF funds should support NGOs preserving cultural traditions and promoting sustainable development in Tibetan communities. The requirement for NGOs to be located outside China was removed in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) manages provision of support for Tibetan communities in China, focusing on social and economic services, private sector competitiveness, environment, and economic opportunity. Congress earmarked ESF assistance for Tibetan communities in India and Nepal, with funds allocated for programs to promote and preserve Tibetan culture. Assistance is provided for programs to promote and preserve Tibetan culture and support Tibetan communities in India and Nepal. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) manages this support from its India office. Retaining this funding is a priority for the Central Tibetan Administration. Congress has mandated educational and cultural exchange programs between the U.S. and Tibet, including training opportunities, in various legislative acts. The Ngawang Choephel Exchange Program was renamed by Congress to the Ngwang Choephel Fellows Program in honor of an Indian Tibetan ethnomusicologist. The program, managed by the State Department, aims to preserve cultural traditions, enhance sustainable development, expand economic opportunities, and support environmental conservation within Tibetan communities in China. In 1990, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act authorized Radio Free Asia (RFA) broadcasts to countries including China and Tibet. Subsequent legislation in 1994 and 1998 emphasized directing funds towards broadcasting to China and Tibet in appropriate languages. Congress also required the Secretary of State to assess the needs of displaced Tibetans compared to other refugees worldwide in 1988 and 1989. Funds authorized for Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal, managed by State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, implemented by the Tibet Fund with ties to the Dalai Lama and Central Tibetan Administration. Coordination with UNHCR and host governments for humanitarian assistance. The United Nations High Commission on Refugees, State Department, and host governments provide assistance for Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal, focusing on health, education, livelihoods, and long-term sustainability. In 2009, $2.3 million was recommended for revitalization of refugee communities in India, Nepal, and Bhutan, with a focus on workforce development and organic agriculture, leading to the establishment of the USAID-supported Tibet Education Project. The USAID-supported Tibet Education Project aimed to improve educational opportunities for Tibetan students in India and Nepal. The project, active from FY2012 to FY2015, was awarded to the Tibet Fund in collaboration with various organizations. Congress initially provided 15 scholarships annually in FY1988, increasing to 30 in FY1990 and 1991. Scholarship recipients were required to be active in preserving Tibet's culture, religion, and language. The scholarship program, managed by the State Department's Office of Academic Exchanges, is for Tibetan refugees in Bhutan, India, and Nepal studying for master's degrees in the US. It is implemented through a cooperative agreement with the Tibet Fund and supported by NED. Notable alumni include Lobsang Sangay, the political leader of the CTA in India. In FY2014, NED supported 21 groups working on human rights and democracy in Tibet. Senator Feinstein and Representative Lantos introduced the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001, later incorporated into the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY2003. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, signed into law by President George W. Bush, included provisions related to Tibet. Despite the President's signing statement asserting the right not to implement certain provisions, the Law Library of Congress clarified that signed laws remain in effect regardless of the President's statements. President George W. Bush signed the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 but objected to certain provisions that interfered with the presidency's foreign affairs functions. Despite his signing statement, the Law Library of Congress clarified that the signed laws remain in effect. Bush declared some sections as merely \"advisory\" and expressed concerns about provisions directing negotiations with foreign entities. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 signed by President George W. Bush included provisions that interfered with the President's foreign affairs authority. Bush objected to certain sections directing negotiations with foreign entities, asserting his constitutional authority in conducting foreign affairs. Additionally, he claimed the right to withhold information required by specific sections of the Act. President Bush objected to provisions in the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 that interfered with his foreign affairs authority. He stated that the executive branch would interpret certain sections in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority to withhold information that could impact foreign relations, national security, or the Executive's duties. Bush also emphasized that his approval of the Act did not signify adoption of its policy statements as U.S. foreign policy, considering them advisory. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 mandates the maintenance of a U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues within the Department of State, with the objective of promoting dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. The Special Coordinator has six duties, including coordinating U.S. policies on Tibet and advocating for the protection of Tibetan identity and human rights. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 mandates a U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. Congress has been considering establishing a \"United States Special Envoy for Tibet\" since 1994, with provisions for ambassadorial rank and promoting negotiations with the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 mandates a U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. Despite opposition from the Clinton Administration, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appointed Gregory B. Craig as the \"Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues\" without ambassadorial rank in 1997. This appointment signaled closer U.S. ties with China were not at the expense of U.S. relations with Tibet. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 mandated a U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. Five State Department officials have served as Special Coordinators, with the last three also holding the position of Under Secretary of State. The portfolio of the Under Secretary position has expanded over time. The position of U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues was initially created under the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002. Over time, the role evolved to include broader responsibilities under different titles such as Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs, Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, and the current Special Coordinator, Sarah Sewall. The main objective of the Special Coordinator is to facilitate dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives. The U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, currently held by Sarah Sewall, coordinates U.S. Government policies and programs concerning Tibet. This includes programs promoting cultural traditions, sustainable development, economic opportunities, environmental conservation, and support for Tibetan communities inside Tibet. The U.S. Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Sarah Sewall, coordinates U.S. government policies and programs related to Tibet, including health care, education, and livelihoods for Tibetan communities. The office also coordinates U.S. government statements on Tibet, such as Secretary of State John Kerry's birthday wishes to the Dalai Lama. The Special Coordinator promotes the protection of Tibet's religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity, and advocates for improved human rights. Special Coordinator Sewall has raised human rights issues in various public settings, including at the U.N. Human Rights Council, a State Department reception for Tibetan New Year, a screening of a film by a Tibetan political prisoner, a hearing on international religious freedom, and an event commemorating China's Tiananmen Square protests. Maria Otero, during her tenure as Special Coordinator, addressed environmental issues in various public formats and settings, including congressional testimony, remarks at the United Nations Human Rights Council, and hosting a Tibet Environmental Forum in 2011. She also discussed Himalayan glacial melt and Tibet at a forum she hosted in 2012. As the United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Otero advocated for State Department actions related to Tibet, including honoring Tsering Woeser with an award and highlighting the case of Dhondup Wangchen, a Tibetan filmmaker imprisoned in China. Sec. 621(d)(3) emphasized maintaining contact with Tibetan leaders. Special Coordinator Sewall maintains close contact with Tibetan leaders, including the Dalai Lama and the Sikyong of the Central Tibetan Administration. She has visited Tibetan refugees in Nepal and India multiple times, meeting with the Dalai Lama on several occasions. Otero, as Special Coordinator, met with the Dalai Lama multiple times and visited Tibetan refugee settlements in India and Nepal. She also visited Bhutan, becoming the most senior Obama Administration official to do so. China has never allowed Special Coordinators to travel to Tibetan areas due to restrictions on foreigners. Beijing restricts travel to Tibetan areas for all foreigners and does not recognize the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. Senior staff from the Office of the Special Coordinator have visited Tibetan areas in China. Sewall and Otero have discussed Tibet in congressional hearings and testimonies. Special Coordinator Sewall, a current Commissioner of the CECC, did not testify at a 2011 House Committee hearing on the Tibetan Policy Act. Sec. 621(d)(5) calls for efforts to establish contacts for a negotiated solution for Tibet. The TPA does not address contacts. The Special Coordinators have engaged with foreign governments and multilateral settings to promote dialogue for a negotiated settlement for Tibet, protect Tibet's identity, advocate for human rights, and address humanitarian conditions for Tibetan refugees in South Asia. The Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues has engaged with foreign governments and multilateral settings to address human rights conditions in Tibet. Congress provided $1 million for the office in FY2014, which currently has two senior staff members. Some suggest that the responsibility for addressing Tibetan issues should lie with the President or Secretary of State, rather than the Special Coordinator. The Tibetan Policy Act (TPA) focuses on encouraging dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives. Despite nine rounds of talks between 2002 and 2010, no agreement was reached, and talks have been stalled since. The Dalai Lama's age and changes in his role in the Tibetan exile movement may impact future dialogue. The Dalai Lama transferred political leadership of the exile movement to the elected head of the Central Tibetan Administration. His lead envoys for dialogue, Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen, resigned due to the deteriorating situation in Tibetan areas and lack of response from China. Formal contact between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama resumed in 2002 after nine years, leading to eight rounds of dialogue. The Dalai Lama's envoys held nine rounds of dialogue with China from 2002 to 2010, seeking a solution to the Tibetan issue. The envoys proposed \"genuine autonomy\" for Tibetan districts within China, known as the \"Middle Way.\" The Dalai Lama's envoys proposed \"genuine autonomy\" for Tibetan districts within China, with a single autonomous government responsible for internal public order and security, ensuring freedom of religion and protecting the Tibetan language. The proposal does not challenge the leadership of the Communist Party or the socialist system of China. However, Chinese officials dismissed it as a demand for \"half independence.\" In August 2014, Chinese officials were in talks with the Dalai Lama's envoys about his possible return from exile. The discussions focused on his future, not Tibet's status. The Dalai Lama confirmed informal talks with retired Chinese military officials and business leaders in October 2014 regarding his return. The condition for return included accepting Tibet and Taiwan as part of China and giving up separatist efforts. In October 2014, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed the idea of the Dalai Lama's return to Tibet, stating he should give up his position on splitting China. Presidents, Secretaries of State, and Special Coordinators for Tibetan Affairs have advocated for dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama. President Obama expressed support for direct dialogue in his meetings with the Dalai Lama in 2010, 2011, and 2014. The White House emphasized the importance of direct dialogue to resolve differences between China and Tibet, with the Dalai Lama expressing his desire for dialogue and not seeking independence for Tibet. President Obama and President George W. Bush also supported dialogue for the preservation of Tibetan culture and identity. The White House emphasized the importance of direct dialogue between China and Tibet, with the Dalai Lama expressing his desire for dialogue and not seeking independence for Tibet. President Obama and President George W. Bush also supported dialogue for the preservation of Tibetan culture and identity. The Administration reports annually to Congress on efforts to promote dialogue, as mandated by the Tibetan Policy Act (TPA). The TPA requires the President to submit a report on steps taken to encourage dialogue between the PRC and the Dalai Lama, focusing solely on the dialogue process. The annual Report on Tibet Negotiations, drafted by the Office of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, has had limited discussion on the implementation of some provisions of the Tibetan Policy Act since 2011. Both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations have provided Congress with these reports, with some being made public on the State Department website. The TPA does not specify if the reports should be public, only stating that the President must transmit them to congressional committees. The U.S. government did not publicly post many reports on Tibet from 2009-2013, making it difficult to assess if they were delivered to Congress by the deadline. Some reports were posted on the International Campaign for Tibet website, with varying transmission dates. The 2014 Report on Tibet Negotiations was transmitted late to Congress and not posted until April 2015. The 2015 Report on Tibet Negotiations has not been transmitted to Congress yet. The United States continues to encourage direct discussions between China and the Dalai Lama without preconditions. There has been no dialogue since early 2010, and talks prior to that did not yield concrete results. Tibet must be included as a separate section in relevant reports according to the TPA. The Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) require reports to include discussions on the status of Sino-Tibetan negotiations and measures to safeguard Tibet's cultural identity. The United States supports economic development, cultural preservation, healthcare, and education in Tibet. The United States supports economic development, cultural preservation, healthcare, and education in Tibet by using its voice and vote to assist Tibetans in becoming self-sufficient. Projects in Tibet must align with the \"Tibet Project Principles\" to receive support from international financial institutions, NGOs, the Export-Import Bank, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. NGOs, the Export-Import Bank, and U.S. TDA should conduct thorough assessments of Tibetan needs through field visits and interviews, prioritize cultural and environmental impact assessments, promote self-sufficiency and accountability, respect Tibetan culture and knowledge, monitor projects on-site, use Tibetan as the working language, and avoid incentivizing migration or ownership transfer. President Bush identified Section 616 of the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 as \"advisory\" due to concerns about interfering with his constitutional authorities in foreign affairs. Multilateral and U.S. institutions covered by this section have not pursued projects in Tibet, as indicated by current and former employees. The World Bank and other international financial institutions have avoided projects in Tibet due to concerns about the Tibetan Policy Act. In 1999 and 2000, the World Bank faced controversy over a proposed project in Tibetan areas of China, leading them to ultimately choose not to support it. Despite the TPA's impact on international projects in Tibet, Section 616 of the TPA continues to influence decision-making. Appropriations bills in every Congress since the 108th Congress have directed the Secretary of the Treasury to support projects in Tibet that meet specific principles, including not encouraging migration of non-Tibetans, promoting self-sufficiency, and respecting Tibetan culture. (See P.L. 108-199, P.L. 108-447, P.L. 109-102, P.L. 110-161, P.L. 111-8, P.L. 111-117, P.L. 112-74, P.L. 113-76) The act directs the President and Secretary of State to request the release of political and religious prisoners in Tibet, ensure access for humanitarian organizations, and seek medical parole for ill Tibetan prisoners. President Obama and Secretary Kerry have discussed Tibet with Chinese officials, expressing U.S. concerns about human rights in Tibetan areas. The U.S. government officials have raised concerns about human rights in Tibetan areas, advocating for the release of political and religious prisoners and access for international humanitarian organizations. Some Tibetans have been released on medical parole, and China accepted a visit from a U.N. Commission on Human Rights Working Group in 2004. The itinerary included visits to a prison and a detention center in Lhasa, Tibet, where the group met Tibetan prisoner Phuntsok Wang. In 2005, China allowed a visit from the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, who interviewed prisoners in Lhasa. Since then, no U.N. delegation has been permitted to visit Tibetan prisons. In 2013, Austria, Slovakia, and Switzerland recommended China to allow a visit by the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, as the last visit was in 1998. The U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights and special rapporteurs have been recommended to visit Tibetan and Uighur areas in China. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China maintains a Political Prisoner Database with records of nearly 4,000 ethnic Tibetan political prisoners. As of July 2015, 633 ethnic Tibetans were detained or imprisoned on political charges. The U.S. has shown strong interest in monitoring political, economic, and cultural developments in Tibet. Congress passed laws requiring the establishment of a U.S. Information Agency office and a U.S. Consulate in Lhasa, Tibet. The Department of State was instructed not to open a consular post in the U.S. by China until certain conditions were met. The U.S. has passed laws urging the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa, Tibet, to monitor political, economic, and cultural developments, and provide consular protection and citizen services. The U.S. has passed laws urging the establishment of a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet, to monitor developments and provide citizen services. Currently, U.S. diplomats face challenges accessing Tibetan areas without a consulate in Lhasa. The U.S. has faced restrictions on accessing Tibet, hindering consular services for American citizens. China delayed consular access during an emergency in 2013, violating international agreements. The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2015 calls for China to fulfill its obligations. The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2015 highlights the challenges faced by the U.S. in accessing Tibet, with limited consular visits approved by China. Requests for consulate establishment in Lhasa have been consistently denied, hindering diplomatic efforts. India is also seeking to open a consulate in Lhasa, but China has clarified that no additional foreign diplomatic presence will be allowed in Tibet. The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu has a senior political officer as the \"Tibet watcher\" who receives Tibetan language training. The State Department offers Tibetan-language instruction for Foreign Service officers. Section 620(a) of the TPA requires the U.S. Ambassador to the PRC to seek the 11th Panchen Lama and ensure his well-being, while also requesting China to release him for religious studies. Section 620(b) calls for the cessation of Chinese interference in Tibetan religious affairs. The Panchen Lama is the second-most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama. Gedun Choekyi Nyima was recognized as the 11th reincarnation by the Dalai Lama in 1995. The 11th Panchen Lama, recognized by the Dalai Lama in 1995, has been missing since then. The Chinese government rejected his selection and appointed a different child, Gyaltsen Norbu. Gedun Choekyi Nyima, now 25 years old, has not been seen or heard from, and his whereabouts are unknown. The U.S. Ambassador has requested to meet with him, but Chinese interference in Tibetan religious affairs has increased. Chinese authorities have issued regulations controlling Tibetan monks and nuns, including overseeing the reincarnation process of Tibetan lamas. U.S. officials and reports highlight poor religious freedom in Tibet, with official interference in Tibetan Buddhist practices generating grievances. China reacts strongly to congressional actions on Tibet. The Chinese government reacts angrily to congressional actions on Tibet, portraying the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist. Chinese scholars express concern about legislation declaring Tibet as an occupied country and criticize Congress for pressuring the executive branch on Tibet policy, which they believe harms China-U.S. relations. The Chinese government strongly opposes congressional actions on Tibet, accusing the Dalai Lama of promoting separatism. Chinese scholars criticize Congress for internationalizing the Tibet issue and view it as a tactic to pressure China and hinder its rise as a global power. They are particularly critical of the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, which established a Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues in the State Department, a position that China does not recognize. The Chinese government opposes any foreign interference in Tibet, rejecting the US-designated 'Special Coordinator for Tibet Issues.' A 2013 study highlighted the importance of the Special Coordinator role in US government, leading to negative international implications by encouraging other countries to follow suit. The authors criticize the rise of Special Coordinators for Tibet, arguing that it shows increasing U.S. support for the Dalai Lama and aims to suppress China. They believe that U.S. involvement in Tibet has negatively impacted dialogue with China by backing the Dalai Lama's positions and supporting autonomy within China. The authors criticize U.S. involvement in Tibetan negotiations, arguing it hindered reaching agreements. Legislative efforts to update the Tibetan Policy Act have stalled in Congress. H.R. 2410 proposed amendments to the Tibetan Policy Act, including requirements for dialogue between the PRC government and the Dalai Lama, coordination with other governments, and U.S. assistance for sustainable development. The bill proposed expanding the duties of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to review and approve grants for projects in Tibetan communities in China. It also required the Secretary of State to assign dedicated personnel to assist in managing the office's responsibilities. Additionally, the bill authorized the establishment of a Tibet section within the U.S. embassy. The bill authorized the Secretary of State to establish a Tibet section within the U.S. embassy in Beijing, China, to follow political, economic, and social developments in Tibet and neighboring Chinese provinces until a U.S. consulate in Tibet is established. It would also provide necessary funds for this section for FY2010 and FY2011. The U.S. government is considering establishing a consulate in Lhasa, Tibet to monitor developments in Tibetan areas and provide services to American citizens. Additionally, efforts are being made to address Chinese interference in Tibetan religious affairs, including the reincarnation system of Tibetan Buddhism. In the 109th Congress, the House passed H.R. 2601, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which included amendments for U.S. assistance to Tibetans inside Tibet. It authorized $6 million in appropriations for projects in FY2006 and $8 million in FY2007. Additionally, it required a Foreign Service officer to be assigned to a U.S. post in the PRC to monitor developments in Tibet. The House passed legislative measures to update the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, including assigning dedicated personnel to the Office of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. Advocates urge Congress to consider policy toward Tibet in the context of relations with China. Congress may need to consider its policy towards Tibet in the context of relations with China, despite the significant bilateral trade between the two countries. The issue of Tibet's political status as either an \"occupied country\" or part of China remains a point of contention, with Congress previously declaring Tibet as \"an occupied country\" in the early 1990s. It is important for Congress to clarify its position on Tibet's status, especially considering the ongoing disagreements with China on human rights issues. Congress has previously declared Tibet as \"an occupied country\" but subsequent legislative measures imply acceptance of Tibet as part of China. The geographic scope of Tibet is disputed, with China defining it as the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) while Tibetan exile organizations include other areas. Congressional appropriations legislation has referenced Tibetan communities in various regions. The legislation aims to apply to Tibetan communities beyond the borders of the TAR, including those in China and South Asia. The political leadership of the Tibetan exile movement has shifted, with the Dalai Lama stepping down and Lobsang Sangay now serving as the elected political head. The question arises on how U.S. programs should balance support for Tibetans in China and those in exile. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 may need to reflect changes in language availability for reports on human rights practices in China. Congress may need to address the issue of translating reports into Tibetan and consider the stalled dialogue process between the PRC and the Dalai Lama's representatives. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 may require updates regarding the Special Coordinator's duties and responsibilities, including promoting dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. The Act should align the Coordinator's objectives with their official duties and reference ongoing programs and projects related to Tibet. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 may need updates for the Special Coordinator's duties, including coordinating with non-State Department entities and traveling to Tibetan refugee settlements in India and Nepal. The Act should also specify the Coordinator's contacts with foreign governments for a negotiated solution for Tibet. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 may need updates regarding international coordination efforts, adequate support for the Special Coordinator, and reporting on Tibet. Questions arise about the scope of contacts with foreign governments, bureaucratic support for the Coordinator, and the content of the annual report. Discussions include expanding the report to cover the implementation of the entire Act and activities of the Special Coordinator. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 may require updates on international coordination efforts, support for the Special Coordinator, and reporting on Tibet. Questions arise about expanding the annual report to cover the Act's implementation and activities of the Coordinator, including economic principles and Tibet's distinct identity. Section 621(d)(2) and related provisions of the Tibetan Policy Act focus on protecting Tibet's distinct religious, cultural, and linguistic identity. The Act assigns specific U.S. officials to implement its mandates. The need for consistency in safeguarding Tibet's identity is questioned. In Section 613(a) and (b)(1) of the TPA, the President and the Secretary of State are tasked with encouraging dialogue with the Dalai Lama on Tibet. Section 617 requires them to request the release of political and religious prisoners in Tibet. Section 620 focuses on seeking medical parole for Tibetan prisoners in ill health. In Section 620, the U.S. Ambassador to China is required to ascertain the well-being of the 11th Panchen Lama and request his release from Chinese custody. The Special Coordinator must promote protecting Tibet's identity and human rights."
