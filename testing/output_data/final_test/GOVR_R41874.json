    "content": "The Senate and House Armed Services Committees report their versions of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) annually, containing provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the House and Senate versions are resolved by a Conference Committee. Congressional staff receive numerous requests for information on NDAA provisions. This report focuses on personnel-related issues in the FY2012 House and Senate versions of the NDAA. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 were passed and signed into law by President Obama on December 31, 2011. The entries in the tables are based on language in these bills, with related CRS products identified for more detailed information and analysis. In 2000, Congress passed P.L. 106-446 to end the euthanizing of military working dogs and facilitate their adoption. Military working dogs are trained to be fearless and aggressive. Military working dogs are trained to be fearless and aggressive, traits that may not be suitable outside of military or law enforcement settings. Congress passed P.L. 106-446 to limit liability for claims related to the transfer of these dogs. Concerns exist for the welfare of these dogs and for family members caring for them. Some deployed dogs suffer from 'canine PTSD,' leading to troubling behavior. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 authorized growth in Army and Marine Corps end strengths. The Army and Marine Corps were authorized to grow in end strength by 65,000 and 27,000 respectively by FY2012. Despite high deployment rates, plans to withdraw forces from Iraq and Afghanistan led to reductions in end strength starting in FY2012. The Army began a reduction of 22,000 in 2012, followed by further reductions in FY2015 and FY2016. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concern over reductions in military personnel, citing existing nondeployable personnel in the Army and soldiers in the disability processing system. The Senate supported the House's strength recommendations with a slight reduction for the Navy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $5.8 billion savings from the proposed decrease in military personnel. The House-proposed decrease of 9,800 military personnel will save $5.8 billion over the 2012 to 2016 period, resulting from reductions in pay, benefits, and operation costs. This information was previously discussed in CRS reports and the overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 2%. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 2% over the past ten years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength. The largest shifts in authorized end strength between FY2001 and FY2011 occurred in the Army National Guard, Coast Guard Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Navy Reserve. The authorized end strength of the Army Reserve decreased by 300 (-0.15%) while the Air National Guard decreased by 1,322 (-1.2%). The Marine Corps Reserve saw a slight increase of 42 (+0.11%). The Air Force Reserve and Navy Reserve both requested and received increases in their authorized end strength for FY2012. The reserve activation provisions in 10 USC 12304, 12302, and 12301(a) allow for involuntary orders to active duty by the federal government. There is debate about expanding these authorities for disaster response. The Senate bill includes new provisions for activating units and individuals in the Reserve Components. The Secretary of Defense can order Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, and Air Force Reserve to active duty for up to 120 days in response to a governor's request for federal assistance during a disaster or emergency. National Guard forces are not included in this authority. The final bill adopted the Senate's language on this provision, which also specifies the appointment of a dual status commander when the armed forces and National Guard are employed simultaneously in civil support operations within the United States. A dual status commander, who is a military officer serving as both a state National Guard officer and a federal military officer, can command non-federalized National Guard forces and federal forces during a major disaster or emergency in the United States. The Governor of the affected state is the principal authority supported by the primary Federal agency, while the Adjutant General of the state is the principal military authority supported by the dual-status commander in their state capacity. Section 515 of the final bill adopted the Senate's language, allowing for the involuntary activation of reservists for up to 365 days for preplanned missions. This new authority is not intended for emergent missions but to enhance the use of reserve component units to support operational mission requirements. The final bill allows for the involuntary activation of reservists for up to 365 days for preplanned missions in support of combatant commands. Only units of the Selected Reserve may be activated, with a limit of 60,000 members serving on active duty at any given time. This authority aims to enhance the use of reserve component units to meet operational mission requirements. In March 2011, Secretary of Defense Gates announced efficiency initiatives to save $178 billion, including eliminating 101 general/flag officer positions and downgrading 22 positions. This would be done over the next two years as U.S. forces withdraw from Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress is concerned about the ratio of general/flag officers to other service members, which has worsened since 9/11. The Air Force has one general for every 1,045 airmen, while the Army has one general for every 1,764 soldiers. Changes in general officer positions were noted in Section 502, in addition to eliminations and downgrades by Secretary Gates. Congress established the position of Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau in 1994, later redesignated as Director of the National Guard Bureau Joint Staff. Section 904 of S. 1390 aimed to re-establish the position of VCNBG in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. In the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress elevated the grade of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a 4-star general and added new responsibilities. Supporters argue for re-establishing the Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau position to assist the CNGB effectively. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a 4-star general with added responsibilities. There is a debate over the redesignation and increase in grade of the Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau position, with the House bill specifying selection criteria and making it a presidentially appointed position, while the Senate bill gives appointment authority to the Secretary of Defense. The final bill adopted the House language. The FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a 4-star general with added responsibilities. The bill requires pre-separation counseling for members of the Armed Forces, covering various topics like educational benefits, relocation assistance, and veterans' benefits. Counseling should start 24 months before retirement or 12 months before separation, but no later than 90 days before discharge. This timeline can be challenging for reserve component members on operational deployments. The Department of Defense requested an amendment to bring reserve components into compliance with the statute regarding pre-separation counseling for National Guard and Reserve members serving on active duty for more than 180 days. The final bill adopted the Senate language, allowing counseling to occur less than 90 days prior to separation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consists of various military leaders. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) consists of the Chairman, who is the principal military adviser to key government bodies, and other military advisers who provide advice through the Chairman. Representation of the Army National Guard and Air National Guard on the JCS is done by their service chiefs. Some argue that this representation is inadequate for issues related to the National Guard's use in non-federalized status for domestic operations. The National Guard advocates for the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to ensure participation in high-level policy decisions, despite recommendations against it by the Commission on the National Guard and Reserve. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserve recommended against making the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, citing concerns about organizational principles and the reserve status of the National Guard. Congress made changes to the position, elevating it to a four-star general and adding new responsibilities. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau was considered for membership in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with differing opinions from the DOD General Counsel, current Joint Chiefs of Staff members, and General Craig McKinley. General McKinley argued for full JCS membership to ensure proper representation. The House and Senate bills propose making the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with additional responsibilities such as advocating for the National Guard and consulting with governors and adjutant generals before making changes in force structure or equipment levels. This move aims to ensure that the National Guard's capabilities are considered in a planned and deliberate manner, rooted in law and national strategy. The final bill designates the Chief of the National Guard Bureau as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with specific responsibilities for non-Federalized National Guard forces in homeland defense and civil support missions. The Cold War Recognition Certificate was authorized by Congress to honor the contributions of armed forces and government civilians during the Cold War from 1945 to 1991. Various veterans' organizations have supported the creation of this medal. Prior to 1987, the Services had differing policies on how they treated secondary educational credentials in the recruiting process. Three tiers were created based on the likelihood of recruits successfully completing their first term. Tier one includes those with a traditional high school diploma or at least one year of college, tier two includes alternative diplomas like the GED, and tier three includes those with no credentials or inadequate ones. This approach has been in place for over 20 years. The House is concerned about the outdated policy on secondary education in the military, which was based on attrition data from over 20 years ago. New alternative education options like online programs have emerged since then. The approach of making changes before studying the data is questioned. Section 654, the basis for the 1993 policy banning open homosexuality in the military, was repealed on September 20, 2011. Certain steps were required for the repeal, including certifications by key officials and a 60-day waiting period. Amendments to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell were procedurally blocked during the legislative process. The repeal of Section 654, which banned open homosexuality in the military, required certifications and a waiting period. Amendments to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell were blocked, despite some members of the Joint Chiefs expressing reservations. The review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was prompted by concerns over laws on sexual misconduct and the repeal of DADT. The Joint Service Committee of Military Justice recommended changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice regarding rape and sexual assault, including repealing the prohibition on sodomy. The proposed changes align language in Article 120 with other Articles, clarify sexual assault definitions, and simplify existing language. The Joint Service Committee recommended changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice regarding rape and sexual assault, including removing sodomy as a chargeable offense. Despite previous changes, problems remain in prosecution and victim advocacy. In 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was enacted, defining marriage as between one man and one woman for federal benefits. Some states recognized same-sex marriages, leading to a debate on the constitutionality of DOMA. Attorney General Eric Holder declared DOMA's definition of marriage as unconstitutional. This impacted military benefits, such as health care, for same-sex spouses. The House reiterates support for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), while the Senate allows military chaplains to refuse performing marriages based on conscience. Navy Chaplains briefly allowed same-sex marriages in 2011 but suspended the policy after criticism from Congress. DOMA's restrictions on military benefits for same-sex spouses are being contested in the courts. The policy change allowing Navy Chaplains to perform same-sex marriages was suspended in 2011 after criticism from Congress. The House language reaffirms support for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Military members who are single parents must have contingency plans for deployments that do not allow dependents. The possibility of military deployments may impact custodial rights of service members. Custody changes could occur during deployment, leading to concerns about attending court proceedings. Legislation has addressed sexual assault in the Armed Forces over the years. Legislation has addressed sexual assault in the Armed Forces through studies, hearings, and legislation. Title V (subtitle I) of H.R. 1540 contains seven Sections concerning sexual assault, which elevate case management, set record-keeping standards, allow victims to seek transfers, and establish training requirements. $45 million is designated for training, and only military or federal employees can serve as Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Advocates to prevent exploitation by private advocacy groups. Section 594 of the bill requires the Secretary of Defense to implement a career-development program for severely wounded warriors and their spouses from 2012 to 2016. The program includes services such as exploring career options, education assessments, and resume preparation. $1 million will be allocated for the program using merit-based procedures, with a cost-benefit analysis to be submitted to Congress within a year of enactment. The career-development program for severely wounded warriors and their spouses includes services like exploring career options, education assessments, resume preparation, acquiring additional education and training, engaging with prospective employers, entering various occupations, advancing in jobs, and resolving obstacles through coordination with military departments and federal agencies. Services will be provided at up to 20 locations in areas with high concentrations of wounded service members. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that implementing a provision for a career-development program for wounded warriors would cost $60 million over a specific period. Congress is interested in monitoring the outcome of the program. The Selective Service System's requirement for men to register for the draft was reinstated in 1980. The Selective Service System is an independent agency with a budget of about $24 million per year. It has staff, including civilian employees, National Guard and Reserve officers, and trained volunteers who would operate local boards in the event of a draft reinstatement. Some question the need for the system since the U.S. Armed Forces became all-volunteer in 1973. Opponents question the need for the Selective Service System, arguing that it is wasteful as conscription is unlikely. Supporters defend the system, stating it is a strategic hedge for rapid and equitable conscription if needed in the future. The House provision calls for a study on alternatives to the current system by the Government Accountability Office. The final bill largely adopts the House provision for a study on the necessity of the Selective Service System, with changes in the report description and deadline. Concerns have been raised about the authenticity of using recorded bugle calls in military ceremonies. The language in the discussion expresses the House's view on playing Taps at events but does not mandate its performance. Concerns about military pay raises have been heightened due to the cost of military personnel and ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Title 37 U.S.C. Section 1009 provides for an annual military pay raise indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The FY2012 President's Budget requested a 1.6% raise, following the formula. Since 9/11, Congress has been focused on military pay raises. Since 9/11, Congress has approved military pay raises based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI) increase plus 0.5% in fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010. The pay raise was equal to the ECI in 2007 and 2011. In 2012, the automatic provisions of 37 U.S.C. resulted in a 1.6% across-the-board pay raise, costing $1.2 billion. Various types of pay raises, including mid-year and targeted raises, have been authorized. The Senate and Conference did not address the issue of the military pay raise. Background: Captain Samson Luke of the Arkansas National Guard died at his off-base home after a day of training at Fort Chaffee. His wife was not eligible for a $100,000 benefit since he was not on-base at the time of his death. The Death Gratuity benefit was not eligible for Captain Luke's wife as he was not considered to be on duty at the time of his death, even though he had returned home after training. The Senate provision aimed to extend the law to cover individuals in similar situations. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) provides compensation to surviving spouses of service members/retirees with service-connected disabilities. DIC offsets Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) payments dollar-for-dollar. Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) was created in 2008 to provide additional monthly allowance to certain beneficiaries. SSIA increased annually until 2017 when it terminated at $310 per month. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) terminated on October 1, 2017, and may not exceed the SBP-DIC offset amount. Critics argue that survivors could be receiving multiple government benefits, leading to \"triple dipping.\" Efforts to end the SBP-DIC offset have been unsuccessful, with advocates seeing SSIA as a better option for beneficiaries. Critics believe providing more money than originally contracted for under SBP is unjustified, especially in the current budgetary situation. TRICARE is a health care program for service members, retirees, and their dependents. H.R. 1540 would limit TRICARE Prime fee increases to COLA adjustments starting in 2013. The House Armed Services Committee proposed extending the prohibition on fee increases for one year. The HASC chairman's mark removed the provision to limit TRICARE Prime fee increases to COLA adjustments, allowing the Obama Administration to raise annual enrollment fees by $30 for individuals and $60 for families. The Administration also proposed indexing future fee increases to the growth rate in national health expenditures. If the Administration proposal is implemented, TRICARE Prime enrollment fees in 2012 will increase to $260 for individuals and $520 for families. Limiting fee increases to the military retirement COLA would cost $186 million over the 2013\u20132016 period. Section 703 of H.R. 1540 would amend Title 10, U.S.C., to require free access to mental health assessments for reserve component members during inactive-duty training. Armed Forces during annual training or duty training will have access to behavioral health support programs, including access to mental health providers and suicide prevention training. The estimated cost of implementing this provision is $118 million over 2012-2016, based on pilot programs in California and Montana National Guards. The provision in Section 704 of H.R. 1540 would close enrollment in the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP) to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries of the military health system. This would require appropriations of almost $30 million per year when fully implemented, with costs being lower in the first year due to the time needed to establish regulations and programs. Those currently enrolled in USFHP can remain in the program, but new enrollees after fiscal year 2012 would have to leave once they turn 65. The Administration's 2012 Budget includes changes that would require Medicare-eligible beneficiaries of the military health system to leave USFHP at age 65 and transition to regular Medicare/TRICARE-for-Life benefits. USFHP, available in six areas of the US, originated from former government-owned hospitals now operated by non-profit health care systems. The \"Uniformed Services Family Health Plan\" (USFHP) was initially deemed equivalent to DOD military hospitals, with DOD paying for beneficiary hospitalizations. With TRICARE's introduction in 1994, DOD changed to a per member per month payment model. USFHP manages care for all beneficiaries in designated areas, including Medicare-eligible retirees. DOD aims to reduce costs by transitioning future Medicare-eligible USFHP enrollees to Medicare/TRICARE-for-Life benefits at age 65. The Government aims to reduce expenditures by requiring future Medicare-eligible USFHP enrollees to enroll in Medicare Part B to retain TRICARE coverage under the TRICARE for Life plan. This change is estimated to save about $76 million over the 2013-2021 period according to the Congressional Budget Office. Section 711 of H.R. 1540 proposes establishing a unified command for medical services to provide healthcare to the Armed Forces and other beneficiaries of the Department of Defense. The Section proposes establishing a unified medical command for healthcare services to the Armed Forces and other beneficiaries of the Department of Defense. It would require all active military medical facilities to be assigned to the unified medical command, with the commander holding a high rank appointed by the President. The Section proposes establishing a unified medical command for healthcare services to the Armed Forces and other beneficiaries of the Department of Defense. This command would include all medical training, education, research and development activities, and would transfer the TRICARE Management Activity to a Defense Health Agency. The commander of the unified medical command would oversee all medical operations activities and submit program recommendations and budget proposals to the Secretary of Defense. The unified medical command would oversee recommendations and budget proposals for the Defense Health Program, training assigned forces, conducting specialized courses, and ensuring equipment and forces interoperability within the military health system. The current organizational structure of the MHS lacks central command authority, leading to inefficiencies and cost-saving opportunities. DOD lacks central command authority in the military health system, leading to inefficiencies and cost-saving opportunities. Limited actions have been taken to consolidate functions, but further restructuring could reduce duplication and achieve significant savings. The Center for Naval Analyses found potential savings for DOD, ranging from $281 million to $460 million annually, depending on the positions eliminated. The Administration objected to creating a new unified combatant command for medical operations, stating that DOD is studying how to deliver medical care efficiently. The Senate amendment allows the process to move forward in a more measured pace, referencing a previous CRS report on military personnel policy issues. Contact Don Jansen for more information."
