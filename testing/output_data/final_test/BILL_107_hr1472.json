SEC. 4. Priority for resource allocation is given to increasing grant size and duration in Research and Related Activities. SEC. 5. If appropriated amount is less than authorized, reduction in funding for scientific directorates and major activities is proportional. SEC. 6. Director of NSF can use up to $10,000 for consultation and representation expenses. SEC. 7. Major Research Instrumentation. The National Science Foundation will review and assess the Major Research Instrumentation Program, providing a report to Congress by September 1, 2002. The report will include estimates of research instrumentation needs by field, distribution of awards and funding levels, and an analysis of the program's impact on research needs identified in 1994. The National Science Foundation's 1994 survey documented academic research instrumentation needs. SEC. 8. Assessment and plan for programs to encourage careers in science and engineering by underrepresented groups. The Director of the National Science Foundation will review precollege and undergraduate programs focused on increasing underrepresented individuals in science, math, and engineering careers. The study will assess program effectiveness, identify key characteristics, and factors for replication at other sites. The Director of the National Science Foundation will develop a plan to scale up effective programs that increase the numbers of underrepresented individuals in science, math, and engineering careers. This includes instituting a research grants program, allocating resources for internal assessment activities, and replicating successful programs. The National Science Foundation will report to Congress within 18 months with findings, conclusions, and recommendations from an assessment on increasing underrepresented individuals in science, math, and engineering careers, along with proposed funding levels for programs and activities. SEC. 9. NATIONAL RESEARCH FACILITIES PLAN. Amends Section 201 of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1998 to require cost data on facilities construction, repair, operations, and maintenance to indicate funding sources by appropriations account. Data on operations costs must also include funding for instrumentation development and upgrades. SEC. 10. REPORTS ELIMINATION. Section 3003(a)(1) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 does not apply to specific reports required by various provisions of law related to science and engineering, including the National Science Foundation Act and the High-Performance Computing Act.
