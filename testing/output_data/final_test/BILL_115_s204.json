The Act allows the use of investigational drugs for eligible patients with terminal illnesses, exempt from certain regulations. The Secretary can only delay drug approval using clinical outcomes if critical for safety determination. The manufacturer or sponsor must submit an annual summary of drug use to the Secretary. The Secretary requires an annual summary report on the use of investigational drugs for terminal illnesses, including doses supplied, patients treated, uses, and adverse events. The report must be submitted alongside the annual report for an investigational new drug application. Additionally, the Secretary will post this information on the FDA website. The use of investigational drugs for terminal illnesses must comply with specific regulations to avoid liability. No liability shall lie against sponsors, manufacturers, prescribers, or dispensers unless there is reckless misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional tort under state law. No liability for not providing investigational drugs under section 561B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, except in cases of reckless misconduct, gross negligence, or intentional tort. This section does not affect the right to bring private actions under product liability, tort, consumer protection, or warranty laws. The Senate acknowledges that section 561B does not create new entitlements or modify existing ones. The curr_chunk outlines the provisions of a new policy that expands individual liberty for terminally ill patients to access experimental treatments. It does not create new mandates or regulations but establishes national standards for providing investigational drugs. The policy recognizes the high mortality risk of eligible patients and emphasizes informed assumption of risk. It does not guarantee a cure but offers an alternative pathway alongside existing FDA policies. The curr_chunk mentions the roles of Speaker of the House of Representatives and Vice President of the United States."
