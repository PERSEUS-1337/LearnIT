    "content": "The Act titled \"Lupus Research, Education, Awareness, Communication, and Healthcare Amendments of 2005\" aims to expand and improve research on lupus and enhance awareness and education about the disease. It includes provisions for the expansion of lupus biomedical research and strengthening lupus epidemiology. Additionally, it focuses on increasing public awareness and improving health professional education on lupus. Congress finds that lupus is a serious autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation and tissue damage to various organs in the body. The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 Americans live with lupus, with women being affected 9 times more often than men. Lupus disproportionately affects women of color, being 2 to 3 times more common among minority populations. The rate of lupus mortality has increased among older African-American women. No new drugs for lupus have been approved by the FDA in nearly 40 years. Lupus can cause pain, fatigue, and disability, leading to reliance on government support programs. The estimated annual cost of medical treatment for lupus can range from $10,000 to $30,000, with serious cases exceeding this amount. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent organ damage, disability, and death. Despite the impact of lupus on individuals and families, there is low understanding among health professionals and the public. Lupus awareness is low, with only 1 in 5 Americans having basic knowledge about the disease. Adults aged 18 to 34, who are most at risk for lupus, have the lowest awareness. A comprehensive response from Federal and State governments, healthcare providers, patients, and public health communities is needed to address this significant national health issue. Expansion of lupus biomedical research under Title I aims to enhance research efforts in the field of lupus. The Secretary will expand lupus research activities through the Institute, coordinating with other national research institutes and agencies. Research will focus on understanding the causes and finding a cure for lupus, including basic research on the disease's pathogenesis and pathophysiology. Research priorities for lupus include understanding the disease's pathophysiology, investigating its disproportionate prevalence in certain ethnic groups, conducting epidemiological studies on disease frequency and natural history, developing new treatments and diagnostic tests, and validating biomarkers. SEC. 102. STRENGTHENING LUPUS EPIDEMIOLOGY; LUPUS STUDY. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a section on strengthening lupus epidemiology. The Secretary will collaborate with academic health institutions to conduct a national lupus epidemiological study to determine the prevalence and incidence of lupus in the US. Funding will be used to establish a data collection and analysis system, including a common data entry system and enhancing existing lupus patient registries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will ensure geographic representation in a lupus consortium capturing data on all affected populations and forms of lupus. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these activities. Authorization of appropriations totaling $3,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2006 to 2009 is provided for activities related to lupus and other disorders. The Institute of Medicine conducted a study and reported on lupus. The Secretary will contract with the Institute of Medicine to evaluate lupus research, identify gaps in Federal research, and make recommendations for building and supporting the lupus research enterprise. The Institute of Medicine will evaluate lupus research, identify gaps, and make recommendations for supporting research. Recommendations include improving public awareness, developing new therapies, and enhancing diagnosis and treatment of lupus. The Institute of Medicine will evaluate lupus research, identify gaps, and make recommendations for supporting research to improve quality of life, summarize clinical features, and recommend disease management and epidemiological studies. SEC. 201 of TITLE II focuses on increasing public awareness of lupus and improving health professional education. The Secretary, in collaboration with relevant organizations, will conduct a national lupus awareness campaign targeting high-risk populations. The campaign aims to improve early intervention, treatment, and quality of life for individuals with lupus, with a focus on minority communities. The Secretary will conduct a national lupus awareness campaign targeting high-risk populations, including minority communities. Efforts will focus on at-risk women and health professionals to reduce the time to diagnose lupus and provide up-to-date medical information. Integration with other programs will be considered, and appropriations are authorized. Authorization of $1,000,000 annually for lupus awareness campaign from 2006 to 2010."
