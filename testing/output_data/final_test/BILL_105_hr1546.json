    "content": "The \"Government Secrecy Act of 1997\" aims to protect classified information effectively and promote disclosure when secrecy is not justified or the costs outweigh the benefits. The Congress finds that the current system for classifying and declassifying national security information, based on Executive orders since 1951, is unstable and costly. The Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy recommended reducing classified information and strengthening protection. The absence of a statutory framework has led to inconsistent policies and excessive costs, especially with the increasing use of electronic systems. The current system for classifying and declassifying national security information is unstable and costly. United States taxpayers spend over $5.2 billion annually to protect classified information. A statutory foundation could lead to more stable and cost-effective policies, consistent application of rules, and greater oversight by Congress. The current system for classifying and declassifying national security information is costly and unstable. A statutory foundation could lead to more stable and cost-effective policies, consistent application of rules, and greater oversight by Congress, while preserving executive branch officials' responsibility for system administration.

SEC. 4. CLASSIFICATION AND DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION. The President can classify information for national security reasons to protect the United States, ensuring the minimum necessary classification. Procedures for classification and declassification must be established, including categories of information and resources for declassification. The President must declassify information previously classified, publish categories and procedures in the Federal Register for public comment, and consider feedback before establishing them. The same procedures apply to any modifications in categories or procedures. Each agency must establish standards and procedures for classifying and declassifying information based on the President's guidelines. Considerations for classification and declassification include weighing the benefits of public disclosure. The determination of whether information should be classified is based on weighing the benefit of public disclosure against the need for protection. Written justifications are required for both original and derivative classification decisions. The official must identify themselves in the document. Information classified under the Act cannot exceed a 10-year period without certification from the agency head. If not declassified within 10 years, it cannot remain classified for more than 30 years without further certification to the President. The official must certify to the President at the end of a 30-year period that continued protection of the information is essential to national security or an individual will be harmed. Classified information must be regularly reviewed and declassified according to agency schedules. Each agency must assess existing classified information. The official must certify to the President after 30 years that classified information is still vital for national security. Agencies must regularly review and declassify information, with a report to Congress due annually. Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act are also made. The title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow for the classification of information under the Government Secrecy Act of 1997 or an Executive order for national security reasons. Proper classification must be in accordance with the Act or Executive order. The National Declassification Center is established under Section 5. The President establishes the National Declassification Center within an existing agency to coordinate declassification policies, provide technical assistance to agencies, and declassify information upon request on a reimbursable basis. The National Declassification Center coordinates declassification policies among agencies, ensuring efficient and consistent declassification of classified information. It may use resources from other agencies with consent for this purpose. Disputes among agencies regarding classification of information are also addressed. The National Declassification Center resolves disputes over classified information classification by referring matters to the President for resolution. A 12-member National Declassification Advisory Committee is established, with members appointed by the President, Senate leaders, and House leaders from various fields. The National Declassification Center has a 12-member Advisory Committee consisting of experts in declassification and government records management. The Committee advises the Center on declassification priorities and activities. The Center must submit annual reports to the President and Congress on its activities and coordination of agency declassification practices. SEC. 6. INFORMATION TO THE CONGRESS. This Act does not allow withholding information from Congress. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as Advisory Committee, agency, Center, and classification process. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the declassification process and national security of the United States. The Act will become effective 180 days after its enactment."
