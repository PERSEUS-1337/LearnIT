By extracting intermediate feature maps from an autoencoder and learning a set of coefficients, the model becomes more flexible and can better fit the training data. Experimental results on MNIST, MTFL, and CIFAR10 datasets show improved classification accuracy using this filter generation method. The proposed filter generation method improves the accuracy of the baseline model by addressing variations in images, such as different head poses and illuminations in face images. Unlike CNNs with fixed filters, CNNs with dynamically generated sample-specific filters are more flexible and efficient, allowing the model to deal with variations without increasing model size. However, training CNNs with dynamic filter generation poses two challenges. The challenges for training CNNs with dynamic filter generation include learning sample-specific features for filter generation and mapping a feature vector to a set of new filters efficiently. The difficulty lies in identifying all factors of variations and mapping them in a supervised manner, as well as dealing with the high dimensionality of filters which requires a large number of parameters. The proposed solution involves using an autoencoder for variation representation learning. The proposed solution involves using an autoencoder for variation representation learning. Each layer of the encoder contains information about the input image, and features are extracted from each layer as sample-specific features. A filter repository is constructed for filter generation, and a matrix is learned to map feature vectors to coefficients for generating new filters. The model bridges the gap between the autoencoder and prediction network, embedding knowledge from unsupervised learning into supervised learning. The proposed method involves using a filter repository to generate new filters in a differentiable manner, bridging unsupervised and supervised learning. It focuses on dynamically changing the parameters of a CNN, either by adjusting connections or generating weights. This approach is distinct from strategies like dynamic connection, where only a subset of connections in a CNN are activated during a forward pass. Researchers have proposed using dynamic connections in CNNs to reduce computation costs. BID13 introduced a conditional CNN for multimodal face recognition, incorporating decision trees to select connections dynamically. BID6 presented deep neural decision forests that combine classification trees with representation learning. BID5 and BID0 also proposed similar frameworks merging decision forests with deep CNNs for enhanced representation learning. Dynamic weights are utilized in hybrid models combining CNNs and decision trees for high representation learning and computational efficiency. These weights, generated dynamically, serve as parameters in CNNs and can be seen as a form of meta learning. BID1 and BID4 introduce methods to generate dynamic weights for one-shot learning scenarios, with hypernetworks improving sequence modeling capabilities in LSTM. Various architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic weights in enhancing model performance. The work introduces a method for feature representation learning using dynamical weights, similar to previous works like De BID3. The proposed method involves using feature vectors from an autoencoder network to generate new filters through a linear combination of base filters. The paper is structured with sections detailing the method, experiment results, and conclusion. The model consists of sample-specific feature learning, filter generation, and final prediction. The autoencoder network extracts features from input images, which are then dimensionally reduced and used to generate new filters. These filters are utilized by the prediction network for tasks like detection and classification. Autoencoders learn sample-specific features through an encoder-decoder structure, with features from each layer used as representations of the input image. The autoencoder network extracts features from input images and uses dimension reduction modules to reduce the dimension of the feature maps. The loss function is binary cross entropy, and the filter generation process generates filters from sample-specific features. The filter generation process in CNNs involves mapping input vectors to filters using a set of base filters from a repository. This method is necessary when the number of filters is large, and each filter vector is generated by a combination of base filters. The assumption is that the base filters are orthogonal, but in real applications, the number of filters is limited in each convolutional layer. In CNNs, the filter generation process maps input vectors to filters using base filters from a repository. The number of filters is limited in each layer, with a small subspace used in the final model. The transformation matrix has fewer parameters than the original size. The prediction network is for high-level tasks like image classification, with filters provided by a module and classifier weights learned during training. Loss functions are task-dependent, with classification task and negative log likelihood loss used in this work. The proposed method aims to generate dynamic filters to improve the performance of a baseline network. It is evaluated on digit classification, facial landmark detection, and image classification tasks using different datasets. The number of base filters in each repository matches the number of filters in each layer of the prediction network. Further analysis on the generated filters is presented in Section 4.4, with network structures detailed in Appendix A.1. An initial experiment on digit classification using the MNIST dataset is set up to start the evaluation process. In a simple experiment on digit classification using the MNIST dataset, the accuracy improvement from dynamic filters is compared between a baseline network with and without them. The size of the encoder network and filter repository are analyzed for their impact on classification accuracy. The baseline model consists of two convolutional layers and a fully connected layer outputting ten dimensions, with five filters in each convolutional layer. Varying the number of filters in each layer of the encoder network is evaluated for its effect on classification accuracy. In an experiment on digit classification using the MNIST dataset, the effect of dynamically generated filters is evaluated. The number of filters in each layer of the encoder network and the size of the filter repository are varied. Results show that using dynamically generated filters leads to higher test accuracy compared to fixed filters, with the highest accuracy reaching 99.1%. In an experiment on digit classification using the MNIST dataset, dynamically generated filters outperform fixed filters, leading to higher test accuracy. The flexibility of the generated filters allows for better fitting of the data. Increasing the number of filters in the encoder network improves classification accuracy by capturing more variations in input images. The final classification accuracy seems less dependent on the repository size. The filter generation technique is also applied to facial landmark detection. The curr_chunk discusses the performance improvement of a baseline model with variations added to the dataset for landmark detection. Two datasets, D-Align and D-Rot, are constructed from the MTFL dataset for comparison. D-Align aligns and crops face images, while D-Rot includes randomly rotated images. The datasets aim to show the impact of variations on detection performance. The training datasets contain 9,000 images, and the test datasets contain 1,000 images. Two baseline models, Model 32 and Model 64, based on UNet BID10, were trained on D-Align and D-Rot without the filter generation module. Evaluation was done using mean error as a metric. The study evaluated two baseline models, Model 32 and Model 64, trained on datasets D-Align and D-Rot without the filter generation module. Results showed that using filters conditioned on the input image reduced the effect of dataset variations, leading to a decrease in detection error. The performance gain was larger on Model 32 compared to Model 64. The study compared the performance of Model 32 and Model 64, showing that Model 64's larger capacity allows it to handle more variations but results in a smaller performance gain. Evaluating on the FORMULA2 dataset with natural images, a small baseline network was trained on CIFAR10 without and with filter generation, showing improved fitting of data with filter generation. Additionally, a VGG11 model was trained on the same dataset, with results shown in FIG3. The study compared Model 32 and Model 64, with Model 64 showing smaller performance gain due to its larger capacity. Training a small baseline network on CIFAR10 with filter generation improved data fitting. VGG11 also achieved high accuracy with eleven layers. Dynamic filter generation improved baseline classification accuracy by \u223c1% and test accuracy comparable to VGG11. The study concludes that dynamically generated filters can enhance baseline model performance. The study visualizes distributions of coefficients, filters, and feature maps from convolutional layers using MNIST dataset. Experiment on CIFAR10 dataset shows sample-specific filters. Visualization with TSNE shows shared filters by certain categories. In the CIFAR10 experiment, the study shows that the generated filters are sample-specific, affecting the classification accuracy of the network. The coefficients and filters form clusters based on different digit categories, making the feature maps more separable. In this paper, the study demonstrates that generated filters are sample-specific, impacting classification accuracy. The proposed filter generation module transforms features from an autoencoder network to coefficients for linearly combining base filters. Dynamic filters increase model capacity, making a small model competitive with a deep model. Evaluation on three tasks shows improved accuracy with filter generation. The network structures used in experiments are detailed, with sample-specific features extracted from convolution feature maps. The study demonstrates that sample-specific filters impact classification accuracy by transforming features from an autoencoder network to coefficients for linearly combining base filters. Dynamic filters increase model capacity, improving accuracy in three tasks. The network structures used in experiments extract sample-specific features from convolution feature maps."
