    "content": "The innocent landowner defense in CERCLA allows property owners to escape liability if contamination was present before acquisition and they were unaware of it. This defense evolved over three enactments, starting with the original Superfund Act in 1980. One of the few defenses to strict liability is the \"third-party defense.\" The third-party defense in CERCLA allows a defendant to show that the release was caused solely by a third party not in a contractual relationship with them. The defendant must prove due care and precautions against foreseeable acts of the third party. The \"contractual relationship\" exception to this defense was questioned for potentially allowing site owners to escape liability. In 1986, Congress amended CERCLA to address the issue of the \"contractual relationship\" exception. The exception now includes instruments of conveyance, but with an exception for landowners who acquired the property after hazardous substances were disposed of, and had no knowledge of it at the time of acquisition. The 1986 amendments to CERCLA clarified the \"contractual relationship\" exception, stating that landowners who acquired property without knowledge of hazardous substance disposal are exempt. Congress later sought to define \"all appropriate inquiry,\" leading to the 2002 Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act instructing EPA to establish standards for this requirement. Regulations were to be in place by January 11, 2004. The regulations, required by January 11, 2004, must include inquiry by an environmental professional, interviews with past and present owners, operators, and occupants of the facility, reviews of historical sources, land use records searches, review of government records, waste disposal records, and hazardous waste records, visual inspection of the facility, specialized knowledge or experience of the land acquirer, relationship of purchase price to property value, ascertainable information about the property contamination, and ability to detect contamination. These regulations will provide significant guidance to land purchasers beyond existing CERCLA requirements. The new regulations provide more guidance to land purchasers beyond existing CERCLA requirements. Property owners before May 31, 1997, are grandfathered and must comply with CERCLA standards for \"all appropriate inquiry.\" Property purchased after May 31, 1997, must follow American Society for Testing and Materials procedures. The innocent-landowner defense to CERCLA liability requires specific conditions to be met, including cooperation with response actions, compliance with land use restrictions, and taking steps to prevent further releases or exposure to hazardous substances. This defense is available to property owners who meet these requirements after purchasing land. The innocent landowner defense under CERCLA requires two conditions to be met: the release must be caused solely by a third party without a contractual relationship with the defendant, and the landowner must have exercised due care, cooperated with response actions, complied with land use restrictions, and taken steps to prevent future releases. CERCLA allows for \"de minimis settlements\" with certain parties to expedite resolution and focus resources on major parties. Innocent landowners may qualify for such settlements if it is in the public interest. The EPA is directed by CERCLA to settle promptly with a landowner if the settlement involves only a \"minor portion\" of the response costs and the landowner meets specific criteria. EPA has wide discretion in offering de minimis settlements, which do not require \"all appropriate inquiry\" or other prerequisites for innocent-landowner status. The EPA's guidance requires all appropriate inquiry for de minimis settlement eligibility, linking it to innocent landowner status as a third-party defense. EPA may include covenants not to sue in de minimis settlements, based on the likelihood of successfully asserting innocent landowner status. Historically, EPA has entered into few de minimis settlements with landowners due to the chilling effect of CERCLA liability on real property investment. Potential liability under CERCLA as an \"owner\" of contaminated land deters buyers, as they may be responsible for response costs. Buyers who know of contamination at the time of purchase do not qualify for innocent landowner protections. In 1989, EPA established a policy for prospective purchasers of contaminated property, offering a \"prospective purchaser agreement\" (PPA) in limited circumstances. This agreement allows EPA to covenant not to sue the buyer based on existing contamination at the site, aiming to encourage private investment in brownfields. In 1989, EPA introduced prospective purchaser agreements (PPAs) for contaminated property, where EPA covenants not to sue based on existing contamination. The criteria for PPAs included anticipated EPA enforcement action and a substantial contribution to response actions. Despite efforts to add flexibility in 1995, only 160-170 PPAs were entered into by 2002. To encourage brownfield redevelopment, the SBA in 2002 defined \"bona fide prospective purchaser\" (BFPP) in CERCLA, granting them exemption from liability. The Small Business Administration (SBA) in 2002 introduced the \"bona fide prospective purchaser\" (BFPP) provision in CERCLA, granting buyers an exemption from liability for contaminated properties. This exemption is automatic once the buyer meets the statutory criteria, without the need for EPA involvement. BFPPs and their tenants are exempt from CERCLA \"owner\" or \"operator\" liability, as long as they do not impede response actions or natural resource restoration. The BFPP provision in CERCLA exempts buyers from liability for contaminated properties if they meet specific criteria, including conducting appropriate inquiry, taking care of hazardous substances, providing cooperation, and complying with land use restrictions. The exemption applies to any contaminated site, not just brownfields, and the buyer must not impede response actions or restoration efforts. The BFPP provision in CERCLA exempts buyers from liability for contaminated properties if they meet specific criteria, including conducting appropriate inquiry, taking care of hazardous substances, providing cooperation, and complying with land use restrictions. The SBA gives the United States a \"windfall lien\" on the property if unrecovered response costs increase the market value. Ambiguities in the criteria have led to concerns in the regulated community about potential enforcement actions by the EPA. The EPA believes that in most cases, the SBA's BFPP provisions make PPAs unnecessary for buyers of contaminated land. However, the Agency may still consider PPAs or other agreements before land acquisition in limited or unusual circumstances. Buyers may only have BFPP status as a realistic option in some cases. The EPA may consider lien-resolution agreements in cases where there is a significant windfall lien that needs to be resolved before purchasing the property. These agreements would only settle the lien claim and do not include a covenant by EPA not to sue. The main obstacle to using these agreements is the difficulty of knowing the exact amount of government cleanup costs in advance. In contrast, PPAs are considered necessary to ensure completion of a transaction and provide substantial public benefits, such as environmental improvements or job creation. The EPA may consider lien-resolution agreements in cases where there is a significant windfall lien that needs to be resolved before purchasing the property. These agreements settle the lien claim but do not include a covenant by EPA not to sue. PPAs are seen as necessary to ensure transaction completion and provide public benefits like environmental improvements or job creation. The memorandum outlines specific circumstances where a PPA may be needed, such as significant environmental benefits, involvement in CERCLA litigation, or unique site-specific circumstances serving public interest. The need for pursuing a PPA, even when appearing to be a BFPP, may have lessened recently. The EPA guidance issued on March 6, 2003 clarified the ambiguity surrounding the phrase \"reasonable steps\" in the context of PPAs. A nonbinding \"comfort letter\" may be issued by the EPA to provide further guidance on what constitutes \"reasonable steps\" for a specific site. However, despite the guidance, buyers of land cannot have complete certainty that the EPA will agree with their interpretation of \"reasonable steps\" in enforcement actions."
