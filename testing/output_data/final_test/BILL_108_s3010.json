    "content": "The \"Firefighters Special Operation Task Force Act\" is a new section added to the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, providing grants for firefighting task forces. The section defines critical infrastructure, firefighting personnel, incident response, and member in relation to the Firefighters Special Operation Task Force Act. The Firefighters Special Operation Task Force Act defines a task force as a group of at least 2 fire services coordinating incident response in a specific area. The Administrator is authorized to award grants to task forces for specific purposes and can award multiple grants in metropolitan areas with over 1,000,000 population. Grants can be awarded to a maximum of 100 task forces in the United States. The grant awarded to a task force under this section can be used to provide salary and benefits for firefighting personnel, pay for training expenses, and provide incident response training. The grant awarded to a task force can be used for firefighting personnel, equipment, communication improvements, and application submission to the Administrator for assistance selection within a 50-mile radius. The Administrator may provide assistance to a task force under this section only if the task force is located within 50 miles of specific facilities or areas of national significance and agrees to match at least 55 percent of the assistance with non-Federal funds. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section. The Administrator may provide assistance to a task force within 50 miles of national facilities, with a requirement for non-Federal fund matching. Appropriations of $1.5 billion for 2006 and $1 billion annually from 2007 to 2015 are allocated for this purpose."
