The Act \"Access to Capital for Entrepreneurs Act of 2006\" introduces a tax credit for equity investment in small businesses. The tax credit is 25% of qualified equity investments made by a qualified investor, with limits of $500,000 per investor and $250,000 per small business. Definitions for qualified investor, qualified equity investment, and qualified small business are provided. The term 'qualified small business' refers to a private small business meeting size standards and having its main location in the US. All members of the same controlled group of corporations are considered one qualified small business. During the holding period of a qualified small business stock, the business must meet active business requirements by using at least 80% of its assets in qualified trades or businesses. For the purposes of determining active business requirements, assets used in start-up activities, research and experimental expenditures, or in-house research expenses of a qualified small business are considered used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business. For determining active business requirements, assets used in start-up activities, research, and experimental expenditures of a qualified small business are considered active. The term 'qualified trade or business' is defined in section 1202(e)(3). Stock and debt in subsidiary entities are disregarded, and the parent small business is deemed to own its share of the subsidiary's assets and activities. A qualified small business must ensure that no more than 10 percent of its assets consist of stock or securities in entities that are not subsidiaries. An entity is considered a subsidiary if the parent owns over 50 percent of the combined voting power. Working capital assets held for qualified trade or business needs or research and experimentation financing within 2 years. A qualified small business must ensure that no more than 50 percent of its assets are used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business after being in existence for at least 2 years. Additionally, the business cannot have more than 10 percent of its total asset value in real estate that is not used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business. The ownership, dealing in, or renting of real property is not considered active conduct of a qualified trade or business. Computer software royalties are treated as assets used in the active conduct of a trade or business. Stock acquired by a qualified investor is not a qualified equity investment if redeemed from the investor or a related person. During a 4-year period, a qualified small business can issue stock as a qualified equity investment if it does not repurchase stock from the investor or a related person. However, significant redemptions within a 2-year period can disqualify the stock as a qualified equity investment. During a 2-year period, a qualified small business must avoid significant redemptions exceeding 5 percent of the aggregate stock value to maintain its qualified equity investment status. Transactions treated as stock redemption will be considered as the business purchasing its own stock. Additionally, no credit is allowed for qualified equity investments made by a qualified investor in a related party small business. The text discusses the definition of a related party for tax purposes and the recapture of credits in certain cases within a 3-year period of making a qualified equity investment. If a recapture event occurs, the tax for that year will increase by the credit recapture amount. The credit recapture amount is calculated as the decrease in credits allowed to the taxpayer for prior years due to the investment, plus interest. No deduction is allowed for the interest. A recapture event triggers an increase in tax for that year by the credit recapture amount. Recapture event occurs when a qualified equity investment is sold, transferred, or exchanged by the investor, not due to liquidation of the small business. Tax increase only applies to credits used to reduce tax liability. Unused credits affect carryforwards and carrybacks. The basis of a qualified equity investment is reduced by the amount of any credit determined under this section. Regulations require certification that the small business meets requirements for the equity investment.
