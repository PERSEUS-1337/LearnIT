    "content": "In Paul v. Virginia (1868), the Supreme Court ruled that issuing insurance policies is not interstate commerce. United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass'n (1944) applied federal antitrust laws to interstate insurance activities. This decision led to the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act, which preserved states' ability to tax insurance premiums and exempted the insurance business from federal antitrust laws. The McCarran-Ferguson Act preserves state regulation of insurance companies, with the exception of antitrust laws applying in cases of boycott. It defines the \"business of insurance\" and addresses state vs federal regulation. The act also discusses judicial opinions on what constitutes the business of insurance and the scope of the boycott exception. Additionally, it mentions related legislation introduced. The McCarran-Ferguson Act preserves state regulation of insurance companies, with the exception of antitrust laws applying in cases of boycott. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's insistence on insurers registering variable annuity contracts as securities, the Supreme Court ruled that neither state regulation nor issuance by insurers qualified the annuities as \"insurance,\" thus insurers could not invoke McCarran-Ferguson as a shield against federal regulation. The McCarran-Ferguson Act protects state regulation of insurance companies, except for antitrust laws in cases of boycott. The Supreme Court ruled that variable annuities do not qualify as \"insurance\" under McCarran-Ferguson, preventing insurers from using it as a shield against federal regulation. NationsBank v. VALIC also determined that banks offering fixed annuities are within their authorized powers. The McCarran-Ferguson Act protects state regulation of insurance companies, except for antitrust laws in cases of boycott. Federal statutes are generally not trumped by McCarran unless the \"business of insurance\" is directly involved. Securities and Exchange Commission v. National Securities, Inc. limited the term \"business of insurance\" to activities involving insurance companies' relationships with policyholders. The Act precluded federal securities laws from applying to a merger of two insurance companies approved by the Arizona Director of Insurance. The Supreme Court disagreed with the argument that a state statute aimed at protecting insurance company stockholders was regulating the \"business of insurance.\" The Court clarified that laws regulating the \"business of insurance\" focus on the relationship between insurance companies and policyholders. In a later case, the Court extended this ruling to include state laws addressing the liquidation of insurers as part of the \"business of insurance.\" The Supreme Court ruled that state laws regulating the payment of claims to policyholders of insolvent insurance companies are not preempted by federal statutes. The primary purpose of such laws is to protect policyholders, and they fall under the business of insurance. The Supreme Court distinguished between state laws regulating the payment of claims to policyholders of insolvent insurance companies and federal statutes. The court emphasized that statutes addressing the \"business of insurance\" may \"reverse-preempt\" conflicting federal laws, while those preempted under constitutional principles are not protected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act. In International Ins. Co. v. Duryee, the Sixth Circuit Court stated that the Act does not shield statutes only tangentially related to insurance from federal law supremacy. The curr_chunk discusses the waiver of constitutional rights by foreign corporations doing business in a state, citing a case where the broad category of laws regulating insurance encompasses more than just insurance business. Independent retail pharmacies accused Blue Shield of Texas of price fixing in Pharmacy Agreements, claiming the insurance company's policies allowed policyholders to buy drugs from any pharmacy. The Supreme Court rejected Blue Shield's argument that the Pharmacy Agreements were immune to prosecution under antitrust laws, emphasizing that the agreements aimed to minimize costs for Blue Shield, allowing policyholders to pay only $2 at participating pharmacies while nonparticipating pharmacies required full payment upfront. In Gilchrist v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., the court distinguished earlier decisions on the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson exemption, emphasizing challenges by non-policyholders to insurance companies' agreements with third parties. In Gilchrist v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., the court addressed challenges by non-policyholders to insurance companies' agreements with third parties. The case involved a policyholder claiming excessive premiums for subpar repair work on her car, directly challenging the insurance policy and rate-making decisions protected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act. State regulation does not need to meet federal antitrust law standards for the Act to apply, but the specific requirements for preempted \"regulation\" remain unclear. The FTC v. National Casualty Co. case determined that McCarran-Ferguson Act withdrew the authority from the FTC to regulate insurers' advertising practices in states with their own laws. States with prohibitory legislation against unfair insurance advertising were deemed sufficient for regulation purposes under the Act. State insurance departments have jurisdiction over insurance practices and the authority to act, as determined by a federal district court in Florida in 1982. The Supreme Court ruled in St. Paul Fire Marine Insurance Co. v. Barry that the McCarran law includes a consumer-protection facet, allowing doctors to sue insurance companies for unfavorable policy changes. The doctors accused companies of an unlawful conspiracy for refusing to sell malpractice policies, claiming it violated antitrust laws. The district court believed the boycott language in McCarran's law aimed to prevent blacklisting, but the appeals court disagreed, stating it did not threaten state authority. The Supreme Court agreed, stating the conduct aligned with a common understanding of a boycott. In Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, the Court differentiated between conspiracy and boycott, denying relief to nineteen states alleging similar claims. The Supreme Court differentiated between conspiracy and boycott in Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, denying relief to nineteen states alleging antitrust violations by insurers. The Court found that a true boycott involves a concerted refusal to deal on matters unrelated to the insurance contract, while a mere concerted refusal on contract terms central to the insurance contract is protected under the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The McCarran-Ferguson Act makes insurance industry conspiracy lawful unless it's considered a 'boycott.' Bills introduced in Congress aimed to end this exemption by amending the Act to apply antitrust laws to the business of insurance. The Federal Trade Commission Act would continue to apply to the business of insurance not regulated by State law, restoring the FTC's authority to investigate the insurance industry. Bills aimed to amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act to make antitrust laws applicable to insurance, removing the exemption for boycotts. Measures in the 109th Congress aimed to prohibit commercial insurers from price fixing in medical malpractice insurance. Joint rate setting is considered a valid business of insurance activity, but courts' narrow interpretation may exclude certain activities. Language in future bills may not be necessary to enable antitrust enforcement policies in the insurance industry. H.R. 2400 proposed establishing the Emergency Malpractice Liability Commission to address rising medical malpractice premiums and their impact on healthcare accessibility. The Commission would investigate the causes and effects of premium increases, jury awards, and physician shortages. The bill was pending in committee. H.R. 2401 aimed to amend McCarran-Ferguson to make antitrust laws generally applicable to the insurance industry, except for the smallest entities. It would prohibit activities like price fixing and monopolization but allow joint collection of historical loss data. The bill was still pending in committee. The \"Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2006\" aimed to subject the insurance industry to federal antitrust law, clarifying that federal antitrust laws would apply except when conduct is pursuant to a state policy actively supervised by that state. This bill acknowledged the original purpose of McCarran-Ferguson to allow states to regulate insurance and the state action doctrine in antitrust law. The state action doctrine in antitrust law, as outlined in S. 2509, would have made federal antitrust laws applicable to federally licensed insurance producers, while retaining the \"business of insurance\" exemption under McCarran-Ferguson to the extent that insurers and producers are subject to state law. The doctrine, established in Parker v. Brown, asserts that antitrust laws do not apply to states, evolving since 1943 to encompass various interpretations and expansions. The state action doctrine in antitrust law, established in Parker v. Brown in 1943, confers antitrust immunity on states, state agencies, private individuals acting in furtherance of state-directed activity, and those acting pursuant to state-sanctioned courses of action. The doctrine requires that the challenged restraint be clearly articulated as state policy and actively supervised by the State itself, as outlined in California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass 'n v. Midcal Aluminum Inc. Since 1980, being \"regulated by state law\" has been a prong of the judicially created state action doctrine in antitrust. The state action doctrine in antitrust law, established in Parker v. Brown in 1943, confers antitrust immunity on states, state agencies, and private entities acting under state authority. The doctrine requires clear articulation of state policy and active state supervision. Since 1980, being \"regulated by state law\" has been a key aspect of the state action doctrine in antitrust. The McCarran-Ferguson Act grants states immunity from federal antitrust laws, with insurance entities considered \"derivative beneficiaries.\" The adequacy of state insurance regulation to meet the \"active supervision\" requirement is uncertain. Legislative attempts to limit the Act's scope remain uncertain due to the state-action doctrine."
