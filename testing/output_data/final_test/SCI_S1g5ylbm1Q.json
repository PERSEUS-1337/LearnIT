They use a universal lexical representation to overcome input-output mismatch across languages and evaluate the strategy on European and diverse languages, showing significant performance improvement over transfer learning approaches. The proposed approach aims to improve low-resource neural machine translation by utilizing a universal lexical representation. It has shown success in achieving high BLEU scores on Romanian-English translation with limited training examples. Despite the success of neural machine translation, it often lags behind traditional systems for low-resource language pairs. Various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, including leveraging monolingual corpora and multilingual translation techniques. In this paper, a meta-learning algorithm for low-resource neural machine translation is proposed based on multilingual NMT. The model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) is applied to find the initialization of model parameters for fast adaptation to new language pairs with minimal training examples. The approach overcomes the limitation of handling tasks with mismatched input and output by incorporating a universal lexical representation. The proposed meta-learning algorithm for low-resource neural machine translation utilizes a universal lexical representation to address tasks with mismatched input and output. It is evaluated on 17 languages from Europarl and Russian from WMT as source tasks, outperforming multilingual translation approaches across all target languages. Neural machine translation models factor the distribution over possible output sentences into conditional probabilities using a left-to-right causal structure. Different architectures, including those without recurrent structures, have been proposed to improve training speed and performance. Low resource translation can lead to inferior performance, but can be addressed by utilizing unlabeled monolingual data or sharing knowledge between languages. Utilizing unlabeled monolingual data and sharing knowledge between low- and high-resource language pairs are key strategies in machine translation research. Various methods such as multi-task learning, back-translation, dual learning, and unsupervised machine translation have been explored. Additionally, using a pivot language or auxiliary tasks can help build translation paths between languages. Multilingual neural machine translation systems have shown promise in handling translation tasks when pivots are not readily available. Meta-learning, also known as learning-to-learn, focuses on fast adaptation to new training data. It has been successfully applied to few-shot learning, where a neural network learns to classify inputs with minimal training examples. This approach is beneficial for low-resource cases in multilingual machine translation, improving performance by sharing embedding information across languages. Previous work assumed joint training of high-resource languages naturally results in a universal space, but this is not always true, especially for very low resource cases. In this paper, a meta-learning algorithm is proposed for low-resource neural machine translation, focusing on fast adaptation with minimal training examples. The approach extends the idea of model-agnostic metalearning (MAML) to the multilingual scenario, using high-resource language pairs to find good initial parameters for training a new translation model on a low-resource language. The proposed meta-learning method for low-resource neural machine translation involves meta-learning the initialization from auxiliary tasks and continuing to learn the target task. The method, referred to as MetaNMT, utilizes an isotropic Gaussian prior distribution for the parameters of the desired NMT model. The learning process aims to maximize the logposterior of the model parameters given data, with a focus on discouraging the newly learned model from deviating too much from the initial parameters. In low-resource neural machine translation, the MetaNMT method involves meta-learning the initialization from auxiliary tasks to prevent overfitting. The initialization \u03b8 0 strongly influences the final model performance, determined through simulating low-resource translation scenarios. The meta-objective function is maximized using stochastic approximation with gradient descent. MetaNMT involves meta-learning the initialization from auxiliary tasks to prevent overfitting in low-resource neural machine translation. The process includes sampling a source task, simulating language-specific learning, evaluating outcomes, and updating parameters using meta-gradients. The resulting model \u03b8 0 is a good starting point for training a better model with a few learning steps. The MetaNMT approach involves meta-learning the initialization from auxiliary tasks to prevent overfitting in low-resource neural machine translation. It aims to find the initialization of a neural machine translation system that can quickly adapt to a new language pair by simulating fast adaptation scenarios using high-resource language pairs. The simplified update rule is derived by ignoring the second-order term in the approximation property. This approach differs from existing multilingual translation or transfer learning frameworks. The MetaNMT approach involves meta-learning the initialization from auxiliary tasks to prevent overfitting in low-resource neural machine translation. It aims to quickly adapt to a new language pair by simulating fast adaptation scenarios using high-resource language pairs. The major difference from existing multilingual transfer approaches is that MetaNMT explicitly incorporates the learning process within the framework. This results in a substantial performance gap on the low-resource task. Transfer learning, multilingual learning, and meta-learning are contrasted using different source and target language pairs in the experiments. MetaNMT involves meta-learning the initialization from auxiliary tasks to prevent overfitting in low-resource neural machine translation. It aims to quickly adapt to new language pairs by simulating fast adaptation scenarios using high-resource language pairs. Meta-learning trains the NMT system to be useful for fine-tuning on various tasks, including source and target tasks, by repeatedly simulating the learning process on low-resource languages using high-resource language pairs. One major challenge is the I/O mismatch across language pairs, limiting the application of meta-learning for low-resource machine translation. In low-resource neural machine translation, the I/O mismatch across language pairs poses a challenge. To address this, a Universal Lexical Representation (ULR) approach is proposed, using a key-value memory network to dynamically build language-specific vocabularies. This method aims to overcome the vocabulary mismatch issue in multilingual translation by creating language-specific embeddings from large monolingual corpora. The Universal Lexical Representation (ULR) approach aims to create language-specific embeddings from large monolingual corpora to overcome vocabulary mismatch in multilingual translation. It involves building a universal embedding matrix and key matrix for each language, allowing for handling languages with different vocabularies using shared parameters. The universal embedding matrix is not updated when finetuning on a small corpus to avoid adverse effects on other tokens. During language-specific learning, query embedding vectors are initialized for all languages using monolingual corpora from Wikipedia and parallel corpus. Word vectors are estimated using fastText and aligned across languages using MUSE to obtain multilingual word vectors. The 20,000 most frequent English words form the universal embedding matrix u. The Transformer model is used with universal lexical representation for NMT. Default hyperparameters are used across all language pairs. The meta-learning method can be applied to other NMT architectures. Source languages are varied to study the impact on learning. A single gradient step is used for language-specific learning in each episode. The study focuses on fine-tuning strategies for the Transformer model in NMT. Different modules are selectively tuned during fine-tuning, with options to tune all modules, only the embedding and encoder, or just the embedding. Tasks of varying sizes are used for each language pair, and the performance is evaluated on test sets. The study compares different fine-tuning strategies for the Transformer model in NMT. The proposed meta-learning approach outperforms multilingual transfer learning across all target tasks. The emb+enc strategy is found to be most effective for both meta-learning and transfer learning. With the proposed approach, NMT systems achieve significant performance with a fraction of the training examples. The study compares fine-tuning strategies for the Transformer model in NMT. The meta-learning approach outperforms multilingual transfer learning. The choice of validation task impacts performance. Meta-learning is more robust to varying target task training set sizes. The meta-learning approach is shown to be more robust to smaller target task training set sizes, with the gap between meta-learning and transfer learning increasing as the size shrinks. Results on five target tasks while varying the source task set show that using more source tasks is beneficial, with up to 2\u00d7 improvement going from one source task to 18 source tasks. The meta-learning approach shows up to 2\u00d7 improvement when using 18 source tasks for various language pairs. Different source languages have varying impacts on target languages. MetaNMT outperforms multilingual transfer learning in training curves, ensuring continuous improvement without overfitting.

It shows improvements in translation quality by rapidly learning to reorder tokens after seeing a small number of sentence pairs. The system utilizes universal lexical representation and meta-learned initialization for better performance across different language pairs.

It shows significant improvements in translation quality across various language pairs and opens new opportunities for incorporating additional data sources.
