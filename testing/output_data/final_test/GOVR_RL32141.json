    "content": "Congress recently completed action on the Bush Administration's FY2004 supplemental budget request to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The debate in Congress revolves around whether these operations should be funded through supplemental requests or the regular defense appropriations process. Some argue for including the costs in the annual defense budget, while others prefer supplementals due to the unpredictability of military circumstances. Since FY1990, Congress has funded combat operations with supplemental appropriations, while initial post-combat peacekeeping operations have relied on a combination of supplemental and regular appropriations. As peacekeeping operations become ongoing, Congress switches to using regular appropriations. Funding patterns for combat operations in various conflicts show they were initially funded with supplemental appropriations, requested shortly after operations began and approved by Congress within months. In the past decade, Congress generally funded combat operations with supplemental appropriations and ongoing peacekeeping operations with regular appropriations. Bosnia was an exception, with initial involvement funded by DOD using resources previously appropriated by Congress. In the past decade, Congress funded combat operations with supplemental appropriations and ongoing peacekeeping operations with regular appropriations. Congress used supplemental appropriations for initial post-combat peacekeeping in Haiti and Kosovo, switching to regular appropriations in later years. Funding for combat operations in Bosnia and ongoing peacekeeping in Kosovo has been supported by a mix of supplemental and regular appropriations. The transition from supplemental to regular appropriations for the First Gulf War and Southwest Asia operations took place over 11 years. The First Gulf War operations were funded through a mix of supplemental and regular appropriations. Initially, Operation Desert Shield received funding from supplemental appropriations and allies' contributions. Regular appropriations were used early on, unlike in later conflicts. The largest appropriations came from the FY1991 Desert Shield/Desert Storm supplemental. The $42.6 billion supplemental appropriation for the \"No-Fly\" zones in Southwest Asia following the First Gulf War was the longest use of supplemental appropriations. Unlike Kosovo and Haiti, the \"No-Fly\" zones were funded partially with supplemental appropriations in FY1992 and FY1993, fully in FY1994 and FY1995, and then transitioned to regular appropriations in FY1996. The \"No-Fly\" zones transitioned from supplemental to regular appropriations between FY1992 and FY1996. Congress used a combination of regular and supplemental appropriations from FY1997 to FY1999, then returned to regular appropriations in FY2000 and FY2001. The interim period for the \"No-Fly\" zones was longer compared to peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Haiti. Major military operations in Afghanistan ended in December 2001 and in Iraq on May 1, 2003. The operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have been funded through supplemental appropriations, including the FY2004 supplemental. Despite the President declaring the end of major combat, low-intensity conflict persists, raising questions about ongoing peacekeeping status. Congress may need to establish criteria for designating ongoing operations for regular appropriations. The DOD covered some costs using existing resources originally programmed for other purposes. The table was assembled by [author name scrubbed] and Nina Serafino of CRS, using public laws and congressional reports. Specific cost information for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, Kosovo, and the Persian Gulf War can be found in CRS reports."
