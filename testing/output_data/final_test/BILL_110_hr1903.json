    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" summarizes the title and key findings of a section. The \"Post-Prostate Cancer Treatment Equity Act of 2007\" acknowledges the prevalence of prostate cancer and the need for reconstructive prosthetic urology surgery for complications post-prostatectomy. While Medicare and most private health benefits cover this surgery, one-third of private health benefits do not. This Act aims to address this disparity, similar to the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act for breast cancer. Men should have the right to access reconstructive surgery following a prostatectomy, similar to women's right to reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy as mandated by the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998. Amendment to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to include required coverage for reconstructive prosthetic urology surgery following prostate cancer treatment. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide coverage for reconstructive prosthetic urology surgery and prostheses related to prostate cancer treatment, as determined by the attending physician and patient. Coverage may include deductibles and coinsurance, with notice given to participants upon enrollment and annually thereafter. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide notice to participants and beneficiaries regarding coverage required by regulations. Notice must be in writing and transmitted in the next mailing, yearly informational packet, or by January 1, 2008. Group health plans and health insurance issuers are prohibited from denying eligibility or coverage renewal to avoid requirements. They cannot penalize providers or offer incentives to provide care inconsistent with regulations. This does not prevent negotiation of coverage levels. Group health insurance coverage negotiation with providers is allowed, and state laws regarding coverage requirements are not preempted. ERISA provisions remain unaffected by this section. Sec. 714 requires coverage for reconstructive prosthetic urology surgery after prostate cancer treatment. The effective dates for these amendments are specified, with a special rule for collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. This section mandates coverage for reconstructive prosthetic urology surgery following prostate cancer treatment in both group and individual health plans. The provisions of section 2707 of the title apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market as they do in connection with a group health plan in the small or large group market. Effective dates for group plans begin on or after the first day of the sixth month after the enactment of this Act. The amendment made by subsection (b) applies to health insurance coverage in the individual market starting six months after the enactment of the Act."
