The Congress defines \"classified school employees\" as workers in various job families providing essential services to public schools in the United States, including paraprofessionals, clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, transportation services, food services, skilled trades, health and student services, security services, and technical services. Classified school employees are essential for student welfare and safety, striving for excellence in all areas of service to the education community. Exemplary employees should be recognized for their outstanding contributions to quality education in the United States. A recognition program is established for exemplary school employees who contribute to quality education in the United States. The Secretary of Education will establish the \"National Classified School Employees of the Year Awards\" program to recognize and promote excellence in certain occupational specialties in public schools. These specialties include paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative services, transportation services, food and nutrition services, custodial and maintenance services, security services, and health and student services. The Secretary of Education will select employees from various occupational specialties in public schools to receive awards under the recognition program. Nominations will be solicited from each specialty by the chief State school officer of each State. The chief State school officer of each State will consider nominations from various groups for the recognition program. Nominations must demonstrate excellence in work performance, school and community involvement, leadership, local support, and enhancing the image of classified school employees. The Secretary will develop national guidelines for evaluating nominations based on excellence in work performance, community involvement, leadership, and image enhancement of classified school employees. Elementary and Secondary Education Act 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801) was passed by the House of Representatives on March 15, 2010. Attest: LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
