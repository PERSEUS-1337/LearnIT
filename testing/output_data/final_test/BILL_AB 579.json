    "title": "AB 579",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1250.8 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 1250.8 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to allow the department to issue a single consolidated license to a general acute care hospital with multiple physical plants or licenses, excluding skilled nursing or intermediate care facilities. The criteria for issuing a single consolidated license to a general acute care hospital with multiple facilities include having a single governing body, administration, and medical staff with unified bylaws and regulations. The director may issue a single consolidated license to a general acute care hospital with multiple facilities located more than 15 miles apart under certain circumstances, such as if one facility is in a rural area, provides only outpatient services, or operates as an emergency department. If Section 14105.986 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is implemented, a nonprofit children's hospital affiliated with a major university medical school and operating a regional tertiary care facility may qualify for a consolidated license if located in specific counties and cities. The state department issues a single consolidated license for a general acute care hospital, specifying the location of supplemental services and beds. The license must be renewed annually and requires a certificate of need for transferring special services between facilities. The state department requires a certificate of need for transferring supplemental services between facilities, with notification and cost estimate needed 30 days prior to relocation. The licensee must obtain a certificate of need before transferring beds between facilities. Notification and cost estimate are required 30 days prior to relocation, including details of the beds being transferred. Health facility beds transferred must remain in the same classification for two years after transfer, unless a certificate of need is obtained. Transferring beds back to the original facility requires a certificate of need as well. Transfers of health facility beds must meet licensure requirements and obtain written approval from the state department. The state department can create regulations, including the need for onsite administrators for each facility under a single license. \"Facility\" refers to a physical plant operated by a health facility with a consolidated license. For selective provider contracts under the Medi-Cal program, a health facility with a single consolidated license must negotiate with the California Medical Assistance Commission. A general acute care hospital with a single consolidated license can choose to enroll in Medi-Cal as a single business address or separate addresses. The hospital may need to file separate cost reports for each facility under the single license. The state department and the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development may require general acute care hospitals with a single consolidated license to report bed and service utilization data separately for each facility. Amendments made during the 1985-86 legislative session regarding single consolidated licenses do not apply to certain facilities. A facility that obtained a certificate of need after August 1, 1984, and prior to February 14, 1985, for the construction of a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility may apply for a single consolidated license. Facilities with a single consolidated license issued before the 1985-86 legislative session amendments will be granted renewal licenses based on the same criteria. If a single consolidated license is issued by the state department, they may take any authorized action, including those specified in Article 5, regarding a facility or service included in the license. The eligibility for participation in the Medi-Cal program of a facility included in a consolidated license, providing outpatient services more than 15 miles from the health facility issued the license, is subject to state department determination. This does not apply to rural facilities included in a consolidated license. Regardless of eligibility determination, licensed professionals can still provide Medi-Cal covered services to eligible individuals in these facilities. The Medi-Cal program allows eligible individuals in facilities to bill for services provided in accordance with regulations. The director may issue a single consolidated license for a general acute care hospital to Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland and San Ramon Regional Medical Center or the John Muir Medical Center, Concord Campus. Payments to Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland under Section 14166.11 of the Welfare and Institutions Code may be adjusted based on Medi-Cal payment days and net revenues from the John Muir Medical Center, Concord Campus. The number of Medi-Cal payment days for hospital beds at John Muir Medical Center, Concord Campus included in the consolidated license shall only be used for calculating disproportionate share hospital payments at Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland. This provision will be inoperative if the two facilities covered under the consolidated license are within a 15-mile radius of each other. Additionally, a new section 1255.15 is added to the Health and Safety Code. Section 1255.15 of the Health and Safety Code allows emergency medical services to continue at a closing hospital's location by an acquiring hospital with a special permit, even if basic services are not offered at the closing hospital's location. Section 1255.15 of the Health and Safety Code allows emergency medical services to continue at a closing hospital's location by an acquiring hospital with a special permit, even if basic services are not offered at the closing hospital's location. Pursuant to Section 1250.8, a single consolidated license can be issued to the acquiring hospital for the provision of emergency medical services at the closing hospital's location within 15 miles of the acquiring hospital. Additionally, the director may issue a consolidated license for locations more than 15 miles apart if the acquiring hospital can demonstrate compliance with licensure requirements and quality care standards.

In this chapter, terms are defined as follows: ambulatory surgery procedures are outpatient surgeries in hospitals or ambulatory surgery clinics, emergency department refers to where emergency medical services are provided in a hospital, encounter is a face-to-face patient-provider interaction, and freestanding ambulatory surgery clinic is a licensed surgical clinic.
