These vehicles have a long history of service, with plans for continued use beyond FY2028. Congress is concerned about their long-term military effectiveness and economic impact. The M-1 Abrams Tank, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and Stryker Combat Vehicle are crucial for Armored Brigade Combat Teams. Congress is concerned about their long-term military effectiveness and economic impact. The M-1 Abrams Tank is named after General Creighton Abrams and is designed for battlefield combat with enemy armored forces. The M-1 Abrams Tank program began in December 1971, with prototype development awarded to Chrysler Corporation and General Motors. The Army accepted prototype vehicles in February 1976 and selected the Chrysler Corporation prototype for Full Scale Engineering Development in November 1976. The first M-1 tanks with a 105mm main gun were delivered in 1980, with a total of 2,374 tanks produced until February 1985. Production then shifted to the Improved M-1, completed in May 1986, followed by the acquisition of the M-1A1 version with a 120mm gun. The Army began acquiring the M-1A1 version of the Abrams Tank in May 1986, which included a 120mm smoothbore main gun, NBC protection system, and various armor and survivability improvements. General Dynamics Land Systems was awarded a contract for the M-1A2 version in 1988, with upgrades such as ICWS, CITV, and POS/NAV. The M-1A2 entered service in late 1992, with over 600 M-1 tanks upgraded to this configuration between 1996 and 2001. The M-1A2 is the baseline export version, with different armor and communications packages available depending on the purchasing country. The M-1 Abrams tank, with various armor and communications options, first saw combat in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. A 1992 GAO report praised its reliability, lethality, and survivability during the war, with Army readiness rates over 90%. Crews praised its accuracy and deadly ammunition against Iraqi armor, attributing it to superior sights, tank readiness, and soldier training. The M-1 Abrams tank demonstrated high levels of accuracy, tank readiness, and soldier training during Operation Desert Storm. Crews reported minimal damage from direct hits by Iraqi T-72 tanks, with no Abrams tanks destroyed. The tank's turbine engine impressed crews, but they were concerned about high fuel consumption and the need for frequent air filter cleaning in the desert. Refueling and faulty fuel pumps were constant issues, with sand-clogged filters reducing engine power. The M-2 Bradley is an Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) used for transporting infantry and providing fire support. It has a crew of three and carries six infantrymen. The M-3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) performs scouting missions with a three-person crew. The program for developing the M-2 and M-3 vehicles began in 1972 with the Ordnance Division of the FMC Corporation. The M-2/M-3 Fighting Vehicles, named the Bradley Fighting Vehicle after General Omar N. Bradley, were developed and produced starting in 1978. Various upgrades were made over the years, including improved NBC protection, ergonomic improvements, survivability features, transmission modifications, and a new engine. The Operation Desert Storm version was introduced in 1995, with a total of 6,385 M-2/M-3 vehicles produced. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle, named after General Omar N. Bradley, was handed over to the Army in February 1995, with a total of 6,385 M-2/M-3 Bradleys produced. Since then, all new Bradleys have been refurbished vehicles. The M-2/M-3 saw combat in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, with the A2 model being the majority. A 1992 GAO report praised the Bradley's performance in terms of reliability, lethality, mobility, and survivability. Army reported readiness rates for the Bradley were generally 90% or higher. The Bradley Fighting Vehicle had high readiness rates during the ground war, proving to be lethal with its 25-mm automatic gun and TOW missile system. Crews praised its speed, maneuverability, and range, especially the A2 model for its added engine power and armor protection. Despite hardware deficiencies like leaking radiators and unreliable heaters, the Bradley performed well in combat. Army officials were aware of these issues. The Stryker is a family of eight-wheeled combat vehicles based on the Canadian LAV III 8x8 light armored vehicle. The U.S. Army developed a medium-weight brigade combat team in 2003 to supplement light and heavy forces, aiming for quick deployment worldwide. Army crews identified needed vehicle improvements like a laser range finder and better sight magnification. The Army selected the General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS)\u2014Canada LAV III 8x8 Light Armored Vehicle for its new medium-weight brigade combat teams in 2000. The vehicle was named the Stryker Combat Vehicle in honor of two Medal of Honor recipients. The Army received its first ICV variant Strykers in September 2002, with the first Stryker Brigade Combat Team ready for operations in May 2003. Currently, there are eight Active and one Army National Guard SBCTs. The M-1126 Stryker saw its first combat service in October 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, with some reported issues including problems with the armored shield's effectiveness against grenades and the need for frequent tire checks and changes. The report highlights issues with the Stryker vehicles, including the impact of additional weight on handling, strain on the engine and drive shaft from mud, poorly designed commanders' displays, slow computers that overheat in desert temperatures, and a grenade launcher that fails to hit targets when the vehicle is moving. The report identifies various issues with the $157,000 grenade launcher on the Stryker vehicle, including its failure to hit targets when the vehicle is in motion, the need for redesign of its components, inability to work at night, and safety concerns with the swiveling launchers. Additionally, the vehicle's seat belts are difficult to latch with armored gear on, leading to fatal rollover accidents. Crews have also improvised protection around the gunner's hatch with sand-filled tin cans. The M-1A2 SEPv2 tank is an all-digital tank with new electronic backbone and powerful computers for split-second command and control. Its open architecture allows for easy integration of spin-off technologies. Improved digital displays enhance tank commanders' understanding of operational status and battlefield situation. Most ARNG ABCTs are equipped with M-1A1 SA tanks, except for two ABCTs and one battalion using M-1A2 SEPv2 tanks. Five ARNG ABCTs are equipped with the upgraded M-1A1 Situational Awareness tank, which includes Blue Force Tracker, FLIR thermal site, TUSK enhancements, and a driver's thermal viewer. The Marines have 445 M-1A1 tanks in service, with additional features such as a Deep Water Fording Kit and hardware for PLRS integration. The Army aimed to reduce the number of variants of Abrams and Bradleys during a modular reconfiguration in 2005. Changes in force structure led to increased recapitalization of combat vehicles, with plans for M-1A1 SA tanks in both the Active Component and Army National Guard. The Army's plans for tank funding shifted towards M-1A2 SEPv2's for various brigades, including the 116th ABCT and 155th ABCT. With a focus on Abrams fleet reset/recapitalization, production of M-1A2SEPv2 was halted to prioritize RDT&E and upgrades to all tanks starting in FY2017. The M-1A2 SEP v2 Abrams main battle tank is the Army's premier ground combat system, with advanced thermal sights and CITV providing hunter-killer capability. It is 110% better in defense and 50% better in offense than the M-1A1, with improved target acquisition and hit capabilities. The tank is all-digital, with a new electronic backbone for split-second Command and Control over combat. The M-1A2 SEP v2 Abrams main battle tank has an open architecture designed for easy integration of new technologies. The Built-In Test system ensures fast diagnosis and repair, improving combat availability and saving costs. Improved digital displays provide better operational status understanding for Tank Commanders and crews. The digital tanks are easier for the National Guard to maintain and train on, with embedded diagnostics and Vehicle Health Management Systems. Army schools currently offer training on the tank's computers and simulators for the tank's operating systems. The National Guard is in need of tank upgrades to ensure superiority over the M-1A1 tanks provided to other countries. Congress has allocated funding to upgrade 50 more M-1A1 tanks to the M-1A2 SEP Configuration, adding over 100 tanks to the Army's inventory. This upgrade will help maintain the tank industrial base and bridge the gap between current upgrades and future developments. The Army continues to field upgraded Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Active Army and National Guard units, including the Bradley A3 and Bradley ODS-SA vehicles. Upgrades include increased force protection with add-on armor, reactive armor tiles, and the Bradley Urban Survivability Kit. The Bradley Fire Support Team Vehicle now has the Fire Support Sensor System for precision targeting missions. PM Bradley is integrating new technologies into the vehicles. PM Bradley is integrating the FS3 on the M7 BFIST SA platform for the National Guard, pursuing vehicle upgrades via an ECP program to enhance space, reduce weight, increase power, and improve mobility for future network integration. There are eight Stryker variants in service with SBCTs, including the ICV for infantry transport and direct fire support, and the RV for reconnaissance missions. The RV is used for reconnaissance and surveillance operations, equipped with the LRAS3 system for long-range target detection. It carries a crew and scout squad, with armament including a .50 caliber machine gun or 40 mm grenade launcher. The M-1128 Mobile Gun System provides direct fire support with a 105 mm main gun, while the M-1129 Stryker Mortar Carrier offers high angle fire support with a 120 mm mortar system. The M-1130 Commander's Vehicle (CV) integrates communication, data, and control functions for combat operations, including C4ISR equipment. The CV allows commanders to analyze information and link to aircraft for mission planning. The M-1131 Fire Support Vehicle (FSV) provides fire support capabilities. The M-1131 Fire Support Vehicle (FSV) enhances surveillance, target acquisition, and communication for the SBCT with \"first round\" fire-for-effect capability. The FSV automates command and control functions for Fire Support Teams (FIST) and facilitates fire support planning and execution. The M-1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle (MEV) transports patients and medical teams, providing protection and medical evacuation to casualty collection points. The Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) detects NBC threats within its operational area. The Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle (NBCRV) detects and identifies chemical, biological, and radiological hazards, warns units of contamination, marks areas of contamination, and collects samples for analysis. Activities like modernization, recapitalization, and reset are undertaken to keep vehicles like Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker operational and effective over time. The Army uses terms like modernization, recapitalization, and reset interchangeably, causing confusion in funding oversight. Funding for these efforts comes from different accounts. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have allowed for significant modernization of Abrams and Bradleys. One study suggests the Active Component is nearly fully modernized. The Army exceeded its goal by upgrading 4,372 Bradleys, with 2,446 to the advanced A3 variant by FY09. The upgrade included modern optics, communication suite, and GPS navigation, giving the Bradley state-of-the-art digital technology. This upgrade ensures combat overmatch and complements the M1A2 Abrams SEP tank. The Bradley upgrade program was completed in FY11, modernizing the majority of the fleet. The Army completed its Bradley upgrade program in FY11, modernizing the bulk of the fleet. In the FY00 budget justification, the Army planned to modernize 1,700 tanks with the M1A2 upgrade and M1A2 System Enhancement Program (SEP). By FY12, 1,158 tanks were upgraded to the more advanced SEP configuration. The Army plans to upgrade only 42 more tanks in FY11 and FY12 to complete the program. The Abrams and Bradley programs modernized nearly the entire fleet of ground combat vehicles due to unexpected bonuses from supplemental war funding. The Army has equipped its active force with modern vehicles thanks to supplemental war funding. Plans include overhauling 1,600 Abrams tanks and 2,500 Bradley vehicles in stages over the next decade. Upgrading the fleet regularly is necessary but challenging in a constrained budget environment. The Army plans to modernize its vehicles in stages through engineering change proposals (ECPs), starting with updated suspensions and tracks for Bradleys. Future ECPs will focus on engines, transmissions, electrical power, and a new targeting sensor called 3rd generation FLIR. FLIR technology allows operators to see through darkness by detecting heat. The Army plans to modernize its vehicles with updated suspensions and tracks for Bradleys, followed by improvements to engines, transmissions, electrical power, and a new targeting sensor called 3rd generation FLIR. This FLIR technology detects heat and creates images to see through darkness, smoke, rain, snow, and fog. The new FLIR will incorporate an additional waveband for more clarity, allowing soldiers to see through the battlefield more clearly. Production of the 3rd generation FLIR components will begin in 2023 after the Army awards a development contract in fiscal year 2016. The FLIR program, set to begin production in 2023, presents a lucrative opportunity for defense contractors with an estimated value of over $2 billion. Industry sources believe that upgrading Abrams and Bradleys with 3rd generation FLIR technology will not be challenging. Raytheon and DRS Technologies are collaborating on the program, having already invested in prototypes. Upgrading vehicle electronics is complex due to rapid technological advancements, leading to obsolescence issues. The Army also plans to upgrade Stryker vehicles and Paladin howitzers. The Army is looking to upgrade its Stryker light armored vehicles and Paladin howitzers, but there may not be enough funds for every vehicle. The Army proposed suspending the upgrade of M-1A2s to the M-1A2SEPv2 variant to save money for developing the new M-1A3 variant. Concerns were raised about the impact on the U.S. industrial base. In response to concerns about the Army's proposal to suspend M-1A2 tank upgrades, Congress allocated additional funds in the defense budget to upgrade existing tanks. Army leadership reiterated their stance that no more M-1A2 tanks were needed, prompting House Members to express concern over the lack of funding for tank production. Concerns over the Army's lack of funding for M-1A2 tank production led Congress to allocate $346 million in the FY2014 defense budget for upgrades. Despite the Army's stance that no more tanks were needed, Congress included $90 million in FY2014 and $120 million in FY2015 for upgrades. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry defended the decision, stating that the funding was necessary to support the last tank plant in America and ensure its viability until 2019. The House and Senate committees allocated funds for tank upgrades to support the last tank plant in America until 2019. Upgrades included the Stryker Double V-Hull effort for increased protection and mobility. The DVH Engineering Change Proposal project will upgrade DVH Strykers with a new engine, suspension, driveline, tires, and electrical system. The vehicle's gross weight will increase, and the electrical system will be upgraded to a 910 amp alternator. The digital infrastructure will be set up for future upgrades, including smart displays and an upgraded Ethernet. The Army requested the 2nd Cavalry Regiment to be equipped with a 30 mm weapon system for enhanced direct fire support. The Army requested to equip the 2nd Cavalry Regiment with 30 mm cannons for direct fire support. The upgrade would cost $3.8 million per Stryker, including other improvements. Upgraded Strykers will be worked on at Anniston Army Depot and Joint Systems Manufacturing Center. Congress approved funding for the upgrade, with fielding expected to be completed by July 2018. The Army is also considering upgrading the entire Stryker fleet for increased lethality. The Army is considering upgrading the entire Stryker fleet for increased lethality, focusing on enhancements such as sensor, protection, and platform network improvements. This upgrade will not be limited to cannon application but may also include adding Javelin anti-tank guided missile-capable remote weapons stations to selected Stryker vehicles. These upgrades aim to improve firepower, early threat detection, survivability, and engagement range for Stryker Brigades. The Army is considering upgrading the entire Stryker fleet with enhancements such as sensor, protection, and platform network improvements. This may include adding mature technologies like the 30 mm cannon and Javelin anti-tank guided missiles to selected Stryker vehicles to enhance their anti-armor capabilities. The integration of these weapons could be quicker and less costly, potentially driving down modernization costs per vehicle. Additionally, the Army plans to test Active Protective Systems on combat vehicles before FY2019, focusing on \"soft-kill\" technologies initially and progressing to \"hard-kill\" technologies like missile defense systems. The Army is exploring the use of existing and foreign-produced Active Protection Systems (APS) for vehicles like Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker. They plan to experiment with commercially available APS systems for survivability enhancements. The Abrams and Stryker will be upgraded, while a successor to the Bradley, the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV), is in development. The previous attempt at a Bradley successor, the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), was deemed impractical. The Army is developing the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) as a successor to the Bradley, after the cancellation of the impractical Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) in 2013. BAE Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems received contracts to design concepts for the FFV in 2015. The Army plans to relax the requirement for the FFV to carry a full nine-man infantry squad, making it more feasible and affordable. Foreign Military Sales allow the U.S. to sell defense articles and services to foreign countries under certain conditions. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) are important for U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives, allowing allies to promote peace and stability in their region. FMS also enables weapon system interoperability between allies and benefits the industry by maintaining production lines. The U.S. has sold M-1A1 Abrams to Australia, Egypt, and Iraq, and provided M-1A2s to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia under FMS. Egypt awarded a contract to General Dynamics Land Systems to support the co-production of M-1A1 tanks at the Egyptian Tank Plant near Cairo. Egypt currently has 1,005 M-1A1 tanks with a long-term goal of 1,500. Morocco received 200 M1-A1 SA Abrams tanks in 2011 through an Excess Defense Article grant. Saudi Arabia acquired 400 M-2 Bradleys under FMS. Israel considered the Stryker for two brigades but decided to develop their own vehicle in 2005. The Army's combat vehicle industrial base is a crucial consideration for DOD, the Army, and Congress, as noted in DOD's 2013 Annual Industrial Capabilities Report. The Army upgrades and maintains its fleet of tracked vehicles using a combination of organic capabilities and private sector involvement. The average age of refurbished Abrams Tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles is only a couple of years. The production of Stryker combat wheeled vehicles has decreased over the years. The Army is considering the need to maintain production lines for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles at a minimum sustainment rate to avoid shutdown and startup costs. The Army is looking to maintain production lines for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker vehicles to avoid shutdown costs. Congress is interested in overseeing the Combat Vehicle Industrial Base due to decreased production of combat vehicles. A GAO report in June 2015 prompted the Army to assess the combat vehicle industrial base with the help of a private consulting firm in October 2012. The GAO conducted an assessment of the combat vehicle industrial base supporting the US Army and delivered the final report to Congress in April 2014. The report highlighted excess capacity in facilities, unique capabilities at each facility, critical skills like armor steel welding, and identified high-risk suppliers. The GAO report in 2014 identified excess capacity in combat vehicle production facilities, critical skills like armor steel welding, and high-risk suppliers. The Army plans to request $245 million from the ERI budget to accelerate production of upgraded M-1 Abrams and M-2 Bradleys. The Army plans to request funding from the ERI budget to accelerate production of upgraded M-1 Abrams and M-2 Bradleys, including one fully modernized Armored Brigade Combat Team equipment set in Europe. Additionally, there are considerations to upgrade the lethality of the Stryker fleet, prompting questions about program cost, timeline, required modifications, and operational capabilities. The potential impact of upgrading Stryker lethality on operational capabilities and deployability of Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs is being considered. Questions arise about the need for additional maintenance and support units/troops, the alignment of lethality upgrades with current and future threats, and the integration of \"soft-kill\" and \"hard-kill\" APS technologies into armored fighting vehicles to enhance survivability and reduce armor protection and weight. Challenges may include ensuring sufficient vehicle power for APS operation and meeting space requirements for mounting the technology. The Army is considering adopting Active Protection Systems (APS) for Abrams, Bradley, and Stryker fighting vehicles, but Congress may want to assess the benefits and risks first. This includes examining the physical space requirements, potential vehicle vulnerability if the APS fails, and the need for enhanced vehicle survivability."
