    "content": "The MDRI builds on previous debt relief initiatives by the G7 and other creditor countries in the 1980s and 1990s. The Paris Club agreed to cancel debts by up to one-third in 1988, increasing to 90% by 1999. The United States forgave almost all debt owed to it by the poorest nations in 1991, totaling $23.9 billion since then. The IMF and World Bank introduced debt relief in 1996 through the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, aiming to reduce poor countries' debts to a sustainable level. The program was redesigned in 1999 to lower the debt service-to-exports ratio to 150% and require increased poverty reduction efforts. HIPC debt relief is provided in stages based on each country's performance. Debt relief in HIPC initiative is provided in stages based on economic performance. Countries must implement IMF reforms for three years to reach \"decision point\" for intermediate relief. \"Completion point\" is reached with good economic policy. MDRI agreement was a compromise between the US and Europeans on debt relief funding. The IMF implemented the MDRI debt relief plan, canceling all HIPC debt incurred by 2004. MDRI was expanded to include all IMF members with low per capita incomes. Cambodia and Tajikistan are non-HIPC countries that qualified for MDRI relief. So far, the IMF has provided $3.67 billion in debt relief to 21 countries, with an expected total relief of $5 billion. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are providing MDRI relief to HIPC completion point countries for debts accrued before 2003. The World Bank will offer $37 billion in debt relief, while the African Development Bank will provide $8.5 billion. Policy-makers support debt relief for moral and pragmatic reasons, with arguments against requiring the poorest countries to repay their debts. The Bush Administration argued for debt relief to help poorest countries escape poverty and use resources for development. Recent studies question debt relief's impact on development and poverty reduction, suggesting underlying economic and political conditions are key. Congress may need to further explore this issue. The research highlights the impact of debt on poor countries' economies and the potential benefits of debt relief in promoting economic growth and poverty reduction. High levels of debt were traditionally seen as a hindrance to economic growth due to concerns about repayment ability and investor confidence. Even if the debt is not being serviced, it can still deter private investors, leading to a debt overhang situation that hampers economic growth. Debt overhang theory suggests forgiving debt to restore investor confidence. HIPC program reduced debt for 18 countries, but debt worsened in 11 out of 13 countries. Debt relief alone is not sufficient for debt sustainability in the poorest countries. Debt levels in HIPC countries exceed thresholds again. Previous debt overhang models may not apply to these countries. Unlike other debtor nations, investors are deterred by political and economic instability rather than just indebtedness concerns. The highly concessional nature of bilateral and multilateral HIPC debt, along with the inflow of foreign aid funds, means that debt service costs are effectively borne by donor countries rather than debtors. There may be a perverse incentive for countries to not grow in order to remain eligible for assistance, as evidenced by stagnation in some low-income countries. The impact of MDRI debt relief is expected to be modest as it does not increase overall resources for poor countries. Countries may hover just below the eligibility cutoff for concessional aid by diverting assistance towards consumption. The amount of debt relief provided by MDRI is small compared to the total aid received by African HIPCs. Debt relief, even if in addition to existing aid, has a minimal impact on domestic resources. It is most effective when part of a broader reform package including improved debt management and targeted policy changes."
