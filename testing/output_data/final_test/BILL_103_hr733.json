    "content": "The Act titled \"Charitable Solicitation Disclosure Act of 1993\" requires disclosure of information for charitable solicitations. The \"Charitable Solicitation Disclosure Act of 1993\" mandates charitable organizations to include specific information when soliciting contributions by mail, such as legal name, address, tax-exempt status, purpose of solicitation, and use of contributions. The \"Charitable Solicitation Disclosure Act of 1993\" requires charitable organizations to provide information about the contribution being solicited, including the program or activities for which the contribution will be used, and the obligation to furnish information in accordance with subsection (c). The information must be included with any solicitation for contributions by mail, presented in understandable language, located conspicuously, and appear in legible type in contrast with other printed matter on the solicitation. The \"Charitable Solicitation Disclosure Act of 1993\" requires charitable organizations to provide clear and easily understandable information in solicitations, including being audible in audio communication and visible in visual communication. The information must be in legible type, against a clear background, and remain visible for a sufficient period. Charitable organizations must provide a financial report for the most recent fiscal year upon request, including gross income, expenses for program services, fund raising, and management activities, functional expenses breakdown, and a balance sheet showing assets, liabilities, and net worth. The financial report for charitable organizations must include details such as assets, liabilities, net worth, program services expenditures, and an independent accountant's opinion for organizations with revenue over $50,000. Charitable organizations soliciting contributions must provide audit reports and information to the Postal Service upon request to verify compliance with the section. Certain exemptions apply, including membership organizations soliciting exclusively to their members and schools soliciting exclusively to students, alumni, faculty, and family members. Exemptions to charitable organizations soliciting contributions include those authorized by schools, colleges, or universities, solicitations for specified individuals with written consent, and organizations with limited revenue and all fundraising done by volunteers. For the purposes of this section, a charitable organization is defined as any person organized for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, humane, patriotic, scientific, literary, medical, religious, educational, or other eleemosynary purposes. Contributions refer to promises or grants made. The term 'contribution' refers to money or property given for charitable purposes. 'Program services' are activities carried out by a charitable organization. 'Fund raising activities' are integral parts of appeals for contributions. 'Management and general activities' pertain to the overall direction of the organization, excluding program services and fund raising activities. The term 'membership' excludes conferring membership solely for contributions. Section 3005(a) of title 39, United States Code, is amended to include charitable purposes without complying with section 3012. Section 3015 is added to chapter 30 of title 39, United States Code, for soliciting charitable contributions by mail. The Act will take effect one year after enactment."
