    "content": "On October 7, 2019, the United States and Japan signed two agreements after six months of negotiations. The U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement focuses on tariff reductions and quota expansions for improved market access, while the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement addresses digital aspects of commerce. These agreements mark the first stage of a broader trade liberalization negotiation between President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Congress will not need to approve the agreements, as the Trump Administration plans to use delegated tariff proclamation authorities to enact the changes. The U.S. and Japan signed two agreements in October 2019, focusing on tariff reductions and digital trade. The agreements do not require approval from Congress, as tariff changes will be enacted using delegated authorities. Japan's Diet ratified the pact on December 5, 2019, with the agreements set to enter into force on January 1, 2020. Congress faces issues regarding the agreements' limited coverage, compliance with WTO rules, and comparison to previous trade agreements. The TPP-11 agreements, particularly the USJTA tariff commitments, may have a significant impact depending on the outcome of future comprehensive bilateral negotiations. Some stakeholders see the second stage of trade talks as crucial for U.S. interests, but questions remain about the scope of issues to be covered and political support during an election year in the United States. The Administration notified Congress in October 2018 of its intent to begin negotiations, in line with TPA requirements. The Trump Administration's interest in a trade agreement with Japan stems from its withdrawal from the TPP in 2017. The focus is on bilateral agreements with major trade partners, especially those with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. The U.S.-Japan component of the TPP was economically significant due to existing trade agreements with other participants. The U.S. withdrawal from the TPP led Japan to spearhead the TPP-11 agreement, which includes comprehensive tariff liberalization commitments and rules on trade. Japan's FTA with the EU, which removes tariffs and establishes trade rules, went into effect in February 2019. Additional trade agreements involving Japan could compound U.S. exporter concerns, including the possible conclusion of the RCEP in 2020. Prime Minister Abe initially hesitated on bilateral U.S. trade negotiations due to Japan's commitment to TPP. Japan's decision to participate in bilateral talks with the U.S. came after President Trump raised the possibility of imposing unilateral motor vehicle tariffs on Japan. The importance of the U.S.-Japan security relationship and the renegotiation of the agreement on sharing the costs of U.S. troops stationed in Japan may have influenced Japan's decision. President Trump has called for Japan to increase its contributions significantly. Japan may increase its contributions by fourfold in bilateral trade agreement to reduce tension and address security issues. The Trump Administration may use cost-sharing negotiations to extract concessions in trade talks. Japan is the United States' fourth-largest trading partner, accounting for 5% of exports and 6% of imports in 2018. The two countries are major investment partners, with Japan's FDI in the U.S. valued at $484 billion. In 2018, Japanese FDI in the United States was $484 billion, mainly in manufacturing, while U.S. FDI in Japan was $125 billion, focused on finance and insurance. Key areas of U.S. interest in the trade relationship include market access for agricultural goods and removing nontariff barriers. Japan is a significant market for U.S. farmers, with $12.9 billion in agricultural exports in 2018, making it the third-largest export market for the U.S. Corn, beef, pork, soybeans, and wheat account for over 60% of total U.S. agricultural exports to Japan. In late 2018 and early 2019, U.S. agricultural exports to Japan declined by 7% ($8.3 billion) compared to the same period in 2018. Japanese imports of non-durum wheat, pork, and beef decreased, while imports from EU and TPP-11 countries increased. The U.S.-Japan agreement may improve the outlook for U.S. agricultural exporters with lower tariff rates. The largest U.S. import category from Japan is motor vehicles and parts, valued at $56.0 billion in 2018. Japan imports few U.S.-made autos, totaling $2.4 billion in 2018. Despite no auto tariffs, U.S. industry argues that nontariff barriers hinder exports to Japan. Japanese-owned production facilities in the U.S. employ over 170,000 workers. President Trump aims to increase U.S. auto production and employment through trade talks, but no provisions on motor vehicles were included in the stage one agreement. In May 2019, President Trump declared motor vehicle and parts imports from Japan and the EU as a threat to U.S. national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This determination allowed the President to impose import restrictions, including tariffs, to address the perceived threat. Japanese-owned auto firms, like Toyota, objected to the emphasis on U.S. ownership in the determination, highlighting their significant investments in the U.S. automotive industry. The President directed the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate with Japan and the EU to address the issue. The USTR was directed to negotiate with Japan and the EU regarding the threat of motor vehicle imports. After signing the USJTA, USTR Lighthizer mentioned no plans for additional Section 232 U.S. auto import restrictions. Japan is still subject to Section 232 tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum imports. Congress sets objectives for trade negotiations through Trade Promotion Authority legislation. The US Trade Promotion Authority legislation allows the President to negotiate FTAs with limited tariff reductions without further congressional action. Nontariff issues may require implementing legislation by Congress. The Trump Administration plans to implement limited trade agreements with Japan without full congressional approval. The Trump Administration plans to implement limited trade agreements with Japan without full congressional approval by using delegated authorities under Section 103(a) of TPA. Some have questioned if the President can establish rules of origin and modify import quotas under this authority. The language of Section 103(a) originated in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, focusing on tariff barriers in trade negotiations. The TPA-2015, effective through July 1, 2021, allows for modifications to U.S. tariffs and agreements addressing tariff barriers. President Obama used this authority in 2015 for an agreement within APEC to reduce duties on environmental goods. The \"stage one\" U.S.-Japan trade deal covers tariff and quota commitments on goods and digital trade, a departure from comprehensive U.S. trade agreements. Neither agreement includes a formal dispute resolution mechanism. The US-Japan trade agreements do not include a formal dispute settlement mechanism. The USJTA covers tariff and quota commitments with a 60-day consultation process for resolving issues. A future comprehensive deal may include a formal dispute settlement mechanism, but its impact on the initial agreements is unclear. The US-Japan trade agreement outlines tariff reductions and rules of origin for preferential tariff treatment on $14.4 billion of bilateral trade. The agreement is narrower in scope compared to TPP-11 and EU-Japan FTA, focusing only on tariffs and quotas for agricultural provisions. The US-Japan trade agreement focuses on tariffs and quotas for agricultural provisions, putting US agricultural exporters at a disadvantage compared to TPP-11 countries and the EU. The lack of legal text on non-market-access provisions in the USJTA may limit the ability to challenge future trade barriers in Japan related to issues like agricultural biotechnology and sanitary measures. The tariff schedule commits the US to reduce or eliminate tariffs on $7.2 billion of imports. The US-Japan trade agreement aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs on 241 tariff lines, accounting for $7.2 billion of U.S. imports from Japan in 2018. The agreement allows for tariff elimination on 169 tariff lines and a 50% reduction on the remaining 72, with a focus on products with less than a 5% current U.S. most-favored nation tariff rate. Unlike the TPP, the USJTA covers fewer products and affects a smaller share of U.S. imports from Japan. The US-Japan trade agreement covers fewer products compared to TPP, excluding autos and auto parts. The agreement focuses on industrial goods, with machinery, electrical machinery, and tools being the main categories. Other products include optical/medical equipment and iron and steel articles. The US-Japan trade agreement covers various product categories, including optical/medical equipment, iron and steel articles, rubber, organic and inorganic chemicals, musical instruments, copper, photographic goods, railway, and toys. The agreement eliminates tariffs on top 10 products, totaling $3 billion of U.S. imports in 2018. Additionally, the United States will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 42 agricultural tariff lines from Japan. Under the US-Japan trade agreement, the United States agreed to modify its tariff-rate quota for Japanese beef, eliminating the country-specific quota and increasing the quota for \"other countries or areas\" to 65,005 MT. Japan, in return, agreed to eliminate or reduce tariffs on certain U.S. agricultural products and provide preferential quotas for others, covering approximately 600 tariff lines worth $7.2 billion of U.S. exports in 2018. In 2018, Japan agreed to provide market access to USJTA products similar to TPP-11 countries, with exceptions like rice and dairy. Over 90% of U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Japan will enter duty-free or receive preferential tariff access. Japan implemented tariff cuts and TRQ expansions for TPP-11 countries in December 2018 and April 2019. Japan accelerated TRQ expansion and tariff reduction schedule in the USJTA to match TPP-11 market access levels. Under the USJTA, U.S. agricultural products will have the same market access as TPP-11 countries, with faster tariff reductions. For example, tariffs on Japanese imports of U.S. beef will be reduced to 26.6% in Year 1 and reach 9% in Year 15. Tariffs on meat products accounting for $2.9 billion of U.S. exports to Japan will be reduced or eliminated over 5 to 15 years. Japan's ability to raise tariffs on U.S. beef will be restricted, and eliminated if not exceeded for four consecutive years after Year 14. Tariffs on pork muscle cuts will also be reduced. Under the USJTA, tariffs on pork muscle cuts are to be eliminated over 9 years, and tariffs on processed pork products are to go to zero in Year 5. Japan's variable levies on certain fresh and frozen pork products will be reduced by almost 90% by Year 9. Japan will gradually increase the amount of U.S. fresh, chilled, and frozen pork that can be imported annually without triggering additional tariffs, with tariffs to be terminated at the end of Year 10. Additionally, Japan will eliminate tariffs immediately on selected products such as almonds, walnuts, blueberries, and sweet corn, which collectively accounted for $1.3 billion of U.S. exports to Japan in 2018. Under the USJTA, Japan will eliminate tariffs on various agricultural products such as almonds, walnuts, blueberries, and sweet corn, which totaled $1.3 billion in U.S. exports to Japan in 2018. Tariffs on corn used for feed, the largest U.S. agricultural export to Japan, will also be removed. Japan will phase out tariffs for products totaling $3 billion in U.S. exports, including cheeses, processed pork, poultry, beef offal, ethanol, wine, frozen potatoes, oranges, fresh cherries, egg products, and tomato paste. Country-specific quotas (CSQ) will be provided for certain products, granting preferential tariff rates. Japan agreed to create a single whey CSQ for the United States starting at 5,400 MT and growing to 9,000 MT in Year 10, combining provisions for whey under TPP. They also improved access for U.S. skim milk powder through an annual global tender for 750 MT. Japan reduced mark-up on imported U.S. wheat and barley and limited the use of safeguard measures. Japan has agreed to limit safeguard measures on U.S. whey, oranges, and race horses. They aim to match agricultural tariffs with TPP-11 countries but fall short on TRQ schedule. The U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement does not include a CSQ for U.S. rice, unlike the TPP-11 which has provisions for Australian rice. Japan's average MFN tariff on agricultural imports was 15.7% in 2018, with many products subject to additional mark-ups through the state trading system, leading to higher prices for Japanese consumers. Import fill rates for whey and skim-milk powder under TRQs were low in 2017. The fill rates for skim-milk powder TRQs in Japan ranged from 25% to 34%, with limited trade beyond quota levels due to high over-quota tariff rates. The U.S. and Japan share similar goals in addressing digital trade barriers, with the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement seen as a comprehensive and high-standard trade deal to promote economic activity and innovation through digital technologies. The U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement reflects the proposed USMCA and U.S. negotiating objectives, serving as a template for future U.S. FTAs. It demonstrates the leading role of both nations in global rulemaking on digital trade, setting precedents for other talks, including at the WTO on e-commerce. Key provisions and comparisons with USMCA and TPP-11 are highlighted. The U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement, USMCA, and TPP-11 all include provisions on digital trade, cross-border data flows, customs duties, nondiscrimination, and data localization. The agreement allows for potential amendments and termination, prohibits customs duties on electronically transmitted products, discrimination against digital products, and restrictions on cross-border data flows. It also prohibits data localization requirements for conducting business. The U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement, USMCA, and TPP-11 all have provisions on digital trade, cross-border data flows, customs duties, nondiscrimination, and data localization. Financial service providers are covered under data localization rules for regulatory purposes. Commitments include adopting online consumer protection laws and privacy frameworks to protect personal information of digital trade users. Unlike USMCA, there is no explicit reference to international privacy frameworks like APEC. The U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement, USMCA, and TPP-11 include provisions on digital trade, cross-border data flows, customs duties, nondiscrimination, and data localization. The APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) system is endorsed by the United States and Japan. Source code and technology transfer commitments prohibit the transfer of software source code as a condition for market access. Liability for interactive computer services limits civil liability for internet platforms. The curr_chunk discusses concerns about inclusion in U.S. FTAs, cybersecurity collaboration, open government data access, and cryptography regulations in trade agreements. The curr_chunk discusses the positive reception of stage one agreements by Members of Congress and U.S. stakeholders for benefits to agriculture and digital trade. However, many believe these deals should not replace a comprehensive agreement, with the second stage seen as crucial. The U.S. Trade Advisory Committee Report reflects varied views, with the private sector supporting the initial deals but urging immediate negotiation of a comprehensive agreement. The Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee also plays a role in representing state interests. The Policy Advisory Committee (IGPAC) and the Labor Advisory Committee criticized the USJTA for not meeting negotiating objectives and being a lopsided agreement. Industry committees raised concerns about lack of consultation and dispute settlement provisions. Despite its importance for U.S. agriculture in the Japanese market, there are worries about product exclusions and nontariff barriers. Some experts caution against the tariff-only approach for future U.S. agreements. Some stakeholders question political support for future talks, especially during a U.S. election year. The U.S. may have limited leverage to secure further concessions in the agriculture sector. Trade experts believe the U.S.-Japan agreement fails to maximize economic potential and leadership in rulemaking. Successful next-stage talks are seen as critical. Some stakeholders question political support for future talks, especially during a U.S. election year. The U.S. may have limited leverage to secure further concessions in the agriculture sector. Trade experts believe the U.S.-Japan agreement fails to maximize economic potential and leadership on rulemaking. Successful next-stage talks are seen as critical for an American return to the regional economic architecture. Prime Minister Abe framed the agreement as a \"win-win outcome,\" but some Japanese observers criticize it as one-sided, benefiting the U.S. interests. Critics point to the lack of U.S. market access commitments in the auto sector and the absence of a concrete commitment not to impose Section 232 auto tariffs. The U.S. and Japan indirectly addressed tariff issues in a joint statement, with Japan assuming economic benefits from a trade deal without U.S. auto tariffs. Some Japanese Diet members doubt this concession. Analysts believe Japan's bilateral talks dim prospects for U.S. rejoining TPP. The deal favored Japan by avoiding auto tariffs and quickly concluding a goods agreement. Minister Abe's initial characterization of the deal includes Japan's concessions in agriculture, limited to commitments in past Japanese trade agreements. Japanese industry broadly welcomes the agreement, especially sectors benefiting from reduced U.S. tariffs. Japan ratified the agreements on December 5, 2019, with the Trump Administration expected to implement agreed tariff changes in December for entry into force in January 2020. The Administration looks forward to further negotiations with Japan for a more comprehensive trade agreement. The United States and Japan intend to conclude consultations within four months after the entry into force of the trade agreement. The next-stage negotiations will cover customs duties, trade barriers, and other issues to promote fair and reciprocal trade. The agreements with Japan represent a significant shift in U.S. trade policy. The U.S. and Japan are planning to conclude trade agreement consultations within four months. The agreements with Japan signify a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, prompting debate in Congress over the Administration's plan to implement the agreements without congressional approval. Members are seeking clarification on how the Administration can enter into a tariff agreement with Japan under TPA authorities. Some analysts and Members question if TPA allows changes in rules of origin and quota modifications under tariff agreements with Japan. Future debate on TPA reauthorization should consider congressional intent. Some Members are open to the Administration implementing the agreements without congressional approval. Questions have been raised about the Administration fulfilling consultation requirements under TPA. Digital trade commitments may not require changes to U.S. law, but certain provisions have sparked concerns. The inclusion of certain provisions in U.S.-Japan trade agreements has sparked congressional debate on the role of Congress in limited trade agreements under TPA. Key questions include potential changes to delegated authorities in future TPA reauthorization. The Trump Administration outlined 22 specific areas of focus for bilateral negotiations with Japan, with stage one agreements including provisions related to a limited reduction of tariffs. The U.S.-Japan trade agreements include provisions on limited tariff reductions and digital trade. Future negotiations for remaining issues are uncertain due to political factors. Some advisory committees suggest a multi-stage approach may hinder achieving the best outcomes. Economic impact and the use of Section 103(a) proclamation authorities are also concerns. The U.S.-Japan trade agreements involve limited tariff reductions and digital trade provisions. An economic assessment by the USITC is not required for this stage one deal. The deal could benefit U.S. agricultural exporters by providing improved access to Japan's market. Congress may question how these agreements impact future negotiations and if staged trade negotiations align with TPA objectives. President Trump's use of tariff authorities under Section 232 raises concerns about national security threats. President Trump's use of tariff authorities, including Section 232, has been seen as a critical tool in trade negotiations. Japan's Foreign Minister emphasized the importance of avoiding auto tariffs in the U.S.-Japan deal. However, the Administration has not yet published a report on the national security threat posed by auto imports, despite requests from Congress. Some analysts warn that using trade barriers as leverage could undermine global trade rules and set a precedent against the U.S. in the future. Many Members of Congress question the security rationale behind the President's tariff actions and support revising Section 232 authorities. President Trump's use of tariff authorities, including Section 232, has been viewed as a crucial tool in trade negotiations. Key questions for Congress include the appropriateness of using Section 232 tariff authorities as leverage in trade negotiations and the long-term implications of using tariff threats in trade talks. Some analysts and Members of Congress question the adherence of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement to WTO rules, particularly regarding the exclusion of auto trade. The U.S.-Japan trade agreement covers a limited share of U.S. goods imports from Japan, raising concerns about adherence to WTO rules. Analysts suggest qualifying the agreement as an \"interim agreement\" under Article XXIV to address these concerns. The timeline and scope of the next-stage U.S.-Japan talks will determine if the agreement aligns with WTO rules. The U.S.-Japan trade agreement, considered an \"interim agreement,\" covers a limited scope of goods imports, raising concerns about WTO rules. The next-stage talks aim to be comprehensive, with key questions for Congress on consistency with WTO obligations and potential precedents for other countries. The Trump Administration's negotiations with Japan offer an alternative to the broader commitments of TPP. The U.S.-Japan trade agreement, an \"interim agreement,\" focuses on reducing tariffs on a limited number of goods. In contrast, the TPP covered a wider range of commitments, including eliminating tariffs on most agricultural products and addressing various trade issues. The Trump Administration's bilateral approach with Japan differs from the multiparty approach of previous administrations. The inclusion of additional commitments in future negotiations remains uncertain. The Obama Administration's multiparty approach to TPP focused on establishing rules reflecting U.S. interests in Asia, while the Trump Administration prioritizes fair and reciprocal trade through bilateral agreements. The broad membership of TPP aimed to harmonize rules across trading partners, while the U.S.-Japan trade agreement focuses on reducing tariffs on specific goods. The Trump Administration prioritizes bilateral trade agreements to leverage U.S. economic power and ensure enforceability. Key questions for Congress include the impact of U.S. withdrawal from TPP on economic interests in Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, the best approach for future talks with Japan, and the costs and benefits of bilateral vs. regional trade agreements. Consideration should be given to joining TPP-11."
