The Congress recognizes the importance of affordable communication services for all Americans, including families paying for inmate telephone and video services. These services are crucial for maintaining contact with incarcerated family members, as family members are usually not allowed to call inmates. Inmate communication in correctional institutions is often limited to collect calling. Incarcerated individuals rely on collect calls or debit accounts for communication with family members. Studies show that frequent communication between inmates and their families is vital for successful reintegration, reducing recidivism and facilitating rehabilitation. However, this communication is often burdened or prevented. Excessive inmate telephone and video service rates burden family members and weaken ties necessary for successful reentry into society. Innocent citizens pay high charges for calls from correctional institutions, with some reaching $1 per minute and $3.00 per call. The high rates for inmate telephone and video services are attributed to the lack of competition between providers in correctional institutions, leading to no incentives for price reduction or efficiency. Additionally, carriers pay commissions to facility administrators for exclusive rights, with these commissions sometimes making up 60% of total revenues. The lack of competition in correctional institutions leads to high rates for inmate telephone and video services. Families of inmates are forced to pay excessive rates charged by the carrier with exclusive rights, affecting those with low incomes. The FCC has the authority to regulate inmate communication services. Congress reaffirms the FCC's authority to regulate inmate telephone and video service rates to address concerns raised in rulemaking proceedings. Restrictions on inmate telephone and video service are outlined in Section 3. The definitions of terms related to inmate telephone and video service are amended in Section 226(a) of the Communications Act of 1934. This includes defining ancillary fees, collect calls, commissions, and debit accounts. The term 'debit account' refers to the payment of inmate telephone and video service through a prepaid card or prisoner account. 'Inmate telephone and video service' encompasses calls made by incarcerated individuals at designated payphones, telephones, or video kiosks. The 'provider of inmate telephone and video service' is any common carrier or designated person offering such services. The Commission will regulate inmate telephone and video service charges to ensure fairness, with a maximum per-minute compensation rate set within a year of the Family Telephone Connection Protection Act of 2015. The Commission will regulate inmate telephone and video service charges by setting maximum compensation rates, requiring providers to offer collect calling and debit account services, and addressing commission payments to administrators of correctional institutions. The Commission will regulate inmate telephone and video service charges by setting maximum compensation rates, requiring providers to offer collect calling and debit account services, and addressing commission payments to administrators of correctional institutions. Additionally, regulations will allow multiple providers to offer services at correctional institutions, giving prisoners a choice, and will prohibit or limit ancillary fees imposed by providers. The regulations will be technologically neutral and not jeopardize legitimate services. The Commission will set maximum compensation rates for inmate telephone and video services, ensuring providers offer collect calling and debit account options. Regulations will also allow multiple providers at correctional institutions, prohibit ancillary fees, and require biennial reviews for potential rate adjustments. The Commission will establish regulations for inmate telephone and video services, preempting any conflicting state or local requirements. These services will be fully subject to specific requirements outlined in sections 201, 205, 251, 252, and 276. The Commission will regulate inmate telephone and video services, overriding state or local rules. Providers cannot block calls based on lack of agreements with carriers."
