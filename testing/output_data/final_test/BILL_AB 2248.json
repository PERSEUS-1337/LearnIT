    "title": "AB 2248",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44253.4 of the Education Code is amended to allow teachers to provide services to limited-English-proficient pupils. Instruction for English language development is required in various educational settings, with exceptions for specific permits or credentials. If a teacher has a teaching credential in adult education, English language development instruction is limited to classes primarily for adults. Content instruction can be delivered in English or the pupil's primary language, based on the teacher's credential or permit. Instruction for primary language development in preschool through grade 12 is based on the possession of specific permits or credentials. If the requirement is met with a children's center permit, instruction is limited to programs authorized by that permit. If met with an adult education teaching credential, instruction is limited to classes organized primarily for adults. The authorization requirements for teaching credentials in California include possession of a valid credential or permit allowing instruction for preschool through grade 12, excluding certain types of credentials like emergency or exchange credentials. Teachers in California can earn authorization by passing exams or completing approved coursework to demonstrate knowledge and skills required for effective teaching. Those with specific authorizations are exempt from certain exams. The authorization remains valid as long as the prerequisite credential or permit is valid. The commission issues authorizations for languages spoken by limited-English-proficient pupils with available teachers. Teachers with out-of-state credentials may qualify by submitting an application and fee."
