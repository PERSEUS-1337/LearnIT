    "content": "The text chunk discusses the repeal of the medical device excise tax and the prohibition on using last-in, first-out accounting for major integrated oil companies. The amendments apply to sales after December 31, 2014. The amendment prohibits major integrated oil companies from using a specific inventory method for taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. Taxpayers affected by this change must initiate and complete the accounting method change for their first taxable year after the enactment of the Act. The amendment requires affected taxpayers to make accounting method changes with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. The adjustments needed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 must be spread out over a period not exceeding 8 taxable years. SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR NEW LEASES AND THE TRANSFER OF LEASES. The term \"covered lease\" refers to leases for oil or gas production in the Gulf of Mexico that meet specific criteria. The term \"lessee\" includes individuals or entities that control or are controlled by the lease. The Secretary of the Interior, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, is prohibited from issuing new leases for oil or gas production to individuals or entities unless they renegotiate existing leases to include royalty payments based on specified price thresholds. Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, new leases for oil or gas production cannot be issued unless existing leases are renegotiated to include royalty payments based on specified price thresholds. A person eligible for a new lease is a lessee holding a covered lease on the date of issuance or one who transferred a covered lease after a certain date, as well as any person with a direct or indirect interest in or benefit from a covered lease. The Secretary may implement separate agreements with multiple lessees owning a share of a covered lease to modify payment responsibilities, including price thresholds equal to those in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The lessee or any person with an interest in a lease cannot transfer any covered lease or its economic benefits without renegotiating payment responsibilities to include price thresholds equal to those in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Secretary may agree to amend leases for Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tracts issued between January 1, 1996, and November 28, 2000, to include price thresholds for royalty relief based on market prices. This is in accordance with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Secretary may amend leases for Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tracts issued between January 1, 1996, and November 28, 2000, to include price thresholds for royalty relief. The new or revised price thresholds will be effective January 1, 2015, while existing lease provisions will remain in effect until December 31, 2014."
