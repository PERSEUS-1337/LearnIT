It includes provisions related to the Truth in Lending Act and the Expedited Funds Availability Act. During the 180-day period after the enactment of the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1994, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System can grant exceptions to the Truth in Lending Act and the Expedited Funds Availability Act for areas affected by disasters, such as the 1994 earthquakes in California, to alleviate public hardships. The Federal Reserve can grant exceptions to the Expedited Funds Availability Act for depository institutions in disaster-affected areas to alleviate public hardships. Any exception made shall expire within 1 year of enactment or determination. The Board must publish a statement describing and explaining any exceptions made. The Federal Reserve can grant exceptions to the Expedited Funds Availability Act for depository institutions in disaster-affected areas, with the condition that the exception must produce benefits that outweigh adverse effects. SEC. 3. DEPOSIT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS. During an 18-month period after the enactment of this Act, a Federal banking agency can allow an insured depository institution to deduct a qualifying amount of insurance proceeds from its total assets when calculating compliance with the leverage limit. This is applicable if the institution is located in an area declared a major disaster zone or eligible for disaster relief under Federal law. During a major disaster, a Federal banking agency can permit an insured depository institution to deduct insurance proceeds from its total assets for leverage limit compliance if certain conditions are met. These conditions include the institution being located in a disaster zone, deriving over 60% of deposits from affected areas, being adequately capitalized, and having a plan for managing asset and deposit increases. The deduction must align with the purpose of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The definitions in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act include terms like \"appropriate federal banking agency,\" \"insured depository institution,\" \"leverage limit,\" and \"qualifying amount attributable to insurance proceeds.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the regulations outlined in the Act. Total assets exceed the institution's average total assets due to insurance payments or governmental assistance for damage caused by a major disaster. SEC. 4. BANKING AGENCY PUBLICATION REQUIREMENTS. During a 180-day period after the enactment of this Act, a qualifying regulatory agency can take actions to assist depository institutions or regulated entities in areas affected by a major disaster, without certain procedural requirements. During a 180-day period after the enactment of this Act, a qualifying regulatory agency can take actions to assist depository institutions or regulated entities in areas affected by a major disaster without certain procedural requirements. The agency can make exceptions to publication requirements for institutions it regulates and must publish a statement in the Federal Register describing and explaining any actions taken. Qualifying regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, Comptroller of the Currency, and others, are defined for the purpose of taking actions to assist institutions affected by a major disaster without certain procedural requirements. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to evaluate the effectiveness of Acts in facilitating recovery from disasters for depository institutions and make recommendations on whether the authority granted by this Act should be permanent. A report on the study results will be submitted to Congress within 18 months. The Congress urges financial regulatory agencies to support depository institutions in serving communities affected by the 1994 California earthquakes. This Act does not limit the authority of any other department or agency under existing laws."
