    "content": "At the June 2005 G8 finance ministers meeting, member nations agreed on a financing plan for 100% debt relief for countries that complete the IMF and World Bank's HIPC debt relief program. If fully implemented, 18 countries would receive immediate forgiveness of their multilateral debts, totaling approximately $40 billion. An additional 20 countries are eligible for debt relief, with a total potential relief of $55.6 billion. Creditor nations will provide funding for the World Bank and AfDB, while IMF debt relief will be funded by the proceeds of a 1999 sale of IMF gold reserves. The Bush Administration has not requested new funds for the U.S. share of the G8 debt relief proposal. Congress is considering appropriations for the World Bank and AfDB's lending facilities, which could be used for increased debt relief. Legislation is being considered for higher levels of debt relief. This report discusses the HIPC debt burden, debt relief initiatives, and previous U.S. and multilateral debt relief efforts. The report discusses previous U.S. debt relief initiatives, multilateral debt relief through the HIPC program, the G8 proposal for 100% debt cancellation, and congressional action. Pressure has been exerted on creditors to cancel debts owed by poor countries. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer called for developed nations to help build a virtuous circle at the United Nations in 2002. [author name scrubbed] challenged developed nations to help build a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction, and sustainable development for the world's poorest countries. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow stated that debt has been trapping these countries in poverty and is morally wrong. The Jubilee debt campaign, launched in 1996, aims to convince major creditor nations to cancel unpayable debts of the poorest countries through a fair and transparent process. This international campaign is supported by various Catholic and Protestant organizations and high-profile individuals like Sir Bob Geldof. Debt relief proponents, including high-profile supporters like Sir Bob Geldof and Bono, argue that poor country debt is illegitimate and unjust, based on the concept of \"odious debt.\" This type of debt benefits ruling elites but has little to no benefit for the general population. Critics question whether successor regimes should be obligated to repay money that was stolen or wasted. The odious debt concept is popular in the NGO community but has not been endorsed by international legal or financial bodies. Debts incurred through World Bank or IMF projects are unlikely to be legally challenged. The poor country debt burden is staggering, with total external debt rising significantly for the most Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. High levels of debt are a major burden for the poorest countries, and efforts to promote economic growth and reduce poverty need to address the HIPC debt burden. In the 1980s and early 1990s, debt relief efforts were introduced for heavily indebted poor countries. The Paris Club agreed to cancel debts in 1988, and in 1996, the IMF, World Bank, and regional development banks created the Debt Relief Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). In 2005, G8 nations extended debt relief and committed to canceling all remaining multilateral HIPC external debt. The proposal aims to cancel all remaining multilateral HIPC external debt, providing up to $55 billion in additional debt relief. Countries that have completed the HIPC program would receive immediate debt relief, while others would receive total debt relief upon program completion. The root causes of the HIPC debt burden include weak macroeconomic policies, lack of economic structural reform, poor debt management practices, adverse trade shocks, and political factors like war and famine. The willingness of creditor nations and multilateral institutions to provide loans and accept risks for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) has raised concerns. Critics question the effectiveness of debt relief in promoting economic reform and reducing poverty, as funds may be diverted from other development resources. Debt relief may not always lead to significant economic growth or poverty reduction as other foreign aid activities could have a greater impact. The \"debt overhang\" theory suggests that a large debt burden can deter potential lenders and investors, but the effectiveness of debt relief in promoting growth is still debated. Following the 1989 debt relief initiative known as the \"Brady Plan,\" named after then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, the theory suggests that high debt levels can hinder a country's ability to repay loans, leading to concerns about inflation or increased taxes. The debt overhang theory proposes that forgiving debts, either entirely or partially, may be more beneficial than continuing to lend at concessional rates in hopes of future repayment. The debt overhang theory suggests forgiving debts to restore investor confidence and economic growth. Evidence from studies on developing countries shows that high debt levels can negatively impact growth, with simulations indicating a slowdown in per capita growth with increased external debt. The studies found that high external debt levels can reduce growth of physical capital and productivity by almost 1%. While the debt overhang theory may apply in general, it may not hold for HIPC countries due to differences in private investment and resource inflows. Debt relief for HIPC countries has not been enough to access private sector credit markets, leading some to argue that institutional factors play a larger role than debt overhang. Some argue that lack of institutional capacity, rather than debt overhang, is the major impediment to economic growth in Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs). Additional funds for debt relief may not be as effective as targeted assistance in boosting economic growth. Creditor nations could help by improving domestic institutions, expanding export sectors, and providing greater market access. U.S. bilateral debt relief is granted through legislation or the Paris Club, where creditor countries renegotiate official sector debts. The Paris Club is a forum where creditor countries renegotiate official sector debts. It includes the United States and 18 other permanent members. A Paris Club 'treatment' refers to a reduction and/or renegotiation of a developing country's debts. Other creditors can participate ad-hoc. The London Club is an informal group of private firms that renegotiate developing country debts. The London Club is an informal group of private firms that meets in London to renegotiate commercial bank debt at the request of debtor nations. Unlike the Paris Club, there is no permanent membership, and the Club is dissolved after a restructuring. The Paris Club is not a formal institution but a set of rules and principles for debt relief agreed upon by its members, with major international creditor countries determining its practices. The five 'principles' of the Paris Club govern the general terms of all treatments. The Paris Club decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, reached by full consensus among creditor nations. Debt renegotiations are applied only for countries clearly in need of relief, evidenced by implementing an IMF program. Solidarity is required among creditors, preserving comparability of treatment. The rules specify technical details of treatments, covering medium and long-term public sector debt. The Paris Club decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, reached by full consensus among creditor nations. Debt renegotiations are applied only for countries clearly in need of relief, evidenced by implementing an IMF program. Solidarity is required among creditors, preserving comparability of treatment. Club arrangements cover medium and long-term public sector debt, payment terms, and provisions for debt swaps. The outcome of a Paris Club meeting is not a legal agreement, but creditor nations sign an 'Agreed Minute' recommending bilateral agreements with the debtor nation. Outright debt cancellation began in 1988, replacing previous rescheduling of debts. The Paris Club gradually increased debt forgiveness from 33.33% in 1988 to 90% in 1999. There are two debt cancellation options: \"Naples\" terms for non-HIPC IDA countries and \"Cologne\" terms for HIPC countries. The United States joined debt forgiveness negotiations in 1994 under Congressional authority. Between 1990 and 2005, the United States forgave $23.1 billion in foreign debt owed to the United States, with $3.14 billion reduced via the Paris Club. Debt reduction measures include Section 411 and Section 572 debt relief authorized by Congress. The U.S. President was authorized to forgive debt from concessional development assistance loans to African and other poor countries during fiscal years 1990 and 1991. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) supports trade, investment, and economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. Debt reduction legislation was enacted in 1990 and 1992 to forgive U.S. food aid loans and USAID and Export-Import Bank debt for EAI countries. The Export Enhancement Act of 1992 added Section 12 to the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, authorizing debt relief for tropical forest conservation. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 allows debt relief for countries with tropical forests. The SEED Act of 1989 authorized debt relief for Eastern European countries. Special debt reduction programs have been implemented for Egypt, Poland, Jordan, and Pakistan for national security reasons. The international financial institutions argued for preferred creditor status to protect their resources and set an example for indebted countries. Debt relief was seen as creating a moral hazard by reducing the incentive for repayment. The HIPC debt relief program was created in 1996 by the World Bank and the IMF to reduce multilateral debt for the poorest countries. Initially, a debt service-to-exports ratio of 250% was considered sustainable, but critics argued it was too high. The program was redesigned in 1999 to provide deeper and faster debt relief. The HIPC debt relief program was redesigned in 1999 to reduce the debt service-to-exports ratio to 150% and focus more on poverty reduction efforts. Countries must meet three criteria for eligibility: be low-income, have a strong policy performance record, and possess an unsustainable debt burden. In 1996, the World Bank and IMF identified 42 potentially HIPC-eligible countries, with 4 later removed due to debt sustainability. Critics argue that eligibility criteria were based on optimistic assumptions, calling for more realistic economic projections. An official review in 2003 supported this view, suggesting political and cost factors influenced eligibility rather than actual debt relief needs. The HIPC debt relief program has two stages: decision point and completion point. Before the decision point, countries must show good economic performance for three years. Debt reduction is provided by Paris Club official creditors at the decision point, with a debt sustainability analysis conducted to determine if the reduction is sufficient for the country to reach the 150% target. The Paris Club debt reduction at Naples Terms is crucial for a country to reach the 150% target ratio. If not sufficient, the IMF and World Bank determine additional multilateral debt relief needed, entering the second phase of debt relief called Completion Point. During this phase, the country must demonstrate good economic policies and implement a poverty reduction strategy. Bilateral debt rescheduling under Cologne Terms and interim assistance are provided between the decision point and completion point. Once the World Bank and IMF confirm completion point, the country receives full and irrevocable debt relief. The World Bank provides debt relief through the HIPC trust fund, which has two components. Contributions from donors and individual nations, including the United States, support HIPC debt relief. Bilateral contributions to the fund totaled $2.97 billion as of February 2005. The United States pledged $600 million initially and an additional $150 million in 2002. Other major contributors include the United Kingdom and Germany. The IMF funded its share of HIPC debt relief through an interim arrangement using resources from the ESAF. To create a permanent facility, the IMF and major contributors planned to sell IMF gold reserves valued at around $48 an ounce. IMF member nations originally contributed a percentage of their quota in gold, even though the international financial system no longer operates on a gold standard. The IMF holds 103.4 million ounces of gold valued at $9 billion on its balance sheet, but at current market prices, it amounts to around $45.3 billion. The Clinton Administration and Congress objected to selling IMF gold to avoid disrupting the international gold market. A compromise in 1999 allowed off-market transactions in gold to finance IMF participation in the HIPC program, with 12.9 million ounces sold to Brazil and Mexico at market price. The IMF sold gold to Brazil and Mexico at market price, with profits placed in a special account. The IMF also accepted back the gold sold to Brazil and Mexico to settle their financial obligations. Currently, 18 out of 38 HIPC-eligible countries have completed the program, while others are at different stages. Debt statistics for HIPC countries, including those with major obligations to the United States, are provided in Appendix 3. Additional donor support is needed according to a 2004 IMF study. According to a 2004 IMF study, additional donor support and structural reforms are needed for HIPC countries to achieve debt sustainability. HIPC completion point countries have stronger economic policies and institutional frameworks compared to other HIPC countries, but their debt management capacity remains weak. Discussions for 100% multilateral debt relief for HIPCs and other poor indebted countries began in 2004, leading to active discussions among G8 nations in 2005. Ministers announced their willingness to provide up to 100% multilateral debt relief, working with the African Development Bank and the World Bank to achieve this without reducing resources for the poorest countries. The debate centered on compensating international financial institutions for debt write-offs, with some arguing that resources could be redirected without harming the institutions' financial situation. On July 11, 2005, G8 finance ministers compromised on a plan to cancel all remaining HIPC multilateral debt. The compromise involved providing new money to multilateral development banks to offset debt reductions and having the IMF absorb the cost of debt relief using internal resources. New gold sales were proposed but faced strong opposition. The G8 finance ministers reached a historic agreement to cancel all remaining HIPC multilateral debt. The cost of forgiving this debt is estimated at $16.7 billion, with the US, Britain, and Germany committing significant amounts to fund the debt relief. The agreement was hailed as a new deal between the rich and poor of the world. Reaction from poor countries not included in the debt deal was critical, arguing that debt relief benefits countries with poor economic performance. Kenya, ineligible for debt relief, expressed concern that faithful debt servicing countries like them are being ignored while HIPCs receive more attention. IMF and World Bank cautiously welcomed the proposal, emphasizing the importance of providing debt relief without diverting resources from other areas. The proposal for debt relief for the world's poorest nations is supported by the IMF and World Bank, with concerns raised about its implementation. The agreement would cancel the remaining debts of 18 countries at the HIPC completion point, totaling $40 billion from various international financial institutions. The agreement for debt relief for the world's poorest nations includes total cancellation of $55.6 million for HIPC-eligible countries completing the program. World Bank and AfDB debts will be redistributed among countries, with completion point countries eligible for 100% debt cancellation. Additional contributions will offset forgiven debts, and funds will be immediately available. The agreement for debt relief includes total cancellation of $55.6 million for HIPC-eligible countries completing the program. Donors commit to cover full costs for the next three years and make additional contributions over the next 10 years to cover cancelled loans. The Bush Administration plans to finance U.S. share of debt relief through early encashment of regular contributions, which may lead to future funding challenges. The proposed debt relief agreement includes total cancellation of $55.6 million for HIPC-eligible countries completing the program. Donors commit to covering full costs for the next three years and making additional contributions over the next 10 years. Critiques of the proposal have been raised, including concerns about no net resource gain for HIPC countries receiving debt reduction. The proposed debt relief agreement covers only the African Development Bank, leaving out other regional development banks where HIPC countries owe debt. Compensation for multilateral development banks is only guaranteed for the next three years, with future assistance not assured. The agreement for debt relief is not guaranteed for the African Development Bank, and future assistance is uncertain. The World Bank has concerns about the terms of debt relief, including the spread-out timeline for donor contributions. The World Bank is concerned about donor countries' commitment to cover debt relief costs spread out over a decade. They suggest legal commitments for extra financing or gradual relief of payments over time instead of wiping out debt immediately. The World Bank is concerned about donor countries' commitment to cover debt relief costs spread out over a decade. They suggest legal commitments for extra financing or gradual relief of payments over time instead of wiping out the entire stock of debt immediately. The cost of the HIPC program may rise depending on which countries are added, with a sunset clause repeatedly extended to prevent it from becoming a permanent facility. In April 2006, the World Bank identified eleven countries eligible for HIPC debt relief, costing an estimated $21 billion. The list includes seven previously identified HIPCs and four new countries. Some countries like Bhutan, Lao PDR, and Sri Lanka meet the criteria but choose not to participate. The cost breakdown includes $10.2 billion to bilateral Paris creditors, $2.4 billion to the IMF, and $2.9 billion to the World Bank. Analysts suggest extending the HIPC program to more eligible countries. In November 2004, the World Bank introduced a new framework to provide 100% grant assistance instead of loans to 47 countries, including 29 HIPC and 18 non-HIPC countries. Analysts suggest that the debt burden of these 18 countries is comparable to those receiving HIPC assistance and they may be eligible for debt relief. This could lead to an increase in the size of the HIPC program by 18 countries and an additional $31.8 billion in debt relief. Members of Congress have introduced proposals in this regard. Several Members of Congress have introduced legislation in the 109th Congress that would extend debt relief to a larger group of countries than is already covered by HIPC. The Multilateral Debt Relief Act of 2005 (S. 1320) would authorize funding to implement G8 debt relief, cancel 100% of debts owed by HIPC countries, and expand the list of countries eligible for debt relief. The Jubilee Act of 2005, introduced by Representative Maxine Walters, aims to provide debt relief to 47 eligible countries through various international financial institutions. If enacted, it would require immediate debt cancellation for 50 poor countries, limiting the waiting period to one month. This legislation would inhibit the World Bank and IMF from seeking economic repayment. The Jubilee Act of 2005 aims to provide immediate debt cancellation for 50 poor countries, inhibiting economic reforms from creditor countries. It also encourages allocating 20% of national budgets for public health, education, and clean water. Additionally, it sets requirements for transparency in international financial institutions and measures indebtedness using debt service ratios. The World Bank classifies countries based on debt service ratios like PVGNI and PV/XGS. If a country exceeds critical values (80% for debt service to GNI, 220% for debt service to exports), it is classified as severely indebted. Moderately indebted countries have ratios three-fifths of critical values (48% for debt service to GNI, 132% for debt service to exports), while less indebted countries have ratios below these thresholds. The World Bank categorizes countries based on debt ratios and income levels. Low-income countries have a GNI per capita of $765 or less, while middle-income countries have a GNI per capita between $766 and $9,385. By combining these indicators, the poorest and most indebted countries can be identified."
