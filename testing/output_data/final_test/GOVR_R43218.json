    "content": "Federal preemption of state tort law actions against drug and medical device manufacturers has sparked controversy. Cases arise when individuals are harmed by a defective product and sue the manufacturer. The FDCA does not explicitly allow these claims, leading injured parties to seek compensation through state tort law. However, constitutional preemption may dismiss such claims due to federal law. The Supreme Court has evaluated medical device and drug preemption cases over the past two decades, with mixed results. In some instances, individuals injured by dangerous drugs or devices are barred from suing manufacturers, while in other cases, suits are allowed to proceed. This report provides background on constitutional preemption and discusses state and federal laws involved in recent Supreme Court FDCA preemption cases. It addresses common state-law tort claims against drug and medical device manufacturers. The report examines federal law regulating prescription drugs and medical devices, focusing on preemption and tort liability. It discusses major Supreme Court FDCA preemption cases and potential judicial and legislative developments in this complex area of law. Federal preemption invalidates state laws that conflict with federal law, as mandated by the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress's intent is crucial in preemption cases, with a presumption against preemption in place historically. However, recent Court decisions suggest a shift away from this presumption, as seen in cases like Wyeth v. Levine and PLIVA v. Mensing. The Supreme Court has shifted away from the presumption against preemption in recent cases like PLIVA v. Mensing and Mutual Pharmaceutical v. Bartlett. This change suggests a departure from the historical approach of considering Congress's intent crucial in preemption cases. The Court distinguishes between express preemption and implied preemption. Express preemption occurs when federal law explicitly overrides state law, while implied preemption is more complex and involves interpreting the scope of federal law. In cases like Cipollone v. Liggett Group, the Supreme Court has dealt with the complexities of express preemption clauses. The Supreme Court's rulings in Cipollone v. Liggett Group and Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly illustrate the complexities of interpreting express preemption clauses in federal statutes. The Court found that the 1969 law preempted state negligence and strict liability claims but not claims for breach of warranty. Additionally, the Court concluded that the same law preempted a state ban on outdoor cigarette advertising near schools. This shows that federal laws can preempt state laws even without an express preemption clause, through field preemption or conflict. Federal law can implicitly displace state law through field preemption and conflict preemption. Field preemption occurs when Congress intends to occupy the entire regulatory field, leaving no room for state supplementation. Examples include regulation of grain elevators and nuclear power plants. Conflict preemption arises when state law conflicts with federal law. Impossibility preemption occurs when compliance with both federal and state regulations is physically impossible. Conflict preemption can also happen when a state law obstructs the execution of federal law. Obstacle preemption arises when a state law hinders the objectives of Congress, balancing the conflict between state and federal laws. In Nash v. Florida Industrial Commission, the Court ruled that federal unfair labor practice laws preempted a state law denying unemployment benefits to employees filing unfair labor practice charges. This doctrine is challenging to apply due to the balancing of national purpose and state autonomy. Preemption is a complex doctrine, especially obstacle preemption, which involves balancing state and federal laws. In Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., the Supreme Court rejected the assumption that an express preemption clause eliminates the need to consider implicit preemption. The case involved a dispute over a car crash injury claim being preempted by a federal motor vehicle safety regulation. Justice Breyer, in a majority opinion, ruled in favor of the car company. In Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., Justice Breyer held that the express preemption clause in the Safety Act did not preempt common law tort claims. The Court clarified that while the savings clause excluded tort actions from express preemption, it did not limit conflict preemption principles. This decision aimed to prevent states from imposing legal duties that conflicted with federal regulations. The federal motor vehicle safety standard preempted state tort law in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co. The Court held that liability for failing to provide airbags would obstruct the purpose of the federal regulation, which aimed for a variety of passive restraint devices on the market. Implied preemption principles must be applied even with a savings clause in federal statutes. The Supremacy Clause implies that Congress and the Supreme Court have the authority to preempt state law. The Supreme Court has recognized that federal administrative agencies, acting under Congress's authority, can preempt state law. Executive preemption depends on agency's statutory authority and arbitrary actions, with courts deferring to agency judgment. Federal common law rules, like in admiralty law, can also preempt state law. Understanding FDCA preemption case law and how federal law can override state tort law requires examining these concepts. Tort law in the United States is based on state common law and aims to compensate individuals for injuries caused by others. It also incentivizes safety and deters harmful behaviors. Monetary damages are seen as the most effective way to address wrongdoing. In tort law, monetary damages are considered the most effective way to compensate and deter harmful behaviors. When suing a drug manufacturer for an injury, plaintiffs typically raise products liability claims based on negligence, warranty, fraud, and strict liability. To establish a negligence case, plaintiffs must prove duty of care, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damages. Product manufacturers owe a duty of due care to all foreseeable users, including aspects like design, manufacture, labeling, and promotion. The duty must meet the standard of a prudent manufacturer. For prescription drugs and medical devices, manufacturers must ensure appropriate concentration, strength, and purity to prevent harm. Manufacturers must exercise due care in producing products to prevent defects. Even when following industry standards, risks can still exist due to misuse. With medical devices and drugs, manufacturers must warn of all known risks. The \"learned intermediary doctrine\" states that warnings should be given to medical professionals, not end users. In failure-to-warn lawsuits over drugs and medical devices, the manufacturer's breach of duty must be proven by the plaintiff. Causation in fact and law must also be established, with proximate causation determining responsibility for the injury. Inadequate warnings can lead to a rebuttable presumption that an adequate warning would have been heeded if provided. In failure-to-warn lawsuits, proximate cause can be the plaintiff's Achilles Heel as the defendant can rebut the presumption that a different warning would have made a difference. This burden can be difficult and has led to the demise of several lawsuits. A breach of warranty can also be the basis for a products liability claim against a drug or device manufacturer. Manufacturers implicitly warrant that their products are \"fit for the ordinary purposes for which they are used\" and \"merchantable,\" found in the Uniform Commercial Code. To prove breach of implied warranty, a plaintiff must show the existence of the warranty, breach, and resulting damages. Plaintiffs face difficulties in products liability suits for prescription drugs or medical devices due to legal doctrines from contract law. State contract law and warranty law can prevent consumers from recovering damages from manufacturers of prescription drugs or medical devices. The privity requirement in contract law can hinder breach of warranty lawsuits, as manufacturers may not have a direct relationship with end users. Implied warranties can be excluded or modified with a conspicuous disclaimer under the UCC. Lack of notice or opportunity to cure defects can also be a defense against breach of implied warranty claims. The UCC requires timely notice of breach of warranty to the seller to pursue a remedy. In cases involving drugs or medical devices, off-label use may prevent a claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability. Some argue that prescription drugs and medical devices are not subject to warranty law due to their unique nature and limited availability through licensed physicians. This makes it challenging to hold manufacturers liable under warranty law for fitness for ordinary purposes. Another common basis for products liability suits is alleging fraud in marketing unsafe products. Alleging fraud in marketing unsafe products involves establishing six elements: a material misrepresentation, made falsely with intent to mislead, justifiable reliance, and resulting injury. Plaintiffs face challenges in proving false representation of material fact rather than broad language. The federal court rejected the argument that a drug manufacturer engaged in material misrepresentations by broadly lauding selected medical journals supportive of a drug. Fraudulent concealment claims require a duty of disclosure and an independent fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff. Claims of fraud require that the manufacturer had an intent to mislead. Claims of fraud in products liability suits require the manufacturer to have intent to mislead, which is difficult to prove. Plaintiffs often rely on strict products liability to recover damages for injuries caused by drugs or devices, where they must show the product harmed them and the defendant's conduct caused the harm, without needing to prove unreasonable behavior. Strict liability in products liability cases focuses on the product itself and the adequacy of warnings. To prove a strict liability claim, the plaintiff must show that the product had a defect that made it unreasonably dangerous, leading to injury. Defects can be in the form of manufacturing defects or design defects. Manufacturing defects occur during production, while design defects affect an entire product line. A design defect in a product line is when it shares a common dangerous characteristic that could have been avoided with a reasonable alternative design. The social utility of a product can sometimes be outweighed by the risks it poses, making proof of an alternative design unnecessary. A warning defect occurs when a manufacturer fails to provide adequate instructions or warnings, especially in drugs and medical devices. Manufacturing defects are legally simple and tend to affect a small number of people. Design defect claims for drugs and medical devices are rare due to the difficulty in showing an alternative design that removes undesirable features. Comment k limits liability for \"unavoidably unsafe products,\" recognizing that some products, especially drugs, cannot be made completely safe. Comment k exempts manufacturers of \"unavoidably unsafe products,\" like drugs and medical devices, from strict liability as long as the product is properly prepared and warnings are provided. Courts differ on what products qualify as \"unavoidably unsafe,\" but generally agree that this exemption applies in some contexts, shifting focus to manufacturing and warning defects in litigation. Manufacturing and warning defect claims in drug and device litigation are often based on a defective warning. A warning defect occurs when the warnings are inadequate to prevent foreseeable harm. Courts typically assess negligence and strict liability claims for warning defects under the same standard, considering the user's awareness of danger and the effectiveness of the warning. The question of a manufacturer's strict liability for a warning defect depends on established standards. The liability of a manufacturer for a warning defect depends on negligence standards, including the learned intermediary doctrine. Questions of liability in drug and device cases focus on the adequacy of warnings. Federal laws, such as the FDCA, govern the safety of medical devices and drugs, requiring them to meet certain requirements before being marketed. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) amended the FDCA to regulate medical devices in the United States based on the level of risk they pose to patients. The MDA established three classes of devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. Class I devices have minimal oversight as they pose no unreasonable risk, while Class II devices have moderate risk and require general and special controls. Class III devices, with the highest risk, are subject to premarket approval by the FDA. The FDA requires premarket approval for Class III devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. The application process is detailed and includes information on labeling, investigations, manufacturing methods, and device components. Approval is denied if there is a lack of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. The FDA requires premarket approval for Class III devices to ensure safety and effectiveness. All new devices are automatically designated as Class III and must receive premarket approval unless they meet exceptions specified under federal law, such as being determined to be \"substantially equivalent\" through the \u00a7 510(k) premarket notification process. Class III medical devices may be marketed with a \u00a7 510(k) submission if they are substantially equivalent to a pre-1976 device. Most new Class III devices enter the market through the \u00a7 510(k) process, where the FDA determines substantial equivalence based on comparison with a predicate device. Medical devices can be cleared through the \u00a7 510(k) process by demonstrating safety and effectiveness compared to a predicate device. Manufacturers must submit a premarket notification to the FDA, including device information, labeling, and comparisons to predicate devices. Devices cleared through \u00a7 510(k) face less scrutiny than those with premarket approval, as clinical data is not always required. The \u00a7 510(k) process for medical device clearance is less rigorous than premarket approval, as FDA inspections of manufacturing and post-market studies are not required. The Supreme Court has evaluated medical device preemption cases, with the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 stating that states cannot impose requirements different from federal regulations on device safety or effectiveness. The FDA may exempt state requirements more stringent than federal ones under the Medical Device Amendments. The Supreme Court has evaluated the scope of preemption provision in medical device cases. The Supreme Court has found that state tort lawsuits regarding medical device defects can be limited by how the device received FDA approval. The provision is seen as restricting individuals' ability to sue for injuries caused by defective devices with premarket approval. However, the Court has acknowledged that it does not completely bar state-law tort claims. In a 1996 case, Medtronic v. Lohr, negligence and strict liability claims were brought against a pacemaker manufacturer after a device component failure led to a patient needing emergency surgery. The Supreme Court ruled that state-law claims regarding medical device defects are not completely preempted by the MDA. In a case involving a pacemaker, the Court found that the plaintiff's state-law claims were not preempted by the MDA, despite the device being cleared under the \u00a7 510(k) process. The Court's decision highlighted the disagreement on the scope of MDA preemption and the extent to which it applies to state-law tort actions. The Supreme Court ruled that state-law claims regarding medical device defects are not completely preempted by the MDA. The majority of the Court disagreed that the \u00a7 510(k) process imposes safety and effectiveness requirements, stating it only establishes device equivalence. The Court reasoned that the \u00a7 510(k) exemption maintains the status quo for marketing medical devices, allowing manufacturers to be subject to state law negligent design claims. The Supreme Court ruled that state-law claims regarding medical device defects are not preempted by the MDA, as long as they parallel federal requirements. Despite some dissenting opinions, the majority agreed that FDA regulations support this interpretation and allow states to provide remedies for common law duties. In 2008, the Supreme Court clarified that state tort law claims related to medical devices with premarket approval are preempted by federal law. The case of Riegel v. Medtronic involved a catheter that ruptured despite contraindications on the label, leading to serious injury. The Supreme Court ruled in an 8-1 decision that the plaintiff's state tort law claims regarding a catheter that ruptured were preempted by federal law under the MDA. The Court found that the federal government had established requirements applicable to the device, leading to the dismissal of the common law claims. The Supreme Court ruled that state tort law claims regarding a catheter were preempted by federal law under the MDA due to premarket approval requirements specific to the device. The Court found that New York's tort duties are considered \"requirements\" under the MDA, different from federal requirements for medical devices. State common law duties can be preempted by the MDA, as they establish legal duties that can lead to tort judgments for violations of state-law obligations. The patient's argument that state-law claims are not preempted due to general common-law duties was not upheld. The Court rejected the argument that state common-law duties are not preempted by the MDA, stating that the MDA does not require state requirements to apply solely to the relevant medical device. It clarified that not all state-law claims are preempted and that states can provide a damages remedy for claims based on FDA regulations. The Court did not provide further analysis on the types of state duties that may be preempted. The Supreme Court has recognized implied preemption principles in medical device cases due to the lack of a private right of action under the FDCA. State tort claims based on FDCA violations are evaluated to determine their viability. In 2001, the Supreme Court in Buckman v. Plaintiff's Legal Committee examined whether federal law preempted state-law tort claims alleging fraud on the FDA. Plaintiffs sued a consulting company for injuries from orthopedic bone screws, claiming the manufacturer committed fraud on the FDA to obtain approval. The Court held that the plaintiffs' claims were preempted by federal law. The Supreme Court held that state law fraud-on-the-FDA claims were impliedly preempted because they conflicted with federal enforcement of the FDCA. The Court stated that allowing these claims to proceed would interfere with federal statutory objectives and the FDA's role in addressing fraud. Federal law provides mechanisms for addressing fraud, such as seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. The Supreme Court ruled that state law fraud-on-the-FDA claims were impliedly preempted as they would burden applicants and conflict with federal enforcement of the FDCA. This could lead to excessive information submissions, delays in the regulatory process, and concerns over the sufficiency of FDA disclosures under state law. The Court clarified that the MDA preemption provision did not hinder finding implied conflict preemption and distinguished this case from the Lohr decision. The Supreme Court's decision in Lohr did not directly address implied preemption. The patient's claims in Lohr were based on the manufacturer's alleged failure to use reasonable care in producing the medical device, not just on FDCA disclosure violations. The Court clarified that not every FDCA violation supports a state-law claim. The question of bringing a state-law tort claim after a medical device injury is complex, with varied results following the Lohr, Buckman, and Riegel decisions. The ability to sue for defects in a medical device can depend on FDA approval process (\u00a7 510(k) or premarket approval). Questions remain on which state-law tort claims against device manufacturers are preempted by federal law. Class III device consumers may be prevented from suing if device receives premarket approval, but parallel state-law claims are not preempted. Several lower courts have grappled with the issue of which state-law tort claims survive federal preemption when a plaintiff brings a claim involving a violation of federal medical device requirements. Courts have struggled with determining whether these claims are impliedly preempted under the Court's reasoning in Buckman. One case that exemplifies these issues is Medtronic v. Stengel, where a patient sued a medical device manufacturer under state law for failing to report information about an adverse event to the FDA. The Ninth Circuit ruled that state-law claims against a medical device manufacturer can proceed if violations of federal medical device requirements occur outside of the premarket approval process. The court distinguished this case from Buckman, stating that the state-law claim was independent of federal requirements. Medtronic has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not yet decided on the appeal of the case regarding state-law claims against a medical device manufacturer. Congress has considered amending the FDCA to clarify the relationship between federal preemption and state tort claims, with a bill introduced to overturn a previous Supreme Court decision. Since 1938, there has been a federal system of premarket approval for drugs in the United States under the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments of 1962. The legislation in H.R. 1346 / S. 540 was incorporated in H.R. 4816, the Food and Drug Administration Improvement Act of 2010, but did not progress in the 111th Congress. Similar legislation has not been introduced in the 112th or 113th Congress regarding FDCA preemption and prescription drugs. The FDA requires a new drug to be safe and effective before it can be marketed. Manufacturers must submit a New Drug Application (NDA) with full reports on safety and effectiveness, drug components, composition, manufacturing methods, and labeling. The FDA will not approve the NDA if the drug is found to be unsafe or ineffective, or if the proposed labeling does not ensure safe use. The labeling must contain essential scientific information for safe and effective use of the drug. The FDA requires a New Drug Application (NDA) with full reports on safety and effectiveness, drug components, composition, manufacturing methods, and labeling. The label must contain essential scientific information for safe and effective use of the drug, including administration details, proper dosage, contraindications, warnings, and adverse reactions. The FDA places approved drugs on a public list called \"listed drugs,\" which is updated every 30 days. Post-market surveillance is required, and the FDA can withdraw approval if a drug is found to be unsafe. The FDA requires a New Drug Application (NDA) with full reports on safety and effectiveness, drug components, composition, manufacturing methods, and labeling. Once a drug is approved, the manufacturer must comply with Good Manufacturing Practices, report adverse events, and submit new information to the FDA. Changes to the drug, including labeling, require FDA approval, except for adding or strengthening warnings under the CBE regulation. The FDA requires premarket approval for drug marketing, even after a patent expires. Manufacturers must submit a New Drug Application (NDA) with safety and effectiveness reports. Changes to drugs, including labeling, need FDA approval, except for certain warning updates under the CBE regulation. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 created the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to allow generic manufacturers to enter the market by proving bioequivalence to the original drug. This streamlined the process and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA requires generic drugs to have the same labeling as the brand-name drug. The generic applicant can rely on the safety and effectiveness evidence from the NDA for the listed drug. If the labeling for the generic drug deviates from the listed drug, the FDA may withdraw approval. Unlike medical devices, the FDCA does not have an express preemption clause for prescription drugs, which can lead to conflicts with state tort law. The FDCA may clash with state tort law regarding federal drug law preemption. State tort law could hold manufacturers liable for approved drugs, despite FDA approval. The FDCA's premarket approval process requires FDA approval of a drug's chemical makeup. State tort law has the potential to second guess FDA's drug approvals, leading to conflicts between federal and state laws. Despite historical uncertainty, federal drug law's preemptive effect on state tort claims became clearer in 2004. The FDA argued in 2006 that its prescription drug labeling regulations preempted injured plaintiffs' common law tort claims, stating that state tort laws challenging the adequacy of an FDA-approved drug label would be preempted. The FDA's labeling regulations were seen as an obstacle to federal law objectives, making it difficult for manufacturers to comply with both FDCA rules and state tort law. The Supreme Court clarified in three landmark rulings starting in 2009 that the FDCA's drug requirements do not always preempt state tort law, as seen in Wyeth v. Levine. Diana Levine visited a clinic for severe headache-related nausea and was given the drug Phenergan. The FDA was aware of the risks of administering Phenergan through an IV push method, which could cause severe chemical irritation and irreversible gangrene. The FDA required warning labels on Phenergan due to the risk of gangrene and amputation from an IV push method. Diana Levine developed gangrene after an administration error, leading to amputation. She received a $700,000 settlement from the clinic. Levine sued Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, arguing insufficient warning labels. State courts rejected Wyeth's preemption argument, and Levine won a $6.7 million jury verdict against the company. In a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court held that none of Ms. Levine's state tort claims were preempted by federal law. The Court found that the FDA's CBE regulation precluded any preemption based on impossibility, allowing a brand name drug manufacturer to make changes based on newly acquired information. The Supreme Court ruled that state tort claims regarding a drug were not preempted by federal law, allowing a drug manufacturer to strengthen warnings based on new information. The FDA's CBE regulation enabled the manufacturer to comply with both state and federal requirements. The Supreme Court rejected Wyeth's argument that state tort claims obstruct federal drug labeling regulation, stating that state law remedies further consumer protection by motivating manufacturers to provide adequate warnings. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, as evidenced by the lack of an express preemption clause in the FDCA. The Court also noted that the regulatory guidance indicating federal drug law preempted state tort claims was not subject to formal rulemaking and contradicted earlier FDA statements. The Supreme Court did not find FDA's position deserving deference and affirmed lower state courts' decision on no preemption in Levine case. Justice Breyer highlighted the potential for state tort law to interfere with FDA objectives and signaled a clear approach for future administrations regarding preemption. Justice Thomas disagreed with Justice Breyer's approach on preemption, emphasizing that only federal laws passed in accordance with the Constitution can preempt state laws. He criticized the \"purposes and objectives\" preemption doctrine for straying from the text of federal law. Justice Thomas criticized the \"purposes and objectives\" preemption doctrine for straying from the text of federal law, stating he would not rely on obstacle preemption. The Court revisited preemption in PLIVA v. Mensing, where lower courts applied Levine's reasoning to generic drugs, finding failure-to-warn claims not preempted without \"clear evidence\" from the FDA. In PLIVA v. Mensing, the Supreme Court rejected lower courts' interpretation of Levine regarding generic drugs. The case involved patients prescribed Reglan but given the generic metoclopramide, leading to tardive dyskinesia. FDA approved stronger warnings for Reglan, culminating in a \"black box\" warning in 2009. In PLIVA v. Mensing, the Supreme Court ruled that state failure-to-warn claims for generic drugs were preempted by FDA regulations, preventing generic manufacturers from independently changing safety labels. The Supreme Court ruled in PLIVA v. Mensing that state failure-to-warn claims for generic drugs were preempted by FDA regulations, preventing generic manufacturers from independently changing safety labels. The majority concluded that it was impossible for generic manufacturers to comply with state tort duties to strengthen drug labels while adhering to federal requirements for generic drug sameness. The decision emphasized that if a party cannot satisfy state duties without federal permission and assistance, they cannot independently satisfy those duties for pre-emption purposes. The Supreme Court's ruling in PLIVA v. Mensing stated that state failure-to-warn claims for generic drugs were preempted by FDA regulations. This decision highlighted the impossibility for generic manufacturers to comply with state tort duties while adhering to federal requirements for generic drug sameness. In Mutual Pharmaceutical v. Bartlett, the Court revisited preemption and prescription drugs, where a woman suffered severe burns and permanent near-blindness after taking a generic drug with inadequate warning labels. Ms. Bartlett suffered permanent near-blindness and lung damage after taking a generic drug. She sued the manufacturer for failure to warn and defective design. The jury awarded her over $21 million in damages. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the manufacturer, stating that her strict liability claim conflicted with federal requirements for generic drug sameness. Justice Alito, writing for the Court, rejected the plaintiff's argument that state strict liability law did not impose a duty on the manufacturer. The Court found that New Hampshire law did impose a substantive duty on the manufacturer not to produce an unreasonably dangerous product, similar to failure-to-warn claims in Mensing. The Court applied a \"risk utility approach\" to determine if a product is defectively designed and \"unreasonably dangerous,\" considering the product's usefulness and risk of danger. New Hampshire, like other states, allows prescription drug manufacturers to avoid liability with an adequate warning. The case functioned like a negligent failure-to-warn claim, similar to Mensing, and impossibility preemption was rejected. The Court rejected the idea of impossibility preemption in a case involving a generic drug manufacturer. The \"stop selling\" rationale was deemed insufficient as it would make impossibility preemption meaningless. This was illustrated with a hypothetical scenario involving avocado growers. Two dissenting opinions were filed. The Supreme Court limited routes for federal drug law to preempt state tort law, expanding avenues for implied preemption. Levine ruled out field preemption, recognizing state tort law complements federal drug law. Justice Breyer's concurrence in Levine and dissent in Bartlett suggest state tort law obstructs federal drug law only with FDA regulation deference. After Mensing and Bartlett, the Supreme Court revived the theory of impossibility preemption, stating that when a state law requirement conflicts with a federal law requirement and \"special permission\" is needed from the federal government, the state law must yield. Bartlett also expanded the impossibility defense by rejecting the stop-selling theory. State failure-to-warn claims against a brand name prescription drug manufacturer are not preempted by federal law, but claims against a generic drug may be. The independence principle established in Mensing and reaffirmed in Bartlett indicates that tort claims based on the chemical composition of an approved drug, whether generic or brand name, are preempted by the FDCA. This has significant implications as generic drugs make up a large portion of prescriptions in the US. The principles in these cases could potentially apply to other situations where government approval is required before a product can be marketed. The FDA plans to issue a \"Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" regarding the labeling of generic drugs, aiming to create parity between NDA holders and ANDA holders in submitting CBE labeling revisions. This could potentially impact the underlying rationale for impossibility preemption of failure-to-warn claims in the generic drug context. The FDA aims to create parity between NDA and ANDA holders by allowing generic manufacturers to unilaterally update drug labeling, potentially impacting the rationale for impossibility preemption of failure-to-warn claims in the generic drug context. However, changing the federal sameness requirement may pose legal challenges due to statutory obligations. The FDA is looking to align NDA and ANDA holders by allowing generic manufacturers to update drug labeling independently, which could affect the basis for impossibility preemption of failure-to-warn claims in the generic drug context. Justice Alito's opinion in Bartlett suggested a legislative solution for those dissatisfied with the outcomes of Mensing and Bartlett, calling for explicit guidance from Congress on the preemptive effect of the FDCA's prescription drug provisions. The addition of explicit language stating that state tort claims are not preempted by the FDCA may not change the outcomes of Mensing and Bartlett. The Court can still examine whether a law impliedly preempts state law despite the presence of an express preemption clause or savings clause. A circuit split exists on whether federal law preempts a tort claim that a generic drug manufacturer has a duty to update a drug's label to match the brand name drug. This could lead to a reexamination of preemption and prescription drugs in the future. State tort claims may not be preempted by the FDCA, but a circuit split exists on whether federal law preempts a duty for generic drug manufacturers to update labels to match brand name drugs. This could lead to a reexamination of preemption and prescription drugs in the future. The issue of whether state-law claims parallel to FDCA's drug provisions are preempted by federal law, including punitive damages for failure-to-warn claims against brand-name manufacturers and duty to communicate dangers by generic manufacturers, remains unresolved. The Supreme Court may need to address these complex issues in the future. The Supreme Court may need to address complex issues involving state tort claims, federal drug law, and constitutional preemption in the future."
