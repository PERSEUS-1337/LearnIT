    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Energy Infrastructure Security Program Establishment Act\" and establishes the National Energy Infrastructure Security Program. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the National Energy Infrastructure Security Program, including approved state plan, Assistant, coastal zone, coastline, and critical energy infrastructure facility. The curr_chunk defines various types of energy infrastructure facilities, including electric transmission facilities, petroleum or natural gas pipelines, energy production facilities, refineries, transportation facilities, ports, and related facilities critical to their operation. The term \"distance\" is defined as the minimum great circle distance in statute miles, and the \"Fund\" refers to the National Energy Infrastructure Security Program. The curr_chunk defines the Fund as the National Energy Infrastructure Security Trust Fund and the leased tract as a tract subject to a lease for drilling oil or natural gas resources. The term \"leased tract\" excludes tracts subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, 2001, unless the lease was in production on that date. The term \"producing coastal State\" includes Alaska, Alabama, California, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The term \"qualified Outer Continental Shelf revenues\" refers to funds received by the US from each leased tract that lies seaward of the zone covered by Mississippi, Texas, and any other State within 200 miles of the geographic center of the tract. The term \"production\" is defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and \"program\" refers to the National Energy Infrastructure Security Program. The term \"qualified Outer Continental Shelf revenues\" includes various payments from natural gas and oil activities within 200 miles of a producing coastal State's coastline. The Assistant will establish the \"National Energy Infrastructure Security Program\" to provide funds to States for approved State plans to enhance security for critical energy infrastructure facilities against hostile and natural threats. The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States. The Governor of a State must submit a plan to secure critical energy infrastructure facilities within 180 days of the Act's enactment to be eligible for federal funds. Revised plans must be submitted within 18 months, with annual reviews thereafter. The Governor of a State must review and submit any revised State plan for critical energy infrastructure facilities annually. The Assistant will approve each State plan or recommend changes in consultation with federal security officials and relevant Secretaries. If changes are recommended, the Governor may resubmit the plan. The Governor of a State may resubmit a revised State plan to the Assistant for approval. The Assistant will determine the availability of the approved State plan to the public and provide a confidential copy to Congress. The State plan must be developed in consultation with various stakeholders including law enforcement, public safety officials, industry, and Indian tribes. The National Energy Infrastructure Security Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to be used in carrying out the section, consisting of appropriated amounts and interest earned on investments. The National Energy Infrastructure Security Trust Fund receives 50 percent of qualified Outer Continental Shelf revenues for allocations to States. Administrative expenses are limited to 1 percent of the Fund annually. The National Energy Infrastructure Security Trust Fund invests excess amounts in interest-bearing US obligations to meet current withdrawals. Investments can be made through original issue or purchase of outstanding obligations at market price, and obligations can be sold at market price. The National Energy Infrastructure Security Trust Fund invests excess amounts in interest-bearing US obligations. The interest and proceeds from the sale of these obligations are credited to the Fund. Transfers of amounts to the Fund are made monthly based on estimates by the Secretary of the Treasury, with adjustments for any discrepancies. The National Energy Infrastructure Security Trust Fund receives transfers of excess amounts, which are then allocated by the Assistant and the Secretary of the Interior for activities in non-coastal and coastal zones, respectively. The Assistant determines allocation of amounts to each State based on vulnerability of infrastructure facilities to threats, potential impact on critical facilities, populations, economies, habitats, and cultural sites, considering other available financial resources. The Secretary of the Interior allocates funds among producing coastal States based on equal division and proximity to offshore oil and gas production locations. The Governor of a producing coastal State must submit a coastal zone plan to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce within 180 days to receive allocated funds for security of energy infrastructure facilities. Plans must be developed and approved similar to State plans. Amounts allocated by the Secretary of the Interior under subsection (e)(3) can only be used for activities to secure critical energy infrastructure facilities in a coastal zone from threats and to support necessary public service activities for the safety and operation of these facilities. Restoration of coastal wetlands is considered an activity that secures critical energy infrastructure facilities. The authority to secure critical energy infrastructure facilities in a coastal zone from natural threats will terminate 6 years after the enactment of this Act."
