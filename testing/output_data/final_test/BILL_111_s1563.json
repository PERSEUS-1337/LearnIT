    "content": "The Act titled \"United States Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs Act of 2009\" establishes the position of United States Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs within the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956. Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic nation with a 700-mile border on the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Arctic region, known as Inuvikput to indigenous populations, is home to unique wildlife and has produced over 16 billion barrels. Since 1959, temperatures in the Arctic region of the United States have warmed by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius, more than twice the global average. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and thinning, with estimates that the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free during summer months in as few as 30 years, impacting indigenous communities and ecosystems. The Arctic region of the United States has experienced significant warming, leading to the rapid diminishing and thinning of the Arctic ice pack. This has implications for indigenous communities and ecosystems, as well as opening up new areas for possible development in offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and tourism. Increased industrial activity in the Arctic region necessitates a stronger diplomatic presence to address important issues involving the United States and other Arctic countries through the Arctic Council. The Arctic Council, consisting of countries like Sweden and the United States, along with 6 Permanent Participants representing indigenous peoples, is dedicated to the well-being of Arctic residents. It recognizes the special relationship indigenous communities have with the region and their unique contributions. The Council is committed to sustainable development, improving health conditions, fostering cultural well-being, and protecting the Arctic environment. The Arctic region faces challenges related to biodiversity, conservation of natural resources, and claims for seabed resources. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council suggests closing commercial fishing in Arctic waters until sustainability is determined. Increased commercial activity raises concerns about national security, environmental protection, and the needs of indigenous communities. The United States aims to maintain a positive relationship with the Arctic Council and has proposed the establishment of an Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs within the Department of State. The Ambassador would enhance the country's ability to address mutual interests with Arctic Council members and Arctic countries. The United States proposes the appointment of an Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs to represent the country in diplomatic matters related to the Arctic region. The Ambassador will advise the President and the Secretary of State on Arctic affairs and participate in international conferences and meetings. The United States proposes appointing an Ambassador at Large for Arctic Affairs to advise on policies and represent the country in diplomatic matters related to the Arctic region. The Secretary of State will provide necessary funds for the Ambassador to carry out their duties."
