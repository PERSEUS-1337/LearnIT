    "content": "The COPS program, established in 1994 under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, aims to promote community policing nationwide. It provides grants to law enforcement agencies for hiring officers, acquiring technology, and testing new strategies. The program is overseen by the COPS Office within the Department of Justice. The COPS program was reauthorized in 2005 through FY2009 as a single-grant program. Congress may need to consider reauthorizing the program as appropriations expired in FY2009. Debate on reauthorization could be contentious due to the need to reduce discretionary spending. This report provides an overview of issues Congress might discuss if legislation to reauthorize the COPS program is taken up. The COPS program may need to change its focus from hiring additional officers to supporting law enforcement operations. Congress is questioning the effectiveness of hiring grants in reducing crime and the potential overlap between COPS and other grant programs. There is debate on whether funding for the COPS program should be continued as currently authorized. The government should provide grants to state and local law enforcement agencies to hire more officers despite low crime rates. Opponents argue that funding should come from state and local governments, not the federal government. Proponents believe COPS hiring grants helped reduce crime in the 1990s and are necessary to maintain law enforcement forces during economic downturns. The federal government should support local law enforcement agencies to maintain their forces and fight crime. Proponents argue that it is the federal government's responsibility to provide security for U.S. citizens and that it should also support law enforcement in homeland security and immigration enforcement. The report analyzes arguments for and against the COPS program, looking at trends in violent crime, the impact of additional law enforcement officers on crime reduction, and the effects of COPS grants in the 1990s. Data on violent crime rates from 1960 to 2012 are shown in Figure 1. The data from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) collected by the FBI shows a general increase in violent crime rates from 1961 to 1991, with a brief decrease in the early 1980s. However, starting in 1992, there was a 13-year decrease in violent crime rates before a slight increase in 2005 and 2006. Since 2006, violent crime rates have been on a downward trend and are currently at their lowest level per capita since 1970. Despite a brief increase in the mid-2000s, recent years have seen a decrease in national violent crime rates. In 2005, the national violent crime rate increased, but decreased in towns with populations between 49,999 and 10,000 residents. However, in 2007, the violent crime rate increased in cities with populations between 100,000 and 249,999 people and in towns with less than 25,000 people. Overall, violent crime rates decreased in cities with populations fewer than 250,000 people, except for an increase in 2011 and 2012 in cities with populations of 250,000 or more people. The assumption that more law enforcement officers will result in lower levels of crime is based on economic theory. The economic theory suggests that more law enforcement officers can deter criminal behavior by increasing the likelihood of criminals being caught and punished. This can also lead to more criminals being incarcerated, preventing them from committing further crimes. Research on the impact of law enforcement on violent crime has shown mixed results. The review of 27 studies from 1971 to 1997 found mixed results on the impact of law enforcement on violent crime. Of the 89 estimates, 49.4% showed no effect, 30.3% showed a positive effect, and 20.2% showed a negative effect. Researchers concluded that hiring more law enforcement officers may not consistently decrease violent crime due to methodological flaws in the studies. The researchers eliminated studies with methodological shortcomings, leaving nine studies with 27 estimates on the effect of law enforcement on violent crime. Results showed that 55% found no effect, 15% found a positive effect, and 30% found a negative effect. Recent studies suggest that increasing law enforcement officers can reduce both violent and property crime, with a 5-6% crime reduction between 1991 and 2001. Most past research did not properly address the simultaneity problem, but recent studies have improved in this aspect. Recent research suggests that law enforcement may have a limited impact on crime, with some studies showing no effect or even a negative impact. However, past research had methodological issues, casting doubt on the conclusions drawn from those studies. Recent research suggests that the impact of law enforcement on crime is uncertain due to methodological limitations and lack of data for studying the relationship between police levels and crime rates. The researcher notes that without good models for other factors influencing crime rates, analyzing the impact of changes in police levels will remain an inexact science. Studies have shown that analyzing the impact of changes in police levels on crime rates is challenging due to methodological limitations. Three studies found that COPS grants had a mixed impact on crime rates, with some grants being more effective than others. Additionally, COPS grants may not have been as effective in larger cities. The GAO analyzed the impact of COPS grants on crime rates between 1994 and 2001. They found that COPS hiring grants, MORE grants, and Innovative grants had a statistically significant negative impact on various crime rates. The GAO analyzed the impact of COPS grants on crime rates between 1994 and 2001, finding that Innovative grants had a greater impact than hiring and MORE grants. Hiring grants had a negative impact on crime rates in most cities, except for those with populations of 25,000 to less than 50,000. Factors other than COPS funding accounted for the majority of the crime rate decline in the 1990s, with COPS expenditures contributing to about 5% of the drop between 1993 and 2000. The analysis used data from 2,074 local law enforcement agencies from 1990 to 2001 to evaluate the impact of COPS hiring, MORE, COPS in Schools (CIS), and Small Communities Grant Program (SCGP) funds on crime rates. COPS hiring grants had a significant impact on various crimes, decreasing burglaries by 2.2%, auto thefts by 3.3%, robberies by 5%, homicides by 3.2%, and assaults by 3.6%. MORE grants also had a significant impact on various crimes. The impact of hiring grants on various crimes was significant, reducing burglaries by 0.5%, auto thefts by 0.8%, larcenies by 0.3%, and robberies by 1.5%. CIS and SCGP grants did not have a significant impact on crime rates. Hiring grants had a negative impact on only a few crimes, with a statistically significant negative impact on robberies. The impact of hiring grants on reducing crime was significant, with hiring grants having a negative impact on robberies. MORE grants also had a significant impact on robberies, assaults, and burglaries. Research suggests that additional officers may decrease crime, but the effectiveness of hiring programs in large cities is ambiguous. The GAO's analysis shows that hiring grants decreased crime in cities with populations over 150,000, while Muhlhausen's analysis suggests they were relatively ineffective in large cities. The GAO's analysis evaluated the impact of hiring grants on all index crimes in cities with populations over 150,000, while Muhlhausen analyzed the impact of hiring grants on individual index crimes in cities with populations of 250,000 or greater. The GAO's analysis may have captured effects that Muhlhausen's research did not by evaluating the impact of hiring grants on all index crimes in a greater number of cities. However, GAO's findings may have also been the product of conducting its analysis using the aggregate number of index crimes rather than testing the affect of COPS grants on individual index crimes. Grants targeting specific problems or allowing more experienced officers to engage in community policing may be effective in decreasing violent crime. Congress could amend the COPS program to focus grants on specific issues rather than just hiring more officers. Research suggests that deploying senior officers, not new hires, can reduce certain crimes in large cities. Grant funds could also be used to hire non-sworn support staff or invest in technology to reduce administrative tasks for officers. Another issue is whether the COPS program actually increased police hiring in the 1990s. The COPS program in the 1990s increased police hiring, with proponents arguing it met its goal of placing 100,000 officers on the street. Despite criticism of misspent funds, Congress allocated $1 billion for hiring grants in 2009, the highest level since 1999. Congress continued funding for hiring programs in FY2010 and FY2011, prompting further consideration of the issue. The COPS program has provided funding for hiring law enforcement officers, with conflicting reports on the actual number hired. The COPS Office claims 117,000 officers were hired, while other evaluations suggest the number is below 100,000. The GAO found funding paid for about 88,000 additional officer-years from 1994 to 2001. An NIJ evaluation estimated that 84,600 officers would have been hired by 2001 out of the 105,000 funded by the COPS program. The COPS program funded hiring law enforcement officers, with conflicting reports on the actual number hired. The COPS Office reported funding for 117,000 officers, while the GAO estimated about 88,000 additional officer-years from 1994 to 2001. Differences in reported numbers are due to varying measurement methods between the COPS Office, GAO, and NIJ evaluations. The GAO calculated officer-years from COPS funding, noting that individual officers may be counted in multiple years. This total is not indicative of officers on the street due to COPS funds. An NIJ-sponsored evaluation estimated officers hired with COPS grants by extrapolating data from law enforcement agencies. Retention requirements for grant-funded officers were not announced at the time of data collection. The COPS Office awarded grant funds for hiring officers, but not all funds were used for hiring. Research suggests that 70% of hiring funds increased police force size. An audit found discrepancies in the number of officers funded and hired due to agencies not accepting grants. The COPS Office awarded $485 million in grant funds for hiring 7,722 officers, but some grants were not accepted. They also counted 2,526 officers towards their goal without award documents being provided. Terminated grants were not promptly de-obligated, making it seem like the goal was closer than it actually was. The OIG found that 78% of grantees audited could not show that MORE grants led to officers being redeployed for community policing. 41% of grantees were found to have used federal funds to supplant local funds. COPS did not require grantees to retain 31,091 funded positions through FY2000. The COPS program has faced challenges with grant oversight and effectiveness, leading to potential misuse of funds. Congress may need to increase oversight, especially with the large hiring funds allocated in the ARRA. Grant funds can be used to hire new officers or retain existing ones facing layoffs, potentially incentivizing local governments to rely more on federal dollars. The COPS program has faced challenges with grant oversight and effectiveness, potentially leading to misuse of funds. Between 1993 and 2000, COPS obligations contributed to a decrease in crime rates. However, cost-benefit analyses suggest that the program's cost may exceed the benefits derived. Congress may need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of funding additional law enforcement officer positions. Evans and Owens estimated that COPS hiring grants cost law enforcement agencies $4.4 billion, with a net benefit of $3.4 billion. If larceny and rapes were excluded, the net benefit decreased to $2.9 billion. Muhlhausen estimated a city of 1 million people spent $5 million on hiring, MORE, and innovative grants. The researcher estimated that COPS grants resulted in approximately $926,000, $1.7 million, and $1.3 million in cost-savings to crime victims. Overall, COPS grants for a city of 1 million people cost approximately $1 million more than they save, mainly due to the lack of cost-effectiveness of hiring grants. However, MORE and innovative grants were found to be cost-effective. These cost-benefit analyses are based on assumptions about crime costs and the impact of COPS grants on crime. Given the lack of cost-effectiveness of the COPS hiring grant program, Congress could consider shifting focus to supporting law enforcement through technology and resources. Increasing the effectiveness of hiring grants by ensuring all funded officers are deployed may improve cost-effectiveness, but the impact on crime rates remains uncertain. The research is unclear on the impact of additional officers on crime. Congress may need to increase oversight of funding for hiring programs. COPS funding has been used for various initiatives since FY2005, including hiring programs and school safety projects. The COPS in Schools (CIS) program funded school resource officers for community policing in schools. The Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP) supported tribal law enforcement needs. The COPS Methamphetamine Initiative aimed to reduce methamphetamine production and distribution through grants for equipment, training, and personnel. The COPS Technology grants provided funding for law enforcement agencies to purchase technologies for communication, crime analysis, and crime prevention. The Interoperable Communications Technology program helped communities develop effective communication systems for public safety. Grants were used to purchase equipment for multidisciplinary projects and upgrade technologies. The Secure Our Schools (SOS) Initiative provided grant funds for school security measures, security assessments, training, and coordination with law enforcement. An audit found some grants duplicative of those awarded under the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program. The OIG reported that grants awarded under the CHP, CIS, and SOS programs were sometimes duplicative of grants awarded under LLEBG. In 2006, Congress replaced LLEBG and the Byrne Formula Grant program with the JAG program, which provides funding for a wider variety of programs related to criminal justice. State and local governments can use JAG funds for various programs, including drug treatment, planning, evaluation, technology improvement, and crime victim initiatives. Funding for COPS grant programs may fluctuate between fiscal years, but programs like CHP have been funded consistently since FY2008. Congress could reinstate funding for zeroed-out grant programs in the future. The COPS Office argues that their grants and JAG grants are complementary, not duplicative. COPS grants must be used for community policing, while JAG funds are not required to be. Law enforcement agencies prefer having different grant programs for a wider variety of funding options to implement their policing vision. Congress may need to decide if state, local, and tribal governments should be allowed to receive grants from both JAG and COPS programs for similar purposes. Additional funding for the JAG program could potentially replace funding for COPS programs like CHP, the Methamphetamine Initiative, or COPS Technology grants. This could streamline the grant application process for state and local governments, allowing them to support similar programs without the need for multiple grant applications. The JAG program allows state and local governments to fund programs that meet their needs. If Congress increases funding for JAG instead of COPS programs, they may lose control over how the funds are spent. The OIG reported duplication between COPS and OJP grant programs due to multiple grant programs funding similar items. Congress could consider amending the authorizing legislation for the JAG and COPS programs to prevent state, local, and tribal governments from using grants for the same purpose. For example, COPS grants could be restricted to hiring programs and law enforcement technology, while JAG funds could not be used for hiring police officers or purchasing law enforcement-related technology. This would address the duplication issue between the two grant programs. The COPS account in the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies appropriations bill lacks flexibility for law enforcement agencies to apply for grants, as they are limited to specific programs based on Congress's appropriations. This restricts agencies from accessing funding for hiring additional officers, as seen in FY2006 and FY2007. The COPS program faced limitations in accessing funding for hiring additional officers due to Congress earmarking appropriations for specific programs like the Law Enforcement Technology program and the Methamphetamine Initiative. Congress may need to reconsider funding COPS as a single-grant program to reduce administrative burdens on law enforcement agencies. A single-grant program for the COPS program would provide law enforcement agencies with more flexibility in how they use the funds, but it could also result in Congress losing control over how the funds are spent and monitoring program performance effectively. The COPS Office provides grants for hiring law enforcement officers for various purposes, such as community policing or school resource officers. Different agencies may use the grants differently, making national evaluations of program effectiveness challenging due to the need for specific metrics tailored to each program."
