    "content": "Notably, there are no data capturing the total quantity of foreign-produced illicit drugs smuggled into the United States at or between POEs. Officials rely on drug seizure data to understand how drugs cross U.S. borders. Marijuana remains the most-seized illicit drug by weight, with more seized at ports than between them in FY2019. In FY2019, 289,529 pounds (52%) of drugs were seized at ports, and 266,822 pounds (48%) were seized by Border Patrol between ports. Marijuana is the primary drug seized between POEs, but methamphetamine seizures have increased since FY2013. Smugglers use various methods like tunnels, aircraft, maritime vessels, and mules to move drugs into the US. The debate on border security includes discussions on physical barriers along the Southwest border. Efforts to build physical barriers along the Southwest border aim to deter unauthorized entry of migrants and smugglers, with a recent focus on preventing drug smuggling and trafficking. Executive Order 13767 emphasizes the need for a physical wall to prevent illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and terrorism. Analysts suggest that smugglers may adapt to these barriers. Mexican traffickers use sophisticated tunnels to smuggle drugs from Mexico into the US, with amenities like ventilation and electricity. In August 2019, a tunnel over 4,300 feet long was discovered in Tijuana. The longest smuggling tunnel discovered to date runs from Tijuana, Mexico, to Otay Mesa, CA, measuring over three-quarters of a mile in length and 70 feet below the surface. CBP and ICE are responsible for investigating and intercepting underground smuggling activities, utilizing technology to detect tunnels and coordinate efforts through programs like the Border Enforcement Security Task Force. Variations in soil types along the Southwest border pose challenges in tunnel detection, requiring different sensor technologies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended in 2017 that CBP and ICE establish standard operating procedures for coordinating counter-tunnel efforts across all border sectors. Traffickers use various methods to move contraband over border barriers, including tossing loads by hand, launching bundles from air cannons, driving vehicles over fencing, and using ultralight aircraft and drones. Ultralights transport bulkier marijuana shipments, while drones have the potential for increased drug smuggling. Border officials have tested systems to enhance detection of ultralights and drones crossing the border for drug smuggling. Current radar technology is used for detecting unauthorized movement of people and goods, not specifically for detecting drugs being smuggled over barriers. Policymakers may need to assess if these technologies keep pace with evolving strategies of drug smugglers. Various forms of physical barriers exist along the Southwest border to prevent the passage of vehicles and pedestrians, including expanded metal, steel mesh, chain link, steel and concrete bollards. Smugglers have found ways to defeat these barriers by cutting holes, driving vehicles through fencing, bribing border officials, and sawing through steel and concrete bollards. Some border barriers can be breached by cutting through a single bollard, creating gaps for smuggling people and drugs. While barriers may deter some drug smuggling, it can also displace it to unfenced areas. This shift can lead to challenges in terrain that act as natural barriers, potentially altering smuggling routes. Reports show an increase in maritime smuggling in San Diego coinciding with the construction of a border barrier. Smugglers use small vessels to bypass the barrier. Smugglers along the coast use small vessels like \"pangas\" to transport drugs at high speeds. They also utilize recreational and fishing boats with hidden compartments to blend in. Border barriers may push smugglers to use official points of entry (POEs) for drug trafficking. Recent data shows more drugs are already being moved through POEs than between them. Policymakers question the impact of additional barriers on drug smuggling through POEs. Increased border barriers may impact drug smuggling between official points of entry (POEs) by altering smugglers' routes, tactics, and abilities. Analyzing this issue is complex due to unknown quantities of illicit drugs entering the US. Border barriers are just one part of the tactical infrastructure at the border, alongside technology and personnel. It is challenging to isolate the effects of changes in border barriers from other security measures. The Department of Homeland Security recognizes the challenges in estimating the effectiveness of border security on the Southwest border between official points of entry (POEs). Factors such as unknown flows of people and goods, as well as the complexity of attributing effectiveness to personnel, technology, or infrastructure, make it difficult to assess the impact of border barriers on drug smuggling. Other factors like demand and supply for drugs, type of drug being shipped, terrain, and climate conditions also play a role in drug smuggling activities. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of border security on the Southwest border between official points of entry (POEs). Factors such as unknown flows of people and goods, terrain, climate conditions, and smuggler counterintelligence functions complicate the assessment. Policymakers question how DHS identifies and evaluates changes in drug smuggling between POEs, including linking drug seizure data to border security efforts like expanded barriers. They also consider the return on investment in border barriers compared to other security enhancements. Policymakers may question how DHS defines the effectiveness of border barriers in deterring drug smuggling and whether barriers contribute to gathering intelligence for the drug-control community."
