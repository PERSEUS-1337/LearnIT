    "content": "Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code allows only municipalities to file for bankruptcy, but not all municipalities are eligible. The municipality must be authorized by its state, insolvent, willing to negotiate a debt adjustment plan, and show good faith in negotiations with creditors. Challenges to eligibility can lead to litigation, with the burden of proof on the municipality. The term \"municipality\" in bankruptcy law is broader than just cities and towns. Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code allows municipalities to file for bankruptcy, but not all are eligible. The term \"municipality\" includes political subdivisions like counties, school districts, and water districts. Since 1994, municipalities can only file under chapter 9 if authorized by their states. Some states, like Georgia, prohibit municipalities from filing, while others, like Iowa, restrict authorization to insolvent municipalities due to involuntarily incurred debt. In 14 states, municipalities need state approval to file for chapter 9 bankruptcy. 23 states lack laws on authorization, making it impossible for municipalities to file without specific legislation. Being authorized to file is not enough; municipalities must also be insolvent, defined as not paying debts as they become due. To be eligible for chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, an insolvent municipality must file in good faith, showing a desire to implement a plan of adjustment. The automatic stay prevents creditors from taking collection actions once the petition is filed. Chapter 9 bankruptcy allows municipalities to seek protection from creditors, but creditors can request relief from the automatic stay. Special revenues can be used to pay off debts, and creditors can challenge the municipality's eligibility. Filing for chapter 9 doesn't solve financial issues, and additional funds may be needed. The municipality can acquire debt with priority or secured by property. In Chapter 9 bankruptcy, municipalities can seek protection from creditors, but some states restrict borrowing for operating expenses. The entire debt must be repaid by the plan's effective date for confirmation. Municipal debtors have control in Chapter 9, similar to Chapter 11, with no trustee unless requested by a creditor for specific purposes like pursuing avoidance powers. In Chapter 11, a trustee can replace the debtor in possession under certain circumstances. In Chapter 9 bankruptcy, municipalities can seek protection from creditors, with no trustee unless requested for specific reasons like fraud or incompetence. Municipal property and income remain under the municipality's control, with limited interference from the bankruptcy court. The court's involvement is mainly to determine eligibility and dismiss cases when necessary. In Chapter 9 bankruptcy, municipalities can seek protection from creditors, with limited interference from the bankruptcy court. The court's involvement includes determining eligibility and approving assumptions or rejections of executory contracts. The municipality can assume beneficial contracts with court approval and reject burdensome ones. The business judgment rule is typically used for approval, but a higher standard is applied for evaluating collective bargaining agreements. In Chapter 9 bankruptcy, municipalities can seek protection from creditors with limited court interference. The court approves assumptions or rejections of contracts, including collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). To reject a CBA, the debtor must meet specific requirements under \u00a7 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code, including equitable treatment of all parties, providing necessary information to the bargaining unit's representative, and demonstrating that the balance of equities favors rejection. This higher standard was established following the Supreme Court's 1984 ruling in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco and Bildisco. In Chapter 9 bankruptcy, municipalities can seek protection from creditors with limited court interference. The court approves assumptions or rejections of contracts, including collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). The Bildisco standard requires a higher standard than the business judgment rule but is less stringent than \u00a7 1113. A CBA may only be rejected if it burdens the debtor and rejection is favored after balancing equities. The Orange County case in 1995 found the Bildisco standards applicable but not met. Vallejo, CA, successfully rejected CBAs in its chapter 9 case, with courts applying the Bildisco standard. In Chapter 9 bankruptcy, municipalities can avoid fraudulent transfers and preferential transfers under sections 547 and 548 of the Bankruptcy Code. Only the debtor can file a plan of adjustment in a chapter 9 case, and the court may set a deadline for filing the plan if not done initially. The plan must be accepted by each class of impaired creditors for confirmation, with a \"cramdown\" provision similar to chapter 11. Chapter 9 bankruptcy allows municipalities to adjust debts, with a \"cramdown\" provision similar to chapter 11. Special revenue bonds are protected, but general obligation bonds may not be. State laws can limit adjustments to debts and pension obligations. Section 943 requires the court to confirm a plan if certain conditions are met. Chapter 9 bankruptcy allows municipalities to adjust debts, with a \"cramdown\" provision similar to chapter 11. Special revenue bonds are protected, but general obligation bonds may not be. Section 943 directs the court to confirm a plan if it complies with the Bankruptcy Code, is feasible, and in the best interest of creditors. Municipalities rarely file for bankruptcy, as seen in the case of New York City in 1975, which created a financial watchdog instead of filing for bankruptcy. In 1991, Bridgeport, CT filed for chapter 9 bankruptcy, but the case was dismissed due to challenges on its eligibility. Orange County, CA filed for chapter 9 in 1994, representing the largest municipal bankruptcy filing. The county's treasurer engaged in high-risk investments, leveraging $7.5 billion into $20 billion. The OCIP's $7.5 billion investment equity was leveraged into $20 billion, dependent on declining interest rates. As rates rose, financial liquidity plummeted, leading to a chapter 9 filing. Lawsuits were filed against investment bankers. A plan of adjustment was effective in June 1996, with $816 million distributed in litigation proceeds in February 2000. Vallejo filed for chapter 9 in 2008 after attempting to resolve financial issues by cutting services and seeking new revenue sources. The city retained a consultant to identify new revenue sources but was limited by California law. It negotiated interim agreements to modify CBAs with police and firefighters, froze employee compensation, and filed for chapter 9. The city renegotiated all but one of its CBAs. The city renegotiated all but one of its CBAs, allowing it to reject the remaining CBA using the Bildisco standard. The city's plan of adjustment proposes paying unsecured creditors between 5% and 20% of their claims. Boise County, ID, filed for chapter 9 bankruptcy due to a $4 million judgment, impacting its budget of less than $9.5 million. Alamar Ranch, LLC faced opposition from taxpayers in the county for a proposed residential treatment facility. The county was found to have violated the Fair Housing Act. Harrisburg, PA, entered the state's \"distressed cities\" program in December 2010 after failing to make bond payments and having a junk-bond credit rating. Jefferson County, AL, is facing financial difficulties with a projected deficit in 2015 and a $3.2 billion debt load from sewer bonds. Some believe filing for chapter 9 bankruptcy would be a better option than the state program. Jefferson County, AL, is facing financial difficulties with a $3.2 billion debt load from sewer bonds. The county's bonds were downgraded to junk status in 2008, leading to projected inability to meet interest payments. Recently, the county lost revenue due to an unconstitutional occupational tax. In 1934, emergency aid legislation was enacted for insolvent municipalities during the Great Depression, later deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1937, new legislation established a new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. The legislation enacted in 1937 established a new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, expanding the definition of \"municipality\" to include public agencies with the power to tax. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, citing the need for federal intervention in municipal bankruptcies due to state limitations. Originally set to expire in 1940, the law was extended multiple times before being made permanent in 1946, with changes including the removal of \"taxing\" from the definition of \"municipality.\" The definition of \"municipality\" was expanded in 1937 to include public agencies authorized to construct or acquire revenue-producing utilities and issue bonds for financing. In 1976, the provisions for municipal bankruptcy were revised to streamline the process, eliminating the need for creditor approval before filing a petition and triggering an automatic stay to protect the debtor from litigation. The 1976 revisions to municipal bankruptcy laws streamlined the process, allowing debtors to reject contracts with court approval and providing protection from creditors' claims. These revisions were later incorporated into chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978. Congress has since made several amendments to chapter 9, including changes in 1988 regarding municipal \"insolvency\" definitions and creditor rights, and in 1994 requiring municipalities to be \"specifically authorized\" by state law to file for chapter 9 bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 amended chapter 9 by incorporating additional sections from chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code, mainly related to exceptions to the automatic stay. Additionally, a subsection from chapter 11 was included in the applicable sections of chapter 9."
