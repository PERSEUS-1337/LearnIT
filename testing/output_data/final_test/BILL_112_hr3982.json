    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Religious Liberty Protection Act of 2012\". Congress has historically protected religious freedom through various legislative acts, including the First Amendment and subsequent laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. These laws have reinforced individuals' rights to practice their religious beliefs. The United States has a history of protecting religious freedoms and conscience rights, including through the Weldon amendment which prohibits discrimination based on refusal to provide or refer for abortions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act grants the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to provide a list of detailed services to be included as essential health benefits and preventive health services, representing a new nationwide coverage requirement for health plans. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates essential health benefits and preventive services for health plans, limiting exemptions for religious groups and potentially hindering individuals' rights of conscience in the health insurance marketplace. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule requiring health plans to cover sterilization and contraceptives approved by the FDA, including drugs with abortifacient effects. This mandate under the Affordable Care Act forces employers to provide insurance covering abortion services, violating Federal provisions. The Department of Health and Human Services mandated health plans to cover sterilization and FDA-approved contraceptives, including abortifacient drugs. In response to objections, they granted institutions and employers with religious or moral concerns an extra year to comply with the rule. SEC. 3. PROTECTING RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.
