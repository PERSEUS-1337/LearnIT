    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Settlement Act\". It includes findings related to the settlement. Congress finds that the Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River for power production sites, licenses involving tribal land require a reasonable annual charge, the Columbia Basin Commission received a permit for water power development at Grand Coulee, and the Spokane Tribe would have benefited if the site had been developed. In the mid-1930s, the Federal Government federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project, recognizing the impact on the Spokane Tribe and the Colville Tribes, leading to a share of revenue from power produced at the dam. The Act of June 29, 1940 granted the United States all rights to tribal and allotted land within the Spokane and Colville Reservations for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Columbia Basin Project. In 1994, Congress ratified the Colville Settlement Agreement, which required compensation for past land use to the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. The Secretary determined just and equitable amounts to be paid. The Colville Settlement Agreement in 1994 required a $53,000,000 payment for past land use and annual payments of $15,250,000 for continued land use. The Spokane Tribe did not file a claim within the statute of limitations, and both tribes did not file compensation claims before August 13, 1951. The Spokane Tribe suffered harm from the Grand Coulee Dam construction, with land taken equaling 39% of Colville tribal land. Payments and land transfers under the Act provide fair compensation for past and ongoing land use. The Spokane Tribe has resolved that payments and land transfers under the Act are fair compensation for the past and ongoing use of tribal land for hydropower production at Grand Coulee Dam. The Act aims to provide fair compensation to the Spokane Tribe for the use of its land for hydropower generation at the Grand Coulee Dam. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"Colville Settlement Agreement,\" \"Colville Tribes,\" and \"Computed annual payment.\" The curr_chunk defines terms such as \"Computed Annual Payment,\" \"Confederated Tribes Act,\" \"Fund,\" \"Secretary,\" \"Spokane Business Council,\" and \"Spokane Tribe.\" The term \"Spokane Tribe\" refers to the Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation, Washington. SEC. 5. SETTLEMENT FUND. Establishment of an interest-bearing trust fund called the \"Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund\" in the Treasury of the United States, funded by deposits from the Secretary totaling $23,900,000 for fiscal year 2009 and $18,900,000 for each of the following 4 fiscal years. The Fund will be maintained and invested by the Secretary in accordance with the Act of June 24, 1938 (25 U.S.C. 162a). Payments from the Fund to the Spokane Business Council can be requested after funds are deposited. The Spokane Business Council can request funds from the Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund, and the Secretary must pay the requested amount within 60 days. $5,000,000 of the initial deposit is allocated for a Cultural Resource Repository and Interpretive Center. The Cultural Resource Repository and Interpretive Center will house and protect burial remains and cultural resources affected by the Grand Coulee Dam. It will also serve as an educational facility on the culture and history of the Spokane Tribe. The funding for this project does not impact existing federal responsibilities under relevant laws. The Spokane Business Council will use 25% of funds for general benefit to all members of the Spokane Tribe, while 75% will be used for discretionary purposes. The funding for the Cultural Resource Repository and Interpretive Center will not impact existing federal responsibilities under relevant laws. The Business Council will implement resource development, credit, scholarship, and economic development programs. SEC. 6. PAYMENTS BY ADMINISTRATOR. The Administrator will make payments to the Spokane Tribe, starting with an initial payment on March 1, 2009, and subsequent payments on March 1 of each year thereafter. These payments will be 29 percent of the Computed Annual Payment for the respective fiscal years. To recover these payments, the Administrator will make cost reductions in expenditures annually and include a cost reduction plan in the annual budget submitted to Congress. SEC. 7. TREATMENT AFTER FUNDS ARE PAID. Payments made to the Spokane Business Council or Spokane Tribe can be used in the same manner as other tribal funds. The Secretary and Administrator have no trust responsibility for the funds once they are paid. The funds and any generated income will be treated similarly to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe Distribution of Judgment Funds Act. The Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan Distribution of Judgment Funds Act states that funds paid to the Spokane Business Council or Spokane Tribe will become tribal governmental funds and will be subject to an annual tribal government audit. SEC. 8. REPAYMENT CREDIT. The Administrator deducts $1,300,000 from interest payable to the Treasury annually, credited to interest payments on debt associated with the generation function. The Administrator deducts excess interest payments on debt associated with the Federal Columbia River Power System's generation function, allocating the surplus pro rata to other interest payments. Any remaining deduction serves as a credit towards other payments to the Treasury. SEC. 9. TRANSFER OF ADMINISTRATIVE JURISDICTION AND RESTORATION OF OWNERSHIP OF LAND. The Secretary will transfer administrative jurisdiction over land acquired under the Act of June 29, 1940, within the Spokane Indian Reservation to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land will be held in trust for the Spokane Tribe and remain part of the reservation, with the same federal trust responsibility as other tribal land. The United States reserves perpetual rights over land transferred within the Spokane Indian Reservation for the Columbia Basin Project. This includes the right to operate, maintain, repair, and replace recreational facilities owned by the United States. The land transferred under this Act will remain part of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The National Park Service will continue to administer the Recreation Area. The Department of the Interior will enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Spokane Tribe for coordination. SEC. 10. Payment by the Secretary and Administrator, and restoration of land ownership, satisfy Spokane Tribe's claim to hydropower revenues from Grand Coulee Dam. SEC. 11. Appropriations authorized for Act implementation. SEC. 12. Act does not set precedent for other Power Administrations."
