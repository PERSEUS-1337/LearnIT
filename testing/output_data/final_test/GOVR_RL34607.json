    "content": "The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 established the position of Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to ensure fair agency proceedings. ALJs, originally called hearing examiners, are meant to conduct unbiased hearings free from agency influence. The APA guarantees parties in agency proceedings protections such as a hearing on the record with an impartial presiding officer. The APA mandates that agency adjudications requiring determination on the record must be presided over by an ALJ or the agency head. ALJs have two main duties in the administrative adjudication process: presiding over evidence-taking at hearings and acting as fact-finders, as well as making or recommending initial determinations on resolution. ALJs, similar to trial judges, make initial determinations in administrative adjudication processes. The Office of Personnel Management oversees the selection and certification of ALJs, with the Social Security Administration hiring the most ALJs. ALJs are chosen through a merit selection process administered by OPM. The Office of Personnel Management oversees the selection and certification of ALJs, with agencies ranking applicants based on qualifications and skills. ALJ positions require licensed attorneys with seven years of relevant experience, who pass an examination to be placed on a register of eligible hires. The Office of Personnel Management oversees the selection and certification of ALJs, with agencies ranking applicants based on qualifications and skills. ALJ positions require licensed attorneys with seven years of relevant experience, who pass an examination to be placed on a register of eligible hires. Applicants who receive a passing score are entitled to preference points if they are veterans. ALJs can be transferred or detailed to another agency if necessary, and OPM temporarily suspended the hiring process due to a lawsuit over changes in the scoring formula. The scoring system for ALJ positions gave veterans a hiring advantage, leading to a lawsuit by non-veteran applicants. The MSPB found the scoring formula violated regulations and ordered its suspension, but the Court of Appeals overturned this decision. OPM resumed using the 1996 scoring formula in 2003 after the court ruling. In 2003, OPM planned to hire new ALJs from a pool of qualified applicants after a lawsuit. OPM issued a final rule in 2007 to update the ALJ selection process, including changes to the examination process, requirements for active bar membership, restrictions on agency awards to ALJs, and revised pay allowing for reductions under certain circumstances. The final rule issued by OPM in 2007 updated the ALJ selection process, including changes to the examination process and requirements for active bar membership. The Association of Administrative Law Judges, seven ALJs, and three private practice attorneys filed suit against OPM regarding the requirements for ALJs and the qualification standards. OPM issued an interim rule suspending the requirement for incumbent ALJs. The district court stayed parts of the case regarding the ALJ qualification standards. OPM was granted summary judgment on other claims. The ALJ application process remained closed until a new vacancy announcement was issued in May 2007, with a cutoff number of 1,250 applicants. Those on the previous ALJ register had to reapply. OPM established a new register on October 30, 2007. OPM established a new register for ALJ positions in October 2007, based on a vacancy announcement from May 2007. Agencies have hired from this register, which has been reopened multiple times. Selective certification was used by some agencies to appoint ALJs without following ranking rules. Specialization of hearing examiners was advocated for efficiency reasons before the APA was enacted in 1941. In 1947, the Civil Service Commission established a ranking system for ALJs, allowing agencies to choose from the top three candidates on a register. The President's Conference in 1954 criticized the system, recommending that agencies be free to appoint any person on the qualified list. This led to agencies being able to appoint individuals with specialized knowledge. In 1962, an advisory committee recommended allowing individual agencies to require specific qualifications for ALJs. The Service Commission advisory committee recommended individual agencies to require special qualifications for ALJs. The Staff Director opposed selective certification, citing that general capabilities were more important than specific subject matter expertise. Selective certification led to \"undesirable inbreeding\" as most agency ALJs had previously been agency staff attorneys. About half of hiring agencies required special subject-matter expertise at that time. In the past, many hiring agencies required special subject-matter expertise for selecting ALJs. Selective certification allowed certain agencies to choose from eligible ALJs with specific expertise. However, in 1984, OPM ended this procedure, and agencies were no longer allowed to formally require subject-matter expertise. In 1984, OPM ended the procedure of agencies formally requiring subject-matter expertise for selecting ALJs. Agencies can now give priority consideration to applicants with special qualifications, but the meaning of \"priority consideration\" was not defined. Agencies must select from the highest three eligibles available for appointment, considering veteran preference rules. The International Trade Commission and other agencies want OPM to allow them to choose ALJ candidates based on agency experience and technical qualifications, rather than just the top three candidates. The Social Security Administration supports giving bonus points to candidates with subject matter experience for fair selection. OPM seems reluctant to allow selective certification. The American Bar Association opposes the ITC's proposal to ensure ALJs are not influenced by agencies. The APA emphasizes the independence of administrative law judges (ALJs) from agency influence in investigative or prosecuting functions. The separation of adjudicatory and investigative personnel was recommended in a 1937 report. While agencies can conduct performance evaluations of ALJs, they are not allowed to participate in decision-making related to their cases. Performance evaluations of ALJs are prohibited by civil service statutes to modify behavior through salary adjustments or tenure changes. ALJs appointed under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3105 are excluded from performance appraisals, while agencies must develop appraisal systems for other employees for various purposes. OPM regulations also prohibit rating ALJs' job performance or granting them awards or incentives. In the past, proposals have been made to establish an ALJ Performance Review Board or set standards for ALJ performance evaluations. Bills in the 96th Congress suggested evaluations every 6-10 years or appointment terms of 7-10 years based on evaluations by entities like ACUS and OPM. However, these proposals were not enacted due to the need for ALJ independence and evaluations free from agency pressures. ALJs are not subject to probationary periods and are considered a career appointment. An agency can only remove an ALJ for \"good cause,\" which is generally defined as actions undermining confidence in the adjudicatory process. Examples include sexual harassment, refusal to travel, and failure to deliver legal documents. The ALJs can only be removed for \"good cause,\" such as refusal to travel, failure to deliver legal documents, and other actions undermining confidence in the adjudicatory process. Performance appraisal cases involving the Social Security Administration established that agencies may use case disposition statistics in disciplinary actions. The ALJs can only be removed for \"good cause,\" such as refusal to travel, failure to deliver legal documents, and other actions undermining confidence in the adjudicatory process. Disciplinary actions related to low productivity must not interfere with an ALJ's performance. Some agencies have set timelines for ALJs to issue decisions in regulation. For example, a Federal Reserve regulation states that the ALJ must file and certify a record of the proceedings for the Board of Governors' decision. ALJs must file a record of proceedings within 45 days for the Board of Governors' decision. Agencies have rarely removed or disciplined ALJs. MSPB hearing procedures are outlined in 5 C.F.R. Part 1201. ALJ pay can be reduced for good cause or voluntarily for personal reasons with approval. ALJs may request a voluntary reduction for personal reasons, which can be approved by OPM. ALJs may also be subject to agency reduction in force. They hear cases in enforcement, entitlement, regulatory, and contract categories. The use of ALJs in adjudicating disputes before executive branch agencies is not universal. Some agencies, such as the Executive Office of Immigration Review and the Veterans Administration, do not require ALJs for certain cases. The decision to employ ALJs is left to agency-specific legislation, as stated in the APA. The use of ALJs in adjudicating disputes before executive branch agencies is not universal. While agencies not required to conduct hearings on the record may use non-ALJs for various proceedings, the decision-making independence of non-ALJs is generally less protected than that of ALJs. Differences in independence, training, experience, and compensation between ALJs and non-ALJs may impact how these hearing officers review administrative appeals. ALJs, despite being agency employees, are not subject to agency management, with certain requirements in place to preserve their integrity, independence, and insulation. Certain requirements ensure the integrity, independence, and insulation of ALJs from agency influence. The competitive selection process is conducted by OPM, appointment is restricted to those eligible by OPM, and ALJs can only be removed for good cause determined by the MSPB. ALJs are largely independent in matters of compensation and tenure, unlike non-ALJs who are subject to agency control. ALJs are highly qualified and trained through a merit selection procedure. The ALJ merit selection procedure ensures highly qualified and trained ALJs, while non-ALJs come from various backgrounds and may lack experience and legal training. Hearing officers, who are non-ALJs, preside over formal proceedings similar to ALJs. Proponents argue that ALJs are better qualified due to their independence and superior training, while proponents of non-ALJs point to their effectiveness in administrative appeals. Proponents of using non-ALJs highlight their successful use in various administrative settings. Some argue that ALJ independence may have disadvantages when consistent outcomes are needed. Both ALJs and non-ALJs have strengths and weaknesses, and Congress could consider alternatives if concerned about approving non-ALJs. The agency could specify review mechanisms for non-ALJs."
