    "title": "SB 946",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 46300 of the Education Code is amended to include the attendance of pupils engaged in educational activities under the immediate supervision of certified school personnel. This applies to work experience education programs meeting California State standards, where pupil participation in on-the-job training is supervised by both the employer and school personnel. The pupil-teacher ratio in work experience programs should not exceed 125 pupils per teacher coordinator. The ratio can be waived by the state board under specific criteria. Pupils in work experience programs can only receive one day of attendance credit per calendar day and must be enrolled full-time in regular classes. Immediate supervision in rehabilitative schools means the person overseeing the pupil shares responsibility with certificated personnel. A pupil in a rehabilitative school can only receive one day of attendance credit per calendar day. School districts can receive proportional average daily attendance credit for high school pupils enrolled in regional occupational programs, but not for less than 145 minutes of attendance each day. In computing average daily attendance, the divisor is 240, or 180 for pupils excused from physical education. Travel time to regional occupational centers/programs doesn't count. Independent study attendance is included, limited to one day per calendar day. A pupil serving as a member of a precinct board for an election is not required to participate for five or more consecutive schooldays if they complete all missed assignments and tests. The teacher must ensure that the makeup work is reasonably equivalent to what was missed. (B) Complete a report or written assignment on the activities as a precinct board member for an election. The teacher must ensure submission within a reasonable time after completion. \"Immediate supervision\" in career technical education programs involves pupil participation in on-the-job experiences under shared supervision. In computing average daily attendance, a school district includes kindergarten pupils after completing one school year or transitional kindergarten pupils after one year if certain conditions are met. A district cannot include attendance for more than two years in kindergarten or a combination of transitional kindergarten and kindergarten. Section 48205 of the Education Code is amended to specify valid reasons for a pupil to be excused from school, including illness, quarantine, medical appointments, funeral services, jury duty, and caring for a sick child. Valid reasons for a pupil to be excused from school include personal reasons like court appearances, funerals, religious observances, employment or educational conferences, and serving on a precinct board for an election. A pupil may be excused from school to spend time with a family member in the military deployed to a combat zone. The superintendent determines the length of the absence. The student must complete missed assignments and tests within a reasonable time for full credit. For religious retreats, attendance is limited to four hours per semester. Absences for this purpose do not affect average daily attendance calculations or state payments, except for students serving on an election precinct board. \"Immediate family\" is defined as in Section 45194, with \"employee\" replaced by \"pupil.\""
