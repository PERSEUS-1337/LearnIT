Questions arose in the 1960s about the constitutional basis and political wisdom of this authority. Despite changes in procedures and limitations, reorganization acts continued to permit the President to submit plans. The reorganization authority delegated to the President between 1932 and 1984 allowed for proposals to Congress that could go into effect unless blocked by a motion of disapproval. However, this legislative veto process faced criticism over the years for potentially increasing conflict between branches. The President's use of this authority was questioned for bypassing regular legislative procedures, leading to tensions between branches. The reorganization authority delegated to the President between 1932 and 1984 allowed for proposals to Congress that could go into effect unless blocked by a motion of disapproval. The process became rigid with no amendments permitted, leading to tensions between branches. The 1983 Chadha decision questioned the utility of the Reorganization Act compared to the regular legislative process. No President has requested its renewal since 1984. The Constitution is silent on organizational matters, emphasizing Congress's critical role in organizing the executive branch. Congress establishes departments, agencies, and internal organization, determines agency missions, personnel systems, confirms executive officials, and evaluates agency existence. This highlights the Framers' intention for Congress to play a significant role in managing the executive branch. President Herbert Hoover, a Progressive, advocated for Congress to delegate reorganization authority to the President for efficiency in the executive branch. Hoover successfully persuaded Congress to include this provision in the Economy Acts of 1932 and 1933. President Hoover advocated for reorganization authority in the executive branch, believing in the President's ability to act decisively based on scientific management principles. This view criticized Congress for being cumbersome and influenced by interest groups. President Roosevelt focused more on creating new agencies than reorganization, leading to limited use of the Reorganization Act. Roosevelt showed renewed interest in executive reorganization during heightened international pressures, leading to the passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939. This Act allowed the President to submit reorganization plans for two years, aiming to reduce expenditures while efficiently operating the government. Roosevelt successfully proposed Reorganization Plan No. 1 under this authority. During World War II, the President was granted authority to make temporary reorganizations under the War Powers Act. In 1945, Congress granted the President authority to submit reorganization plans for two years. The Reorganization Act of 1949 renewed the President's reorganization authority until 1977. The Reorganization Act of 1949 granted the President greater authority to submit reorganization plans for executive departments and agencies, with Congress having to accept or reject the plan in its entirety within 60 days. This Act established a one-house veto procedure for reorganization plans. The Reorganization Act of 1949 granted the President authority to submit reorganization plans for executive departments and agencies, with Congress having to accept or reject the plan within 60 days. President Truman submitted multiple plans in 1949 and 1950, with most becoming effective, including proposals to strengthen the Executive Office of the President and transfer the Public Roads Administration. Legislative bills like the National Security Act Amendments were also enacted during this time. The ease of plan effectiveness was attributed to two factors. The high rate of passage for reorganization plans was due to Congress giving deference to the President and the straightforward nature of the proposals. However, opposition to the reorganization process emerged over time, leading to amendments that limited the President's discretion in submitting plans and the approval process. The Reorganization Act of 1949 was renewed seven times between 1949 and 1977, with amendments aimed at restricting the scope of the plans and approval procedures. The limitations on reorganization plans included restrictions on frequency, subject matter, and creation of new legal authority. Congress eliminated the President's authority to propose new executive departments in 1964, leading to increased distrust between branches. Many in Congress challenged the Reorganization Act on constitutional grounds. The Reorganization Act was challenged on constitutional grounds by Representative Jack Brooks, who argued that it allowed the President to make laws without proper approval. President Carter requested Congress to renew his authority under the Act in 1977, which was eventually passed after amendments and signed into law. The Reorganization Act of 1977, signed by President Carter on April 6, 1977, made significant changes to the 1949 Act. Key provisions included allowing the President to amend a plan within 30 days, expanding prohibitions on departmental changes to independent regulatory agencies, and limiting the number of pending plans in Congress. Section 905 imposed additional limitations on the President's authority to submit Reorganization Plans. The Reorganization Act of 1977 expanded limitations on the President's authority to submit Reorganization Plans, including restrictions on creating new executive departments, continuing agencies beyond authorized periods, and authorizing functions not expressly allowed by law. The Reorganization Act of 1977 imposed limitations on the President's ability to submit reorganization plans, including restrictions on creating new executive departments, extending agency durations, and authorizing functions not explicitly permitted by law. Chairman Brooks pushed for a congressional vote on reorganization plans, with a resolution of disapproval required to be introduced simultaneously by specific committees. Under the Reorganization Act of 1977, President Carter submitted ten reorganization plans to Congress, all of which were allowed to become law. The reorganization authority granted to the President expired on April 7, 1981, and there were calls for its renewal in the new Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration considered renewing the reorganization authority after it expired in April 1981. Hearings were held in Congress in 1983 to discuss renewing the authority, with a bill proposing changes to the 1977 Reorganization Act. The Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha in 1983 had a significant impact on Congress' deliberations. H.R. 1314 required a joint resolution from both the House and Senate for a reorganization plan to become law, following the unconstitutional ruling on legislative vetoes. Expedited procedures from the 1977 Act were altered, with a veto override needing a two-thirds vote from both houses. Congressional sponsors Brooks and Representative Frank Horton were involved in the legislation. H.R. 1314, sponsored by Brooks and Representative Frank Horton, extended time frames for congressional consideration, presidential amendments, and committee actions. It also required an implementation section in the President's message for reorganization plans. The General Accounting Office recommended including an implementation section in reorganization plans to address startup problems faced by agencies under the Reorganization Act of 1977. These problems included delays in key officials, staffing issues, funding shortages, office space constraints, and difficulties in setting up administrative support functions like payroll and accounting systems. Front-end implementation planning objectives could help alleviate these issues. The implementation provision added to reorganization plans includes detailed actions, orders, and a timetable for completion. It aims to address startup problems faced by agencies under the Reorganization Act of 1977. The 1977 Reorganization Act included provisions to ensure proper planning and implementation of reorganization proposals. The Act's restrictions on subject matter in reorganization plans were deemed necessary and were continued in the legislation. The Act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on November 8, 1984, and was set to expire on December 31, 1984. No reorganization plans were submitted during this period. The President has not utilized reorganization authority since 1980, despite calls for its renewal. Reorganization within the executive branch is a continuous process driven by changes in priorities and resources. The concept of reorganization plans still holds appeal, but the specific intentions behind calls for renewal remain unclear. The President has not used reorganization authority since 1980 despite calls for its renewal. Supporters want to reintroduce an expedited process similar to the 1984 act to encourage the President to take the initiative in organizational management. Critics argue that the regular legislative process should be followed instead. Critics argue that the regular legislative process allows for democratic justification of a bill's failure, while the expedited procedures of the reorganization act are seen as undemocratic. Executive branch reorganization has been out-of-fashion, with a focus on changing management practices over organizational structures. The Clinton-Gore Administration emphasized performance over political accountability in their reinventing government exercise. The focus on performance over political accountability in government management is highlighted by the reassertion of management values through the revival of the President's reorganization authority."
