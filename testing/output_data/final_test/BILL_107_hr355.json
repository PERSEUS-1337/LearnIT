The lobbying nontaxable amount for any organization is the lesser of $1,000,000 or a determined amount based on specific criteria. If the exempt purpose expenditures are not over $500,000, the lobbying nontaxable amount is 20 percent of the exempt purpose expenditures. For expenditures over $500,000 but not over $1,000,000, it is $100,000 plus 15 percent of the excess. For expenditures over $1,000,000 but not over $1,500,000, it is $175,000 plus 10 percent of the excess. Expenditures over $1,500,000 have a different calculation. The lobbying nontaxable amount for organizations with exempt purpose expenditures over $1,500,000 is $225,000 plus 5 percent of the excess. Exempt purpose expenditures refer to amounts spent on religious, charitable, educational, etc., purposes as defined in section 170(c)(2)(B). The term 'exempt purpose expenditures' includes administrative expenses for section 170(c)(2)(B) purposes and political expenditures.
