FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that soldiers from the United States and the Philippines at Bataan bravely fought off enemy attacks for over 4 months, redefining the war's momentum and providing time for other Allied forces to prepare. Major General Edward King surrendered them into enemy hands on April 9, 1942. The soldiers from the United States and the Philippines were taken prisoner after bravely fighting off enemy attacks at Bataan. They were forced to march 65 miles without food, water, or medical care in the Bataan Death March, where thousands died from starvation, exhaustion, and abuse. Conditions at Camp O'Donnell were substandard, leading to increased disease and malnutrition among the prisoners. Prisoners from the United States were later transferred to Cabanatuan, while those from the Philippines were paroled in July 1942. In July 1942, prisoners from the Philippines were paroled, while those who remained in the camps suffered mistreatment, malnutrition, and lack of medical care. They were liberated in 1945 and formed support groups, honored in memorials, and shared their story. Many have passed away, but those remaining continue to tell their story. The people of the United States are forever indebted to these courageous soldiers for their actions during the early stages of World War II. During World War II, soldiers fought against enemies for 4 months and showed perseverance during 3 years of capture, imprisonment, and harsh conditions, maintaining dignity, honor, patriotism, and loyalty.
