    "content": "In the 1990s, Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups infiltrated the Balkans during wars and political instability. However, U.S. and European peacekeeping efforts, aid, and the prospect of Euro-Atlantic integration have brought more stability to the region. The September 11, 2001 attacks increased U.S. attention and aid to fight terrorism in the Balkans. Countries like Saudi Arabia have cracked down on Islamic militants, reducing terrorist financing in the region. Experts do not currently view the Balkans as a major hub for terrorists compared to other regions like the Middle East, North Africa, and Western Europe. Experts caution that Central and Eastern Europe may continue to play a role in terrorist plans as a transit route and base for attacks in other regions. Efforts to recruit people from the region into terrorist groups have been noted, and the region's continuing problems leave it vulnerable to terrorist activities in the future. The 9/11 Commission report highlighted the region's vulnerability due to significant Muslim populations and weak border controls. Concerns exist that terrorists from Iraq may disperse to the Balkans and other regions, increasing the threat. Some Serbian and Russian experts claim that the Balkans pose a greater threat to the US and Western Europe than acknowledged. Despite having indigenous Muslim populations, the region has not attracted many Muslim immigrants, who are often recruits for Islamic extremists in Western Europe. Bosniaks and Albanians in the Balkans strongly oppose terrorism and are more secular, viewing themselves as part of Europe. They appreciate the US role in defending them against Serbian aggression in the 1990s and continue to contribute to their security. Charges of terrorism are sometimes used for political purposes. Some politicians in the Balkans use charges of terrorism for political gain, with Serbian and Bosnian Serb leaders accusing Bosniaks and Albanians of harboring Al Qaeda training camps. However, Bosniak and Albanian leaders deny these charges and accuse the Serbs of supporting terrorism by sheltering indicted war criminals. Observers believe that the terrorist threat is less serious than issues like corruption and poverty in the region, but the focus on terrorism could also encourage Balkan countries to cooperate more closely. The Balkans may cooperate with the United States on terrorism issues to secure support for their regional goals and Euro-Atlantic integration. Despite challenges like weak government institutions and corruption, the region has provided good cooperation in the Global War on Terrorism. The focus on terrorism could lead to increased political support for addressing the region's problems. The report focuses on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, and Serbia's efforts in arresting terrorist suspects, shutting down terrorist-linked organizations, and freezing assets of suspected terrorist financiers. Bosnia and Herzegovina faced a civil war from 1992 to 1995, resulting in many deaths and displacement. The report emphasizes the role of Islamic terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the region. The Bosniak-dominated Bosnian government accepted help from Iran and Islamic radicals during the civil war from 1992 to 1995. Some Islamic radicals remained in Bosnia after the war, becoming citizens through marriage or bribery. Al Qaeda operatives in Bosnia had connections to Bosnia's intelligence service. The Bosnia conflict has influenced terrorist groups globally, with Al Qaeda figures citing it as an important cause. During the Bosnian war, Al Qaeda was active in Bosnia and used it as a militant Islamic cause. Islamic charities from Saudi Arabia provided assistance to Bosniaks, some of which were fronts for Al Qaeda. Saudi Arabian-built mosques in Bosnia may contribute to terrorist recruiting efforts. Despite terrorist threats post-9/11, Bosnian opposition to terrorism remains strong. The United States maintains significant support in Bosnia. The United States has strong support in Bosnia, especially among Bosniaks, for bringing peace and providing post-war aid. Bosniaks' largely secular and European outlook has caused friction with foreign Islamic extremists. Efforts to recruit Bosniaks into extremist organizations have had limited success. Some Bosniaks fear terrorism tarnishing Bosnia's reputation in Europe, hindering travel and European integration. Concerns exist about unemployment among Bosniak youth and dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy aiding terrorist recruitment. The 2005 State Department terrorism report mentions Active Islamic Youth, an extremist organization associated with former foreign Islamic fighters in Bosnia. The group associated with former foreign Islamic fighters in Bosnia engages in outreach activities promoting Islamic fundamentalism and anti-Western rhetoric. There are concerns about recruiting \"white Muslims\" to avoid suspicion in Europe. Bosnian officials have mixed views on the threat, citing poverty, corruption, and institutional failings as contributing factors. The Dayton Peace Accords divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into two semi-autonomous entities, hindering effective government institutions. Bosnia's weak central government has made it vulnerable to exploitation as a terrorist safe haven. Efforts to strengthen the central government have been resisted by Bosnian Serbs, who accuse Bosniaks of terrorist ties. Chief Dragomir Andan claimed that terrorists responsible for the March 2004 Madrid bombings were trained at alleged Al Qaeda camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina. EU police and officials in Bosnia denied the charges. International efforts in Bosnia aim to centralize control of the police to combat organized crime and terrorism more effectively. The US praised Bosnia's cooperation in fighting terrorism, highlighted by President Bush in his 2002 State of the Union Address. Bosnia handed over suspected Al Qaeda member Bensayah Belkacem and five others to the US in 2002. The suspects, originally from Algeria, gained Bosnian citizenship and are interned at Guantanamo Bay. Bosnian legal experts criticized their rendition and detention in Cuba. Bosnian prosecutors exonerated them in 2004 and requested their release in 2005, which the US rejected. Bosnian authorities investigated Islamic charities with ties to Bin Laden, raiding the Benevolence International Foundation offices in 2002. In Bosnia, raids on Islamic charities linked to Bin Laden uncovered fraudulent activities, anti-Semitic and anti-American materials, and calls for attacks on peacekeepers. Several Al Qaeda front organizations were shut down, including BIF leader Enaam Arnaout receiving an 11-year sentence for fraud. In 2004, Bosnian authorities disrupted the operations of more Al Qaeda-linked organizations. In Bosnia, authorities have been vigilant in investigating organizations and individuals with links to terrorist financing. In 2005, Bosnian officials were charged with aiding terrorists, and former officials faced charges for assisting foreign Islamic fighters in gaining Bosnian citizenship. Additionally, former Federation officials were on trial for their involvement in establishing a terrorist training camp with Iran's help in the mid-1990s. Iran allegedly helped establish a terrorist training camp in Bosnia during the mid-1990s. Despite being designated as a supporter of terrorism by the US, Iran is not closely linked with Al Qaeda. Experts believe Iran reduced its activities in Bosnia after the 1995 war. In 2005, Bosnia set up a commission to review citizenship, targeting naturalized citizens with fraudulent ties to the country. About 1,300 cases were reviewed, including former Islamic fighters. In August 2007, Bosnia revoked citizenship of 613 individuals granted improperly. Those affected must leave or face deportation, but many are untraceable due to outdated addresses. Some may have changed identities, gone into hiding, or are detained in other countries. Bosnia deported former Islamic fighters in 2006 and 2007, while others evade deportation through appeals. In August 2007, Bosnia deported former Islamic fighters, some avoiding deportation through appeals. Strong U.S. pressure led to the push for deportations. Al Qaeda supporters numbered between 10 and 100, with less than 50 posing a threat to national security. In October 2005, two terrorist suspects with links to networks in Western Europe were arrested in Bosnia. The men were convicted in January 2007 for planning a terrorist attack in Bosnia or Europe to withdraw troops from Iran and Afghanistan. Bosnia has improved its anti-terrorism measures with the establishment of central-government-level institutions and a State Border Service. The 2005 State Department report praised the SBS but noted some shortcomings in controlling illegal crossings. Ministries of Defense and Security were formed in 2004, and entity-level intelligence services were merged. Bosnia established the State Investigative and Protection Agency (SIPA) in 2004, merging entity-level intelligence services into a single State Intelligence and Security Agency (OSA). SIPA is responsible for investigating complex crimes including terrorism, illegal trafficking, organized crime, and smuggling of weapons of mass destruction. It has a financial intelligence unit (FIU) and a sub-unit dedicated to counterterrorism and WMD. An Interministerial Counterterrorism Task Force coordinates the activities of central government bodies. In 2004, Bosnia adopted laws to strengthen state-level law enforcement capabilities, giving SIPA authority for state-level crimes, including terrorism, and implementing laws on money laundering prevention. Bosnia and Herzegovina has laws on prevention of money laundering and terrorism. State-level bodies lack resources and qualified personnel. Prosecutors struggle to link illegal activities to terrorism charges, often convicting suspects on charges like illegal arms possession. Albania's instability in the 1990s allowed Al Qaeda to gain a foothold due to poor internal security and lax border controls. In the 1990s, Albania's poor internal security and lax border controls created an environment conducive to terrorist activity. Foreign Islamic extremists used Albania as a safe haven, some gaining Albanian citizenship. Islamic NGOs, some linked to Al Qaeda, were established after the Communist regime fell in 1991. The situation worsened during civil unrest in 1997, with the temporary closure of the U.S. embassy due to terrorist threats. Albania and the U.S. foiled a planned attack on the embassy in 1998. In 1998, Albania and the United States thwarted a planned attack on the U.S. embassy in Tirana and arrested Al Qaeda figures. Allegations of ethnic Albanian \"terrorists\" maintaining links with Islamic terrorist groups have been made by some Serbian media sources and political leaders. The Albanian government denies the presence of terrorist training camps on its territory. U.S. and European experts state that Albania currently does not pose a serious terrorist threat. In 2004, Albania disclosed the discovery of chemical weapons stocks acquired by the Communist regime in the 1970s, which were found unguarded during the disorder of the 1990s. Albania has taken measures to combat terrorism, including adopting a national action plan in 2002 and expelling suspected extremists. The government has cooperated with the United States and other countries to investigate terrorist-related activities and block financial assets of groups with links to terrorists. In 2004, local arms traffickers were arrested for dealing in surface-to-air missiles, believed to be intended for regional extremists. The Albanian Parliament also passed a strong money-laundering law in the same year. In 2004, Albania passed a money-laundering law with antiterrorist financing provisions, freezing assets of organizations and individuals linked to terrorist activities. In 2007, Albania strengthened its Criminal Code to align with EU counterterrorism legislation, allowing prosecution for recruiting or training individuals for terrorist acts. Albania has ratified UN conventions on terrorism, but counterterrorist efforts are hindered by financial issues, corruption, and lack of trained officers. Muslims in Serbia make up 3% of the population, concentrated in specific regions. Islamic terrorism is not a major threat in Serbia. In March 2007, Serbian police raided a training camp for Islamic extremists in Sandzak, arresting four men and seizing weapons and explosives. The leader of a terrorist group, Ismail Prenetic, was killed in a police raid in April 2007. In January 2008, 15 men associated with the camp went on trial in Serbia. Serbia has been cooperative with the United States on border security and antiterrorism efforts. In 2005, Serbian police arrested Abdelmajid Bouchar, a key suspect in the 2004 train bombings in Madrid, Spain. Bouchar, a Moroccan, was extradited to Spain in August 2005. Serbian authorities believed he may have been passing through Serbia, a key transportation route between Europe and Asia. Despite effective action in the Bouchar case, Serbia faces corruption and organized crime issues, potentially making it vulnerable to terrorism. In 1998 and 1999, ethnic Albanian guerrillas in Serbia's Kosovo province fought Serbian troops, leading to a NATO bombing campaign. Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic withdrew forces in June 1999, allowing for NATO peacekeepers. Kosovo has been administered by UNMIK since then. Serbian and Russian intelligence sources claim a strong Al Qaeda presence in Kosovo. Sources have claimed a strong Al Qaeda presence in Kosovo, including training camps. However, caution is needed in assessing these claims as both countries have an interest in discrediting Kosovar Albanians. Radical Islamic organizations have tried to recruit Kosovo Albanian Muslims, but with limited success. Ethnic Albanian nationalists have committed terrorist attacks on Serbian civilians in Kosovo, but there is little evidence of collaboration with Al Qaeda or other radical Islamic groups. Concern has been expressed about powerful ethnic Albanian organized criminal groups from Kosovo, Albania, and Macedonia. Kosovo, Albania, and Macedonia have potential ties to terrorist groups, but no links have been detected so far. UNMIK and KFOR are responsible for security in Kosovo, with efforts focused on counterterrorism. UNMIK has successfully prosecuted individuals for terrorism and established tools to combat terrorist financing, including a Financial Information Center. In 2005, UNMIK police froze the assets of 34 individuals. In 2005, UNMIK froze assets of 34 individuals and groups suspected of terrorist links. UNMIK's CIU cooperates with the US and other governments to investigate terrorist activities. Monitoring of individuals entering Kosovo is conducted by UNMIK and KPS. Regulations require non-international organization employees to register with KPS. PISG and UNMIK increased monitoring of foreign NGOs suspected of extremism and imposed restrictions on their activities. The Kosovo Islamic Community evaluated foreign NGOs for extremist views and prohibited them from using public facilities for gatherings. Kosovo's counterterrorism efforts are hindered by porous boundary lines, corruption among border officials, and insufficient number of KPS border officials. KFOR patrols Kosovo's border, but smuggling routes exist that could allow potential terrorists to evade detection. Terrorism investigations face challenges such as witness intimidation and weak witness protection laws. In August 2007, seven inmates, including a convicted terrorist, broke out of a prison in western Kosovo. In early 2008, the United States and most EU countries may recognize Kosovo's independence under a plan for supervised independence. The International Civilian Representative (ICR) would have the power to void any decisions or laws of the Kosovo government inconsistent with the plan and remove officials acting against the settlement. An EU mission would monitor and advise the Kosovo government on rule of law issues. The Kosovo government would be supervised by an International Civilian Representative (ICR) with power over rule of law issues. KFOR would maintain security control, potentially replaced by an EU force. The US and allies must support Kosovo's counterterrorism efforts post-independence to combat regional terrorism threats. US engagement in the Balkans aims to bring stability and fight terrorism. The United States works with other countries to combat terrorism by denying terrorists sponsorship, support, and sanctuary, as well as addressing underlying conditions that terrorists exploit. U.S. troops, along with NATO-led peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, play a crucial role in anti-terrorist efforts in the region. International officials in Bosnia and Kosovo have significant influence in fighting terrorism. The United States has more freedom to arrest and deport terrorists in Bosnia and Kosovo due to the influence of international officials. SFOR withdrew from Bosnia in 2004, replaced by an EU-led force with counterterrorism as part of its mandate. In Kosovo, KFOR has 16,000 troops, including 1,600 U.S. troops expected to remain post-resolution. Close links with Kosovo government structures will be necessary as international control reduces. The United States and its allies aim to establish close links with Kosovo government structures to combat organized crime and terrorism. The U.S. aid program for the region focuses on strengthening the rule of law and promoting economic reform to bring stability. Significant funding is allocated for Kosovo in FY2008 and FY2007 to support the country after its political status is determined. In Bosnia, U.S. aid includes technical assistance, training, and equipment for police forces. The United States provides technical assistance, training, and equipment to strengthen police forces, border controls, and law enforcement agencies in Bosnia, Albania, and Kosovo. This includes support for export control regimes, border security, and combating terrorist financing. The U.S. also aims to interdict weapons of mass destruction-related items in the region. The United States provides technical assistance, training, and equipment to strengthen police forces, border controls, and law enforcement agencies in Bosnia, Albania, and Kosovo. This includes support for export control regimes, border security, and combating terrorist financing. The U.S. also aims to interdict weapons of mass destruction-related items in the region through initiatives like the Southeast European Cooperation Initiative (SECI) and the Antiterrorism Assistance (ATA) program. The Administration requested $650,000 in ATA assistance for Bosnia for FY2008 to integrate the region into Euro-Atlantic institutions, encouraging countries to fight terrorism effectively. The European Union aims to incorporate all countries in the region, with Croatia possibly being an exception. NATO membership is sought by all countries in the region, with Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia part of the U.S.-brokered \"Adriatic Charter\" to improve qualifications for NATO membership. Adriatic Charter countries have contributed troops to peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan. Charter countries, including Albania and Macedonia, have contributed troops to peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan and U.S.-led operations in Iraq. Croatia is seen as having stronger qualifications for NATO membership compared to other Adriatic Charter countries. Bosnia and Herzegovina must unify its police forces, implement political reforms, and cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal before it can join NATO. Kosovo's undetermined status prevents it from potential EU and NATO membership. Congress has addressed Islamic terrorism in the Balkans through hearings and legislation. Congress has addressed Islamic terrorism in the Balkans through hearings and legislation, providing funding for global counterterrorism programs mainly in the Middle East and South Asia. Foreign aid has been appropriated for the Balkans to enhance stability and improve the rule of law, with the authorization to withhold aid if certain conditions are not met. The United States and its allies have successfully reduced the terrorist threat from the Balkans over the past decade. U.S. military interventions in Bosnia and Kosovo were perceived positively by Muslims in the region, leading to pro-American sentiment. Most elites in the region see integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions as the future. Observers note that while Muslims in the Balkans are eager to help the United States fight terrorism and see integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions as the future, complacency would be unwise. The region's stability is fragile, with weak law enforcement and public institutions. There is a risk of terrorists redeploying from Iraq to the Balkans or recruits from the Balkans joining the insurgency in Iraq. Additionally, terrorists could obtain weapons from the region's black market for attacks in Western Europe or other regions."
