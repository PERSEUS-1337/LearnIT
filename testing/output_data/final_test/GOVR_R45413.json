    "content": "Numerous federal, state, and local agencies regulate the safety of the U.S. food supply. FDA and FSIS are primarily responsible for food safety. FDA oversees the safety of most domestic and imported food products, while FSIS regulates meat, poultry, and processed egg products. FSIS oversees 10%-20% of the food supply, while FDA is responsible for 80%-90%. In FY2018, combined appropriations for food safety activities at FDA and USDA totaled nearly $2.1 billion, with a funding distribution reflecting greater increases in appropriations for FDA compared to FSIS since FY2011. The FY2018 appropriations for FDA's food safety activities provided $1,041.6 million, while FSIS received $1,056.8 million. User fees generated annually differ between the two agencies, with FSIS collecting between $180 million and $250 million, and FDA collecting between $10 million and $20 million. FSIS has around 9,200 full-time equivalents (FTEs), while FDA's food-related staff number about 3,900 FTEs. Agriculture appropriations bills may include policy-related provisions in addition to setting budgetary amounts. Policy-related provisions in bills direct how the executive branch should implement specific appropriations, potentially having the force of law for the indicated fiscal year. Explanatory statements and committee reports provide policy instructions, though not legally binding, to clarify congressional intent. These documents may need to be reviewed together to fully understand congressional directives for a given fiscal year. FDA's Foods Program, covered in House Report (H.Rept. 115-232) and Senate Report (S.Rept. 115-131), plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety, quality, and labeling of the nation's food supply. The program's budget accounts for one-third of FDA's total appropriation and extends beyond food safety programs. The FDA's total budget for food safety programs includes various food and veterinary medicine programs, as well as funding for food additives, antimicrobial resistance, and nutrition labeling. Funding for FDA's Foods Program has increased in recent years, following the enactment of comprehensive food safety legislation. The FDA continues to implement the law and adapt to the changing U.S. food supply. The FDA's budget for food safety programs has increased due to rising demand for products produced outside the US, emerging microbial pathogens, natural toxins, and technological innovations. Congress authorized funds for the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) but did not provide full funding, leading to a need for additional FDA funding. FDA officials and food industry groups have called for increased budget authority to fully implement FSMA. The FDA's budget for food safety programs has increased to support the implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). Various groups, including food industry, state agriculture officials, public health organizations, and victims of food-borne illnesses, have called for increased funding to maintain consumer confidence and support FSMA implementation. Congressional appropriators have increased funding for the FDA Foods Program by $204.3 million between FY2011 and FY2018, largely to support FSMA implementation. The FDA's budget has increased by over $300 million since FY2011 to support food safety activities and FSMA implementation. Despite goals set by FSMA to have 5,000 staff by FY2014, FDA only had 3,900 food safety FTEs in FY2018. The enacted FY2018 act allocated $1.5 million for oversight by HHS's Office of Inspector General and $1.5 million for public education on biotechnology. Industry-paid user fees authorized by FSMA also contribute to FDA's funding. The FDA's budget has increased to support food safety activities and FSMA implementation. User fees authorized by FSMA contribute to FDA funding, generating between $10 million and $20 million annually. The Obama Administration requested new user fees totaling nearly $170 million annually, but congressional appropriators did not accept the proposals. User fees are established by authorizing committees in law, not by appropriators. The enacted FY2018 appropriation act addresses FSMA implementation issues. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of FSMA requirements for regulating dried spent grain byproducts from alcoholic beverage production for animal feed. It also addresses the need for FDA to differentiate between grape varieties for wine production and raw consumption, concerns about animal feed regulations from cotton ginning, and the provision of clarification and technical assistance to small farms for FSMA compliance.

The House and Senate committees direct FDA to review seafood advisories for pregnant women and provide funding for seafood decomposition detection methods. The Senate and House committees direct FDA to address seafood safety, biotechnology use, standards of identity, and food labeling. They also request increased funding for research on Vibrio illnesses from raw molluscan shellfish consumption and monitoring of fraud in imported olive oil. Additionally, FDA is urged to respond to a citizen petition for olive oil standard of identity and update its survey of olive oil products. The House committee also calls for the development of dairy-specific standard of identity and guidance in line with the Dairy Pride Act. The Senate and House committees direct FDA to address various food safety issues, including seafood safety, biotechnology use, standards of identity, and food labeling. They also request increased funding for research on Vibrio illnesses and monitoring of fraud in imported olive oil.

The enacted appropriation and committee bills contain policy riders for FDA's Foods Program, such as restrictions on partially hydrogenated oils and sodium reduction regulations. provisions in the House committee report address menu labeling requirements and the nutrition facts label. The House and Senate bills provide funding for FDA's Foods Program, with the Senate bill allocating $1,052.3 million and the House bill allocating $1,039.7 million for FY2019. Both bills specify how the funds should be used, including inspections of foreign seafood manufacturers and oversight of FDA programs. The Administration's budget request recommends $1,029.9 million for the program, with additional funding from FSMA-authorized user fees. The House and Senate FY2019 appropriation bills allocate funding for FDA's Foods Program, with specific directives on how the funds should be used. This includes oversight activities by HHS's Office of Inspector General, coordination of public education activities on crop biotechnology, and addressing various food safety issues under FDA jurisdiction. Additionally, there are policy riders in the bills that touch on agency nutritional guidance and regulations. The FY2019 appropriation bills allocate funding for FDA's Foods Program, with specific directives on oversight activities and addressing food safety issues. USDA's FSIS is responsible for inspecting meat and poultry products to ensure safety and proper labeling.

The FY2018 appropriation for FSIS is nearly $50 million higher than FY2011. $7.5 million is allocated for public health veterinarian recruitment and retention incentives. Congressional appropriators require FSIS to employ at least 148 FTEs dedicated to inspections related to the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The appropriation is divided into various subaccounts for federal food safety inspection, state food safety inspection, international inspections, and the Public Health Data Communications Infrastructure System. Language in the appropriation addresses animal welfare issues, catfish inspection, and grading concerns. The FY2018 appropriation for FSIS addresses concerns such as animal welfare, catfish inspection, and horse slaughter restrictions.

It prohibits horse slaughter facility inspections for human consumption and the purchase of cooked poultry meat from China for certain food programs. Additionally, it includes provisions to ensure the equivalence of China's poultry slaughter inspection system before allowing poultry exports to the US. The House-reported bill and the Senate-passed bill for FY2019 would appropriate $1,049.3 million, including proposed new user fees to cover inspection program costs for meat, poultry, and eggs, generating an estimated $660 million. Congressional appropriators have not accepted similar proposals from previous Administrations. The House and Senate committee reports address food safety issues under FSIS jurisdiction, including animal welfare, catfish inspection, horse slaughter restrictions, and chicken imports from China. There is a debate over regulatory jurisdiction between FSIS and FDA regarding cell-cultured meat. The House-reported bill requires USDA to regulate cell-cultured products made from livestock cells. The House-reported bill requires USDA to regulate cell-cultured products made from livestock cells, while the federal jurisdiction of cell-cultured products remains to be determined. FDA and FSIS are expected to jointly oversee the production of cell-cultured food products derived from livestock and poultry.
