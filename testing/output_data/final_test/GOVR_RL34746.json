    "content": "The United States may need to build new power plants to meet increasing demand for electricity. The Energy Information Administration estimates that 226,000 megawatts of new capacity will be needed by 2030, equivalent to about 450 large power plants. Congress can influence the types of plants built through energy, environmental, and economic policies. Factors affecting electricity costs from new plants include construction, fuel, environmental regulations, and financing, all influenced by government policies. Government policies play a significant role in determining the types of power plants built in the future. For instance, policies aimed at reducing construction costs could benefit nuclear plants, while those reducing fossil fuel costs could benefit natural gas plants. The report provides cost projections for new fossil, nuclear, and renewable plants, showing how government incentives can impact the cost rankings of different technologies. Federal loan guarantees, for example, can make nuclear power a more cost-effective option. The report discusses how government policies can influence the cost competitiveness of different power plant technologies. Natural gas plants are currently a cost-effective option, while coal-fired plants with carbon capture technology are expensive. Wind, nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas combined cycle plants without capture technology are more economical alternatives. Future uncertainties prevent firm forecasts. The report provides insight into factors influencing future power costs, including generating technologies, cost drivers, financial analysis, and power project costs. It includes appendices with technology diagrams, data supporting cost estimates, operating cost estimates for carbon control technologies, financial assumptions, and a list of acronyms. The characteristics of electricity demand influence power plant choice and operation. The daily load curve dictates how electric power systems are operated, with baseload generating units meeting the base level of demand with low variable operating costs. Baseload units can meet demand above the base by ramping generation up and down. Intermediate units quickly adjust output to match fluctuations in demand and serve as spinning reserve. Peaking units, although expensive, can startup and shutdown quickly to meet brief peaks in demand. Peaking units serve as spinning reserve and quick start units, operating for a few hundred hours a year. Generating units are dispatched based on lowest variable cost in economic dispatch. Efficiency, measured by heat rate, impacts variable costs for plants using combustible fuels. Lower heat rate means higher efficiency and priority in economic dispatch. In economic dispatch, generating units are prioritized based on lowest variable cost. Plants with lower heat rates are more efficient and have higher priority. Different types of units, such as baseload, combined cycle, and peaking plants, are utilized to meet varying load demands efficiently. Peaking units operate as needed using combustion turbines and serve as spinning reserve. Variable renewable power plants like wind and solar are used to meet demand efficiently by displacing generation from gas-fired plants with higher variable costs. However, their output is dependent on weather conditions, making them non-firm resources unlike traditional power plants. Variable renewable generation can be made firm by linking wind and solar plants to electricity storage, but current technology limits storage options. Baseload units run more often than cycling units, and peaking units operate the least often. The utilization of a generating unit is measured by its \"capacity factor,\" which is the ratio of power generated over a period to the maximum potential output. For example, a 1,000 MW unit with a capacity factor of 46% would produce 4.0 million Mwh in a year. The capacity factor of a generating unit is the ratio of power generated over a period to the maximum potential output. Capacity factors are typically around 70% for baseload plants and 25% for peaking plants. Planned maintenance, mechanical breakdowns, and other factors can cause the actual output to be less than the theoretical maximum. Baseload plants have capacity factors of about 70% or greater, peaking plants about 25% or less, and cycling plants fall in the middle. Generating technologies discussed are referred to as \"utility scale\" plants for baseload or intermediate service, accounting for 86% of total power generation in the US in 2006. Utility scale plants have capacities ranging from dozens to over a thousand megawatts, with solar photovoltaic power being the only smaller scale technology mentioned. The largest US central station solar photovoltaic plant has a capacity of 14 MW due to small size, high capital costs, and low utilization rates. The report excludes peaking plants and oil-fired generation due to high costs and low utilization rates. Oil-fired plants' share of electricity production decreased from 22% in 1978 to less than 2% in 2007. New oil-fired plant construction is not expected. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants, which co-produce electricity and steam for internal use, are also not covered in the report. CHP facilities have unique operating modes and cost structures, accounting for about 3.7% of total electricity output in 2007. The cost analysis is for plants entering service in 2015, reflecting current estimates of cost and performance for new technologies like advanced nuclear power and coal gasification. The technologies covered in the report include pulverized coal plants, which account for the majority of coal-fired generating capacity. These plants grind coal into fine powder, inject it with air into a boiler where it ignites, and produce electricity by rotating a turbine with steam. Most new pulverized coal plants since 2000 are \"supercritical\" designs for higher efficiency. In 2007, coal generation accounted for 49% of total power generation in the United States. Additionally, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants convert coal to synthesis gas before combustion, but are more expensive to build than pulverized coal plants. IGCC plants convert coal to synthesis gas (syngas) before combustion, with advantages including lower emissions of air pollutants and greater efficiency. The syngas can be processed to convert carbon into concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) before combustion, making pre-combustion capture of CO2 easier and cheaper than post-combustion removal from exhaust gases. IGCC technology offers more efficient carbon capture compared to conventional coal plants. While some projects are underway, concerns over cost and technology reliability hinder widespread adoption. The advantages of IGCC over conventional coal technology and its commercial readiness are still debated. Combined cycle plants use natural gas to generate electricity efficiently by capturing waste heat from the combustion turbine to produce steam, driving another generator. This technology has high efficiencies and low environmental impacts, making it a popular choice for new generating capacity since 1995. Combined cycle plants, particularly natural gas ones, have been the primary choice for new generating capacity in the United States, with expectations to continue dominating capacity additions. The forecast suggests that combined cycle plants will contribute significantly to capacity additions between 2008 and 2015, potentially surpassing coal plants despite public opposition and cost concerns leading to cancellations of planned coal-fired capacity. According to a Department of Energy report, only 12% of the coal capacity planned in 2002 was actually built by 2007 due to regulatory uncertainty and escalating costs. The main replacement for coal plants is likely to be natural gas combined cycle plants, which accounted for 17% of total generation in 2007. In Florida, plans for new coal-fired capacity dropped significantly due to environmental concerns, with most of it being replaced by gas-fired units. In 2007, gas combined cycle plants accounted for 17% of total power generation in the United States, while natural gas plants of all types accounted for 21%. Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to produce steam for electricity generation, supplying 19% of the nation's electricity in 2007. Generation III/III+ technology nuclear plants are discussed in the report, with high investment costs but low variable operating costs. Generation III/III+ nuclear plants in the United States aim to reduce costs and enhance safety through standardized designs and passive safety systems. Only one design has been built so far, with others under construction in different countries. Building new nuclear plants in the US is expected to be costly, while geothermal plants have been operating in California for many years. Geothermal plants have operated in California for many years, drawing hot water and steam from underground to drive turbine generators. Operators can inject water into depleted fields to boost steam production. Unlike solar and wind power, geothermal plants are dispatchable baseload plants. However, current technology limits geothermal plants to small facilities under 50 MW in the western United States, producing 0.4% of the nation's power supply in 2007. In 2007, geothermal plants produced 0.4% of the nation's power supply. Wind power plants use turbines to generate electricity, with wind supplying 1% of total U.S. power supply in 2007. Solar PV installations in the U.S. have been mostly small, with exceptions like the 14 MW installation at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. PV power directly converts sunlight to electricity. Solar thermal plants concentrate sunlight to produce steam for power generation using parabolic trough and power tower technologies. Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and the Alamosa Photovoltaic Power Plant in Colorado are exceptions with 14 MW and 8 MW installations, respectively. Power tower technology focuses sunlight on a central tower to produce steam, while parabolic trough plants use mirrors to focus sunlight on liquid-carrying tubes. Solar thermal projects, including power tower plants, are being developed in California and Spain. These projects have capacities up to 554 MW and can store solar heat for electricity production. Solar thermal generation accounted for a small percentage of total generation in 2007. The report discusses factors influencing the costs of building and operating power plants. Government incentives, capital costs, fuel costs, and air emissions controls are factors that determine the costs of building and operating power plants. Incentives like the renewable investment tax credit directly affect the cost of power plant construction or operation. The credit has a value of 2.0 cents per kWh and applies for the first 10 years of operation. The production tax credit is available for new wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources, but not for solar projects. Advanced nuclear plants can receive a credit of 1.8 cents per kWh for the first eight years of operation, with limitations on construction and service dates. The credit is not indexed to inflation and decreases in value over time. The production tax credit is available for new wind, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources, but not for solar projects. Advanced nuclear plants can receive a credit of 1.8 cents per kWh for the first eight years of operation, with limitations on construction and service dates. The credit is not indexed to inflation and decreases in value over time. The annual credit for nuclear projects is limited to $125 million per thousand megawatts of generating capacity, with prorated amounts if total capacity exceeds 6,000 megawatts. Loan guarantees can cover up to 80% of project costs, with recipients required to make a \"credit subsidy cost\" payment to the federal treasury. Loan guarantees for nuclear projects require a \"credit subsidy cost\" payment to the federal treasury reflecting the guarantee's cost. Backed by the government, they offer low interest rates and are crucial for new nuclear plant construction due to high costs. DOE can grant guarantees up to a set value determined by Congress, with applications solicited for up to $18.5 billion in April 2008. As of November 2008, several applications were under consideration. Publicly owned utilities are ineligible for these guarantees. The high cost of nuclear projects, which can exceed a company's total market value, makes it difficult to construct new plants without loan guarantees. Tax credits are available for solar, geothermal, and other energy technologies, but not for wind energy systems. Geothermal systems receive a 10% credit, while solar electric systems get a 30% credit until January 1, 2017. Geothermal projects that claim the investment tax credit cannot also claim the renewable production tax credit. The investment tax credit is available to independent power producers and investor-owned utilities. The investment tax credit is available to independent power producers and investor-owned utilities, totaling $2.55 billion with specific allocations for different technologies. The depreciable basis of a project is reduced by 50% of the credit value. State and local governments can offer additional incentives like property tax deferrals. The government offers tax incentives, including property tax deferrals, worth hundreds of millions of dollars per project. State utility commissions can provide financial incentives for investor-owned utilities by allowing rate treatment of new plants. This motivates utilities to manage construction efficiently and ensures customers do not pay for a power plant until it is operational. However, for expensive projects, the delay in earning a return on investment can strain the company financially. Utilities sometimes argue for an alternative rate making method called \"construction work in progress (CWIP) in rates\" to avoid rate shock on customers from a single big adjustment. CWIP in rates allows utilities to recover the return on their investment as the plant is being built, relieving financial strain and phasing in rate increases. Some states have passed legislation allowing utility projects to receive CWIP in rates. The use of CWIP in rates has expanded to include various types of projects, not just expensive coal and nuclear ones. Most generating technologies require a significant initial investment, with costs typically exceeding $2,100 per kW. Nuclear, geothermal, and IGCC plants have even higher estimated costs. Power plant capital costs have multiple components and are often measured in dollars per kilowatt of generating capacity. Power plant capital costs have several components including Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) cost, Owner's costs, and Capitalized financing charges. EPC cost covers designing, equipment, and construction, while Owner's costs include external construction expenses. Capitalized financing charges encompass interest on debt and equity capital costs during plant construction. Construction costs for power plants have significantly increased in recent years due to factors such as high prices for materials and strong global demand for generating equipment. Between 2000 and 2008, the cost of building a power plant rose by 131%, with wind capacity increasing by 108%, coal by 78%, and gas-fired plants by 92%. The rising construction costs for power plants are driven by strong global demand for generating equipment, including coal-fired and nuclear plants. Factors such as the low value of the dollar, increasing labor costs, and a shortage of skilled engineering staff contribute to the high costs. Competition for resources like wind turbines and limited global capacity for nuclear plant components further impact construction expenses. The demand is fueled by growing economies in Asia, posing a critical question for the power industry regarding future construction costs. The power industry faces uncertainty regarding future construction costs, with factors like global demand for generating equipment and competition for resources driving up costs. Capital costs play a crucial role in determining the economics of different power generation technologies, with natural gas plants having lower capital costs compared to nuclear power and wind. The cost of building power plants, even relatively small ones, runs into millions of dollars, typically financed through a mix of debt and equity. Entities that develop power plants include Investor-owned utilities (IOUs) owned by private investors subject to government regulation, and Publicly-owned utilities (POUs) that are agencies of municipalities or governments. Both have guaranteed service territories and limited competition. State utility commissions set electric rates for IOUs to maintain financial health and approve new power plant proposals. Publicly-owned utilities (POUs) like the Tennessee Valley Authority and municipal utilities in Los Angeles and San Antonio set their own rates and make decisions to build power plants. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are merchant developers that sell wholesale power and face more financial risk but can earn larger profits. All three entities - IOUs, POUs, and IPPs - play a major role in the electric power industry. Entities in the electric power industry, including IOUs, POUs, and IPPs, play significant roles. POUs typically finance projects with 100% debt at low interest rates due to tax exemptions and low default risk. Privately owned IOUs and IPPs use a mix of debt and equity, facing higher costs due to lack of tax exemptions and lower credit ratings. The electric utility industry has lower credit ratings, with IPP debt falling in the speculative category and having higher interest rates. Private developers are expected to contribute significant equity to projects. Equity is more expensive than debt, with POUs able to finance projects with 100% low-cost debt, making them more cost-effective than IOUs or IPPs. POUs often partner with IOUs or IPPs on projects due to limited resources. IOUs have lower financing costs than IPPs. Fuel costs impact coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants, not solar, geothermal, or wind power. Natural gas prices have escalated significantly in recent years. The price escalation of natural gas has been severe compared to coal, impacting the cost of building power plants. Fuel price forecasts are crucial for generation plans, but predicting prices accurately has been challenging. Regulatory reforms in the mid-1980s made natural gas behavior hard to predict, leading to significant gaps between actual and forecasted prices. In the mid-1980s, natural gas behavior was unpredictable due to regulatory reforms. Despite technological advancements, early forecasts underestimated cost reductions in petroleum and natural gas production. Natural gas became a popular fuel for electricity and industrial use after curtailments were lifted. Price instability was influenced by resource estimates and world oil prices. Recent projections overestimated consumption due to lower-than-expected wellhead prices. The confluence of technological, regulatory, resource, and market factors makes fuel price forecasts challenging, especially for natural gas-fired combined cycle plants. Fuel costs make up a significant portion of total power plant expenses, with nuclear fuel prices expected to increase in the long term. Despite recent price drops, uranium prices remain high compared to historical levels. Regulations play a role in shaping the economics of nuclear plants, which are primarily influenced by construction costs. The economics of power plants are influenced by capital costs and regulations on air emissions. Costs include installing control equipment and allowances for emissions. Emissions from coal and natural gas plants include sulfur dioxide, mercury, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, and particulates. Regulations and control technologies for these emissions are briefly discussed. Control technologies for conventional emissions such as SO2, NOx, particulates, and mercury are well-understood and commercially available. In contrast, CO2 control technologies are still in development and may be more costly. While CO2 is not currently regulated at the federal level, Congress is considering control legislation, and some states are already taking action. More information on air emissions and regulations can be found on the CRS website. The EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants like SO2, NOx, ozone, and particulates. New coal and natural gas plants in compliance areas must use Best Available Control Technology to keep emissions low. Non-compliant areas require stricter emission standards. State permits can set lower limits than federal standards. Plants emitting SO2 must purchase emission allowances. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule, categorizing coal plant mercury emissions as hazardous. This triggers a requirement for all coal plants to install mercury control equipment meeting a MACT standard. State air officials will likely enforce tight mercury emission limits for new plants. Technology and costs for controlling sulfur, NOx, particulate, and mercury emissions are briefly described. Commercial technologies can remove 95% to 99% of the sulfur dioxide formed by burning coal in pulverized coal plants and over 99% of the sulfur in IGCC synthesis gas before it is burned. New coal plants must buy SO2 emission allowances if they release SO2 to the atmosphere. The cost of SO2 allowances is minimal compared to other expenses like fuel, with an estimated annual cost of around $1 million for a coal plant burning eastern coal. The cost of SO2 control equipment for coal plants is significant, accounting for about 12% of capital costs and 29% of non-fuel operating costs. Some plants can achieve 90% mercury removal as a co-benefit of operating SO2 control equipment, while others may need a powdered activated carbon injection system. IGCC plants can remove 90% to 95% of mercury from synthesis gas. Commercial technologies can reduce NOx emissions significantly. Carbon control technologies for coal plants, including activated carbon, can reduce NOx emissions to low levels. Plants may need to purchase NOx emission allowances depending on location. Particulate removal systems are standard for pulverized coal plants, with efficiencies exceeding 99%. Control equipment costs for pulverized coal plants are around 2% of capital expense and 9% of non-fuel operating costs. IGCC plants are expected to have similar particulate removal rates. Reducing NOx and SO2 emissions also helps control secondary particulates. The report discusses the technical and cost characteristics of carbon control technologies for coal and natural gas plants. Estimates of the cost and performance effects of installing carbon controls are uncertain due to the lack of full-scale carbon capture in power plants. Technology using amines from the petrochemical industry can be used to scrub CO2 from flue gas. Amine scrubbing is currently used at some coal-fired plants to extract CO2 for various industries. For more information on carbon control technologies, refer to CRS Report RL34621 and articles by Steve Blankinship in Power Engineering. Amine scrubbing technology is used to extract CO2 from flue gas at coal-fired plants, but scaling up for large power plants is challenging. It is energy-intensive, reducing electricity output by 30-40% and increasing costs by 61% for new plants. Retrofit installation costs around $1,600 per kW of net. The recent rapid increase in power plant construction costs is around $1,600 per kW of net capacity, with significant cost and performance impacts for adding amine scrubbing to natural gas-fired combined cycles. Researchers are working on developing more cost-effective carbon capture technologies for conventional coal and gas plants, but these are still in early stages. Incorporating carbon capture into an IGCC plant design can lead to a wide range of estimated increases in capital costs and loss in generating capacity. The estimated loss in generating capacity for IGCC technology with carbon capture ranges from 13% to 28%, reflecting factors specific to different technologies and limited experience. While IGCC is considered better for carbon capture than pulverized coal systems, it presents challenges in cost and performance penalties. Implementing carbon control in IGCC plants using western subbituminous coal, the nation's largest and cheapest supply, incurs significant costs and performance penalties. Congress is considering legislation, like the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2007 (S. 2191), to impose a cost on carbon emissions. The estimated costs of carbon allowances are uncertain, with projections ranging from $60 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 by 2030. This would surpass existing air emissions regulations. The EIA's financial analysis of new power plants estimates operating costs and required capital recovery for each generating technology through 2050. Allowance prices are projected to triple the coal price by 2030, but the outlook is uncertain due to different legislative approaches and forecasting assumptions. Operating costs will vary annually based on fuel prices and government programs, with expenses converted to a uniform annualized cost in 2008 present value dollars for comparison. The process of converting cash flows to a uniform annual payment involves adjusting for the time value of money and risk, then converting the present value to an equivalent annual payment. Capital costs for generating technologies are also annualized to account for recovery and return on investment, factoring in income taxes, depreciation rates, and the cost of money. This is done using a capital charge rate in the financial model. The financial model used for projects computes a project-specific capital charge rate based on various factors. For a 100% debt-financed project, a capital recovery factor is calculated to determine annual payments. Annualized capital and operating costs are combined to estimate the total annual cost of a project, which is then divided by the projected electricity output to determine the cost per Mwh. This allows for a comparison of different technologies on an equal basis. Inputs to the financial model include financing costs and forecasted fuel expenses. The financial model used for projects calculates project-specific capital charge rates based on various factors, including financing costs, forecasted fuel prices, and operating expenses. Inputs for the model are sourced from published data, such as EIA energy forecasts. Power plant capital costs are estimated based on public information, and the report analyzes the cost of power from different generating technologies. Results are presented for a Base Case analysis and four additional cases exploring key variables influencing power plant costs. The cost of power from different generating technologies is influenced by federal and state incentives, natural gas prices, capital costs uncertainty, and carbon controls. A natural gas-fired combined cycle plant is used as a benchmark for evaluating power costs. The Base Case analysis compares different assumptions on fuel and construction costs to estimate power costs for future projects. Future power costs are highly uncertain and influenced by various factors such as federal and state incentives, natural gas prices, and carbon controls. The analysis aims to provide insight into how these factors impact the costs of power plants, but the estimates are approximations with a high degree of uncertainty. Project-specific factors like proximity to fuel sources, local climate, transmission upgrades, risk appetite, and financial resources also play a significant role in actual developer decisions. The rankings of technologies by cost are approximate and should not be seen as definitive. The lowest cost generating technologies in the Base Case are pulverized coal, geothermal, and natural gas combined cycle plants, all around $60 per Mwh. Geothermal plants are limited to sites in the West, coal plants face building challenges, while gas-fired plants can be built at a large scale throughout the US. Costs drop significantly for POUs with low-cost financing, but most lack resources for large projects. Most publicly owned utilities (POUs) lack resources for large power projects, unlike investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and independent power producers (IPPs) who can undertake expensive projects. The Base Case assumes IOUs build coal and nuclear plants, while IPPs prefer gas-fired projects due to lower costs. Renewable projects like wind, solar, and geothermal are also assumed to be IPP projects, with the common practice of selling power to regulated utilities. The analysis is for new projects starting in 2015. The analysis focuses on new projects starting in 2015 and estimates fuel prices, allowance prices, and operational characteristics based on EIA's Reference Case assumptions. The 2008 overnight capital costs for each technology are estimated by CRS from public information on recent projects. The Base Case excludes certain incentives like federal loan guarantee programs and clean coal tax credit programs. These incentives are excluded due to uncertainty in receiving them for most projects. The Base Case analysis excludes federal loan guarantee programs and clean coal tax credit programs due to uncertainty in receiving them for most projects. Most projects will receive incentives, with nuclear plant developers requesting $122 billion in loan guarantees compared to congressional approval of $18.5 billion. The only incentives in the Base Case are the 30% investment tax credit for solar and geothermal energy systems, and the nuclear production tax credit. The lowest-cost options under the Base Case assumptions are pulverized coal, natural gas combined cycle, and geothermal generation, all around $60 per Mwh. The lowest-cost options for power generation are pulverized coal, natural gas combined cycle, and geothermal generation, all priced at around $60 per Mwh. Geothermal energy has no fuel cost and can operate at high utilization rates, while coal and geothermal technologies have limitations and risks that natural gas combined cycle does not face. The gas-fired combined cycle plant has limited environmental impacts and can be built with generating capacities in the hundreds of megawatts. The main risk factor is uncertainty over the long-term price and supply of natural gas. IGCC and nuclear plants are expensive to build and take years to construct, incurring large charges for interest during construction. The cost per Mwh for wind, solar thermal, and solar PV plants is relatively high due to their high capital costs and low rates of utilization. Comparing these costs to a natural gas combined cycle plant shows the difference in electricity production costs. The cost of power from different technologies varies, with geothermal energy and pulverized coal having costs similar to natural gas combined cycle plants. Nuclear, wind, and coal IGCC power are projected to be 31% to 35% higher, while solar thermal and solar photovoltaic are even higher. The cost of financing also plays a significant role, with POUs having access to lower cost financing compared to IOUs or IPPs, resulting in a reduction in power costs ranging from 14% for combined cycle plants. The cost of power varies among different technologies, with geothermal energy and pulverized coal having costs similar to natural gas combined cycle plants. Public financing can reduce power costs by 14% for combined cycle plants and up to 37% for capital-intensive IGCC and nuclear plants. However, the reduction is only 11% for solar thermal and 14% for solar photovoltaic plants due to the loss of renewable energy tax credits. Government financial incentives, such as federal loan guarantees, can transform high-cost technologies into low-cost options. The federal loan guarantee significantly reduces the cost of financing capital-intensive technologies like nuclear power, making it a low-cost option. Even with government incentives, no technology has a significant cost advantage over natural gas combined cycle. The analysis includes various discretionary incentives like federal loan guarantees for nuclear power, clean coal tax credit for IGCC plants, and production tax credit for wind. The discretionary incentives, such as federal loan guarantees, significantly reduce the cost of nuclear power, making it one of the lowest-cost options. The renewable production tax credit also lowers the cost of wind power. Combined cycle, geothermal, and coal plants remain low-cost options with different incentives. The table shows technologies eligible for additional incentives: Pulverized coal, IGCC coal, wind, and nuclear. Nuclear power becomes more cost-competitive with discretionary incentives. The cost advantage of combined cycle over wind and IGCC coal decreases. Geothermal and pulverized coal are cheaper than combined cycle with higher natural gas prices. Geothermal is limited to western US sites, and pulverized coal faces construction and environmental challenges. In the higher gas price scenario, the cost of power from natural gas combined cycle plant aligns with wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal. Fuel prices are crucial for gas-fired generation economics, with fuel accounting for half of the total cost. Natural gas prices are uncertain and difficult to forecast, especially if the US relies more on imported liquefied natural gas in the future. The natural gas market is volatile, with prices historically increasing significantly. Higher gas prices could impact the economics of gas-fired generation, with costs potentially rising by 50%. This would align the cost of power from natural gas with other energy sources like wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal. Fuel prices are a critical factor in gas-fired generation economics, accounting for half of the total cost. The cost of power from a gas-fired combined cycle plant is $77.05 per Mwh, making it more expensive than coal or geothermal power but competitive with wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal generation. Even with a 50% increase in fuel prices, the gas-fired combined cycle remains a viable option for new generating capacity. The cost of power from a gas-fired combined cycle plant is competitive with wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal generation. Gas prices would need to increase significantly for the cost of power from the combined cycle to match solar or photovoltaic electricity costs. The plant's low capital costs and high utilization rate make it less sensitive to changes in capital costs compared to other technologies. If power plant capital costs rise, the combined cycle's competitive position improves. The gas-fired combined cycle plant is competitive with various technologies in terms of power cost. Even with a 25% drop in capital costs, it remains competitive. The plant's low capital costs and high capacity factor contribute to its cost-effectiveness. Power costs for the combined cycle only change by about +/-12% due to its unique characteristics. The power cost of the combined cycle plant is less sensitive to changes in capital costs compared to other technologies. Rapid escalation in building costs will benefit the economics of combined cycles. Wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal have higher power costs than combined cycle, especially in high capital cost scenarios. Decreases in capital costs would reduce power costs for other technologies more than for combined cycle. Carbon-related allowance costs and control are also considered. The analysis considers the uncertainty of carbon-related allowance costs and control technology costs in determining the cost of generating electricity. Coal-fired generation is expensive, while zero-carbon emission technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and wind are more cost-effective. The natural gas combined cycle plant without carbon capture is competitive, and with a 50% drop in cost and efficiency penalties of carbon capture technologies, it becomes comparable to wind and nuclear power. The cost of generating electricity with carbon capture technology is uncertain due to the lack of agreement on carbon control legislation. No power plants have been built with full-scale carbon capture equipment, making the costs of CO2 allowances and control systems unpredictable. The analysis assumes current technology can remove 90% of CO2, but actual costs will depend on future legislation, allowance markets, and control technologies. The cost of carbon capture for power plants using petrochemical industry technology is high, with capital costs increasing by 42% to 97% and heat rates by 21% to 27%. Newer, more efficient technologies are still in development. CO2 allowance prices are projected to start at $17.70 per metric ton in 2012 and reach $266.80 by 2050, with all allowances needing to be purchased. Fuel prices remain consistent. The cost of carbon capture for power plants using control technologies is high, with power costs ranging from $100.69 to almost $120 per Mwh. This is compared to $63.19 per Mwh for a pulverized coal unit in the Base Case. Financing costs for units with carbon controls are assumed to be high due to the risk involved. The cost of carbon capture technologies for power plants is high, ranging from $100.69 to almost $120 per Mwh. In comparison, geothermal, nuclear, and wind power are zero-carbon options with relatively low costs. Natural gas combined cycle plants without carbon capture are also a cost-effective option at $77.21 per Mwh. The cost of carbon capture technologies for power plants is high, ranging from $100.69 to almost $120 per Mwh. Natural gas combined cycle plants without carbon capture incur allowance costs of $13.06 per Mwh, which is 61% less than pulverized coal plants. Solar thermal power is more expensive than nuclear and wind power, but cheaper than fossil plants with carbon capture technology. The low cost of power from natural gas plants is partly due to fuel prices, which may increase in a carbon-constrained world. The cost of carbon capture for power plants is high, with natural gas prices needing to more than double to match coal power with carbon controls or increase by 75% to match solar thermal power. Natural gas prices have historically increased by about 200%. Improved carbon capture technologies are being developed to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The cost of carbon capture for power plants can be reduced by 50%, resulting in combined cycle plants with capture having electricity costs slightly less than wind and nuclear power. IGCC plants with capture are more expensive, with power costs 28% higher than wind and 24% higher than nuclear due to the high cost of IGCC technology. The overnight cost of power plants is the capital component of power prices, excluding escalation in costs during construction and financing charges. Cost estimates were derived from a database of 161 power projects, covering fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy technologies. The overnight costs of power plants were estimated using a database of 161 projects, excluding those that were too old, used non-standard technology, or had extreme outliers. Projects were sorted by technology, and the reported cost per kilowatt of capacity was averaged to estimate the overnight cost for each technology. Information was sourced from utilities filed with state public service commissions, providing cost details for new plant construction. The project cost estimate can be adjusted to exclude IDC and other expenses not directly associated with the cost of the plant. Information from utility commission filings, press releases, and trade journal articles was used to determine cost estimates for 161 power plant projects, including 119 in the United States. The financial model assumed no cost escalation to avoid double counting, but did compute IDC charges. The database contains information on 161 power plant projects, including 119 in the United States. It also includes 31 generic and 11 foreign cost estimates for nuclear power plants, which are useful for illustrating cost trends. The capital costs used in the study are based on actual project estimates but are subject to significant uncertainty due to factors like cost escalation and evolving technology. The report provides information on cost escalation and technology evolution in power plant construction, with a focus on advanced nuclear and IGCC coal plants. It includes tables and graphs showing project data used to estimate overnight costs for different technologies. Acronyms like Pulverized Coal, IGCC, and Nuclear are used in the tables. The costs and efficiency of different technologies are detailed in the report, including Pulverized Coal, IGCC, Nuclear, Natural Gas Combined Cycle, Wind, Geothermal, Solar Thermal, and Solar Photovoltaic. MIT's 2007 study on coal estimates that a supercritical pulverized coal plant with carbon capture would have a 90% CO2 capture rate and a 23.9% decrease in efficiency. The capital cost would increase by 61% for a plant with amine scrubbing for CO2 removal. The size of the plant needs to be increased to meet the electricity and steam demands of the capture system, with a 788 MW plant required to achieve 600 MW of net capacity. The additional 188 MW is used by the amine scrubbing system. MIT does not provide specific O&M costs for carbon capture, but estimates from a DOE study suggest fixed O&M costs of $8.24 per kW and variable O&M costs of $7.79 per Mwh. These costs are added to the base O&M costs for a coal-fired plant. The estimated characteristics of a new supercritical pulverized coal plant with amine scrubbing are: Capacity: 600 MW. Heat rate increases by 31.3% to 12,080 btus per kWh. Overnight capital cost: $4,025 per kW. Variable O&M costs: $13.65 per Mwh. Fixed O&M costs: $43.44 per kW. Capacity factor: 85%. Construction time: four years. The cost estimate for an IGCC plant with carbon capture is $4,862 per kW in 2008, higher than EIA's estimates for IGCC plants without carbon controls. Other assumptions such as O&M costs and heat rates remain unchanged in this study. The capital cost for a natural gas-fired combined cycle with carbon capture is estimated at $2,400 per kW in 2008, double the base cost. EIA's assumptions for a combined cycle plant with carbon capture are used without adjustment in this study."
