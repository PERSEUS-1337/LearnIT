    "content": "Revolving door statutes regulating post-employment activities of former federal officers and employees have been in place since 1872, with updates in 1944, 1962, 1978, and 1989. These laws include cooling-off periods for high-level executive branch personnel to limit advocacy activities before the federal government. The revolving door statutes have been amended multiple times since 1989, with changes in 2007 increasing cooling-off periods for certain officials. The purpose of these laws is to prevent former employees from using proprietary information against the government. The court upheld the constitutionality of the \"switching sides\" prohibition to protect the government from former agents using information gained during their agency. Revolving door restrictions aim to prevent current federal officials from being influenced by future private arrangements. The court upheld the constitutionality of the \"switching sides\" prohibition to prevent former federal officials from using insider knowledge for personal gain. Revolving door restrictions aim to prevent conflicts of interest when officials leave government positions. The limitations on former government employees' private employment opportunities aim to prevent unfair use of prior government affiliations. However, overly restrictive provisions may deter qualified individuals from entering government service and isolate government employees from private sector concerns. 18 U.S.C. Section 207 applies to all executive branch employees after they leave government service, restricting their activities. Section 207 of title 18 imposes post-employment restrictions on executive branch personnel, including lifetime bans on certain activities related to matters they worked on while in government service. These restrictions aim to prevent unfair use of prior government affiliations. The post-employment restrictions under Section 207 of title 18 include a one-year \"cooling off\" period for senior officials, a two-year period for very senior officials, and a one-year ban on certain officials from performing representational activities for foreign entities. Additionally, presidential and vice-presidential appointees in the Obama Administration must sign an ethics agreement limiting lobbying and advocacy activities during and after their tenure. The post-employment restrictions under Section 207 of title 18 include a lifetime ban on executive branch employees \"switching sides\" to represent private parties in specific matters they worked on while in government service. This restriction applies to cases where an individual worked substantially on a particular governmental matter and then tries to represent the private parties involved in that matter before the government. The post-employment restrictions under Section 207 of title 18 include a lifetime ban on executive branch employees \"switching sides\" to represent private parties in specific matters they worked on while in government service. This prohibition typically involves specific proceedings affecting legal rights or identifiable transactions between parties, rather than broad policy making matters. It does not prohibit former government officials from working for a private company that had previous dealings with their agency, but it does restrict subsequent representational or advocacy activities before the government. Section 207 of title 18 imposes post-employment restrictions on federal employees in the executive branch. It includes a lifetime ban on representing private parties in specific matters worked on while in government service. Additionally, there is a two-year ban on similar representational activities, extending to matters under the official responsibility of the former official. This restriction is broader in coverage as it does not require personal involvement in the matter while in government service. Section 207 of title 18 imposes post-employment restrictions on federal employees in the executive branch, including a one-year ban on representing private parties in ongoing trade or treaty negotiations they were involved in while in government service. Additionally, senior-level employees have a one-year \"cooling off\" period where they cannot make advocacy contacts or representations to their former departments. Senior-level executive branch employees are subject to a one-year ban on representing private parties in matters they worked on while in government service. This restriction also applies to seeking official action from their former department or agency. The \"cooling off\" ban applies to senior-level executive branch officials, including Vice President and Cabinet officers, restricting them from lobbying their former agency for one year. The ban does not apply to lobbying Congress immediately after leaving government. The cooling off period for \"very senior\" officials prohibits them from making representations before their former agencies or executive level positions in the federal government for two years. Additionally, 18 U.S.C. Section 207(f) bars \"senior\" and \"very senior\" employees from engaging in representational activities for foreign governments for one year after leaving the government. The provision prohibits former officials from representing foreign entities before any U.S. department or agency for one year after leaving the government. It also restricts aiding or advising a foreign entity with the intent to influence U.S. officials for one year. Members of Congress are included in the ban on communications with foreign governments during this period. The lifetime ban on representing or aiding foreign governments applies to the United States Trade Representative and Deputy United States Trade Representative. The Office of Government Ethics clarifies that the prohibition involves employment activities that attempt to influence U.S. government officials. General employment with a foreign government is not prohibited, but activities that involve attempts to influence U.S. officials are restricted. Former senior employees represent a foreign entity when acting on its behalf before any U.S. department or agency. President Obama issued an executive order on January 21, 2009, imposing additional post-employment restrictions on full-time, non-career presidential appointees in the executive branch. These restrictions aim to prevent former senior employees from aiding or advising foreign entities with the intent to influence current departmental or agency employees' decisions. In the executive branch, non-career SES appointees and appointees to confidential and policy-making positions must agree to an ethics pledge prohibiting them from lobbying after leaving government service. This pledge applies to executive branch officials covered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act and non-career SES appointees for the duration of the Obama Administration. Additionally, senior executive branch officials subject to the one-year cooling-off period now have to abide by a two-year cooling-off period. Certain officers and employees of federal banking agencies or reserve banks involved in bank examinations are now subject to a two-year cooling-off period. This restriction applies to those who served as senior examiners for at least two months in their last year of federal service and had broad responsibility for examinations. They are prohibited from any compensated employment with private depository institutions for one year after leaving federal service. Certain restrictions exist on post-government employment activities for certain officials, including those involved in bank examinations. These restrictions go beyond lobbying activities and extend to any compensated work for private contractors after working on certain contracts. The post-employment restrictions for former federal officials involved in government contracts exceeding $10 million prohibit them from receiving compensation from the private contractor for one year after performing procurement duties. These restrictions are outlined in federal law at 41 U.S.C. Sections 2103 and 2104. Officials of the Department of Defense involved in procurements over $10 million must request an ethics opinion before leaving if they will receive compensation from a defense contractor within two years. This is to ensure compliance with post-employment restrictions outlined in federal law. Under legislation adopted in 2012, all federal officials earning a salary equal to or more than 120% of the base salary for a GS-15 must report negotiations for private employment to their ethics office. The STOCK Act requires them to recuse themselves from any government matters that may create a conflict of interest. Federal employees in the executive branch seeking private employment must comply with conflict of interest laws, including disqualifying themselves from official duties once negotiations with a private employer begin. The Office of Government Ethics has regulations in place to address potential conflicts of interest. The regulations require federal employees to disqualify themselves from official duties once they have begun seeking private employment. This includes any discussions or communications related to potential job opportunities, even if specific details are not discussed. The status of \"seeking employment\" continues until all possibilities are rejected or two months have passed after an unsolicited communication. The regulations require federal employees to disqualify themselves from official duties once they have begun seeking private employment. This status continues until all possibilities are rejected or two months have passed after an unsolicited communication. Employees should notify their assignment supervisor or take necessary steps for compliance. Written documentation of recusal is not required, except to comply with previous ethics agreements. Waivers from disqualification requirements can be obtained in writing from the official responsible for the employee's appointment. In procurement, contacts about potential private employment between federal personnel and contractors may trigger reporting and recusal requirements. Officials involved in a procurement over $100,000 must report all contacts regarding non-federal employment and either reject future employment or disqualify themselves until discussions end. In procurement, officials involved in procurements over $100,000 must report contacts about potential private employment and either reject future employment or disqualify themselves until discussions end. Reports on contacts and recusals are kept for two years and can be requested by the public. Departing Department of Defense officials must seek an ethics opinion if they expect compensation from a defense contractor within two years. Changes in House and Senate rules in 2007 address negotiations for future private employment by Members and certain staff. In the Senate and House, rules govern private employment negotiations for Members and staff. Senators must wait for successors before starting negotiations, while House Members cannot negotiate while still serving. Exceptions allow early negotiations with disclosure statements, except for lobbying activities in the Senate until a successor is elected. The rules for private employment negotiations for Members of Congress require recusal from any conflicts of interest. Senators must wait for successors before negotiating, while House Members cannot negotiate while still serving. Disclosure statements are required for early negotiations, except for lobbying activities in the Senate until a successor is elected. The rules for private employment negotiations for Members of Congress require recusal from conflicts of interest. Senior staff must notify ethics committees of negotiations for future private employment within three days. They must recuse themselves from legislative matters that pose conflicts of interest and refrain from contacting prospective employers on legislative issues. The STOCK Act of 2012 may impact staff not covered by these provisions. The STOCK Act of 2012 introduces new provisions that may affect staff not covered by existing rules. Staff required to file financial disclosure reports must notify the ethics office of private employment negotiations and recuse themselves from conflicting governmental matters. Post-employment restrictions for Members and senior congressional staffers were added in 1989 and amended in 2007. Members of the House are prohibited from lobbying under criminal provisions. The STOCK Act of 2012 imposes post-employment restrictions on former Members of Congress and senior staff, prohibiting lobbying for one to two years after leaving office. Additionally, there are cooling-off periods for advocacy contacts and limitations on representing foreign interests before the U.S. government. Post-employment lobbying restrictions apply to United States Senators for two years and to Members of the House of Representatives and senior legislative branch employees for one year. After leaving office, former Members of the House are prohibited from lobbying or contacting any current congressional members or employees. After leaving Senate or House employment, \"senior\" staff are restricted from making advocacy communications to current members or employees for one year. House committee staffers are also barred from making such contacts to former committee members for one year. After leaving Senate or House employment, \"senior\" staff are restricted from making advocacy communications to current members or employees for one year. The prohibition applies to advocacy-type communications intended to influence official action by a Member, officer, or employee of the legislative branch. There are exceptions for lobbying for state or local governments, testifying under oath, and representing political candidates or parties. Members of Congress and government employees who worked on treaties or trade negotiations cannot use privileged information for one year after leaving for purposes other than aiding the United States. They are also prohibited from representing foreign entities or influencing US agency decisions for a year after leaving office. Former Senate staffers who become registered lobbyists or work for entities with lobbyists are subject to Senate Rule XXXVII, clause 9, which prohibits them from lobbying their former Senator or committee for one year after leaving Senate employment. \"Senior\" employees are barred from lobbying any Member, officer, or employee of the entire Senate for one year. Former Members of Congress are also subject to restrictions on lobbying activities. Former Members of the House and Senate are generally granted floor privileges, but restrictions apply if they have a direct interest in pending legislative measures or are registered lobbyists. Senate rules also prohibit former Members or officers who are lobbyists from having floor privileges. Former Members of Congress who are registered lobbyists or foreign agents are restricted from accessing athletic and exercise facilities in the House and Senate. Additionally, a Member of Congress cannot accept a civil office in the U.S. government if the office was created or its salary increased during their current term, preventing them from retiring early to take such a position. The disqualification of a Member of Congress from accepting a civil office with an increased salary during their term has been avoided by legislation lowering the salary back to its previous level."
