    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Transitional Fuel Security Act of 2006\". Congress finds that fossil fuels currently dominate energy consumption in the United States, with oil production declining and prices rising. The country heavily relies on foreign oil sources, making the energy supply chain vulnerable. Additionally, no new oil refineries have been built since 1976. The Fischer-Tropsch technology can produce cleaner synthetic fuels from abundant domestic coal reserves. The United States military's fuel demand accounts for 2% of total consumption, making them vulnerable to oil cost increases. Federal agencies aim to partner with the energy industry and academia to reduce reliance on foreign oil sources for national security. Private industry is prepared to commercialize these efforts. The Act aims to establish a Federal pilot program to encourage private investment in transitioning to a coal-to-fuel industry using Fischer-Tropsch technology. The goal is to achieve this transition in a cost-neutral manner to the Treasury. The Act aims to establish a Federal pilot program to encourage private investment in transitioning to a coal-to-fuel industry using Fischer-Tropsch technology. The goal is to achieve this transition in a cost-neutral manner to the Treasury. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"byproduct\" as residual products of the Fischer-Tropsch process with commercial value, and \"coal-to-fuel\" as using coal resources to produce synthetic fuel through Fischer-Tropsch reactions. The Act defines \"byproduct\" as residual products of the Fischer-Tropsch process with commercial value, and \"coal-to-fuel\" as using coal resources to produce synthetic fuel through Fischer-Tropsch reactions. The term \"facility\" refers to a coal-to-fuel demonstration facility constructed under the Plan, while an \"investor\" is a nongovernmental entity that invests in and holds a minority non-controlling interest in one or more facilities. The \"Plan\" is the plan developed by the Secretary and submitted to Congress, and the \"Reserve\" is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve established under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The term \"synthetic fuel\" in the Policy and Conservation Act refers to synthetic petroleum or refined fuel products produced through a coal-to-fuel process. The term \"Secretary\" in the Act means the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. CONSTRUCTION OF COAL-TO-FUEL DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES. The Secretary must submit a plan to Congress for constructing up to 5 coal-to-fuel demonstration facilities within 180 days of this Act. The plan includes funding details and requirements for partnerships with investors and the Department of Defense. The Secretary of Defense will procure jet fuel and diesel from facilities, enter contracts to resupply the Reserve with synthetic petroleum or crude oil, and require all Reserve petroleum needs to be met with synthetic fuel. The plan involves meeting the Reserve's petroleum requirements with synthetic fuel, producing and selling synthetic fuel products, divesting ownership of facilities, and ensuring full reimbursement of costs through various means. The revenue generated from activities described in subsection (b) will be used to pay operating expenses and distribute profit shares to commercial investors. Any remaining revenue will be deposited in the Treasury's general fund. The Secretary must include proposed facility locations, construction costs, and production goals in the Plan submitted to Congress. The Plan must include production goals of 30,000 barrels of synthetic fuel per day for some facilities and 5,000 barrels per day for others, a carbon dioxide sequestration plan, marketing plan for byproducts, coal procurement plans, product contracting with the Secretary of Defense, phased construction plan, phased withdrawal of petroleum products to finance construction, management plans involving investors, and a plan to divest ownership of facilities. SEC. 5. NON-FEDERAL INVESTMENT. The Federal share of construction costs for each facility under the Plan must be at least 51 percent. After recovering the Federal share, profits from facility operation will be distributed to investors based on their investment. SEC. 6. DIVESTITURE. The Secretary must divest ownership of facilities once production goals are met, funds are deposited in the Treasury, and fuel is deposited in the Reserve. The Secretary will manage each facility until divestiture, and contracts can be transferred to subsequent owners. The contract prohibits nongovernmental entities from taking ownership of a facility to shut it down. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATIONS. The Secretary may sell up to 20,000,000 barrels of petroleum products annually for 5 years to finance facility construction, with a total limit of 100,000,000 barrels. Priority for facility sites is on Federal land, with alternatives if Federal land is unavailable. The Secretary may procure non-Federal land if Federal land is not available for facility sites."
