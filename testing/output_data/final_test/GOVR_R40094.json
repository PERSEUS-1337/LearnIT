    "content": "Iran ratified the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1970 and accepted IAEA safeguards in 1974. The IAEA found Iran in violation of its safeguards agreement in 2002, leading to referral to the UN Security Council in 2006. Six resolutions have since been adopted to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program. Iran's nuclear program has raised concerns about the pursuit of nuclear weapons through gas centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities. Gas centrifuges enrich uranium by spinning uranium hexafluoride gas to increase the concentration of uranium-235 isotope, producing both low-enriched uranium (LEU) for reactors and highly enriched uranium (HEU) for nuclear weapons. For more detailed information, refer to CRS Report RL34544 and CRS Report R43333. Iran has uranium conversion facilities for producing LEU for power reactors. They are also constructing a heavy water reactor at Arak, which raises proliferation concerns due to the potential for plutonium production. Iran claims the reactor is for medical isotopes, but the spent fuel could be used for nuclear weapons. Iran has stated they will not engage in reprocessing. Iran has fulfilled JCPOA requirements by rendering the Arak reactor's core inoperable and redesigning it to prevent weapons-grade plutonium production. Iran also agreed with the IAEA in 2007 to clarify outstanding questions about its nuclear program, resolving most suspicions of pursuing nuclear weapons. However, one major unresolved issue remains. The IAEA has one major unresolved issue with Iran regarding possible military dimensions to its nuclear program. Iran questions the evidence and expresses concerns about revealing sensitive information related to its military activities. The IAEA is willing to discuss modalities for Iran to demonstrate that the activities are not nuclear-related while protecting sensitive information. The IAEA and Iran have been in discussions regarding Iran's nuclear program and its military activities. Despite several proposals from the agency, Iran did not provide the requested information. The IAEA Board of Governors adopted a resolution in 2011 urging intensified dialogue for resolving outstanding issues. Meetings between IAEA and Iranian officials took place from 2012 to 2013, leading to a new approach in 2013. A joint statement in 2013 outlined a \"Framework for Cooperation\" to strengthen dialogue and cooperation between Iran and the IAEA. Iran and the IAEA agreed to strengthen cooperation to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. Iran provided information on outstanding issues and agreed to disclose more by August 25, 2014. The JCPOA required Iran to complete steps outlined in a roadmap with the IAEA. The IAEA and Iran cooperated to address outstanding issues related to Iran's nuclear program. A road map was implemented according to schedule, leading to the closure of the Board's consideration of these issues. The IAEA is now focused on monitoring and verifying Iran's JCPOA implementation in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Quarterly reports are to be issued regarding Iran's commitments under the JCPOA. The Director General is required to report to the Board of Governors and the Security Council on Tehran's compliance with its JCPOA and safeguards obligations. Reporting provisions in the JCPOA and Resolution 2231 mandate regular updates to the IAEA Board of Governors and Security Council on Iran's commitments. Iran is also obligated to cooperate fully with the IAEA's investigation of its nuclear activities. Iran is required to cooperate fully with the IAEA's investigation of its nuclear activities, suspend its uranium enrichment program, construction of a heavy-water reactor, and ratify the Additional Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement. Tehran has signed but not ratified the Additional Protocol. Iran has also continued its ballistic missile program despite Resolution 1929's requirements. On January 16, 2016, Iran implemented additional restrictions on its nuclear program as part of the JCPOA. The agreement terminated previous Security Council resolutions' requirements and is governed by U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 and the NPT. Compliance with the agreement is monitored by the IAEA and the JCPOA-established Joint Commission. \"Iran continued to adhere to its JCPOA commitments during 2017, as confirmed by various official reports and statements from international organizations. The IAEA has verified compliance with restrictions on nuclear weapons-related activities, including access to Iranian sites for inspections.\" The IAEA has concerns about undeclared nuclear materials or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA. They have various methods to monitor Iranian compliance, including analyzing open-source information and receiving intelligence briefings. The agency continues to pursue any new safeguards-relevant information in Iran through the implementation of safeguards agreements and the JCPOA. There are no apparent disputes between Iran and the IAEA regarding Iranian compliance. The IAEA has been able to access all sites in Iran needed for inspections, ensuring Iranian cooperation. Iran's agreements with the IAEA aim to prevent the diversion of nuclear material for weapons purposes. Comprehensive safeguards agreements give the IAEA authority to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. The IAEA's safeguards agreements allow them to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities, but their authority is limited. Additional Protocols increase the agency's ability to investigate undeclared facilities and activities. Iran signed a protocol in 2003 but stopped adhering to it in 2006. The IAEA's authority to investigate nuclear-weapons-related activity is limited, as explained by Director General ElBaradei in 2005. The agency's legal authority to verify possible nuclear weapons-related activity is restricted without a nexus to nuclear material. Disagreements among IAEA member states exist regarding the agency's rights to access locations without suspicion of nuclear material presence. The IAEA's authority to investigate nuclear-weapons-related activity is limited without a nexus to nuclear material. Disagreements among member states exist regarding the agency's rights to access locations without suspicion of nuclear material presence. The current public controversy over Iran's nuclear program began in 2002 when the NCRI revealed Tehran's undisclosed nuclear facilities. The United States was aware of some activities prior to this revelation. In 2002, the IAEA started investigating Iran's nuclear activities following a report by the NCRI. By September 2003, the IAEA urged Tehran to cooperate, suspend uranium enrichment, and sign an Additional Protocol. Iran then agreed with France, Germany, and the UK to suspend enrichment and comply with the IAEA, avoiding referral to the UN Security Council. The IAEA's investigation revealed Iran's clandestine nuclear activities, leading to a resolution of noncompliance in September 2005. Iran had signed but not ratified the Additional Protocol in 2003, and despite agreements to suspend enrichment, resumed activities under Ahmadinejad in 2005. The IAEA board decided not to refer the matter to the UN Security Council. The IAEA resolution urged Iran to comply with transparency measures, suspend enrichment activities, reconsider the construction of a research reactor, ratify the Additional Protocol, and act in accordance with its provisions. ElBaradei's report highlighted the importance of these measures for the IAEA to progress in its assessment of Iran's nuclear program. Iran announced in January 2006 that it would resume research and development on its centrifuges at Natanz, leading to the IAEA Board of Governors referring Iran's case to the U.N. Security Council. Tehran then announced it would stop implementing its Additional Protocol, further reducing cooperation with the IAEA by halting compliance with a portion of its safeguards agreement. Iran's decision to withhold information on its nuclear program was based on its interpretation of notification provisions regarding new facility construction. Despite initial refusal, Iran eventually provided design information for the Arak reactor in 2014. Tehran also withheld design information for a reactor planned at Darkhovin, but later submitted preliminary design details. Iran provided preliminary design information for the Darkhovin reactor in 2009, but the IAEA requested additional clarifications. Iran only provided limited design information in 2010. Tehran argued that its failure to notify the IAEA about the Fordow facility construction before 2009 was consistent with safeguards obligations. The exact timing of Iran's decision to construct the facility remains unclear. The IAEA requested information from Iran regarding the Fordow construction decision in 2012. The IAEA requested information from Iran regarding the Fordow construction decision, but Tehran has not provided all the necessary design information as per safeguards obligations. Iran's refusal to provide the design information appears to be inconsistent with its agreements with the IAEA. The IAEA requested information from Iran about the Fordow facility construction decision, but Tehran has not provided all necessary design information, which may violate Iran's safeguards agreement. Additionally, Iran's delay in providing design information for the Darkhovin reactor is also noted. The IAEA is investigating whether Iran has made decisions to construct new nuclear facilities without informing the agency. Iran is planning to construct new uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear reactor similar to one in Tehran. They are also producing fuel for new research reactors and planning to build more nuclear power reactors. Iran has provided some information to the IAEA, but there have been delays and refusals to allow inspectors to verify design information, which may violate safeguards agreements. In 2008, ElBaradei reported Iran's refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to verify the Arak reactor's design information, violating safeguards agreements. Inspectors visited the facility in August 2009 and several times after. Iran's failure to notify the IAEA of producing enriched uranium containing 20% uranium-235 may have also violated agreements, according to a February 2010 report from Amano. The IAEA board has not formally found Iran in noncompliance with safeguards agreements despite concerns raised in resolutions regarding Tehran's failure to notify the agency of certain facilities. The IAEA board has not formally found Iran in noncompliance with safeguards agreements despite concerns raised in resolutions. Iran resumed research on centrifuges at Natanz in January 2006, leading to resolutions by the IAEA board and the U.N. Security Council. The Security Council issued non-legally binding statements and adopted six resolutions regarding Iran's nuclear program. Resolution 1696, 1737, 1803, and 1929 imposed restrictions on Iran regarding its nuclear program, including mandatory suspension and transparency measures. The Security Council recognized Iran's rights under the NPT but required Tehran to refrain from certain nuclear activities. Resolution 1929 required Tehran to refrain from ballistic missile activities related to nuclear weapons and comply with modified Code 3.1. Resolution 2231 terminated previous requirements upon IAEA confirmation of Iran's nuclear-related measures implementation by Implementation Day on January 16, 2016. It also emphasized Iran's cooperation with IAEA to resolve outstanding issues. The JCPOA closed consideration of Iran's nuclear program issues. The JCPOA and Resolution 2231 outline a process for resolving disputes over Iran's nuclear program. A \"snap back\" mechanism allows for sanctions to be reimposed if Iran fails to address noncompliance claims. The mechanism can be invoked by any permanent UN Security Council member. The US's ability to use this mechanism is unclear as Resolution 2231 states that only a \"JCPOA participant state\" can bring a noncompliance finding. The legal authority for actions taken by the IAEA Board of Governors and the UN Security Council is found in the IAEA Statute and the UN Charter. The IAEA Statute outlines procedures for addressing noncompliance with safeguards agreements, including reporting to the UN General Assembly and Security Council when necessary. The IAEA Board of Governors has the responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Noncompliance issues are reported to the Director General, who then reports to the Board of Governors. The Board can call upon the recipient State to remedy noncompliance and report to the Security Council and General Assembly of the United Nations. In the case of Iran, the Board found multiple failures and breaches of obligations, constituting noncompliance with the Agency's Statute. The IAEA Board of Governors found Iran in noncompliance with the Agency's Statute due to a history of concealing nuclear activities. The Director General's report raised concerns about Iran's nuclear program not being solely for peaceful purposes, leading to questions within the Security Council's jurisdiction. ElBaradei's report, GOV/2003/75, detailed Iranian nuclear activities violating safeguards agreements, with corrective measures subsequently taken by Iran. The 2005 resolution called on Iran to address safeguards breaches, invoking the Security Council's authority under the U.N. Charter. Chapter VII outlines actions for threats to peace, including measures related to Iran's nuclear program. Resolution 1696 invoked Chapter VII of the UN Charter to make mandatory the suspension required by the IAEA for Iran's nuclear program, without imposing sanctions. Subsequent resolutions 1737, 1747, 1803, and 1929, which did impose sanctions, invoked Article 41 of Chapter VII. Security Council resolution 1835 reaffirmed previous resolutions and called on Iran to comply with them, without imposing new sanctions. Article 25 of the U.N. Charter obligates members to accept and carry out Security Council decisions. The IAEA has an obligation to cooperate with the Security Council under their Relationship Agreement with the United Nations. Security Council Resolution 2231 tasks the IAEA Director General with verifying Iran's nuclear commitments under the JCPOA. It is unclear if Iran has violated the NPT, as there is no formal mechanism for determining violations. An NPT Review Conference could be a venue for such determinations, as the U.N. Security Council has not declared Iran in violation of the NPT. The U.N. Security Council has not declared Iran in violation of the NPT, but has taken action based on the IAEA's determination of Iran's safeguards agreement violations. Iran's breaches may constitute violations of Article III of the NPT, which requires acceptance of IAEA safeguards to prevent nuclear energy diversion for weapons. There are concerns that Iran may have also violated Article II. The IAEA investigated evidence of possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, indicating potential violations of Article II of the NPT. A past Iranian military program to develop nuclear weapons until fall 2003 could also be a violation of Article II. The IAEA investigated Iran's nuclear program for possible military dimensions, suggesting violations of Article II of the NPT. A 2005 State Department report concluded that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons, citing secrecy, deception, and lack of economic justification. The 2005 State Department report concluded that Iran's nuclear program combines declared and suspected undeclared activities, potentially violating Article II of the NPT. The report emphasizes the need to consider the purpose behind nuclear activities to assess compliance. The 2005 State Department report highlighted that activities indicating the acquisition of a nuclear explosive device could violate Article II of the NPT. Foster mentioned examples like building a nuclear device or producing relevant components. The report's argument relies on determining violations based on a state's apparent intentions behind nuclear-related activities. The State Department's assessments on Iran's compliance with Article II of the NPT from 2002 to 2016 remain unclear. The 2007 NIE stated that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003, and subsequent U.S. statements reiterated that Tehran has not decided to build nuclear weapons. In 2012, the UK's Foreign Secretary did not confirm if Iran had violated Article II. The November 2003 report from IAEA Director General ElBaradei detailed Iran's failures to comply with its safeguards agreement, including not reporting nuclear material processing and storage facilities. This noncompliance was also mentioned in earlier reports. Iran failed to declare importation and processing of natural uranium, production and transfer of nuclear material, waste, and facilities to IAEA. They also did not report uranium conversion experiments and testing of centrifuges with imported uranium hexafluoride. Iran failed to provide the IAEA with information on the testing of centrifuges, production of enriched and depleted uranium, importation of natural uranium for laser enrichment experiments, production of nuclear compounds, production of uranium targets for the Tehran Research Reactor, and design information for nuclear-related facilities. The report highlighted Iran's failure to cooperate with the IAEA, including concealment of nuclear activities and refusal to grant access to certain facilities. Special inspections may be called for in such cases, requiring approval from the IAEA Board of Governors. Special inspections, which may be necessary in cases of non-cooperation like Iran's, require approval from the IAEA Board of Governors. These inspections involve accessing information or locations not previously identified to the IAEA and are meant to resolve verification issues. The IAEA's ability to conduct special inspections is outlined in comprehensive safeguards agreements, allowing them to address inadequate information provided by the State. The IAEA has the authority to conduct special inspections based on plausible information not adequately explained by the State. If the need for a special inspection is determined, immediate consultations between the agency and the government must take place, with any disputes resolved according to dispute settlement provisions. The IAEA can conduct special inspections based on unexplained information, with disputes resolved through settlement provisions. INFCIRC 153 allows the Board to call for urgent action if nuclear material is at risk, with potential reporting to the UN Security Council if inspections are refused. William Foster's testimony in 1968 highlighted concerns about possible NPT violations. Director William Foster testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the NPT, specifically addressing the prohibited nuclear activities outlined in Article II of the treaty. This includes the commitment of non-nuclear-weapon parties to refrain from manufacturing or acquiring nuclear weapons or other explosive devices, while also allowing for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with the Treaty's provisions. United States representatives were consulted during the Treaty negotiations on defining what constitutes the \"manufacture\" of nuclear weapons or explosive devices. The United States representatives were consulted on defining the \"manufacture\" of nuclear weapons under Article II of the draft treaty. They stated that while the general intent of the provision is clear, it is difficult to formulate a comprehensive definition. Specific activities indicating the acquisition of a nuclear explosive device would suggest non-compliance with the proposed treaty. The United States representatives consulted on defining the \"manufacture\" of nuclear weapons under Article II of the draft treaty. Specific activities indicating the acquisition of a nuclear explosive device would suggest non-compliance. The construction of an experimental or prototype nuclear explosive device would be covered by the term 'manufacture'. Placing activities under safeguards would help allay suspicion of non-compliance. The United States would not consider uranium enrichment or stockpiling of fissionable material for a peaceful program as violations if safeguarded under Article III. The development of plutonium-fueled power reactors, including research on metallic plutonium properties, is permitted under Article III. Fast breeder reactors can also be developed and used under safeguards, without interference from Article II."
