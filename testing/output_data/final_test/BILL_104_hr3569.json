FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that the purpose of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is to enable member countries to conduct trade based on free market principles, limit government intervention, and encourage reciprocal reductions in tariffs. The WTO assumes that trade is conducted by independent enterprises responding to profit incentives and market forces. Countries with nonmarket economies must implement significant reforms to join the WTO, with a decentralized and free market economy considered a precondition for fair trade. The World Trade Organization (WTO) requires member countries to have a market economy for fair trade. Hong Kong will remain a full member of the WTO as a separate customs territory after joining China. Taiwan has applied for WTO membership as a separate customs territory with a free market economy. Taiwan, with a free market economy for over 3 decades, is the 14th largest trading nation globally. It has the world's 20th largest gross national product and is the 7th largest foreign investor. Taiwan is the 7th largest trading partner of the United States, with purchases of U.S. exports exceeding those of China by over 50 percent. Taiwan has agreed to reduce tariffs on many products and eliminate nontariff barriers, maintaining a longstanding friendship with the United States. Taiwan's democratic progress was highlighted by the historic election in 1996, showcasing the success of US promotion of democracy worldwide. Taiwan's WTO accession is significant for the US due to its status as a major importer. Taiwan's entry into the WTO would create new market opportunities for US exporters and investors. Despite China's opposition, Taiwan meets the criteria for admission, unlike China which seeks developing nation status to avoid tariff and subsidy obligations. The Communist government of the People's Republic of China maintains strict controls over trade, restricts free market competition, and imposes high tariffs on foreign goods, despite commitments made in the WTO. The United States threatened trade sanctions against China for failing to curb piracy of intellectual property rights, causing an estimated $2.3 billion loss to the US economy in 1995. Additionally, Chinese state-owned arms exporting companies were caught smuggling 2,000 items into the US. The United States threatened trade sanctions against China for intellectual property rights piracy, causing a $2.3 billion loss to the US economy in 1995. Chinese state-owned arms exporting companies were caught smuggling 2,000 AK-47 rifles into the US for sale to gangs. Illegal activities like these should be considered in trade policy formulation. The Communist government of China uses subsidies to unfairly advantage its exports, making it unfit for WTO admission as a developed or developing nation. Taiwan, on the other hand, meets all requirements for WTO admission. The Republic of China has most-favored-nation trading status with the United States, but the People's Republic of China should only have this status if Taiwan is admitted to the WTO soon. SEC. 2. CONTINGENT EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TRADE TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA: Nondiscriminatory treatment may apply to China's products after March 1, 1997, only if Taiwan is admitted to the WTO as a separate customs territory by that date."
