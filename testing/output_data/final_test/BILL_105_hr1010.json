    "content": "The \"Mandates Information Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that before enacting private sector mandates, the effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses should be carefully considered. The costs of these mandates are often borne by consumers through higher prices, workers through lower wages, and small businesses through hiring disincentives and stunted growth. The Act aims to improve Congress' deliberation on private sector mandates by providing complete information on their effects and ensuring focused deliberation. It also seeks to help Congress differentiate between mandates that harm consumers, workers, and small businesses and those that benefit them. The Act aims to enhance Congress' understanding of the impact of Federal private sector mandates on consumers, workers, and small businesses, including any disproportionate effects in specific regions or industries. The joint resolution focuses on analyzing the impact of Federal private sector mandates on consumer prices, worker wages, benefits, employment opportunities, hiring practices, expansion, and profitability of businesses with 100 or fewer employees. Additionally, a point of order is added to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The joint resolution adds a point of order to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding Federal intergovernmental mandates exceeding specified thresholds. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to remove references to \"intergovernmental\" in various sections, and the Rules of the House of Representatives are updated accordingly. The Rules of the House of Representatives are amended to include section 424 (a)(1) or (b)(1) and clarify the exercise of rulemaking powers by Congress. The Congress believes that any unfunded mandates exceeding the threshold should be funded through reduced taxes, tax abatements, or direct compensation by the Federal Government."
