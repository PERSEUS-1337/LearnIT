    "content": "The Office of Advocacy is an independent office within the U.S. Small Business Administration responsible for representing small businesses to various government bodies. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy is appointed by the President and supports small business development by intervening in regulatory processes and providing compliance training. The Office of Advocacy, part of the U.S. Small Business Administration, represents small businesses to government bodies. It aims to reduce regulatory burdens, document the role of small businesses in the economy, and facilitate communication between federal agencies and the small business community. Advocacy has expanded its responsibilities over time and received an appropriation of $9.120 million for FY2019. Legislation has been introduced to increase its authority further, such as the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. The Office of Advocacy, part of the U.S. Small Business Administration, aims to reduce regulatory burdens for small businesses. Legislation has been introduced to increase its authority, including provisions in bills such as H.R. 2542 and H.R. 2804, which empower the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. During the 114th Congress, provisions empowering the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act were included in various bills such as H.R. 527 and S. 2847. More recently, S. 83, the Advocacy Empowerment Act of 2019, seeks to further empower the Chief Counsel in overseeing federal agency compliance with the RFA. The Small Business Act of 1953 authorized the SBA to aid small-business concerns. The Prove It Act of 2017 reintroduced during the 115th Congress examines Advocacy's origins and expansion of responsibilities. Recent legislative efforts aim to enhance Advocacy's authority. The Small Business Administration (SBA) advocates for small-business concerns through various programs. In response to dissatisfaction with advocacy efforts in the 1970s, legislation was passed to create an Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy. The Chief Counsel was tasked with five duties to enhance advocacy efforts. The Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy, established by P.L. 93-386, has five key duties: 1. receive feedback on small business policies; 2. advise small businesses on government relations; 3. propose policy changes to federal agencies; 4. advocate for small business interests; and 5. collaborate with other entities to promote federal programs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) established the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy in October 1974 to assist small businesses in accessing federal programs and services. Anthony Stasio was appointed as the first Chief Counsel, overseeing three deputy advocate positions. The office became fully operational by March 1, 1975. The Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy was established in October 1974 and became fully operational by March 1, 1975. Small business organizations lobbied Congress for greater independence for the Chief Counsel from the SBA's Administrator, leading to the passage of P.L. 94-305 in 1976, enhancing the Chief Counsel's authority. The Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy was established in 1974 and gained more authority with the passage of P.L. 94-305 in 1976. The Chief Counsel can be appointed by the President, with Senate approval, and has the power to employ staff, obtain expert advice, and hold hearings. Each federal department must provide necessary reports and information to the Chief Counsel. The Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy, established in 1974, gained more authority with P.L. 94-305 in 1976. The Chief Counsel can be appointed by the President, with Senate approval, and has the power to employ staff, obtain expert advice, and hold hearings. The Chief Counsel was ordered to provide information to Congress, the President, and the SBA, and authorized $1 million for Advocacy. The term \"independent\" was used to describe the Chief Counsel and Advocacy, but it remained part of the SBA and subject to the Administration's influence. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 expanded duties of the Office of Chief Counsel for Advocacy to oversee federal agency compliance with analyzing regulatory impacts on small entities. Federal regulations were seen as disproportionately burdening small businesses, nonprofits, and governments. Dougherty Jr., director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, highlighted at a congressional hearing the challenges small firms face in regulatory compliance compared to large firms due to higher per unit regulatory costs and lack of economies of scale. Small firms struggle to match the regulatory expertise and resources of large firms, leading to a competitive disadvantage. Economist Milton Kafoglis testified that regulatory requirements increase firm size, favoring dominant firms over small ones, leading to increased industrial concentration and impacting competition. This challenges the national policy of maintaining competition and preventing monopoly. The RFA requires federal agencies to assess the impact of regulations on small entities, defined as small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, and certain not-for-profit organizations. The Chief Counsel monitors compliance, reviews proposed regulations, and may appear in court actions. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 enhanced Advocacy's independence by separating its budget from the SBA's expenses account. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 enhanced Advocacy's independence by separating its budget from the SBA's expenses account, requiring the SBA Administrator to provide Advocacy with necessary office space, equipment, and budget. Advocacy issued its own congressional budget justification document and annual performance report for the first time in the Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request. Advocacy currently has 55 staff members across various offices. The budget for FY2019 is $9.120 million, with staff salaries and benefits accounting for 95% of the budget. The remaining funds are used for economic research grants and direct expenses. Advocacy is responsible for monitoring federal agency compliance with the RFA and Executive Order 13272. Advocacy monitors federal agency compliance with the RFA and Executive Order 13272, which require agencies to assess the impact of regulations on small entities. The RFA aims to identify barriers to small business competitiveness and promote a level playing field. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to analyze the impact of regulations on small entities, aiming to promote a level playing field for small businesses. The analysis includes reasons for the regulatory action, the small entities affected, compliance requirements, and alternatives to minimize impact on small entities. The analytical requirements can be waived if the agency head certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) gives federal agencies discretion in determining the economic impact on small entities. The RFA requires agencies to publish a regulatory flexibility agenda listing rules likely to impact small entities and to retrospectively review significant rules within 10 years of promulgation. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies to review rules that impact small entities within 10 years of promulgation. Agencies must consider whether to continue, amend, or rescind these rules to minimize their impact on small entities. Additionally, agencies like the EPA, OSHA, and CFPB must convene small business advocacy review panels when developing rules with significant economic impact on small entities. These panels include representatives from the rulemaking agency, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Chief Counsel, who seek input from small entity representatives to understand the impact of the rules. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies to review rules impacting small entities within 10 years. Small business advocacy review panels are convened to understand the impact of rules on small entities. The RFA encourages agencies to modify proposed rules based on panel recommendations and requires the Chief Counsel to monitor agencies' compliance with the act. Executive Order 13272 mandates federal agencies to make information publicly available. The Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 13272 require federal agencies to make information publicly available and consider Advocacy's comments on draft regulations that impact small entities. Advocacy notifies agencies on how to comply with the RFA through publications and training programs. Advocacy ensures federal agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 13272 through training programs and annual reporting. In FY2018, Advocacy provided public comment letters to 20 federal agencies, hosted roundtable discussions in 16 states, and trained 132 federal officials on RFA compliance. These activities aim to provide regulatory cost savings for small businesses. Advocacy provides regulatory cost savings for small businesses by estimating the costs and benefits of federal regulations, which is methodologically challenging due to varying methods and quality of studies. Some doubt the accuracy of total regulatory costs and benefits measurement. Advocacy reported $255.3 million in regulatory cost savings for small businesses in FY2018. The Office of Economic Research gathers data on small businesses' impact on the economy, including credit availability, regulation effects, and entrepreneurship factors. Advocacy conducts research on small businesses, including factors influencing entrepreneurship and innovation. They provide state economic profiles, firm size data, and quarterly economic bulletins. Advocacy provides research on small businesses, including economic profiles, firm size data, quarterly economic bulletins, research projects, fact sheets, issue briefs, and funding for business data generation. Advocacy provides research on small businesses, including economic profiles, firm size data, quarterly economic bulletins, research projects, and funding for business data generation. They publish newsletters and an annual report on small businesses' status in the national economy, along with various research reports and forums for economists and researchers to discuss key economic topics. Advocacy engages in outreach activities related to its role with the RFA, participating in small business advocacy review panels and sponsoring roundtable discussions, conferences, and symposia for small business owners to share their views on regulatory issues. They also interact directly with small businesses, trade associations, governors, and state legislatures to educate them about regulatory flexibility benefits. Advocacy's regional advocates work closely with Regional Fairness Boards to develop information for the SBA's National Ombudsman and alert businesses about regulatory proposals. The Chief Counsel meets with business organizations, trade associations, and participates in roundtable discussions and conferences. Advocacy's economists provide economic presentations at various events and participated in 523 outreach events in FY2018. Advocacy's responsibilities expanded during the 115th Congress with the passing of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017. The bill aimed to increase Advocacy's authority by enhancing requirements for federal agency notification to the Chief Counsel, expanding the use of small business advocacy review panels, and empowering the Chief Counsel to issue rules governing federal agency compliance with the RFA. Advocates argue for expanding Advocacy's authority under the RFA to reduce regulatory burdens on small entities, enhance job creation, and hasten economic recovery amidst concerns of excessive federal regulation. Expanding the Office of Advocacy's authority under the RFA is advocated to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses, promote job creation, and improve economic growth. Critics argue that the lack of a uniform definition for terms like significant economic impact hinders consistent compliance with the RFA across federal agencies. Opponents of expanding Advocacy's authority under the RFA argue that the proposed provisions are part of an \"ongoing attack on federal regulation\" disguised as pro-small business rhetoric. They claim that these provisions are based on false premises, threaten public health and safety, impose additional duties on agencies without providing resources, and give industry more opportunities to delay or defeat rulemakings. Critics also argue that these provisions do not alleviate the burden on small entities complying with regulations. The bill does not offer assistance to small entities through subsidies, loans, or tax benefits. It instead strengthens the power of the SBA's Office of Advocacy and professional lobbyists in Washington. The Office of Advocacy faces challenges as an independent office within the SBA. The Office of Advocacy within the SBA faces challenges due to its size relative to the SBA, budgetary process, and turnover of Chief Counsels, impacting its role as the definitive voice for small businesses. The Office of Advocacy within the SBA has faced challenges due to turnover of Chief Counsels, impacting its role as the definitive voice for small businesses. Chief Counsels leave office for various reasons, such as a change in Administration or for more lucrative positions in the private sector. One of Advocacy's primary functions is to monitor and report on federal agency compliance with the RFA, but the lack of clarity in key terms makes it difficult for Advocacy to fulfill its role effectively. The lack of clarity in key terms under the RFA hinders Advocacy's ability to determine agency compliance and train federal regulatory officials. Congress has been urged to clarify these terms, but the RFA's original authors intentionally left them vague to allow agencies discretion. Advocacy faces criticism for not being more aggressive in preventing federal regulations, especially from those opposed to regulations on environmental issues and health care reform. Advocacy faces challenges in determining agency compliance with the RFA due to vague terms intentionally left by the original authors. It is criticized for not being more aggressive in preventing federal regulations, especially from those opposed to regulations on environmental issues and health care reform. The limited budget restricts its ability to produce economic research on small businesses and engage in outreach activities not directly related to its RFA role. The Office of Advocacy operates independently within a larger federal agency with a similar mission."
