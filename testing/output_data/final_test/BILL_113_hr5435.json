The Medicare Home Infusion Site of Care Act of 2014 acknowledges that the Medicare program does not provide comprehensive coverage of home infusion therapy, leading to challenges for patients and physicians in accessing cost-effective and convenient care settings. The Medicare program could save money by covering home infusion therapy, as private payers have found it to be cost-effective and of high quality. Medicare coverage of home infusion therapy is being amended under Section 1861 of the Social Security Act to include home infusion therapy as a defined service. The term 'home infusion therapy' refers to items and services provided to an individual under a physician's care in the individual's home by a qualified supplier.

The Secretary will establish a per diem payment schedule for home infusion therapy services, supplies, and equipment to ensure Medicare beneficiaries have reasonable access to therapy while complying with state and federal laws and quality standards.

The Social Security Act now covers infusion drugs, which are parenteral drugs or biologicals administered through access devices, including drugs for catheter maintenance, additives like vitamins and minerals, and components for home infusion therapy. SEC. 5. ENSURING BENEFICIARY ACCESS TO HOME INFUSION THERAPY. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement the Medicare home infusion therapy benefit to ensure timely access for beneficiaries. Coordination between drug coverage and home infusion therapy services will be seamless to prevent duplicative claims. The implementation will aim for practicality and minimal administrative burden for all involved parties. The Secretary will consider using consolidated claims for part D drugs and part B services to ensure efficient operation of the benefit. Prior authorization processes must be quick to provide meaningful access to home infusion therapy. Medical necessity determinations will be made by Medicare administrative contractors or Medicare Advantage organizations for individuals enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. The organization offering the home infusion therapy plan must ensure timely access for Medicare beneficiaries. A report on Medicare beneficiary access to home infusion therapy is due by January 1, 2018, to Congress.
