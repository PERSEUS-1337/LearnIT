Additionally, it defines terms such as Secretary, serious incident, and what constitutes a serious incident. The curr_chunk states the establishment of a branch of detention services. The Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act is amended to establish a Branch of Detention Services within the Division of Law Enforcement Services. This branch will be responsible for the detention, confinement, and corrections of offenders within Indian country, separate from routine law enforcement and criminal investigations. The Branch of Detention Services within the Division of Law Enforcement Services is responsible for police operations in Indian country. They may detain individuals for Federal prosecution, immigration, transportation, or any other detention purpose. The Secretary will establish regulations for cooperation with Indian tribes on reservations. Personnel for this branch will be designated for detention services. The Branch of Detention Services within the Division of Law Enforcement Services is responsible for police operations in Indian country. Personnel of the Branch shall be subject to the supervision and direction of law enforcement personnel or personnel of the Branch or Division, as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. They shall not be under the supervision of the Bureau Agency Superintendent or Bureau Regional Director. Cooperation with non-law enforcement entities is not precluded. The Branch of Detention Services in the Division of Law Enforcement Services oversees police operations in Indian country. Personnel are supervised by law enforcement personnel or Branch/Division personnel, not Bureau Agency Superintendent or Regional Director. Indian tribes can request the Secretary to reestablish authority after one year. The Indian tribe can request the Secretary to reestablish authority over detention of its members directly through the Agency Superintendent or Bureau Regional Office Director, instead of the Branch of Detention Services. The Secretary must approve the request unless there is good cause not to do so. SEC. 4. FUNDING. Amends Section 9 of the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act to specify that funds for the Act shall remain available until expended. SEC. 5. DETENTION REFORM AND REVIEW. Inserts a new section 10A for detention reform in the Act. Congress finds serious deficiencies in Indian country detention facilities, leading to dangerous conditions for detainees and staff. An Inspector General report in April 2004 highlighted deaths, escapes, and assaults at these facilities. Several detention facilities in Indian country have deficiencies, with the Division of Law Enforcement Services lacking clear authority for detention services. Existing Federal law lacks clear authority and standards for detention services in Indian country, which are needed to meet law enforcement and detention goals, protect life and property, and reduce crime and recidivism rates. Reporting protocols for serious incidents are required within 270 days. The Bureau must develop protocols for reporting serious incidents at detention facilities, including escapes, to law enforcement authorities within 270 days of the Indian Tribal Detention Facility Reform Act of 2004. The Division of Law Enforcement Services will conduct preliminary inquiries into these incidents to determine the need for a full investigation. The Bureau is required to report serious incidents at detention facilities to law enforcement authorities. Findings from preliminary inquiries must be reported to the Division of Law Enforcement Services and the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs. Additionally, the Bureau must review staffing needs at all detention facilities within 90 days of the Indian Tribal Detention Facility Reform Act of 2004 and update the review annually. Regulations regarding these requirements must be established within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, will create regulations to implement subsections (a) and (b) of the Indian Tribal Detention Facility Reform Act of 2004. Within 1 year of the Act's enactment, the Bureau will assess the physical conditions and needs of all detention facilities in consultation with Indian tribes. A report must be submitted to the Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations within 15 months. The Bureau will assess detention facilities in consultation with Indian tribes and submit a report to relevant committees within 15 months. Data and methodologies from the Department of Justice will be used for the assessment. The report will catalog the condition of detention facilities, including existing and proposed facilities, using accurate and timely data from various sources. It will also include methodologies from reputable architecture and engineering associations. The report will assess the need for complementary detention facilities based on factors such as size, number of detainees, facility condition, interjurisdictional needs, staff requirements, and prisoner isolation and transportation needs. It will also establish maintenance schedules and identify staffing and operational needs for each facility. The report will include a detailed plan to address staffing and operational needs, as well as cost estimates for repairing, renovating, leasing, or constructing detention facilities. It will also outline a plan to bring all facilities into compliance with applicable standards, including status updates, cost estimates, and timelines for meeting the standards. The report will assess the feasibility of developing regional detention facilities and tribal operation of these facilities under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, including cost comparisons and potential cost savings. The report will evaluate tribal operation of regional detention facilities under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, including cost comparisons and potential savings. Authorization of $500,000 is provided for this purpose."
