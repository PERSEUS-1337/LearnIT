SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act aims to enhance math and science teaching by improving teacher education and fostering collaboration between educational agencies and institutions. It defines an \"eligible partnership\" as including a State educational agency, mathematics or science department of an institution of higher education, and a local educational agency. The Act defines a \"high need local educational agency\" as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. A \"summer workshop or institute\" is a program conducted outside the academic year for a minimum of 2 weeks with direct student-faculty interaction. The Act requires follow-up training in the classroom for a minimum of 3 days during the academic year, not necessarily consecutive. For programs lasting only 2 weeks, follow-up training must exceed 3 days. Internet training is allowed for teachers in rural districts. \"Grants authorized for follow-up training in the classroom.\" The Secretary can award grants to eligible partnerships for 5 years to cover costs of authorized activities. The Federal share starts at 75% in the first year and decreases over time. The non-Federal share of costs for activities under this Act can be provided in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated. SEC. 5. APPLICATION. Each eligible partnership seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, including an assessment of teacher needs in math and science, alignment with state and local standards, and educational reform activities. The eligible partnership must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing activities based on research to improve student performance in math and science. Priority is given to partnerships including high need local educational agencies. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES. Eligible partnerships can use grant funds for activities like developing rigorous math and science curricula, providing professional development for teachers, and recruiting math and science majors into teaching with incentives like bonuses and stipends. Promoting strong teaching skills for mathematics and science teachers and educators, including integrating research-based teaching methods into the curriculum. Establishing summer workshops and training for teachers in math and science using experiment-oriented curricula. Establishing web-based instructional materials for mathematics and science teachers using experiment-oriented, content-based curricula grounded in current research. Designing programs to prepare teachers to provide professional development instruction to other teachers within their school. Creating programs to connect teachers with working scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to enhance content knowledge and instructional techniques. Developing programs focused on changing teacher behaviors to support novice teachers in gaining confidence and improving skills. Developing programs to support novice teachers in gaining confidence and improving skills to increase retention in the teaching profession and enhance teaching quality. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. Each eligible partnership receiving a grant under this Act must develop an evaluation and accountability plan with performance objectives for improving student performance in math and science, increasing student participation in advanced courses, enhancing teacher qualifications in math and science, and improving passing rates in advanced courses. Increased passing rates of students in advanced courses in mathematics and science. SEC. 8. REPORT; REVOCATION OF GRANT.\n\nEach eligible partnership must report annually to the Secretary on their progress towards meeting performance objectives. If substantial progress is not made by the end of the third year, grant payments for the fourth and fifth year will be revoked.\n\nSEC. 9. CONSULTATION WITH NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION. SEC. 9. CONSULTATION WITH NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION.\n\nThe Secretary must consult and coordinate with the National Science Foundation regarding the roles in summer workshops for improving math and science teaching in schools.\n\nSEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$500,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for the following 6 years."
