    "content": "The President can request authorization for a military humanitarian operation, which must be introduced as a joint resolution in both the Senate and the House of Representatives within 1 day. Any Member of the respective House can move to proceed to consider the resolution. The motion for a military humanitarian operation is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to amendment or reconsideration. If agreed to, the resolution remains unfinished business until disposed of. Debate on the resolution in the House of Representatives and the Senate is limited to 4 hours, divided equally between those in favor and those opposing. Further debate limitations are allowed. Amendments, postponements, considering other business, or reconsidering the vote are not permitted. After the debate, a vote on final passage is taken. The resolution allows for a single quorum call at the end of the debate, with a vote on final passage to occur within 48 hours of a formal request, unless the President waives the deadline. Appeals on procedural rulings are decided without debate.
