Regulations on the appointment and jurisdiction of a special counsel do not need approval. If regulations are disapproved, new ones must be submitted to Congress within 60 days. The Attorney General must create regulations for a special counsel, which require Congressional approval through a joint resolution. The resolution must specifically approve the regulations proposed by the Attorney General. The resolution introduced in the House or Senate must be referred to specific committees for review. If the committees do not report on the resolution within 15 days, they are discharged from further consideration. When a resolution is referred to committees, they must report on it within 15 days or be discharged. After committees report or are discharged, any Member can move to proceed to consider the resolution, with all points of order waived. The motion is privileged in the House of Representatives. The motion to proceed with the resolution is privileged in the Senate and not debatable. It cannot be amended, postponed, or considered alongside other business. Debate on the resolution is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between supporters and opponents. The final vote on the resolution must be divided equally between supporters and opponents. Limiting debate further is not allowed, and various motions such as amendments, postponements, or reconsiderations are not in order. After the debate, a vote on the resolution's final passage will take place. The final vote on the resolution must be divided equally between supporters and opponents. Appeals from the Chair's decisions on procedure shall be decided without debate. If one House receives a resolution from the other House, it will not be referred to a committee.

If one House receives a resolution from the other House, it will not be referred to a committee. The procedure in the House receiving the resolution shall be the same as if no resolution had been received from the other House, but the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution of the other House. This subsection is enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and House of Representatives, applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in each House in the case of a resolution. The procedure for a resolution in the House supersedes other rules to the extent of inconsistency. Each House has the constitutional right to change its rules regarding procedure. The table of chapters is amended to replace \"Independent Counsel\" with \"Special Counsel.\" The Attorney General must adhere to regulations regarding the operation or removal of a special counsel conducting criminal investigations. Initial regulations must be implemented within 60 days of the Act's enactment."
