    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an agency within the Department of Defense responsible for military and civil works. Its civil works mission includes improving navigation channels, reducing flood damages, and restoring aquatic ecosystems. USACE operates dams, levees, harbors, and waterways under congressional direction and oversight. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is involved in annual appropriations legislation, oversight efforts, and water resource projects with nonfederal sponsors. Congress faces the challenge of addressing the nation's water resource needs and determining USACE's role. Unlike other infrastructure funding, USACE directly plans and constructs projects using its appropriations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) primarily uses its appropriations for specific studies and construction projects authorized by Congress. This report explores the standard process for USACE water resource projects, including the role of Congress and nonfederal sponsors, as well as alternative project delivery and finance options. It covers USACE authorization legislation, project planning and construction, alternative delivery methods, and other authorities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for various water resource projects authorized by Congress, including Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs) and technical assistance. The civil works program is overseen by a civilian Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, a military Chief of Engineers, and a civilian Director of Civil Works. The agency's responsibilities are organized under eight divisions and 38 districts. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is divided into eight divisions and 38 districts, led by Army officers. The Trump Administration has shown interest in potentially removing USACE from the Department of Defense. Local interests and Members of Congress support USACE projects for economic and environmental benefits. Congress authorizes USACE projects through WRDA legislation. WRDA legislation authorizes USACE water resource studies, projects, and programs with specific categories like project studies, construction projects, and modifications. Authorizations can be project-specific, programmatic, or general, and some expire without extension. USACE can only pursue activities it is both authorized and funded to perform. Funding for USACE civil works comes from annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts. The annual appropriations for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have ranged from $4.7 billion to $7.0 billion over the last decade. More than 50% of the appropriations are now used for operation and maintenance (O&M) of USACE projects, limiting new studies and construction projects. Congress directs the funding through annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts. The US Army Corps of Engineers has a $98 billion backlog of construction projects awaiting funding, exceeding the agency's appropriations. Congress authorizes more work than can be completed with the annual construction funding of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Numerous projects remain unfunded, with hundreds of authorized studies lacking funding. Only a few new studies are funded each year, with six new studies initiated using FY2019 appropriations. Congress has authorized multiple Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) since 1986, with the most recent being in 2007. Delays in enacting new WRDAs were due to challenges in developing omnibus water authorization bills and increased scrutiny on earmarks. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) addressed concerns related to earmarks by authorizing 34 construction projects with agency review and Chief of Engineers reports. It also established a new process for identifying nonfederal interest in USACE studies and projects. Congress mandated the Secretary of the Army to submit an annual report on potential projects to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The Section 7001 process involves submitting study and project authorization proposals to Congress for consideration. The Assistant Secretary of the Army delivers an annual report to Congress, with the next call for submissions expected in May 2019. Submissions for the annual report are accepted until August 20, with the report expected to be delivered to authorizing committees in mid-2019. The next call for submissions is expected to open in May 2019 for the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) legislation. Congress enacted WRDA 2016 and America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which authorized new studies and construction projects based on Section 7001 reports and Chief's reports. The 116th Congress may consider WRDA legislation, with deliberations influenced by various factors. The upcoming WRDA legislation deliberations in the 116th Congress may be influenced by policy proposals, congressional policies on earmarks, and infrastructure initiatives. Congress will have access to various reports, including Section 7001 reports, Chief's reports, and a report required by Section 1002 of WRRDA 2014, which tracks the progress of USACE feasibility studies. At the beginning of FY2019, there were around 100 active feasibility studies being conducted by USACE. In addition to feasibility studies, Congress may receive various reports recommending actions such as modifying authorized projects, reevaluating constructed projects, and deauthorizing projects no longer serving their intended purposes. Reports from entities like GAO, Inspector Generals, and advocacy groups can also influence congressional deliberations. The Trump Administration proposed moving civil works activities from the Department of Defense to the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Interior for consolidation. The conference report accompanying the USACE appropriations for FY2019 opposes the proposed reorganization to consolidate USACE civil works missions with the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Interior. It highlights potential detrimental impacts on the Civil Works program and non-federal entities relying on the Corps' expertise. Legislation would be required for such a reorganization, which has not been proposed or requested to date. The USACE's central civil works responsibilities include supporting coastal and inland commercial navigation, reducing flood and storm damage, and protecting aquatic ecosystems. Additional project benefits may include water supply, hydropower, recreation, and wildlife enhancement. USACE also has regulatory responsibilities for issuing permits related to navigation and wetlands. Additionally, USACE participates in emergency response activities under the National Response Framework. The Trump Administration has focused on reforming USACE civil works to accelerate project delivery, transform financing, and improve regulatory processes. This includes efforts to revolutionize infrastructure project regulation, funding, delivery, and maintenance. For more details on USACE projects delivery and financing options, refer to the \"Standard Project Delivery Process\" and \"Alternative Project Delivery and Innovative Finance\" sections. In WRDA 2018, Congress enacted provisions supporting project delivery and budgeting improvements. Section 1102 required a study on USACE's mission and potential transfers of functions. Section 1103 focused on economic and budgetary analyses. The legislation in WRDA 2018 requires a study on USACE's economic principles and methods for water resource projects. The study must be completed within two years of enactment. USACE typically leads the study, design, and construction of authorized projects, with nonfederal sponsors sharing costs and providing land. Since the 1950s, the sharing of costs and responsibilities for USACE projects has been a topic of debate. Congress established the current arrangement in the 1980s, with adjustments in subsequent legislation. Congressional authorization and appropriations are crucial for project delivery, following a standard process involving study authorization, feasibility study, construction authorization, and preconstruction engineering and design. The US Army Corps of Engineers can start preconstruction engineering and design before receiving construction authorization if funds are available. Congress authorizes construction in legislation like WRDA, but appropriations are necessary for studies and construction. Nonfederal sponsors are required to share costs for most water resource projects, with responsibilities for funding studies, construction, and operation and maintenance. Flood risk reduction and ecosystem restoration projects may be transferred to nonfederal owners after completion. The US Army Corps of Engineers oversees water resource projects, with nonfederal sponsors sharing costs. Projects can involve federal, state, tribal, or local agencies, and sometimes private entities. Project delivery can be lengthy due to congressional authorization and funding availability. The US Army Corps of Engineers conducts feasibility studies for water resource projects to determine federal interest in construction. Congressional authorization and appropriations are required to initiate studies, with projects planned at the district level and approved at higher levels within USACE. Nonfederal entities may share project costs and responsibilities. The US Army Corps of Engineers conducts feasibility studies for water resource projects to determine federal interest in construction. If USACE recommends proceeding and a nonfederal sponsor is willing to contribute, a feasibility study begins with costs split between USACE and the sponsor. The study aims to recommend solutions to the water resource problem, including alternative plans, engineering feasibility, benefit-cost analyses, and environmental impact assessments under NEPA. The evaluation of USACE water resource projects is guided by the 1983 Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Implementation Studies and policy direction from WRDA bills. Feasibility studies aim to determine if a project merits further federal investment, with a focus on national economic development while protecting the environment. The Assistant Secretary of the Army has the authority to approve the tentatively preferred plan that maximizes economic development while safeguarding the environment. The Assistant Secretary of the Army has the authority to grant exceptions and recommend plans other than the NED plan for USACE water resource projects. The nonfederal sponsor may support a locally preferred plan (LPP) instead, with the nonfederal entity responsible for the cost difference between the LPP and the NED plan. The Chief of Engineers signs a recommendation known as the Chief's report, which is submitted to congressional committees and reviewed by the Assistant Secretary of the Army and the Office of Management and Budget. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) begins preconstruction engineering and design (PED) of a project after the Chief's report is completed. PED includes finalizing the project's design, preparing construction plans, and drafting construction contracts. The duration of PED is typically two years, depending on the project's size and complexity. Costs for PED are shared between federal and nonfederal sponsors based on the cost-share arrangement for the construction phase. Once the project receives congressional construction authorization, federal funds for construction are sought in the annual appropriations process. USACE typically functions as the project manager during construction, with physical construction contracted out to private engineering and construction contractors. Post-construction ownership and operations responsibilities vary depending on the type of project. The cost-share responsibilities for construction and O&M vary by project purpose, as shown in Table 2. WRDA 1986 increased local cost-share requirements; some subsequent WRDAs further adjusted cost sharing. Deviation from standard cost-sharing arrangements for individual projects is infrequent and typically requires specific authorization by Congress. If project features or estimated costs change significantly, additional congressional authorization may be necessary. If costs change significantly for a USACE civil works project, additional congressional authorization may be required. WRDA typically authorizes significant modifications, while less significant changes may not need additional authorization. Section 902 of WRDA 1986 allows for up to a 20% increase in project costs without extra authorization. Nonfederal entities must obtain permission from USACE for alterations to projects after construction, as per Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Section 408, also known as Section 408 based on its codification at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7408, allows the Secretary of the Army to grant permission for alterations or use of public works if it won't harm public interest. USACE conducts a technical review for proposed alterations' effects on projects, which may be required for both USACE and nonfederal projects. USACE can approve or deny permission with attached conditions. Section 408 allows the Secretary of the Army to grant permission for alterations or use of public works without harming public interest. Most USACE construction projects are not time limited, and deauthorization processes are in place for unconstructed projects. The oldest deauthorization authority requires the Secretary of the Army to annually transmit a list of projects not funded in the last five fiscal years, with projects not funded for planning, design, or construction being deauthorized. WRDA 2018 created a one-time process for project deauthorization. Section 1301 of WRDA 2018 and WRDA 2016 established one-time processes to deauthorize unconstructed projects deemed no longer viable for construction. This includes projects authorized before WRDA 2007 and those with federal costs over $10 billion. WRDA 2018 also mandates automatic deauthorization for projects without funding obligations. Section 1301 of WRDA 2018 and WRDA 2016 established processes to deauthorize unconstructed projects deemed unviable for construction, including those authorized before WRDA 2007 and with federal costs over $10 billion. WRDA 2018 mandates automatic deauthorization for projects without funding obligations after 10 years of enactment. USACE has not clarified how these authorities will be coordinated, and a separate divestiture process is used for disposing of constructed projects or real property interests. Some USACE divestitures require congressional deauthorization, with limited historical divestitures for projects no longer serving their purpose. WRDA legislation allows for deauthorization of unconstructed and constructed projects. There is no formal process for nonfederal entities to propose deauthorization of constructed projects. The Secretary of the Army annually lists incomplete authorized studies for potential deauthorization. The Secretary of the Army is required to transmit a list of incomplete authorized studies to Congress annually. If funds are not appropriated within 90 days, the study is deauthorized. WRRDA 2014 mandates automatic deauthorization of feasibility studies incomplete for 10 years. USACE is reviewing 5,600 study authorities for potential deauthorization due to delays in project completion. Nonfederal entities are frustrated with project delays impacting water resource projects. Delayed completion of water resource projects can have various impacts depending on the type of project. For flood risk reduction projects, delays can prolong a community's vulnerability to floods, increasing disaster response costs. Navigation projects may see postponed transportation cost savings and increased reliance on other modes of transport. Delays in aquatic ecosystem restoration projects can result in missed opportunities for wetlands preservation and related benefits. Long project delivery times also raise concerns about potential cost increases. The 2013 report on USACE flood control projects found that cost increases were due to funding below capability level, design changes, and discrepancies in cost estimates. USACE Deputy Commanding General emphasized the impact of funding on project delivery duration. Despite interest in improving water infrastructure, concerns about increased federal expenditures persist. Competition for USACE discretionary appropriations has increased interest in alternative project delivery and innovative financing, including private financing and public-private partnerships. Congress has authorized and extended alternative ways to advance and deliver USACE studies and projects to enhance project delivery efficiency and effectiveness. Congress has expanded nonfederal funding options for USACE-led activities, allowing nonfederal entities to lead studies and projects with shared costs. WRRDA 2014 and WRDA 2016 increased authorities for nonfederal entities to undertake projects typically done by USACE, with the federal government sharing costs as if USACE had performed them. Nonfederal entities advancing water resource projects may receive credit or reimbursement subject to federal appropriations. Private sector involvement in U.S. water resource projects has increased, with nonfederal entities now able to lead projects with shared costs and access federal appropriations. WRRDA 2014 directed USACE to establish pilot programs to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. The 116th Congress may consider water resource project financing and delivery, including public-private partnerships, during discussions on USACE appropriations and broader infrastructure initiatives. Congressional appropriators directed USACE to develop its policy approach for P3 efforts in H.Rept. 115-929. Limitations on USACE entering into long-term contracts and challenges with project-specific user fees have impeded greater private-sector participation in water resource projects. The 116th Congress may consider water resource project financing and delivery, including public-private partnerships. Limitations on USACE entering into long-term contracts and challenges with project-specific user fees have impeded greater private-sector participation in water resource projects. Additional nonfederal investments under certain authorities may help progress on water resource projects, potentially freeing up federal funding for other USACE projects. However, concerns exist about reduced federal influence and challenges in obtaining federal reimbursement. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) was authorized by WRRDA 2014 to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for water projects. Modeled after the TIFIA program for transportation projects, WIFIA involves both USACE and EPA, with EPA's program already operational and USACE's program still in development. USACE is authorized to provide WIFIA support for various project types like flood damage reduction and storm damage. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) was authorized by WRRDA 2014 to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for water projects, including flood damage reduction, storm damage, environmental restoration, and navigation improvement projects. WRRDA 2014 set project selection criteria for USACE WIFIA funding, with WRDA 2018 amending the authorization of appropriations. WRDA 2018 added $50 million for EPA Administrator for FY2020 and FY2021. Congressional appropriations are required for administrative and subsidy costs of WIFIA implementation. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) was authorized to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for water projects. EPA has developed regulations for its WIFIA program and is implementing it, while USACE has not advanced its program sufficiently. Congress has directed USACE to continue developing its WIFIA proposals, but funding has not been requested for USACE's WIFIA in recent years. The FY2020 request did not include funding for USACE's WIFIA. USACE has authorities for small projects, technical assistance, emergency actions, and municipal water projects. They also work on a reimbursable basis for other agencies. These authorities are known as Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs) and do not require specific congressional study or appropriations. USACE's Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs) do not require specific congressional study or appropriations. Once funded, CAP projects generally take three years from feasibility phase initiation to construction completion. Congress has limited the project size and scope for most CAP authorities. WRRDA 2014 mandates the publication of prioritization criteria and an annual report for CAPs. USACE has general authorities for technical assistance in water resources planning and floodplain management. USACE has general authorities for technical assistance in water resources planning and floodplain management, including support for public works and engineering during disasters. They do not need project-specific authority for activities listed in Table 4, and may be tasked with response and recovery activities funded through the Disaster Relief Fund. Coordination is done under the National Response Framework. USACE provides emergency response and disaster assistance, including clearing debris and stabilizing damaged structures. They have their own emergency response authority under P.L. 84-99, allowing them to coordinate contaminated debris management with EPA. USACE has authority for emergency response and disaster assistance, including flood control works, shore protection, emergency dredging, and rescue operations. Funding for these activities is typically provided through supplemental appropriations or by transferring money from ongoing projects. In P.L. 84-99, Congress authorized USACE to rehabilitate damaged flood control works and federally constructed hurricane or shore protection projects through the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP). To be eligible for assistance, projects must be in active status and maintained properly. RIP currently includes around 1,100 projects with 14,000 miles of levees and 33 dams. For locally constructed projects, 80% of repair costs are covered by federal funds. Since 1992, Congress has authorized USACE assistance for municipal water and wastewater projects, including treatment facilities. Repair costs for federally constructed projects are split 80% federal and 20% owner responsibility. USACE determines repair eligibility based on benefit-cost ratio, with local sponsors covering rehabilitation costs for deficient maintenance. Nonfederal sponsors can increase protection levels by paying for additional measures. USACE provides environmental infrastructure assistance for projects like recycling and desalination plants, stormwater collection, and water distribution. Assistance is authorized under Section 219 of WRDA 1992, with cost sharing typically set at 75%. USACE environmental infrastructure assistance requires cost sharing, typically at 75% federal and 25% nonfederal. Congress has authorized over 300 projects with appropriations totaling more than $5 billion. WRRDA 2014 and subsequent WRDA acts expanded authorizations for environmental infrastructure activities. Congress has regularly included USACE environmental infrastructure funds in appropriations bills, providing $50 million in FY2015, $55 million in FY2016 and FY2017, $70 million in FY2018, and $77 million in FY2019. These funds are part of additional funding provided by Congress, and the Administration directs their use based on guidance in the appropriations bill and accompanying reports. Environmental infrastructure assistance activities are identified in the agency's work plan for the fiscal year, typically available within two months after appropriations. Funds have been used for ongoing assistance, not subject to USACE planning processes but are subject to federal laws like NEPA. USACE may also perform work for other entities on a reimbursable basis. USACE provides engineering and contracting expertise for various departments and agencies, executing reimbursable work consistent with their core technical expertise and national interest. This includes projects like remediation of contaminated sites for the EPA and border barrier construction for DHS. USACE's work is guided by broad authorities and is not subject to their planning processes but federal laws like NEPA. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has broad authorities under various acts and agency-specific authorities like the Chief's Economy Act. Their civil responsibilities include navigation projects such as river deepening and flood control projects like levees and dams. USACE projects are often multipurpose, providing water supply, recreation, and hydropower in addition to navigation or flood control. Their environmental activities focus on wetlands and aquatic ecosystem restoration. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for wetlands and aquatic ecosystem restoration, environmental mitigation, and issuing permits for private actions affecting navigation and waters of the United States. The agency's civil works mission began in the 19th century with a focus on navigation and flood control, including projects like river deepening and levees. Congress directed USACE to regulate obstructions of navigable waters and incorporate hydropower into multipurpose projects. The Flood Control Acts of 1928, 1936, 1944, and 1950 authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake flood control projects and emergency operations, marking the modern era of federal flood control. The Water Supply Act of 1958 gave USACE authority over reservoirs. The Water Supply Act of 1958 authorized USACE to include reservoir storage for water supply at nonfederal cost. From 1970 to 1985, Congress made changes to water projects, passed laws for environmental protection, and expanded USACE's regulatory responsibilities. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a71344) and executive orders (E.O. 11988 and E.O. 11990) aimed to reduce flood losses and environmental damage by recognizing wetlands' value. Dam failures in the 1970s led to the development of federal dam safety framework, with USACE playing a key role in the National Inventory of Dams. The 1986 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA 1986) changed funding rules for USACE water projects, giving nonfederal stakeholders more financial and decision-making roles. WRDA 1990 expanded USACE's mission to include environmental protection and hazardous waste management. WRDA 1992 authorized USACE to use dredged materials for habitat restoration. WRDA 1996 gave USACE limited authority for aquatic ecosystem restoration projects, with WRDA 2000 approving a multiyear, multibillion-dollar restoration program for the Florida Everglades. USACE's activities have expanded to include infrastructure rehabilitation, maintenance, and protection, as well as significant flood-related disaster response and recovery efforts post-Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and the 2017 hurricane season. WRDA 2007 included provisions to enhance levee safety. USACE's flood control activities have shifted towards flood risk management and resilience. Congressional appropriations for natural disaster response have increased attention on USACE's role in emergency response and infrastructure repair. WRDA 2007 expanded ecosystem restoration efforts, including projects in coastal Louisiana and the Upper Mississippi River. WRDA 2014, 2016, and 2018 aimed to improve project delivery efficiency and increase nonfederal participation in financing. The appendix provides an overview of omnibus U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) authorization legislation from 1986 to 2016, including various Water Resource Development Acts (WRDA) from 1986 to 1992. The table lists various Water Resource Development Acts (WRDA) from 1988 to 2018, along with the titles used in the bills and the agencies or departments associated with the provisions. The titles are categorized as primarily related to USACE civil works or other agencies/departments. The table categorizes Water Resource Development Acts (WRDA) from 1988 to 2018 based on the agencies or departments associated with the provisions. USACE was the focus of most titles, except for WIIN and AWIA 2018. Some titles, like WRDA 1992 and WRRDA 2014, had provisions related to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alongside USACE activities. The WRDA acts from 1988 to 2018 focused mainly on USACE, with some provisions related to EPA in WRDA 1992 and WRRDA 2014. WRDA 1986 resolved disputes on USACE authorizations, while WIIN included titles on water programs across various agencies. The WRDA acts from 1988 to 2018 focused mainly on USACE, resolving disputes related to cost sharing, user fees, and environmental requirements. Biennial consideration of USACE authorization legislation resumed after WRDA 1986 to avoid delays in project planning and execution. WRDA enactment was inconsistent due to controversial project authorizations and disagreements over USACE operations. The 110th Congress overrode a presidential veto to enact WRDA 2007. Between WRDA 2007 and WRRDA 2014, no WRDA bill was enacted. WRDA 2016 returned USACE authorization legislation to a biennial schedule. WRRDA 2014 and WRDA 2016 aimed to involve nonfederal entities in project development and financing. WRRDA 2014 authorized 34 construction projects, totaling $15.6 billion in federal appropriations. WRDA 2016 authorized new USACE water resource studies and projects, including 30 new construction projects at a federal cost of over $10 billion. It also included provisions for nonfederal sponsors to participate in financing water infrastructure activities. For more information on WRDA 2016 and other titles of WIIN, refer to CRS In Focus IF10536, Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN). The 115th Congress enacted America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 (AWIA 2018, P.L. 115-270) in October 2018, which included the Water Resources Development Act of 2018 (WRDA 2018) focusing on USACE activities and dam and levee safety programs. WRDA 2018 authorized 12 new construction projects at a total cost of $5.6 billion. WRDA 2018 expanded programmatic authorization levels by 25%, amended deauthorization efforts, and established a process to deauthorize $4 billion in construction projects. It also required various reports from USACE and the National Academy of Sciences."
