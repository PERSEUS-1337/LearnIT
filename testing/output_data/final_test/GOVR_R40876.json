    "content": "The Social Security Administration administers two programs providing cash benefits to persons with disabilities: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Both programs have the same definition of disability, based on inability to work. State Disability Determination Services (DDS) make determinations of disability for both programs in accordance with federal laws and regulations. State DDS agencies play two roles in the SSDI and SSI programs by making initial determinations of disability status for applicants. DDS agencies determine disability status for program applicants and conduct reviews for program participants. In FY2008, over 3.6 million initial determinations and reviews were processed. When applying for SSDI or SSI benefits, the SSA first assesses non-disability requirements before forwarding the application to the claimant's state DDS for disability determination. The DDS is authorized to purchase additional medical and vocational evidence to determine disability status for program applicants. Applicants denied benefits can request a reconsideration by the DDS or appeal to an ALJ. SSDI and SSI recipients undergo continuing disability reviews by the DDS to assess ongoing eligibility. Children receiving SSI benefits are subject to redeterminations at age 18. Children receiving SSI benefits are subject to redeterminations of their eligibility at age 18, transitioning to the adult definition of disability. The DDS, authorized under the Social Security Act, conducts these redeterminations. States can choose to operate their own DDS or have the SSA administer it for them. Currently, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico manage their own DDS. Each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico operate their own Disability Determination Services (DDS) as required by the Social Security Act. The Commissioner of Social Security establishes regulations outlining performance standards and administrative requirements for accurate and prompt disability determinations. States must provide the necessary structure, personnel, medical consultants, and quality assurance to comply with federal regulations and SSA guidance. The Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state operate under provisions in the Social Security Act and federal regulations. DDS employees are state employees, allowing states to set their own policies on salaries and benefits. Despite state autonomy, federal requirements such as equal employment opportunity, hiring guidelines, and travel restrictions apply to all DDS agencies. The Social Security Act and regulations do not prohibit states from implementing personnel actions like furloughs or hiring freezes for DDS employees. While there are guidelines to facilitate disability claims processing, states have autonomy as long as they comply with federal statutes, regulations, and SSA guidance. The SSA allows states to make personnel decisions for DDS employees, such as furloughs or hiring freezes. States are fully reimbursed by the SSA for all DDS expenses, totaling over $1.8 billion in FY2008. Each state has an agreement with the Treasury Department for reimbursement, governed by federal regulations. States receive funds from SSA for DDS expenditures, subject to federal regulations and OMB Circular A-87. DDS employees may face personnel actions like furloughs or RIFs to reduce costs. States argue against exempting DDS workers from statewide actions. States argue that exempting DDS employees from statewide furloughs or personnel actions could be unfair and administratively challenging due to funding sources and collective bargaining agreements. As of October 15, 2009, 13 states had implemented or announced statewide furloughs affecting DDS agencies and employees. As of October 15, 2009, 13 states had implemented or announced statewide furloughs affecting DDS agencies and employees. Among these states, Colorado, Illinois, and Maryland exempt all DDS employees from furloughs, while California and Hawaii have announced RIFs but exempt DDS employees. Hiring freezes may reduce overall DDS capacity if employees cannot be replaced. The attrition rate for DDS disability examiners was 12.5% in FY2008, projected to be 9.8% in FY2009. 25 states had hiring freezes, with 19 exempting DDS agencies. Some states implemented personnel actions that could reduce DDS capacity. In 20 states, personnel actions like hiring limitations, pay freezes, and early retirement incentives are being implemented, with DDS agencies exempt in nine states. These actions could impact DDS operations, but cost savings are unlikely as expenses are covered by the SSA. Furloughs and personnel actions may negatively affect SSDI and SSI programs and states, as noted by Commissioner of Social Security Michael Astrue and Vice President Joseph Biden in 2009. In 2009, Commissioner of Social Security Michael Astrue and Vice President Joseph Biden urged state governors not to furlough DDS employees to avoid limiting DDS capacity for processing disability applications. The SSA projects a significant increase in SSDI and SSI applications, making it crucial to maintain DDS capacity. The SSA OIG estimates that a two-day furlough in California would result in 2,375 initial disability determinations and reconsiderations not being performed, delaying over $648,000 in SSDI and SSI benefits to 776 approved claimants. The SSA OIG estimates that a two-day furlough in California would delay SSDI and SSI benefits to 776 approved claimants with severe illnesses and disabilities. The furlough would impact the processing of Compassionate Allowance cases and CDRs, leading to delays in benefit payments. Delays in processing CDRs could lead to longer wait times for SSDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients, adding to the backlog and potentially paying benefits to those no longer eligible. States may lose federal funding and economic purchasing power if furloughs or personnel actions affect DDS employees. Applicants may turn to other social programs if benefits are delayed. Delays in processing benefit payments could lead to increased reliance on social programs like TANF, SNAP, and UI. DDS employees facing layoffs may also seek UI benefits, causing a loss in tax revenue for states."
