    "content": "Department of Defense (DOD) benefits for survivors of deceased members of the armed forces vary significantly in purpose and structure, providing immediate cash payments like the death gratuity and lump sum payments from Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI). Long-term monthly income is offered through benefits like Veterans Affairs Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) and Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). Congress directed the Administration to assess and recommend enhanced benefits for deceased members of the armed forces in the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The Department of Defense proposed increasing death benefit payments for families of U.S. servicemembers killed in combat zones, doubling the cash survivors can receive to $500,000. The proposed increase would be retroactive to October 2001 for troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, costing an estimated $280 million in retroactive payments. The President included these increases in the FY2005 Supplemental Appropriations request, raising the Death Gratuity to $100,000 and the SGLI to $400,000 for those who die from wounds, injuries, or illness. The Death Gratuity and SGLI benefits were increased to $100,000 and $400,000 respectively for combat-related deaths. These changes were made permanent for active duty deaths by Public Law 109-163 in 2006. Additionally, benefits for survivors of retired service members were increased by P.L. 110-118. Various death benefits are available to certain survivors of Armed Forces members who die on active duty. In FY 2004, a tax-free lump sum of $12,420 was paid by DOD to assist survivors of deceased armed forces members. Some benefits, like SBP and DIC, may offset each other. Calculating benefits involves multiple variables, making each case unique. The Death Gratuity is a tax-free lump sum paid by DOD to eligible survivors of deceased military personnel. In FY2004, it was increased to $100,000 for deaths in combat zones or combat-related activities. This increase was retroactive to October 7, 2001, and additional payments were scheduled to end on September 30, 2005. Public Law 109-77 extended the Death Gratuity benefits. On January 6, 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 permanently increased the Death Gratuity for servicemembers who die on active duty, retroactive to October 7, 2001. Beneficiaries are designated in order of eligibility, with the surviving spouse first, followed by children, and others if designated by the service member. The Death Gratuity benefit for service members can be designated to other beneficiaries besides the recipient under law. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 expanded the list of eligible beneficiaries to include individuals designated in writing, surviving spouse, children, parents, executor/administrator of the estate, and other next of kin. The Death Gratuity benefit for service members can be designated to other beneficiaries besides the recipient under law. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 expanded the list of eligible beneficiaries to include individuals designated in writing, surviving spouse, children, parents, executor/administrator of the estate, and other next of kin. The provision also addresses the need for pre-deployment counseling on survivor benefits and directs the Secretary of Defense to review such counseling. Social Security provides income and security to covered employees and their families, including active duty military personnel since 1957. Survivor benefits are available to widows, widowers, and dependent children of deceased retirees, with average monthly benefits ranging from $691 to $742. Benefits are first payable at age 60, or earlier if the surviving spouse is disabled or has children under 16. The survivor benefit is payable to a dependent unmarried child under age 18, a full-time student under age 19, or a disabled person over 18 with a disability before age 22. A surviving widow with one child receives an average monthly benefit of $1,433. Members of the uniformed services are automatically insured for $250,000 under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance at a cost of $0.65 per $10,000 of coverage per month. As of November 2004, only 8.4% of active duty servicemen declined full coverage of SGLI. The SGLI was increased to $400,000 for combat-related deaths at no extra cost. Members with spouses need spousal consent to opt for less coverage. Unmarried members opting for less coverage will have their next of kin or beneficiary notified. The FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act funded an increase in SGLI coverage, with increments raised to $50,000. H.R. 3200 repealed previous legislation, permanently increasing coverage to $400,000 and replacing 'spousal consent' with 'spousal notification' for opting for less coverage. Unmarried servicemembers will have their designated next of kin or beneficiary notified. H.R. 3200 makes the increase in SGLI coverage from $10,000 to $50,000 permanent for unmarried servicemembers. The change is retroactive to October 7, 2001, except for non-qualifying deaths between May 11, 2005, and September 1, 2005. There may be reconsideration regarding this oversight. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 expanded SGLI coverage for service members in OEF or OIF to $400,000, with premiums of $0.07 per $1,000 coverage. The Secretary of Defense has permissive authority to cover up to an additional $250,000 in SGLI coverage for those in OEF or OIF. The VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits provide payment to surviving dependents of deceased military members, serving as reparation for the death and replacing lost family income. DIC benefits are integrated with the Survivor Benefit Plan, resulting in a reduction in SBP benefits dollar-for-dollar. The DIC benefit is $1,091 per month for the surviving spouse, $271 per month for each child, and an additional $250 per month for two years for children under 18. Benefits can be terminated upon remarriage of the surviving spouse. The VA Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits provide payment to surviving dependents of deceased military members, serving as reparation for the death and replacing lost family income. DIC benefits are integrated with the Survivor Benefit Plan, resulting in a reduction in SBP benefits dollar-for-dollar. Additional benefits may be provided to a spouse if they meet certain criteria, and surviving parents may also be eligible for DIC benefits based on income and marital status. The purpose of the program is to ensure that the surviving dependents of military personnel who die continue to have a reasonable level of income. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) now covers survivors of military personnel who die while on active duty since September 10, 2001. The annuity for active duty members is based on assumed total disability retirement eligibility. Surviving spouses receive 55% of the member's disability retired pay if under 62, and 40% if 62 or older. Benefits for survivors aged 62 and over were reduced due to the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) covers survivors of military personnel who die on active duty since September 10, 2001. Benefits for survivors aged 62 and over were reduced due to the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act, with a phased-out reduction in benefits by April 1, 2008. Monthly disability pay is calculated based on the member's years of service and percentage disability, capped at 75% of base pay. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides benefits to survivors of military personnel who die on active duty. The SBP benefit is calculated as 55% of the retired pay the member would have received. If a survivor is eligible for both SBP and DIC benefits, the SBP benefit is reduced dollar-for-dollar by any DIC benefits received. Surviving spouses can designate their children as SBP beneficiaries to avoid this offset. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows survivors of military personnel who die on active duty to receive benefits. Children can be designated as SBP beneficiaries to avoid offsetting benefits. Changes in eligibility and effective dates have been made over the years, with the latest update in 2007. Surviving spouses lose SBP eligibility if they remarry before age 55. Efforts to repeal the SBP/DIC offset have been included in legislation but have not been successful. The Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 aimed to repeal the SBP/DIC offset, but the language was dropped by the Conference Committee. Instead, a survivor indemnity allowance was enacted for survivors of service members entitled to retired pay. The monthly allowance of $50 would increase by $10 each year through FY2013 to provide cash assistance for military personnel to obtain civilian housing. The BAH housing benefits for military personnel with dependents or are single vary based on annual surveys of housing costs in metropolitan areas. P.L. 109-163 extended these benefits to 365 days and allowed surviving spouses and dependent children to move once at Government expense. Additionally, the period for selecting a residence for travel and transportation allowances was increased to three years after the death of the member. The purpose of providing military health care benefits is to ensure medical care availability for uniformed services members and their dependents during national emergencies, incentivize armed forces personnel to stay in service, and support professional training programs for military physicians and dentists. Unremarried surviving spouses and minor children of deceased military personnel are eligible for these benefits with certain limitations. Surviving family members of deceased active duty servicemembers are eligible for TRICARE benefits at active duty dependent rates for three years, then at retiree dependent rates. Spouses remain eligible for TRICARE benefits for life if they do not remarry, while unmarried dependents are eligible until age 21 (or 23 if a full-time student). Eligibility can be extended for dependents with disabilities. P.L. 109-163 expanded survivor benefits under TRICARE dental plan to include active duty spouses of deceased members. The purpose of providing TRICARE benefits to surviving family members of deceased active duty servicemembers is to ensure quality services at moderate prices. Surviving spouses and dependent children are eligible for benefits, with spouses eligible for life if they do not remarry. Unmarried dependent children retain benefits until age 21 or 23 if enrolled in an educational program. Additionally, surviving spouses can use commissary and exchange stores until remarriage, while unmarried dependent children can use these privileges until age 21. Children of military members have commissary and exchange store privileges until age 21, or 23 if a full-time student. Dependents with disabilities can extend eligibility. Child and youth programs are crucial for Service families. Children of deceased military members can continue using child development facilities. Installation commanders support continued attendance for education opportunities. Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) provides education and training opportunities to eligible dependents of certain veterans, including the surviving spouse and children of a servicemember who died of a service-connected disability. This VA program offers monthly benefits for a maximum of 45 months to pay for education benefits. DEA provides education benefits for up to 45 months for degree programs, apprenticeships, and training. Surviving spouses can use benefits for 20 years, ending if remarried before 57. Benefits can be reinstated if remarriage ends. Dependent children aged 18-26 can also receive benefits for education or training. The VA provides education benefits through the Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program for children of deceased or disabled veterans. Additionally, a special Montgomery GI Bill death benefit is paid to designated survivors in the event of a service-connected death. The Federal Government is responsible for the recovery, care, and disposition of the remains of personnel who die while on active duty. The Federal Government is responsible for the recovery, care, and disposition of the remains of personnel who die while on active duty, including recovery, identification, notification of next of kin, preparation for burial, furnishing of clothing, casket or urn, hearse service, funeral director's services, and transportation of remains to the selected place for burial. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 specifies the transportation of remains of service members who die in a combat theater of operations to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware by military aircraft. It also includes provisions for an Honor Guard to accompany the remains. When a servicemember dies, the Casualty Assistance Office (CAO) notifies the next-of-kin and assists the family with funeral preparations, benefits, and compensation. The CAO provides counseling, arranges military funerals, and ensures families receive their entitled benefits. Families can access their CAO representative for support even after the servicemember's death. The Secretary can reimburse individuals for expenses paid by the United States, limited to what would have been incurred by the Secretary. Special rules apply for unrecoverable or unidentified remains, with burial in a national cemetery and military honors provided. Arlington National Cemetery is an option for those who die on active duty, with provisions for burial in other national or state veterans cemeteries varying. The Defense Department was directed to implement revisions to require military members to designate a person authorized to direct disposition of their remains. The prohibition against interment in national cemeteries was expanded to include those convicted of a capital offense or bringing discredit upon their service. The 1997 law, aimed at preventing certain individuals from being buried at Arlington National Cemetery, required the removal of Russell Wayne Wagner's remains due to his criminal conviction. Despite being an honorably discharged Vietnam veteran, Wagner was convicted of murder in 1994. His remains were removed in 2006 following protests from the victims' family. Additionally, changes were made in P.L. 109-364 regarding the transportation of remains for those who die in combat theaters of operations. The law requires a uniformed escort for the transportation of remains from Dover Air Force Base to a military airfield, with a military escort at all times. This escort consists of active duty or Ready Reserve members of the armed forces and was established on January 1, 2007. The value of death benefits for survivors depends on individual circumstances, including cost of living adjustments, eligibility changes, and tax implications. Military service benefits, including Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, are integrated with Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). Social Security benefits are excluded from examples in this report, which focuses on death benefits from the Department of Defense and Veteran Affairs. Calculating benefits based on a hypothetical situation may not represent the average benefits received by survivors of military personnel. The average benefits received by survivors of military personnel who die on active duty are difficult to quantify. An example includes a Marine Corps Corporal killed in Iraq in 2008, whose spouse could receive a $100,000 death gratuity and additional $400,000 from SGLI. The spouse may also receive $1091 per month in DIC benefits. The SBP benefit is based on the Corporal's $2,047.80 monthly base pay. The SBP benefit for a Marine Corps Corporal's surviving spouse is offset by DIC, resulting in a monthly DIC benefit of $1091. The spouse remains eligible for SBP as long as they do not remarry before age 55, with benefits subject to annual cost of living increases. If the spouse lives to 74 without remarrying, the approximate lifetime benefit from SBP/DIC can be calculated. The approximate lifetime benefit from SBP/DIC for an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with eighteen years of service who dies on active duty is $1,076,048, including Death Gratuity and SGLI. The spouse can expect to receive approximately $2,974 per month from SBP until age 62, with a reduction possible if the spouse reaches age 62 before 2008. The lifetime benefit from SBP/DIC for an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with eighteen years of service who dies on active duty is approximately $1,076,048, including Death Gratuity and SGLI. The total amount, including Death Gratuity, SGLI, and other benefits, could reach $2,070,272. It is important to note that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and may not encompass all variables that could apply in specific cases. Additional benefits such as social security, designating children as beneficiaries, and in-kind benefits like healthcare and housing could further increase the total value of benefits received. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in July 2004 comparing death benefits for military and civilian government employees. The military provides survivor benefits comparable to those of 61 civilian government entities, including Social Security payments, a death gratuity, burial expenses, and life insurance. Some government entities also provide recurring payments through retirement plans. The GAO studied death benefits for military and civilian government employees, including Social Security payments and recurring payments. Survivors of deceased servicemembers generally receive higher lump sums than survivors of deceased employees from civilian government entities. Recurring payments to deceased servicemembers' survivors exceed federal payments and those from at least half of the states, but are typically less than those from half of the cities. The military provides more types of noncash survivor benefits than civilian government entities, with some benefits being comparable and others differing. Survivors of civilian government employees in high-risk occupations may receive supplemental benefits beyond those provided to employees in general. For example, survivors of law enforcement officers and firefighters who die in the line of duty may be entitled to a lump sum payment under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act. Additionally, 34 states and 5 cities provide survivors of employees in high-risk occupations with additional cash benefits. Survivors of government employees in high-risk occupations receive additional cash benefits not available to survivors of state and city employees in general, resulting in higher payments compared to servicemembers' survivors."
