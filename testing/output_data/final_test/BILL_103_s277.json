    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National African American Museum Act\". The Congress finds that the presentation and preservation of African American life, art, history, and culture within the National Park System and other Federal entities is inadequate, restricting understanding of African American experiences and struggles. Public Law 99-511 encouraged support for a commemorative structure within the National Park System or on other Federal lands.
