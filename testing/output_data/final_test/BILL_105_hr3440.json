    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Routes to Teacher Certification Act of 1998\". The Congress acknowledges the need for over two million new teachers in the next decade due to increasing student numbers and teacher turnover. Many qualified individuals from other professions are interested in teaching. Schools struggle to recruit qualified teachers, especially in high-poverty urban and rural areas. The shortage of highly qualified teachers is a significant challenge, especially in high-poverty urban and rural areas. Minority representation in the teaching force is low, with only 13 percent being members of racial and ethnic minorities. Alternative route candidates, who make up more than one third of the teacher interns, show a preference for teaching in urban settings. Alternative routes to certification programs aim to bring diverse life experiences and high subject knowledge into the teaching profession. These programs target Federal funding to attract qualified teachers to high-need areas, focusing on subject-matter knowledge and teaching skills for new teacher-licensing policies. Alternative routes to teacher certification are addressed in Title V of the Higher Education Act of 1965 through the addition of a new part focused on partnership functions and authorization of appropriations. The purpose of this part is to improve the supply of qualified elementary and secondary school teachers by supporting partnerships and awarding grants to innovative programs that recruit, prepare, and retain individuals seeking to become licensed teachers from other occupational fields. The program aims to support partnerships and grant programs that recruit, prepare, and retain individuals seeking to become licensed teachers from other occupational fields. This includes recent college graduates with academic distinction in the subject area they plan to teach, as well as professionals transitioning into teaching from other careers. The program aims to support partnerships and grant programs to recruit, prepare, and retain individuals seeking to become licensed teachers. It encourages states to develop new teacher-licensing policies based on subject-matter knowledge and teaching skills. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, with additional funding for the following four years. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible applicants for recruiting, preparing, and retaining individuals entering teaching from another field. Grants can last up to 5 years, with a review before the 4th year for continuation. To be eligible for an award, applicants must submit an application that designates a fiscal agent, outlines a plan for developing an alternative route to a certification program, ensures high-quality recruitment and preparation of applicants, assesses teacher recruitment needs, and describes recruitment and outreach efforts. The curr_chunk describes the program's efforts to serve various types of students, including paraprofessionals, emergency certification hires, former military personnel, mid-career professionals, and returned Peace Corps or AmeriCorps volunteers. It outlines how the partnership will use funds to increase the number of effective teachers, criteria for selecting students, developing performance criteria, and implementing new teacher-licensing policies. The curr_chunk outlines teacher-licensing policies based on subject-matter knowledge, teaching skills, and performance-based examinations. It includes descriptions of support services, induction programs, and commitments from the local educational agency partner to hire qualified individuals completing the alternative certification program. The curr_chunk outlines uses of funds related to teacher-licensing policies, support services, induction programs, and commitments from local educational agencies. The curr_chunk outlines the required activities for partnerships receiving grants under this program, including developing programs to recruit and train teachers, assessing local educational agency needs, and implementing outreach and recruitment efforts. The curr_chunk outlines the goals of developing new teacher-licensing policies and an induction program to attract high quality individuals. The Secretary will evaluate programs to ensure teachers have necessary knowledge and skills, compare student outcomes between different certification programs, and assess the increase in qualified applicants to address teacher shortages in underserved areas. The term 'eligible applicant' refers to a partnership including the State agency for teacher certification, local education agencies eligible for Title I assistance, and nonprofit organizations that prepare teachers for entry into the profession. Partnerships for entry into teaching profession may involve 2-year colleges, public/private agencies in local communities. Alternative route to certification is for individuals with a bachelor's degree to obtain teacher licensure. Highly qualified individuals are those who have demonstrated proficiency. Qualified individuals are those who have demonstrated subject matter knowledge, teaching skills, and the ability to teach effectively in specific content areas. The Federal share of grant activities cannot exceed 75 percent and the non-Federal share can be provided in cash or in kind from any non-Federal source."
