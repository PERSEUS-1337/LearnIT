    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides funding for Department of the Interior agencies, the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, the EPA, arts and cultural agencies, and other entities. The appropriations laws for Interior and Related Agencies previously funded Department of Energy programs, Naval Petroleum Reserves, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These DOE programs were transferred to energy and water subcommittees, while EPA and smaller entities were moved to Interior subcommittees for funding in annual bills. The appropriations bill underwent changes due to the abolition of certain subcommittees, resulting in a reorganization of funding for agencies like the EPA. The report is structured into sections focusing on Interior agencies, EPA, other agencies, programs, and cross-cutting topics. Major agencies and issues receiving funding in the appropriations bill are discussed, including key funding details. The appropriations bill discusses key funding changes for various agencies and policy issues of interest to Congress. It is a complex process with numerous funding and programmatic changes not fully summarized in the report. For more information on specific programs funded in the bill, contact the listed policy staff members. The term appropriations in the report refers to total available funds, including regular annual allocations. The term appropriations in the report represents total available funds, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, as well as rescissions, transfers, and deferrals. The House Committee on Appropriations is the primary source of funding figures used, with other sources including the Senate Committee on Appropriations, agency budget justifications, and the Congressional Record. Funding figures in tables may not match precise totals due to rounding. Appropriations for accounts within annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations laws are available for varying periods depending on program needs. The Interior appropriations laws provide one-year appropriations for various accounts, with some accounts having appropriations for longer periods, including multiple fiscal years. Some accounts in the Interior appropriations laws have appropriations for multiple fiscal years, allowing for carryover of funds from one year to the next without a deadline for obligation. These \"no-year appropriations\" remain available until expended. The appropriation for the Fish and Wildlife Service in P.L. 112-74 provides an example of no-year appropriations, allowing funds to remain available until expended. Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, with $29.23 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies in FY2012, including a 0.16% across-the-board reduction. This marked a decrease from the FY2011 level and the President's request for FY2012. The FY2012 appropriations law included a $29.61 billion level, a $2.11 billion decrease from the President's request. The law called for rescissions to be calculated by OMB, with few increases over FY2011 for major agencies funded by the bill. Notable increases included $244.2 million for the Indian Health Service and $51.9 million for the Smithsonian Institution. The FY2012 law reduced funding for various agencies compared to FY2011 levels. Reductions included $219.1 million (3%) for the Environmental Protection Agency, $83.4 million (2%) for the Forest Service, $27.3 million (1%) for the National Park Service, and $25.3 million (2%) for the Fish and Wildlife Service. The law addressed diverse issues affecting multiple agencies and emphasized following guidance and reporting requirements outlined in the House Appropriations Committee report. The FY2012 law included a provision requiring DOI agencies, EPA, FS, and IHS to report quarterly to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on balances of appropriations, specifying uncommitted, committed, and unobligated funds. The House Appropriations Committee sought information on the source year of remaining funds to assess if appropriations exceeded needs or if administrative inefficiencies hindered fund expenditure. The FY2012 law included a provision to extend the Service First initiative, aiming to improve services and reduce costs by co-locating field offices of DOI agencies and the FS. The House Appropriations Committee requested a report on the initiative's costs, successes, and recommendations for improvement. Additionally, agencies were directed to report on actions taken to address management weaknesses and implement reforms identified by Inspectors General and the Government Accountability Office, as well as the costs of litigation related to agency actions. The House Appropriations Committee requested information on payments of attorney fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act, citing rising litigation costs and agencies spending over half of their funds on litigation. The report also included recommendations for agencies with unauthorized or expired authorizations, recommending a total appropriation of $7.25 billion for these agencies. The committee recommended a $7.25 billion appropriation for agencies with unauthorized or expired authorizations, emphasizing the need for authorizing committees to secure authorizations to avoid continual funding. Authorizing legislation establishes, continues, or modifies agencies or programs, outlining their duties, functions, and organizational structure, as well as authorizing appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee recommended downsizing and restructuring agencies to achieve economies of scale, with a focus on consolidating regional offices. DOI, EPA, FS, and IHS were directed to submit a joint proposal on office consolidation and provide staffing and funding lists in their annual budget requests. No regular FY2012 appropriations bill for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was enacted before October 1, 2011, leading to funding through continuing resolutions until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 was passed. The FY2012 funding for agencies and activities was provided through continuing appropriations laws, aiming to reduce discretionary spending to the government-wide total allowed under the Budget Control Act of 2011. A draft bill for FY2012 was released by the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, but no regular appropriations bill was enacted before October 1, 2011. The House considered H.R. 2584 for FY2012 appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, but no resolution was reached. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a bill with $27.52 billion in appropriations for FY2012, a 7% reduction from FY2011. The bill included a notable increase of $392.4 million (10%) for the Indian Health Service, but recommended decreases for other agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and National Park. The President's proposed budget for FY2012 included significant increases for various agencies, such as $554.6 million (14%) for the Indian Health Service, $290.9 million (3%) for the Environmental Protection Agency, and $280.4 million (11%) for the National Park Service. These proposed increases contrasted with the House Appropriations Committee's bill, which recommended reduced appropriations for several agencies. For FY2012, Congress debated funding and policy issues including regulatory actions, energy development, wildland fire fighting, Indian trust fund management, climate change, DOI science programs, endangered species, and agency reorganizations. Decreases in funding were proposed for various agencies, such as $93.4 million (4%) for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, $16.9 million (5%) for the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, and $16.6 million (10%) for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Other issues included funding levels for Indian Health Service construction and contract health services, wastewater/drinking water needs, and land acquisition. Among the major issues discussed in FY2012 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations hearings were Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, and Endangered Species Act funding for new species protection and critical habitat designation. The FY2012 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations hearings focused on funding for various environmental regulations, including the Endangered Species Act, EPA regulatory actions, Indian Health Service programs, and Land Acquisition for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The curr_chunk discusses the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), Outer Continental Shelf Leasing activities, reorganization of the Former Minerals Management Service, and Superfund. It addresses funding levels and regulatory issues related to energy and mineral resources development. The curr_chunk discusses funding for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, including Superfund and U.S. Geological Survey Realignment. It highlights proposed funding for hazardous waste cleanup and restructuring of science programs. Funding appropriations for FY2004-FY2012 are shown in Table 1. The FY2012 appropriations for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) saw a slight increase of $1.4 million (0.1%) compared to FY2011, totaling $1.12 billion. BLM manages public land for various uses like energy development and recreation, as well as federal mineral estate and Indian Trust lands. The FY2012 appropriation for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) increased slightly by $1.4 million (0.1%) compared to FY2011, totaling $1.12 billion. Funding for BLM accounts includes management of lands and resources for various programs like protection, recreational use, improvement, development, disposal, and general administration. The FY2012 appropriation for this account was $947.6 million, $3.2 million (0.3%) less than FY2011 but $28.1 million (3%) more than the Administration's request for FY2012. The FY2012 appropriation for range management on BLM land was $87.5 million, an increase of $10.6 million from FY2011. This increase was intended for hiring seasonal employees, completing grazing permit renewals, and monitoring grazing allotments. The House Appropriations Committee noted the program was previously underfunded and highlighted the increasing cost of grazing-related litigation. Additionally, a provision allowed for automatic renewal of BLM and Forest Service grazing permits until the renewal process is completed. The appropriation for cultural resources management was $16.1 million. The FY2012 appropriation for cultural resources management was $16.1 million, a decrease from FY2011 and the Administration's request. The funding was intended for the preservation and protection of cultural, historical, and paleontological resources, including inventory and stabilization of cultural resource sites on BLM lands. Additionally, the appropriation for recreation management was $67.6 million, below FY2011 and the Administration's request, with a focus on interpretation, visitor services, off-highway vehicle management, and travel management plans. The Alaska land conveyance program received $29.1 million, consistent with the FY2011 appropriation. The FY2012 appropriation for the Alaska land conveyance program was $29.1 million, consistent with the FY2011 level. The Administration had requested a decrease of $12.5 million from FY2011 to streamline the conveyance process. For energy and minerals management, the appropriation was $107.8 million, an increase of $17.3 million from FY2011. The differences in appropriations were primarily due to expected collections from fees for processing applications for permits to drill. The FY2012 law did not include a provision to prevent BLM and Forest Service land near the Grand Canyon from being withdrawn from development under the General Mining Law of 1872. The Secretary of the Interior had concerns about uranium mining's impact on the Grand Canyon watershed. The National Landscape Conservation System received $31.9 million in base appropriation, $7.5 million less than the Administration's request. Total funding for FY2012 was unspecified. The National Landscape Conservation System, established in 2009, includes BLM's protected areas like wilderness, national monuments, and conservation areas. The FY2012 law allocated $75.0 million for wild horse and burro management, with provisions prohibiting slaughter and sale for commercial products. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $3.6 million for BLM construction, a decrease from the previous year but in line with the Administration's request. This funding was the lowest in at least a decade, with most of the funds designated for disposal of assets and construction projects. The FY2012 appropriations law provided $22.4 million for BLM land acquisition, $0.4 million higher than FY2011 and $27.6 million below the Administration's request. Funding for land acquisition fluctuated over the past decade, ranging from $49.9 million in FY2002 to $8.6 million in FY2006 and FY2007. Money comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, proposed at $900.0 million in FY2012. The Fish and Wildlife Service manages the National Wildlife Refuge System and implements the Endangered Species Act. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $1.48 billion to the Fish and Wildlife Service, a decrease of $25.3 million from the previous year. The largest portion of the funding went to the Resource Management account, which received $1.23 billion. The Construction account saw an increase of $2.3 million, while the Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science subaccount increased by $1.3 million. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $1.48 billion to the Fish and Wildlife Service, with the Endangered Species program receiving $176.2 million. The Administration's request was $182.7 million, but P.L. 112-74 contained limits on spending for listing species and critical habitat designation. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $1.48 billion to the Fish and Wildlife Service, with the Endangered Species program receiving $176.2 million. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund benefits species listed under the Endangered Species Act through grants to states and territories. The FY2012 appropriation for the Refuge System was $486.5 million, with a decrease from the previous year. The Administration had requested $502.9 million for the Refuge System. The wildlife and habitat management activity within the NWRS saw a decrease in funding from $227.0 million in FY2011 to $223.8 million in FY2012. In FY2012, the appropriation for Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Conservation decreased by $3.4 million to $135.5 million. Congress rejected most of the proposed cut in the hatchery program, allocating $46.1 million instead of $42.8 million. However, this was still a reduction of $2.7 million from the previous year. The FY2012 appropriations law authorized a transfer of $3.8 million from the Corps of Engineers to FWS for hatchery activities. The FY2012 appropriation for Cooperative Landscape Conservation and Adaptive Science was $32.3 million, an increase of $1.3 million from the previous year. The conferees directed FWS to integrate certain programs within this activity with Joint Ventures, Fish Habitat Partnerships, and other related units. Land acquisition funding for FWS in FY2012 was $54.7 million, a slight reduction from the previous year. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands under FWS jurisdiction. Funding has not been sufficient for full payments, with additional funds coming from annual appropriations. In FY2011, $14.5 million was allocated, enough to pay each county 30% of the authorized level. No funding was requested for FY2012. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands under FWS jurisdiction. In FY2012, Congress rejected the proposed elimination of funding and instead appropriated $14.0 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from the previous year. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund received $9.5 million in FY2012, a decrease of $0.5 million from FY2011. The FY2012 appropriation for State and Tribal Wildlife Grants was $61.4 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from FY2011. The program helps fund conservation efforts for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The National Park Service (NPS) administers the National Park System with diverse natural and historic areas. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $2.58 billion for the NPS, a decrease from the previous year. The decrease in funding would mainly affect the Land Acquisition and State Assistance account and the Operation of the National Park System account. The largest portion of the NPS annual appropriations is for the Operation of the National Park System account, with $2.24 billion allocated in FY2012. Funding was slightly lower than the previous year and the Administration's request, with decreases in various park management activities. The conferees included report language on various issues in the Operation of the National Park System account, such as encouraging historic leases, maintaining funding for the National Capital Area Performing Arts Program, increasing funding for the Statue of Liberty and Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial protection, and directing the National Academy of Sciences to assess the science in the NPS Draft Environmental Impact Statement on oyster operations at Point Reyes National Seashore. The law provided less funding than the President's request for park management activities within the account. The FY2012 appropriations law included a $11.5 million increase for interpretation and education, as well as facility operations and maintenance. The National Recreation and Preservation (NR&P) account received $60.0 million, which was $2.1 million more than the previous year and $8.4 million more than the Administration's request. NR&P funds various Park System activities, including resource protection programs and technical assistance for preserving natural, historic, and cultural resources outside the National Park System. The funding for programs within this account remained consistent with FY2011 levels and the President's FY2012 request, with minor exceptions. The FY2012 law maintained funding levels for natural programs and heritage partnership programs, with the exception of a slight increase for natural programs. The Administration had sought to reduce funding for heritage partnership programs, but the law kept it at the FY2011 level. The reduction in funding for FY2012 would have allowed resources to be focused on other partnership programs and address concerns about the number of national heritage areas. The House Appropriations Committee had directed heritage areas to work towards long-term self-sustainability. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), administered by the NPS, provides grants for restoring historic districts, sites, buildings, and objects significant in American history. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $56.0 million for the HPF, with $47.0 million for state historic preservation offices and $9.0 million for tribal historic preservation offices. NPS Construction for FY2012 received $155.6 million, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $184.6 million, including $77.8 million for construction projects. $7.5 million was designated for the stabilization of the Washington Monument. The Construction line item funds new projects, repairs, and park facility improvements. $14.6 million was allocated for general management planning, with $2.4 million for special resource studies development. The NPS was urged to complete authorized studies before starting new ones. The conferees urged the NPS to complete authorized studies before starting new ones and address deferred maintenance concerns. The estimated deferred maintenance backlog for the NPS was between $8.77 billion and $12.89 billion for FY2010. Additional funding for NPS road construction and repair was provided through the Federal Lands Highway Program. The FY2012 appropriation for Land Acquisition and State Assistance was $102.1 million, an increase from the previous year but less than the Administration's request. The FY2012 appropriation for Land Acquisition and State Assistance was $102.1 million, with $57.1 million allocated for land acquisition and $45.0 million for grants to states. The Administration had requested $360.0 million, a significant increase from the previous year. The FY2012 appropriation for Land Acquisition and State Assistance was $102.1 million, with $57.1 million for land acquisition and $45.0 million for state grants. NPS appropriations for land acquisition have varied historically, ranging from $130.0 million in FY2002 to $34.4 million in FY2006 and FY2007. The US Geological Survey (USGS) provides information on geological resources, climate change, energy, water, and biological sciences. In 2011, USGS reorganized its science programs to align with interdisciplinary themes outlined in its strategic plan. The US Geological Survey (USGS) reorganized its science programs in 2011 to focus on interdisciplinary themes like Ecosystems, Climate Change, Energy, and Water Resources. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $1.07 billion to the USGS, a decrease from previous years, and rejected the creation of the National Land Imaging Program. The FY2012 appropriations for the USGS included $161.5 million for the Ecosystems program, with increases for Chesapeake Bay Executive Order and Great Lakes Asian Carp Control Framework. Conferees supported the Administration's request for an analysis of endocrine disrupting agents in the Chesapeake Bay. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $144.3 million for the Climate and Land Use Change program, with an increase of $6.2 million from the previous year. This included additional funding for Landsat 8 ground operations development. The conferees did not agree to transfer budgetary authority for the launch of Landsat satellites 9 and 10 to USGS from NASA. The conferees allocated $2.0 million for Landsat 9 and 10 implementation out of the $48.0 million requested. They suggested re-examining Landsat missions for cost-effective options. $2.4 million was provided for Climate Variability sub-program science support, a decrease from previous levels. $25.5 million was allocated for full deployment of climate science centers in FY2012 appropriations law. The National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center and its regional entities support research on global change data. The Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health program includes research on mineral and energy resources, contaminant biology, and toxic substances hydrology. Activities aim to understand how energy and mineral resources impact landscape, water, climate, ecosystems, and human health. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $96.4 million for the Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health program, with higher levels than the Administration's request for three of the four subprograms. The Administration's proposed reduction in funding for Minerals Resources was controversial and would have delayed the completion of the next National Mineral Resource Assessment. Opponents argued that this, along with proposed increases in funding for ecosystem restoration, would divert USGS from its core responsibilities. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $134.7 million for the ecosystem restoration program, which would shift activities from the Geology discipline to address natural hazards like hurricanes and tsunamis. This program aims to provide scientific information to mitigate the effects of natural hazards. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $215.0 million for the Water Resources program, an increase of $2.6 million from FY2011. The funding was restored for Earthquake grants, the 2012 Multi-hazards Initiative, and the National Volcano Early Warning System. The program collects, assesses, and disseminates hydrological data for water conservation. The FY2012 appropriations law restored funding for various programs that the Administration had proposed to cut, including the National Water Quality Assessment which received an increase of $5.5 million to $63.0 million for FY2012. The law also allocated $6.5 million for the Water Resources Research Act Program, maintaining the funding level from FY2011. Additionally, the National Streamflow Information Program received $29.4 million for FY2012. The National Streamflow Information Program received $29.4 million for FY2012, $2.5 million above the Administration's request. The Core Science Systems program, which provides geospatial data for resource management and natural hazard planning, received $106.8 million for FY2012, a decrease from the previous year. The biological information management and delivery subprogram received $15.1 million for FY2012, a decrease from FY2011. The National Biological Information Infrastructure funding was proposed to be eliminated in FY2012, which includes Enterprise Information activities and USGS information needs. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $110.4 million for this program, a decrease from the previous year. The Facilities program, which includes USGS activity sites and research vessels, received $100.6 million in FY2012, a decrease of $4.1 million. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $100.6 million for the Facilities program, a decrease of $4.1 million from the previous year. The conferees did not support the Administration's proposal for a separate Construction line item and maintained funds within the Deferred Maintenance and Capital Improvement sub-activity. The Administration's proposal for a National Land Imaging account was not accepted, with Landsat and related activities to be funded under the Surveys, Investigations, and Research account. The Landsat program received funding through the Climate and Land Use Change Program. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced the separation of functions within the Minerals Management Service. Three new entities were established - Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The transition to this new framework was completed on October 1, 2011. Each entity has a director under the supervision of an assistant secretary. BOEM manages the development of the nation's offshore resources. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) manages offshore resource development, while the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) enforces safety regulations. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) collects and disburses revenues from energy leases. Prior to BOEM and BSEE, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) handled these activities. In FY2011, disbursements from mineral leases on federal and Indian lands totaled $11.2 billion, fluctuating annually based on oil and gas prices. ONRR also collects revenues from bonus bids, rents, and royalties from various minerals. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated funding for BOEM, BSEE, and ONRR, with a total gross funding level of $478.0 million. Revenues from onshore and offshore leases are distributed to states, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. Net amounts enacted for FY2012 were $59.8 million for BOEM and $76.4 million for BSEE. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $478.0 million for BOEM, BSEE, and ONRR. The net amount enacted for FY2012 for the agencies replacing MMS was $255.8 million. The Administration's gross funding request for BOEMRE and ONRR was equal to the amount enacted. The FY2011 enacted gross funding level was $415.6 million, while the net funding level was $225.7 million. Additionally, there was a $42.0 million cost-share deduction for FY2011 and FY2012 appropriations. The Operations, Safety and Regulation program within BSEE saw a significant increase in funding from about $88 million in FY2011 to about $132 million in FY2012. Oil spill research funding also increased from $11.7 million to $14.9 million from FY2011 to FY2012. The Administration established an Office of Offshore Alternative Energy Programs in FY2010 to develop offshore renewable energy policies. Leases were issued for site testing and data collection, with a commercial lease granted for a wind energy project at Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound. Cape Wind Associates, LLC is developing a wind energy project offshore with 130 turbines at Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound. BOEMRE aims to streamline the process for offshore wind energy projects through the \"Smart from the Start\" program. The FY2012 appropriation for renewable energy was $22.7 million, slightly lower than previous years. The Administration's proposals for fees on nonproducing oil and gas leases and royalty relief provisions were not included in the FY2012 law. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about delays in issuing OCS exploration permits. The FY2012 appropriation for ONNR was $119.6 million, with a focus on compliance and asset management, as well as revenue and operations programs. The agency aims to improve data mining for royalty payments and implement a risk-based compliance strategy. The revenue and operations program is phasing out the royalty-in-kind program. President Bush lifted the executive moratoria on oil and gas development in certain areas in 2008, potentially opening up these areas for leasing activity. The focus of recent debates has been on moratoria and the audit and compliance program in the OCS. The Obama Administration revised the 2007-2012 OCS Leasing Program, eliminating Alaskan lease sales and withdrawing the North Aleutian Basin from leasing until 2017. They also excluded Atlantic and Pacific Coast planning areas from the 2012-2017 leasing program. Three areas in Alaska are being considered for leasing. President Obama cancelled a lease sale in 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. President Obama cancelled lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Lease sale 218 was held in the Western Gulf of Mexico in December 2011. The decision to lift the moratorium in the eastern Gulf of Mexico under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) is controversial, with some supporting it to increase domestic oil and gas supply, while others are concerned about adverse economic and environmental impacts. Congressional proposals to lift the moratorium are being debated. The 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has influenced the debate on unexplored areas with potential oil and gas reserves. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) faces challenges in maintaining an effective audit and compliance program. Critics argue that a focus on compliance review over auditing has weakened royalty collection, leading to revenue loss. The Department of the Interior (DOI) Inspector General has recommended strengthening administrative controls, including a risk-based compliance approach. The Royalty Policy Committee (RPC) has provided numerous recommendations to improve the Mineral Leasing Program and auditing functions, including a review of the RIK program. The RIK program, which saw significant growth from 2004 to 2007, was reviewed by the GAO and deemed in need of improvement. As a result, the Secretary of the Interior announced a phased-in termination of the program. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure proper land reclamation post-coal mining, addressing abandoned mine sites. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) established the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AML) Fund to address the large inventory of abandoned mine sites. Monies for the AML fund come from fees on coal production. Funding for state and tribal grants for reclaiming abandoned sites is provided by both annual appropriations from the AML fund and mandatory appropriations from general U.S. Treasury funds since FY2008. Other Office of Surface Mining (OSM) activities receive annual appropriations, including federal AML programs in states without OSM-approved reclamation programs, an emergency reclamation program, OSM administrative expenses, and the clean streams program. The AML fund, funded by fees on coal production, addresses abandoned mine sites. Western states sought more AML appropriations to access unappropriated balances. A restructuring plan is returning unappropriated balances to state- and tribal-share accounts in installments. The AML fund, funded by coal production fees, is returning unappropriated balances to certified states and tribes in installments. A Secretarial Order aimed to consolidate the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement within the Bureau of Land Management, but the effective date was suspended due to concerns. The FY2012 appropriations bill funded OSM at $150.5 million, a decrease from FY2011 but an increase over the Administration's request. The Administration proposed states increase user fees from the coal industry to offset a reduction in appropriations for regulation and technology. The FY2012 law did not support the Administration's proposal to increase fees on the coal industry or federal oversight of state regulatory programs. It also did not include the request to end payments to states and tribes for restoring abandoned coal mines, citing inconsistency with the AML program's purpose. Remaining reclamation funding would be competitively allocated for emergencies and program administration. The Administration's proposal for the FY2012 appropriations law included a decrease in funding for the AML Fund, opposed by affected states and tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to tribes and historically leads federal dealings with them. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the lead agency in federal dealings with tribes, providing various programs and services such as government operations, law enforcement, social programs, and education through the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $2.54 billion for BIA and BIE, slightly lower than the previous year's funding. The federal government has primary jurisdiction over major tribal issues. The federal government has primary jurisdiction over major criminal offenses on most Indian reservations, while tribes share jurisdiction with limited sentencing options. BIA funds law enforcement, jails, and courts in Indian country, supporting numerous agencies and programs. However, funding for public safety and justice is insufficient, leading to understaffed tribal law enforcement agencies compared to state and local jurisdictions. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) placed new responsibilities on BIA's Office of Justice Services to address staffing shortages and deficiencies in detention facilities. The act will have a significant impact on tribal courts, law enforcement, and detention centers by allowing extended jail sentences for tribal citizens convicted of crimes. The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) allows tribal courts to give longer jail sentences to tribal citizens convicted of crimes under tribal codes. The act also mandates the BIA to develop guidelines for approving correctional centers for long-term incarceration and a plan for the construction, maintenance, and operation of tribal detention centers. This could lead to a need for additional court capacity and increased detention capacity, either through new facilities or contracting with local jails. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $346.8 million for Public Safety and Justice activities, slightly more than the previous year's appropriation but less than the Administration's request. The FY2012 appropriations allocated $354.7 million, with $322.5 million for law enforcement on tribal lands, including funding for hiring additional officers and staff for detention centers. Additionally, $23.4 million was allocated for tribal courts. The BIE funds an educational system serving 41,000 students in 183 schools and residential facilities, with tribes operating 126 of these schools. The BIE operates 126 schools and residential facilities, while also funding early childhood and adult education programs, postsecondary scholarships, and education programs for Indian children in public schools. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $796.8 million for the BIE, a $44.1 million increase from FY2011. The increase in funding was primarily for elementary and secondary education programs, with a shift in funds from construction to education subactivities. The FY2012 law included provisions for the BIE to expend recovered funds over five years, rent out school facilities, and allow personnel to fundraise for schools. The BIE was directed to count students eligible for the Johnson O'Malley program, which provides financial assistance to Indian students in public and private schools. Student counts have been frozen since FY1995, leading to a lack of data collection on students served by projects. The freeze allows pre-1995 contractors to receive funding based on outdated student counts, impacting the allocation of funds. The Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act emphasizes maximum Indian participation in federal services. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $2.0 million to build tribal education department capacity and conduct a pilot project collaborating with states and school districts for program administration. The committee allocated $2.0 million for tribal education department capacity building and collaboration with states and school districts for program administration. Appropriations acts have prohibited BIE from funding schools not in the system since the mid-90s. Congress was concerned about adding new schools in the 1990s. In the 1990s, Congress was concerned about adding new BIE schools due to limited financial resources. The FY2012 appropriations law maintained these prohibitions, except for schools closed between 1951 and 1972 with terminated tribal relationships. This required funding for Jones Academy in Oklahoma. BIA Construction for FY2012 saw a $85.8 million decrease from FY2011. The FY2012 appropriation for construction of education facilities was $70.9 million, a decrease from FY2011 due to funds transferred for facilities maintenance. $17.8 million was allocated for replacement school construction, not requested by the President. The BIA program aims to replace, repair, and improve BIE school facilities, including employee housing, to ensure safety and functionality. The estimated cost for these improvements was $1.3 billion in 2009. Additionally, a portion of the construction budget was allocated for public safety and justice projects, with a decrease in funding for detention center construction in FY2012. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to insular areas and freely associated states in the Western Pacific to build fiscal and administrative capacities. OIA aid is crucial for addressing financial challenges in territorial governments, especially with declining industries. Infrastructure projects in Guam have also been supported by OIA funds. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to territorial governments facing economic challenges due to natural resources, population, and limited land. OIA funding includes permanent and discretionary funds from Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA) accounts. These accounts provide grants for government operations, infrastructure projects, and natural resource initiatives. However, the bulk of U.S. financial assistance comes from permanent and indefinite funds to insular areas, FSM, RMI, and Palau. The FY2012 appropriation for insular affairs was $105.3 million, $3.8 million more than FY2011. Of the total, $88.0 million was in AT funds, $3.8 million more than FY2011. The FY2012 appropriation for CFA was $17.3 million, level with FY2011. The funding difference is primarily due to differences in CFA funding. The FY2012 law included provisions for Palau to receive federal financial assistance while negotiating a new compact agreement. Funding for Guam could be transferred to the U.S. Agriculture Department for military buildup expenses. The FY2012 appropriation specified spending priorities for sustainable energy projects, educational opportunities, medical services for freely associated states, and OIA staffing for compact agreements implementation. Total OIA request included mandatory funds. The FY2012 OIA request was $468.4 million, with $377.1 million required by statutes and not subject to annual appropriations. This includes $232.1 million for Compacts of Free Association and $145.0 million for Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. EPA's responsibilities involve implementing federal environmental regulations and awarding grants for pollution control. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $8.46 billion for EPA, $219.1 million less than the previous year. The FY2012 appropriations for EPA were $8.46 billion, which was $219.1 million less than the previous year. The enacted amounts were lower than the President's FY2012 request for each of the eight EPA accounts. The largest dollar decreases were in three accounts: Environmental Programs and Management (EPM), Hazardous Waste. The FY2012 appropriations for EPA were $8.46 billion, $219.1 million less than the previous year. The appropriations reflect mostly decreases for individual programs and activities funded within each account, with some programs seeing maintained or increased funding compared to FY2011 levels. Issues associated with certain accounts and programs have been prominent in the debate on EPA's FY2012 appropriations, along with recent and pending EPA regulatory actions that were central to the discussions. The FY2012 appropriations for EPA were $8.46 billion, with some programs seeing maintained or increased funding. Concerns were expressed during hearings about EPA regulatory actions, with many proposals included in the FY2012 law to address these actions. The law included administrative provisions setting terms and conditions for the use of appropriations. The FY2012 appropriations for EPA were $8.46 billion, with some programs seeing maintained or increased funding. One provision rescinded unobligated balances and authorized EPA to transfer funds for emergency response actions for oil spills. General provisions specified requirements for Clean Air Act regulatory actions, greenhouse gas emission reporting, and Clean Water Act permitting for silvicultural activities. The House Appropriations Committee bill for FY2012 included extensive language regarding specific actions by EPA, such as refinements to EPA's policies for assessments under the Integrated Risk Information System. Funding focus was on wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, air pollution control grants, Superfund site cleanup, and climate change research. Approximately one-third of EPA's annual appropriations have been allocated to State and Tribal Assistance Grants for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The FY2012 appropriations for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) totaled $2.39 billion, a 4% decrease from the previous year. These funds support local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA awards SRF capitalization grants to states and territories based on formulas, with $1.47 billion allocated for Clean Water SRF and $919.4 million for Drinking Water SRF. This was less than the President's FY2012 request and FY2011 appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee proposed significant decreases in funding for both SRFs. The House proposed significant decreases in funding for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) in FY2012. Congress is debating the sustainability of federal assistance for SRFs to meet local water infrastructure needs. Some members argue for examining sustainable funding mechanisms, while others advocate for maintaining or increasing federal assistance due to long-term community needs and expanding water quality requirements. Congress is debating the sustainability of federal assistance for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) in FY2012. Some members argue for examining sustainable funding mechanisms, while others advocate for maintaining or increasing federal assistance due to long-term community needs and expanding water quality requirements. The focus of Congress' consideration of EPA's FY2012 appropriations was on the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, as well as other recently proposed or promulgated EPA actions addressing various air pollutants. The agency's response to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding climate change also remains a prominent issue. The FY2012 appropriations law contained provisions addressing EPA's use of funds for Clean Air Act regulatory actions, including transferring authority to regulate air emissions from EPA to DOI in the Outer Continental Shelf off Alaska's north coast. Another provision prohibited funds for regulations requiring permits under title V of the Clean Air Act for certain pollutants. The FY2012 appropriations law included provisions regarding EPA's funding for Clean Air Act regulations, such as transferring authority to regulate air emissions from EPA to DOI in the Outer Continental Shelf off Alaska's north coast. It also prohibited permits under title V of the Clean Air Act for certain pollutants from biological processes associated with livestock production. Additionally, it restricted the use of appropriations for mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from manure \"management systems.\" EPA is one of 17 federal agencies receiving funding for climate change activities, with a relatively small share but significant policy and regulatory roles compared to other agencies. The FY2012 appropriations law provided $411.1 million for EPA's clean air and climate programs, a 9% reduction from the President's request. The budget presentation was reorganized, making it difficult to compare appropriations with previous years. The law included provisions regarding Clean Air Act regulations and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions reporting. EPA is one of 17 federal agencies funding climate change activities. The FY2012 appropriations for EPA's clean air and climate programs were $411.1 million, a 9% reduction from the President's request. The FY2012 law included specific allocations for air quality management and tribal grants, with some decreases compared to FY2011 levels. The diesel emission reduction grants program saw a significant decrease in funding for FY2012. The FY2012 appropriations for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account were $1.22 billion, a 5% decrease from FY2011 and 2% below the President's request. Funding levels for the Superfund account have remained fairly consistent over the past decade. The Superfund program's funding levels have remained consistent over the past decade, with most funds allocated to cleanup sites on the National Priorities List. There is debate over the adequacy of funding and interest in reinstating Superfund taxes on industry to support the program. The President's FY2012 budget proposed reinstating Superfund taxes from 2012 to 2021, but the appropriations law did not include language for reauthorization. The FY2012 appropriations law did not reauthorize Superfund taxes. Funding for EPA's Brownfields program, aimed at cleaning up sites with contamination hindering redevelopment, is provided in separate agency accounts. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $168.1 million for the program, a decrease from previous years. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $4.60 billion for the Forest Service, a decrease of $83.4 million (2%) from FY2011 and $331.6 million (7%) less than the Administration's FY2012 request. This funding reduction was due to decreased funding for competitive grants to state and local governmental entities. The Forest Service manages 193 million acres of national forests, grasslands, and a tallgrass prairie, providing assistance to states, tribes, and private forest landowners. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $4.60 billion for the Forest Service, with key provisions including funding for the Integrated Resource Restoration initiative on a pilot basis, authority for a pre-decisional objection process, and no funding for payments to communities. The law also did not include funding for a five-year reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools Program. Forest Service appropriations are provided in various major accounts. The Forest Service budget for FY2012 included allocations for various programs such as Wildland Fire Management, Forest and Rangeland Research, and State and Private Forestry. The Forest and Rangeland Research account received $295.8 million, while State and Private Forestry programs were allocated $253.3 million. This marked a decrease from the previous year's funding levels. The FY2012 law allocated $253.3 million for State and Private Forestry programs, a decrease from previous funding levels. This included reductions in funding for the forest legacy program and International Forestry. Additionally, $1.56 billion was provided for the National Forest System, which was an increase from the previous year but lower than the President's request. The FY2012 appropriation for minerals and geology management within the account was $83.6 million, the same as FY2011. The Administration had proposed a reduction to $78.8 million. Conferees recommended the Forest Service to start planning for a renewable energy development program. The Administration also suggested combining various line items into a new Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR) line item. Funding transfers from other accounts were proposed for the IRR line item. The FY2012 appropriations law did not provide funds for the proposed Integrated Resource Restoration (IRR) combination, instead allocating funding to subaccounts as in previous years. A \"proof of concept\" pilot for the IRR was approved for three regions. The law also did not approve the Administration's request to merge the Land Management Planning and Inventory and Monitoring budget line items. $382.7 million was provided for capital improvement and maintenance, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $75.8 million for facilities maintenance and capital improvement, a decrease from the previous year. $45.0 million was designated for the legacy roads and trails program, with concerns about deferred maintenance and infrastructure improvements. The agency's backlog of deferred maintenance was estimated at $5.3 billion as of September 30, 2010. The FY2012 appropriation included $9.1 million for FS deferred maintenance, with $53.8 million allocated for land acquisition. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical and environmental health services for approximately 2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives belonging to federally recognized tribes. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives belonging to federally recognized tribes. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, and stations, while tribes, tribal groups, and urban Indian organizations also provide healthcare services. In FY2012, IHS received $4.31 billion in appropriations, which was a 6% increase from the previous year but a 7% decrease from the Administration's request. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received $4.31 billion in appropriations in FY2012, which was a 6% increase from the previous year but a 7% decrease from the Administration's request. IHS funding includes discretionary appropriations, third-party reimbursements, diabetes program funding, and rents on personnel quarters, totaling an estimated program level of $5.38 billion. The FY2012 appropriations law directed IHS to report on unobligated balances and provide a plan to reduce them. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated 90% of the Indian Health Service's funding to Health Services and 10% to the Facilities program. Health Services received $3.87 billion, slightly more than the previous year but less than the President's budget request. Funding levels for clinical and preventive health services were higher than the previous year. Some of the increase was for staffing new health facilities in California, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated funds for new health facilities in California, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and South Dakota, as well as for improving health information technology. $472.2 million was allocated for contract support costs (CSC), which was $74.5 million more than the previous year. CSC funds help tribes administer IHS-funded programs under self-determination contracts or compacts. Shortfalls in the CSC program have led to reduced services for tribes. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $441.1 million for IHS Facilities account, with $37.1 million increase from FY2011. Funding for facility maintenance and improvement remained at $53.8 million. $79.7 million was allocated for sanitation facility construction, meeting the Administration's request. Health care facility construction funding increased by $46.0 million. The FY2012 appropriations law increased funding for health care facility construction by $46.0 million above the FY2011 enacted level. Specifically, FY2012 funding for this activity was $85.2 million, equal to the level requested by the Administration. Indian health organizations assert that increased appropriations are needed for health care facility construction. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex consisting of 19 museums and galleries, the National Zoo, and 9 research facilities throughout the United States and around the world, with over 30 million visitors in 2010. Established in 1846, SI is funded by federal legislation. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is funded by federal appropriations and a private trust, with over $1.1 billion in total revenue for FY2010. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $811.5 million for SI, $50.0 million less than the Administration's request. Funding was provided for salaries, expenses, and facilities capital, with $636.5 million for salaries and expenses, a $1.6 million increase from FY2011. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated funding for the Smithsonian Institution, including $245.9 million for museums and research institutes, $43.1 million for program support and outreach, $82.7 million for administration, and $264.8 million for facilities services. The conferees expressed support for collaborative efforts among museums and provided direction on collections stewardship and budget submissions. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $175.0 million for Facilities Capital at the Smithsonian Institution, with $84.8 million for baseline revitalization, $15.2 million for facilities planning and design, and $75.0 million for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Additionally, the SI receives income from trust funds to support salaries. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) receives income from federal appropriations and trust funds to support salaries, capital projects, and operations. In FY2010, the SI's net assets increased by 8% to almost $2.7 billion. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), received $292.5 million in FY2012, a decrease of $16.9 million from the previous year. The decrease will be divided equally between the NEA and NEH. The NEA is a federal source of support for arts disciplines, with $146.3 million in FY2012 appropriations. This was a decrease from the previous year but equal to the Administration's request. $115.3 million was allocated for grants, with $56.2 million for direct grants and $36.3 million for state/regional partnership grants. The FY2012 appropriations law allocated $39.5 million for the NEA, an increase of $1.6 million from the requested amount. Additionally, $8.0 million was provided for Challenge America and $5.0 million for Our Town, a grant program for arts projects that engage communities. Our Town funds were to be distributed based on the agreement that States receive 40 percent of all grant funds. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) supports various humanities programs, including regional centers and state councils. NEH has awarded over 61,000 grants since 1965 and offers a Challenge Grant program to match private donations. In FY2012, NEH received $146.3 million, with $108.0 million for non-matching grants. The federal/state partnership grants program received $40.5 million. The Bridging Cultures initiative received $3.5 million in FY2012, $2.0 million more than FY2011 but $0.5 million less than the requested amount. The NEH did not request funding for the We the People grant program in FY2012, but $3.0 million was provided, slightly less than the previous year. The program was noted for its cost-effectiveness and broad reach. The LWCF program is cost-effective with bipartisan support and broad geographic reach. It is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015, but funds require appropriation. The program is used for federal land acquisition, state and local government grants, and various related activities. Since FY2008, the majority of funds have been allocated for land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has received about $34 billion for land acquisition from FY1965 to FY2012, with roughly $16 billion appropriated. Annual appropriations have varied, with $322.9 million allocated in FY2012. There is debate on the optimal funding level and allocation for LWCF's three purposes. The House Appropriations Committee aimed to reduce funding to $65.8 million in FY2012 for oversight of previous projects rather than new acquisitions. The House Appropriations Committee proposed reducing funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) in FY2012 to $65.8 million for oversight of previous projects rather than new acquisitions. The Administration had proposed funding LWCF at $900.0 million, aiming for \"full funding\" to achieve conservation and economic benefits. The FY2012 appropriation for land acquisition was $186.8 million, a $22.1 million increase from FY2011. The funding covered projects prioritized by agencies, but was $253.2 million less than the Administration's request of $440.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for clear information on land acquisition. The House Appropriations Committee requested clear information from the Administration on the need for federal land acquisition, criteria for selecting lands, and consideration of landscape-level conservation. The DOI agencies aimed to use consistent criteria for acquisition projects in FY2012 to meet conservation goals. Changes to the LWCF program included the use of selection criteria to rank land acquisition projects, addressing congressional concerns. The FY2012 appropriations law addressed congressional concerns by aiming for a single set of policies for land acquisitions among four agencies. The state grants received $45.0 million, $5.1 million more than FY2011 but $155.0 million less than the Administration's $200.0 million request. The law did not include the proposal for a new competitive grants program, maintaining the 50:50 federal/state matching basis for grants. The House Appropriations Committee did not seek funding for new stateside grants, but rather $2.8 million for administrative expenses related to previous grants. The proposed competitive program aimed to fund projects in urban centers with limited access to natural areas, reconnect young people to the outdoors, provide access to blueways/waterways, and protect open space. Previous administrations have also sought to eliminate funds for new stateside grants. For FY2012, the appropriations law allocated $78.4 million from LWCF for other purposes, $5.4 million less than the previous year. Congress also funded the Forest Legacy program and cooperative endangered species grants through LWCF. Wildfire protection programs and funding remain controversial due to high costs and debates over treatment locations and environmental analysis. In FY2012, DOI was directed to assess cost-effective wildfire management. Funding for Wildland Fire Management in FY2012 was $2.63 billion, a decrease from FY2011. The program funds fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations. In FY2012, funding for Wildland Fire Management was $2.63 billion, a decrease from FY2011. The program provides funding for baseline staffing, training, and equipment. For preparedness in FY2012, the appropriations law matched the Administration's proposal of $1.28 billion, an increase of $318.9 million (33%) from FY2011. This program funds agency fire control activities before wildfires meet the criteria for FLAME funding. For FY2012, the appropriations law matched the Administration's request of $809.3 million, a decrease of $585.1 million (42%) from FY2011. In FY2012, the appropriations law provided $500.9 million for hazardous fuel reduction, with a significant increase over the Administration's request. The funding also includes support for various wildfire operations such as fuel reduction treatments, post-fire site rehabilitation, research, forest health management, and fire assistance. The decline in funding for the Forest Service (FS) is partly due to a shift in costs to preparedness and reduced needs following mild fire seasons. The FS is directed to replace its aging fleet of federal air tankers and collaborate with the Department of Interior on a strategy for this purpose. In FY2012, $500.9 million was allocated for hazardous fuel reduction, with a notable increase from the Administration's request. The Forest Service (FS) saw a decrease in funding due to a shift in costs and reduced needs after mild fire seasons. The FS was directed to replace its aging fleet of federal air tankers and collaborate with the Department of Interior on a strategy for this purpose. The conferees directed both the FS and DOI to spend hazardous fuels funding on the highest priority projects in the highest priority areas, removing the requirement for specific percentages to be spent in the Wildland-Urban Interface. In FY2012, the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund allocated $13.0 million for site rehabilitation, a decrease from FY2011. The appropriations law matched the FY2011 level for DOI facilities and research, but provided more funding for FS forest health activities and state and volunteer fire assistance. In FY2012, the appropriations law provided $61.9 million for FS state and volunteer fire assistance, exceeding the request but less than FY2011. The FLAME Act of 2009 established funds for DOI and the Forest Service to cover costs of large fires when Wildland Fire Management accounts are depleted. Transfers from the FLAME fund to the Wildland Fire Management account can be made for suppression activities upon a secretarial declaration. The FY2012 appropriations law provided $407.9 million for fire suppression activities, matching the Administration's request. The conferees directed the Secretaries to develop new methods for estimating fire suppression funding needs. Funding levels for wildland fire management varied, with $315.9 million for the FS and $92.0 million for DOI in FY2012, exceeding the previous year's funding. The FY2012 appropriations law included provisions for rescissions and carry-over of fire funds. $429.6 million was directed to be used from carry-over emergency suppression funds before obligating FY2012 suppression funds, with $240.0 million for the FS and $189.6 million for DOI. A rescission of $82.0 million in unobligated balances was included for DOI, while a proposed rescission of $192.0 million from FS wildland fire management was not included in the law. The FY2011 appropriations law had included rescissions of $600.0 million, with $400.0 million for the FS and $200.0 million for DOI. The table and graph display appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies from FY2008 to FY2012. It shows appropriations by agency, total appropriations in each title, and overall total in the law. The FY2012 law included provisions for rescissions and carry-over of fire funds. $429.6 million was directed for emergency suppression funds, with $240.0 million for FS and $189.6 million for DOI. Rescissions of unobligated balances were included for DOI."
