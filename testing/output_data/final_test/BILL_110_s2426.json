    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Congressional Oversight of Iraq Agreements Act of 2007\". Congress finds that President George W. Bush's Declaration of Principles with Iraq lacks clarity on the absence of permanent military bases, future mission profiles, and deployment lengths for US forces in Iraq. The Declaration of Principles with Iraq lacks clarity on the accountability of US military personnel and government contractors under Iraqi laws. Lieutenant General Douglas Lute stated that negotiations may not involve formal inputs from Congress. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Fiscal Year 2008, prohibits the establishment of military installations for permanent stationing of US Armed Forces in Iraq. The extension of long-term US security commitments to Iraq requiring funds must have full participation and consent of Congress as per constitutional guidelines. Legislative approval can be through Senate approval of a treaty or authorization by both houses of Congress. Past presidential practice for international agreements not treaties follows Department of State guidelines for consideration of the agreement's involvement. The extension of US security commitments to Iraq must have Congress's full participation and consent, considering the nation's interests, the need for congressional legislation, and Congress's preference. The conclusion of bilateral agreements without congressional approval is addressed in Section 3. The Legal Advisor to the Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress justifying the President's decision to bypass congressional approval for an agreement on the US-Iraq security relationship. The report should include a legal analysis of the President's constitutional authority in making this decision. The sense of Congress is that any bilateral agreement between the US and Iraq not approved by the Senate or authorized by legislation does not have the force of law. No funds can be used for agreements not meeting these criteria."
