    "content": "The \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993\" amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to address interstate transportation of municipal waste. The \"Interstate Transportation of Municipal Waste Act of 1993\" grants Governors the authority to restrict out-of-state municipal waste imports, allowing them to prohibit disposal in landfills or incinerators under their jurisdiction, with exceptions for certain existing landfills meeting specific criteria. The Act allows Governors to restrict out-of-state waste imports to landfills meeting specific criteria, including design standards, leachate collection, monitoring, and financial assurance. Landfills approved before 1993 to receive waste from outside jurisdictions are exempt. The Act grants authority to limit incinerators receiving out-of-state waste if they comply with Clean Air Act requirements and all relevant laws. Beginning in 1993, a Governor can restrict the amount of out-of-state municipal waste disposed of at landfills or incinerators to the levels received in 1991 or 1992. Additionally, disposal of out-of-state waste exceeding 50,000 tons or 30% of all waste received can be limited at each facility. The regulations aim to limit out-of-state municipal waste disposal at landfills or incinerators to 30% of all waste received in 1991 or 1992, prohibit disposal in non-compliant facilities, and ensure adherence to design, location, and environmental standards. The regulations aim to limit out-of-state municipal waste disposal at landfills or incinerators to 30% of all waste received in 1991 or 1992, and prohibit disposal in non-compliant facilities. Governors have the authority to further limit out-of-state waste disposal percentages in subsequent years. The regulations limit out-of-state municipal waste disposal at landfills or incinerators and prohibit disposal in non-compliant facilities. Governors have the authority to further restrict out-of-state waste disposal percentages. Any limitations imposed by the Governor must be applicable statewide and cannot discriminate against out-of-state waste shipments based on origin. Governors must submit information to the Administrator within 120 days if they intend to exercise this authority. The Administrator must be provided with information on out-of-State municipal waste received for disposal in the State during 1991 and 1992. After receiving this information, a notification will be sent to the Governor of each State and the public, followed by a 30-day comment period. Within 180 days, a list of the quantity of out-of-State municipal waste received in 1991 and 1992 must be published for each landfill and incinerator in States where the Governor plans to restrict in-State municipal waste exports. The Governor of a State may restrict the exportation of municipal waste generated within the State, in line with the waste management plan. However, materials separated for recycling cannot be restricted. The Governor can delegate this authority to local governments or solid waste planning units. Within 90 days of enactment, the Governor must designate the affected local government. After the enactment of this section, the Governor must designate the affected local government for actions related to landfills or incinerators. If no designation is made, the primary jurisdiction over the land where the facility is located will serve as the affected local government. Definitions include the elected officials of the political subdivision where the facility is located as the 'affected local government' and a political subdivision with authority as the 'affected local solid waste planning unit.' The term 'out-of-State municipal waste' refers to municipal waste generated outside of a State, including waste from outside the United States. 'Municipal waste' is defined as refuse from various sources like residential, commercial, or industrial, consisting of different materials but excluding hazardous waste. The curr_chunk discusses various types of waste, including hazardous waste, waste from response actions, materials for recycling, and industrial waste. The curr_chunk defines different types of waste, including industrial waste, medical waste, and materials returned for credit or reuse. The curr_chunk defines industrial waste as waste from manufacturing or industrial processing operations that is different from municipal waste, including construction and demolition debris. The Solid Waste Disposal Act's table of contents is amended to include a new item regarding the interstate transportation of municipal waste."
