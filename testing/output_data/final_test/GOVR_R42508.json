    "content": "The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA) of 2002 authorized the FDA to collect fees from the medical device industry to fund device reviews. Medical devices encompass a variety of products used for diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, or prevention of diseases. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a medical device as any instrument or apparatus intended for medical use. Medical devices encompass a variety of products used for diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, or prevention of diseases. According to FDA, examples of medical devices range from simple tongue depressors to complex programmable pacemakers. Manufacturers of certain medical devices must obtain FDA approval before marketing in the United States. The FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health is responsible for medical device premarket review, supported by user fees to reduce review times. The user fee law provides revenue for FDA and sets performance goals for medical device review, modeled after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The Medical Device User Fee Program, authorized in five-year increments like other user fee programs, was reauthorized through September 30, 2012, by the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2007. FDA reached an agreement with the medical device industry on proposed recommendations for MDUFA III in February 2012. The draft MDUFA III package, including statutory language and performance goals, was posted on the FDA website in March 2012. After a public meeting and a 30-day comment period, a final recommendation was submitted to Congress. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) became law on July 9, 2012, granting FDA authority to collect medical device user fees. The FDA's authority to collect medical device user fees was reauthorized for FY2013 through FY2017 under the Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144). However, FDA can only spend fees up to the FY2012 level due to the FY2013 continuing resolution. The report describes the impact of MDUFA on FDA review time for medical device applications and the agency's budget. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 was the first legislation addressing premarket review of medical devices, with user fees authorized in 2002. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 authorized user fees for medical devices in 2002. Manufacturers pay fees for new drug applications submitted to the FDA for premarket review. Most medical devices are exempt from premarket review and fees, except for about a third classified as moderate to high-risk. Manufacturers have two pathways to bring moderate to high-risk devices to market with FDA approval. The FDA has two pathways for manufacturers to bring moderate to high-risk medical devices to market: the PMA process, which involves clinical studies and a lengthy approval process, and the 510(k) process, which demonstrates substantial equivalence to a predicate device already on the market. Since MDUFA II reauthorization in 2007, FDA has cleared over 13,000 510(k) devices and approved 106 PMAs. User fees collected under MDUFA fund about 20% of the device review program, while fees under PDUFA account for over 60% of the drug review program's budget. Fees under MDUFA III would fund about a third of the medical device premarket review process, including fees for significant changes in device design or performance approved via the PMA pathway. Since the MDUFA II reauthorization in 2007, FDA has cleared over 13,000 510(k) devices and approved 106 PMAs. User fees collected under MDUFA fund about 20% of the device review program. Manufacturers can request approval for changes in approved devices through 180-Day PMA Supplements or Real-Time PMA Supplements. A Premarket Report allows for the reprocessing of high-risk devices for additional use. The 2007 reauthorization added new annual fees to generate a more stable funding source. MDUFA II, the 2007 reauthorization, introduced new annual fees to create a stable revenue stream for the FDA. These fees included establishment registration fees for device establishments and product fees for high-risk devices. Additionally, new application fees were added, such as the 30-Day Notice and 513(g) application, with lowered existing application fee amounts. Under MDUFA III, the classification of device fees changed, with the 510(k) fee increasing to 2% of the PMA fee. The PMA fee amount rose from $248,000 in FY2013 to $268,443 in FY2017. The establishment registration fee also increased from $2,575 in FY2013 to $3,872 in FY2016 and FY2017, leading to more establishments paying the fee. Under MDUFA III, fees for medical device applications have changed. Manufacturers are exempt from fees, with small businesses paying a reduced rate. Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) applications are also exempt from user fees. Pediatric devices are exempt from fees other than establishment fees. Government entities and Indian tribes have exemptions from certain fees unless devices are distributed commercially. Under MDUFA III, FDA fees for medical device applications have changed. Small businesses pay a reduced rate, and certain exemptions apply for Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) and pediatric devices. FDA accredits third parties to review 510(k) submissions, improving efficiency. No FDA fee is charged for 510(k) submissions reviewed by accredited third parties. Small businesses qualify for user fee discounts under amended processes in MDUFA II. Small businesses with gross receipts below a certain amount receive fee reductions and exemptions for FDA user fees. Companies reporting under $30 million in gross receipts are exempt from fees for their first PMA. Small businesses with annual gross sales of $100 million or less pay reduced rates for certain user fees. Establishment fees must be paid in full by small businesses. FDA user fee laws aim to supplement congressional funding. The FDA user fee laws, MDUFA and PDUFA, aim to supplement congressional appropriations, not replace them. MDUFA fees can only be collected if direct appropriations remain at a specified level. PDUFA has been expanded to include postmarket safety activities, while MDUFA revenue is limited to activities related to the review of medical device applications. Fees are collected to cover increased costs of resources for the review process. MDUFA III requires the Secretary to submit annual fiscal and performance reports for the next five fiscal years to specified congressional committees. The reports address FDA's authority to collect medical device user fees and its progress towards fee-related performance goals. FDA must also develop a reauthorization proposal in consultation with various stakeholders. The FDA must engage with various stakeholders, including committees, experts, and advocacy groups, before negotiating with the industry for reauthorization. Public input and comments are requested, and monthly discussions with advocacy groups are held. Recommendations are presented to congressional committees, published for public comment, and revised as needed. Meeting minutes are posted on the FDA website. The FDA's review process for medical devices is a key measure of its performance under the MDUFA agreement with the industry. The total review time includes FDA handling time and time for sponsors to respond to requests for additional information. FDA has been meeting or exceeding goals for 95% of submissions, with at least 90% of 510(k) reviews completed within 90 days. However, these metrics only reflect FDA time, not sponsor response time. The time taken by device sponsors to respond to requests for additional information has increased steadily since 2001. While FDA review time for 510(k) submissions has decreased, the total days for review have been increasing. FDA and GAO have studied the issue of increasing review time, with FDA attributing delays to poor quality submissions requiring additional information. The FDA and GAO have studied the increasing review time for 510(k) submissions. The FDA found that delays were due to poor quality submissions requiring additional information, with sponsors failing to address deficiencies identified in first-round AI Letters. The GAO also analyzed FDA performance goals regarding device review times and requests for additional information from sponsors. The FDA has met medical device performance goals for 510(k)s, but the total review time has increased. The agency uses AI Letters for additional information, giving sponsors a chance to respond and potentially get approval. Expedited review is available for devices treating life-threatening conditions. The FDA's review time for PMA applications has been increasing since 2004, despite spending less time on reviews. A 2012 GAO report noted that FDA met most goals for PMAs but fell short on expedited PMAs. Communication issues between industry and FDA were highlighted, with industry representatives citing unclear guidance documents and lack of communication on application deficiencies. The FDA has communication issues with sponsors regarding application deficiencies. Industry representatives believe that if the FDA communicated these deficiencies earlier, sponsors could correct them and avoid additional information requests. The FDA has taken steps to address these issues, such as issuing new guidance documents and improving the review process. 35% of FDA's budget for FY2012 comes from user fees. In FY2012, 35% of FDA's budget comes from user fees, with medical device user fees contributing about 10% to the FDA's medical device and radiological health program budget. User fees have become an increasing proportion of FDA's device-related budget. In FY2012, user fees accounted for 35% of FDA's budget, with medical device user fees contributing 10% to the FDA's medical device and radiological health program budget. Over the period of FY2003 to FY2012, user fees more than doubled, while direct appropriations increased at a slower rate. FDA held an initial public meeting on the reauthorization of medical device user fees in September 2010, leading to negotiation meetings with industry and other stakeholders. Minutes of these meetings are available on the FDA's website. FDA and the medical device industry reached an agreement on proposed recommendations for the third reauthorization of a medical device user fee program, authorizing $595 million in user fees over five years. This would allow FDA to hire over 200 full-time-equivalent workers. Industry expressed concerns about future resource increases under MDUFA IV, to which the agency responded with uncertainties about the agreement's financial footing. The FDA and the medical device industry reached an agreement on the MDUFA III package, which includes statutory language and performance goals. The draft was posted on the FDA's website on March 14, 2012, followed by a public meeting on March 28, 2012. After a 30-day comment period, the final package was submitted to Congress. Additional details can be found in the tables in the appendixes. MDUFA III legislative changes increase the number of establishments subject to a registration fee from 16,000 to about 22,000. Fees for PMAs and establishment fees are set to gradually rise from $248,000 to $268,443 and $2,575 to $3,872 respectively. Total fee revenue is set to increase from $97,722,301 to $130,184,348 by FY2017, with a total collection of $595 million over FY2013 to FY2017. MDUFA III adjusts fee amounts for inflation and total revenue, with provisions for fee waivers in the interest of public health, particularly for LDT manufacturers. Adjusted fee amounts are published in the Federal Register 60 days before each fiscal year. The fee waiver for laboratory developed test (LDT) manufacturers under MDUFA III sunsets at the end of the program. MDUFA III also includes requirements for electronic submission of PMA, 510(k), and other specified submissions. Additionally, there is a provision for streamlined hiring of FDA employees to support medical device reviews, with the authority for streamlined hiring ending three years after enactment. The agreement emphasizes the commitment to public health and timely access to safe medical devices, while allowing the FDA to ensure safety and effectiveness. Various process improvements are also described in the agreement. The agreement outlines process improvements for FDA's medical device review process, including structured pre-submission management, feedback via email and meetings, guidance on electronic submissions, and use of interactive review for timely completion. User fees will continue to be applied to guidance document development. FDA will continue to apply user fees to guidance document development and may apply user fees to delete outdated guidance. It will work with interested parties to improve the third-party review program and implement final guidance on benefit-risk determinations in device premarket review. FDA will propose additional low-risk medical devices for exemption from the 510(k) process and develop a transitional approach for regulating emerging diagnostics. The agency's main focus is on completing medical device submissions within specified timeframes. The FDA applies user fees to support the review of submissions like PMA reviews and 510(k) notifications within specific timeframes. Performance goals are set for each submission type for FY2013 through FY2017. Shared outcome goals aim to reduce the average total time to decision for PMAs and 510(k)s, with FDA and industry sharing responsibility to meet these goals. In FY2013, FDA and industry aimed to reduce the average total time to decision goal to 135 calendar days, which decreased to 130 days in FY2015 and 124 days in FY2017. User fees will be used to enhance scientific review capacity, streamline hiring, provide training programs, and improve IT systems for real-time submission status updates. Independent assessment of review process management will also be conducted. FDA will hire a consultant to assess the device application review process by the end of the second quarter of FY2013. A report with recommendations to reduce review time will be published within six months of the contract award. Quarterly performance reports will be provided to the industry, with more detailed information on 510(k)s, PMAs, Pre-Submissions, and IDEs. The FDA reports quarterly and annually on various data points for different types of device applications. Discretionary fee waivers or reduced fees may be granted in the interest of public health. MDUFA III, along with PDUFA and FDASIA, reauthorized user fee acts and included new authorities. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) became law on July 9, 2012, encompassing these provisions. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) became law on July 9, 2012, including provisions related to user fees, delegation of activities to third parties, establishment registration requirements, unique device identification system, and reporting requirements for devices linked to serious injuries or deaths. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) was enacted on July 9, 2012, with provisions on user fees, delegation of activities, establishment registration, device identification, and reporting serious injuries or deaths. Performance Goals and Procedures, MDUFMA and MDUFA fees, MDUFA III Performance Goals, and Acronyms are included in the report."
