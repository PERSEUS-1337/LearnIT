    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1158 of the Evidence Code is amended to define \"medical provider\" and outlines the authorization process for obtaining medical records on behalf of an attorney. Failure to provide patient records within five days of written authorization may result in liability for all reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees. Medical providers can charge reasonable costs, such as ten cents per page, for making patient records available. The cost for copying documents from microfilm is twenty cents per page, with additional charges for oversize or special processing documents. Clerical costs for locating and making records available are billed at a maximum rate of sixteen dollars per hour per person. Postage charges and third-party retrieval costs may also apply. (f) The fee for inspecting or copying records at the record custodian's place of business is capped at fifteen dollars ($15) plus actual retrieval costs. (g) If electronic records are requested, the medical provider must provide them in the requested format if readily available, or in an agreed-upon readable format. A medical provider must accept a completed authorization form for disclosing health information if the form is valid and meets specific requirements. The form must be in 14-point type and include an authorization statement. Treatment or benefits cannot be conditioned on submitting this authorization. Patient information requested for medical records includes name, medical record number, date of birth, address, telephone number, and email. Recipient information needed includes name, address, telephone number, and email. Health information requested can include records dated within a specific range, radiology records, laboratory results, or records related to a specific injury or treatment. Authorization for Release of Medical Records:\n\nRecords may contain details on mental health, alcohol/drug use, and HIV/AIDS. Mental health, alcohol/drug department records, and HIV test results will not be disclosed unless requested. Authorization is valid for one year unless specified otherwise. Revocation possible in writing, but does not apply to previously disclosed information. Copy of authorization is as valid as the original. By signing this form, the patient agrees that once their health information is shared, it may no longer be protected under HIPAA. Patient signature, date, and printed name are required. If the patient cannot sign, the relationship to the patient must be indicated."
