    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Autism Statistics, Surveillance, Research, and Epidemiology Act of 1998 (ASSURE)\". The Congress finds that autism and other pervasive developmental disabilities are neurodevelopmental diseases causing severe impairment in cognition, language, and affective abilities. These conditions are not rare and may affect as many as one in every 500 children, with limited information on their prevalence in the United States. Recent studies in Canada, Europe, and Japan suggest that the prevalence of classic autism may be 300-400% higher than previously estimated. The cost of caring for individuals with autism is estimated at over $13 billion per year. Autism is considered highly heritable and likely to benefit from advancements in genetics and neurology, making accurate prevalence and incidence data crucial for discovering effective treatments and a cure. Recent research indicates that environmental factors may play a role in the prevalence and incidence of autism. Identifying contributing causes of autism could potentially lead to prevention. Understanding the causes of autism and related developmental disabilities may also provide insights into other disorders affecting millions of Americans. SEC. 3. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may award grants for data collection on autism and developmental disabilities to public or nonprofit entities. Technical assistance can be provided instead of cash. Additionally, Centers of Excellence in Autism and Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology will be established by the Secretary through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology to collect and analyze information on autism and related developmental disabilities. These centers will be awarded grants or cooperative agreements to public or nonprofit entities for research purposes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology. These centers will collect, analyze, and report data according to guidelines prescribed by the Director. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology. These centers will coordinate surveillance efforts, provide education and training for health professionals, and conduct research into factors causing autism and related developmental disabilities. Each program will focus on a specific research expertise area. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish regional centers of excellence in autism and pervasive developmental disabilities epidemiology. These centers will coordinate surveillance efforts, provide education and training for health professionals, and conduct research into factors causing autism and related developmental disabilities. Each program will focus on a specific research expertise area. SEC. 4. CLEARINGHOUSE. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish a clearinghouse to coordinate research and policy development for autism and pervasive developmental disabilities. The agency will also coordinate the Federal response to requests for assistance from State health departments regarding potential or alleged cases of autism. The CDC will establish a clearinghouse to coordinate research and policy development for autism and developmental disabilities. They will also coordinate the Federal response to requests for assistance from State health departments regarding potential or alleged clusters. The CDC will establish a clearinghouse to coordinate research and policy development for autism and developmental disabilities. They will also coordinate the Federal response to requests for assistance from State health departments regarding potential or alleged clusters. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Secretary will establish an Advisory Committee for Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology Research to provide advice on surveillance programs, centers of excellence, coordination of programs and research, and research activities. The Advisory Committee for Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology Research is composed of ex officio members and appointed members. Ex officio members include officials from various health organizations, while appointed members are selected according to specific guidelines. The Advisory Committee for Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disabilities Epidemiology Research consists of appointed members with specific qualifications. These include research scientists, representatives from national organizations focused on autism research, and clinicians specializing in treatment. Members are appointed by the Secretary in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences. The Committee for Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disabilities focuses on treatment and is appointed by the Secretary in consultation with relevant organizations. Two members must be parents or legal guardians of individuals with these disabilities. Administrative support and terms of service are provided for the Committee. The Committee for Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disabilities receives administrative support from the Department of Health and Human Services. Members serve for three-year terms, can be reappointed indefinitely, and must meet at least twice a year. They do not receive additional compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses related to their service on the Committee. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress on autism and other developmental disorders, research findings, public health responses, and the need for further research. The definition of \"State\" includes various regions. Authorization of appropriations is also included in the Act. Authorization of $7,500,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2003 is approved for carrying out the Act."
