    "content": "The United States and Europe share similar values and often pursue common goals in international politics, security, and economics. The EU has become increasingly influential in its member countries, with policy-making shifting from national capitals to Brussels. This partnership enhances the chances of achieving mutually desirable outcomes in world affairs. The United States maintains strong bilateral relations with individual European countries, but the transatlantic partnership is increasingly influenced by relations with the EU. Members of Congress and policymakers are seeking to understand EU foreign policy and policy-making processes, covering a wide range of security and economic issues such as police training, anti-piracy missions, counterterrorism, Iran sanctions, and efforts to end conflicts in Syria. Members of the 113th Congress are interested in examining the compatibility of U.S. and EU legislation, funding, and political communication on various issues such as Iran sanctions, Syria conflict, Russia or China relations, and free trade agreements with South Korea. They also assess how EU foreign and security policy developments may impact the United States in the long term. The EU's global role in relation to evolving U.S. foreign policy priorities, the EU-NATO relationship, and the U.S.-EU-NATO dynamics are key interests for states. The complexity of EU external policies, governed by the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), poses a challenge due to the intergovernmental nature of decision-making within the 27 member states. The European Council and the Council of the European Union play key roles in shaping and executing external policies in areas such as trade, foreign aid, and EU enlargement. The Lisbon Treaty, which took effect in December 2009, aimed to enhance the coordination between the European Commission, member states, and the European Parliament in order to improve the coherence and effectiveness of EU external policies. The EU faces challenges in achieving consensus among its 27 member countries, leading to thinly developed or no common policies. Critics argue that EU foreign policy lacks institutional coordination and coherence, with intergovernmental and supranational strands not effectively linked. The EU's foreign policy challenges stem from a lack of institutional coordination and coherence, with rotating national presidencies causing shifting priorities. The Lisbon Treaty introduced the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy position to address these issues, currently held by Catherine Ashton. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, currently held by Catherine Ashton, consolidates external policy duties previously divided between three officials. The European External Action Service (EEAS) was launched to support the High Representative in coordinating and implementing EU foreign policy, reflecting an institutional merger between the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. The Lisbon Treaty established a \"permanent\" President of the European Council, appointed by member states, to manage activities, promote consensus, and speak on behalf of the group. The EU has historically focused on civilian power and economic integration, while NATO addressed Cold War defense. The EU aims to safeguard its values, interests, security, and promote democracy, human rights, and international law under the 1992 Treaty on European Union. The EU aims to promote democracy, human rights, and international law to preserve peace, prevent conflicts, strengthen security, eradicate poverty, encourage global economic integration, and support sustainable development. The EU's foreign policy aims to promote democracy, human rights, and international law to preserve peace and strengthen security through multilateral cooperation. The European Security Strategy outlines strategic objectives including addressing global challenges, regional security in its neighborhood, and long-term stability. The EU's foreign policy aims to promote democracy, human rights, and international law to preserve peace and strengthen security through multilateral cooperation. The European Security Strategy outlines strategic objectives including addressing global challenges, regional security in its neighborhood, and long-term stability. The EU seeks a rules-based, multilateral world order to ensure peace and security through a mix of military, political, and economic tools, focusing on conflict prevention, strengthening governance and human rights, and promoting economic development. The EU's foreign policy emphasizes democracy, human rights, and international law to maintain peace and security through multilateral cooperation. Analysts highlight the EU's use of soft power tools and preference for multilateralism, reflecting its evolved system of cooperative policy making. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, established in 1992, focuses on political and diplomatic international issues. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) deals with international political and security issues, with member state governments working together to reach consensus. The European Council and Council of the European Union play a key role in formulating CFSP, with the European Council being the EU's highest level of political authority. The European Council defines priorities and provides political direction for the Union's external action through the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Decisions are made by consensus, with the President of the European Council managing its work and serving as the spokesman. The High Representative also participates in the European Council's work and may propose CFSP initiatives. The President of the European Council represents CFSP at the heads of state or government level, while the High Representative is the voice at the ministerial level. The Council of Ministers is a primary forum for developing political consensus and direction in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Foreign ministers of the 27 member states meet monthly to make CFSP decisions, requiring unanimous agreement. The High Representative chairs the Foreign Affairs Council, facilitating consensus and managing CFSP decisions with the support of the European External Action Service and the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The Political and Security Committee (PSC) supports the Council in monitoring international affairs relevant to CFSP. The PSC works closely with the High Representative and the EEAS. CFSP includes Principles and Guidelines, Common Strategies, Joint Actions, and Common Positions as its main instruments. The terminology used in CFSP can be confusing due to overlapping meanings with everyday language. The Lisbon Treaty reconceptualizes CFSP instruments into four types of Decisions: on strategic objectives, common positions, joint actions, and implementing arrangements. Principles and Guidelines shape EU policies, while conclusions and results documents from European Council meetings promulgate strategic decisions in CFSP. The High Representative can release CFSP statements on behalf of the EU between EU leaders' meetings. Key strategy documents adopted by the European Council, such as the European Security Strategy, fall under Principles and Guidelines, triggering subsequent formalization or specific application. Common Positions and Joint Actions further commit member states to agreed concepts. Common Positions and Joint Actions in the EU are seen as a gray area between legislation and political cooperation. While some view them as binding legal instruments, others argue they are separate from EU law due to the lack of legal enforcement mechanisms. Member states are obligated to actively support the Union's external and security policy and comply with its actions. Common Positions define diplomatic approaches to regions or countries collectively agreed upon by the EU. The EU adopts Common Positions to address problematic situations involving foreign governments that violate human rights, democracy, or international law. These decisions can also cover cross-cutting topics like conflict prevention, nonproliferation, and terrorism, often including sanctions. As of February 2013, the EU had sanctions against entities in 27 countries and terrorist groups. The EU adopts Common Positions to address foreign governments violating human rights, democracy, or international law, often imposing sanctions. EU sanctions require a formal instrument from the Council of Ministers. Joint Actions may involve civilian or military operations under CSDP, appointing EUSRs, or providing support. The EU has developed a Common Foreign and Security Policy, allowing it to have a strong voice in international politics and security issues. However, the main challenge remains in forming and maintaining consensus among its 27 member states. The EU faces challenges in forming and maintaining consensus among its 27 member states in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). National capitals hold significant influence, leading to differing perspectives and priorities. Disagreements, such as the 2003 Iraq invasion and recognition of Kosovo's independence, highlight the varying degrees of consensus within the EU. Despite disagreements on specific policies, a common approach can still be achieved on different levels. The EU faces challenges in forming consensus in its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Member states France and the UK have pushed to arm opposition troops but faced objections from other members. Some analysts criticize the lack of comprehensive strategic approaches, especially towards Russia and China. EU members have varying priorities on trade, commercial concerns, democracy, and human rights. The EU struggles to form a cohesive strategy in its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), with differing views on engagement, reforms, and behaviors. Critics point to a lack of comprehensive approaches towards Russia and China, with member states hesitant to take unilateral action without EU consensus. Despite improvements from the Lisbon Treaty, the EU still faces challenges in facilitating consensus within the CFSP. The High Representative works with member states' mandates to encourage consensus in CFSP, which remains a common policy. The EU is not a sovereign state, and integration is a gradual process. Strengthening CFSP is crucial for the EU to maintain global relevance, as individual member countries may lose influence without a unified EU. The EU must focus on developing CFSP and strategic partnerships with key countries like the US, Canada, Japan, China, Russia, India, Brazil, and Mexico. CSDP, the operations arm of CFSP, was agreed upon in 1999 and includes military and defense elements. The Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) of the EU focuses on civilian activities like police training, security sector reform, peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions. Efforts are being made to enhance EU countries' military capabilities through targets for improving deployable assets, including plans for rapid reaction forces and multinational \"EU Battlegroups.\" These forces are not a standing \"EU army\" but consist of troops and assets from existing national forces. The EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) focuses on civilian activities like police training, security sector reform, peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions. Efforts are being made to enhance military capabilities through pooling assets among member states and developing national niche capabilities. The European Defense Agency (EDA) was established in 2004 to coordinate defense-industrial and procurement policy. CSDP is meant to be a complementary alternative to NATO, with the Lisbon Treaty confirming NATO's primary role in mutual defense. The EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) allows the EU to act independently when NATO or the UN do not intervene. Key actors include the European Council, Council of Ministers, and High Representative. The Political and Security Committee (PSC) controls CSDP operations, with input from the EU Military Committee (EUMC). EU defense ministers participate in Foreign Affairs Council meetings for security discussions. Specialized support structures are also in place. The EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) allows independent EU action when NATO or the UN do not intervene. Specialized support structures like Crisis Management Planning Directorate, Civilian Planning Conduct Capability, Joint Situation Centre, and EU Military Staff assist in operational planning and implementation. These structures are now part of the External Action Service under the direction of High Representative Ashton. As of February 2013, there are 16 active CSDP missions: 4 military operations and 12 civilian missions. Four new EU missions have been launched in Africa since 2012, with a focus on Mali, Niger/Sahel, South Sudan, and the Horn of Africa. A total of 16 active CSDP missions, including military and civilian operations, are currently ongoing. EU missions are typically carried out with a U.N. mandate or host country agreement, with a historical focus on countries in the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union. The European Union conducts various civilian and military missions in regions like Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina to promote stability and rule of law. EULEX trains officials in Kosovo, while EUFOR Althea is a peace-enforcement mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These missions are driven by a sense of historical responsibility, the vision of a peaceful European continent, and the need to prevent regional instability from affecting the EU. The EU conducts civilian and military missions in regions like Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina to promote stability and rule of law. EULEX trains officials in Kosovo, while EUFOR Althea is a peace-enforcement mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Althea's troop strength stands at 600 as of March 2013. The EU Monitoring Mission (EUMM) is the only official international monitoring presence in Georgia after the 2008 conflict with Russia, with about 300 staff tasked with monitoring ceasefire agreements and promoting stability. The EU also conducts a border assistance mission to Ukraine and Moldova (EUBAM) with approximately 200 staff providing technical assistance along the border. The EU has conducted several civilian and military missions in various regions. The first-ever CSDP mission was a civilian police training mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2003. EUPM concluded in June 2012 with around 35 personnel. The EU has also concluded three CSDP missions in Macedonia, including a military support operation called Concordia in 2003. Additionally, the EU carried out a rule-of-law mission in Georgia from 2004 to 2005. The EU's Themis mission in Georgia aimed to reform criminal legislation and justice processes. The EU has conducted 14 CSDP missions in Africa since 2003, driven by humanitarian concerns, geographical proximity, and historical ties. These missions, often unnoticed in the US, have contributed to international security. In 2013, the EU launched a military training operation in Mali (EUTM Mali). In 2013, the EU launched a military training operation in Mali (EUTM Mali) to train and advise Malian armed forces in restoring law and order. The mission consists of approximately 200 instructors and 300 support staff, headquartered in Bamako with training activities in Koulikoro. The EU also launched a civilian training mission called EUCAP SAHEL Niger in July 2012 to increase the capacity of Nigerien police and security forces to combat terrorism. The EU launched a civilian mission in Niger to strengthen airport security and a military training mission in Somalia. Additionally, the EU Naval Force (Operation Atalanta) is a maritime anti-piracy mission off the coast of Somalia with a force strength of approximately 1,400 personnel. The EU has launched civilian and military missions in Somalia and Niger to strengthen security and train security forces. Additionally, there are small civilian CSDP missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo focusing on security sector reform and police training. In 2007, the EU had 47 staff. Three missions were conducted in the DRC: Operation Artemis in 2003 with 2,000 troops, EUFOR RD Congo in 2006 with 2,400 troops, and EUPOL Kinshasa from 2005 to 2007. EUFOR Tschad/RCA was launched in 2008 to stabilize Chad and Central African Republic. The EU conducted various missions in Africa, including EUFOR Tschad/RCA in eastern Chad and northeastern Central African Republic with 3,700 troops. They also supported the African Union's mission in Sudan/Darfur from 2005 to 2007. The EU conducted a security sector reform mission in Guinea-Bissau from 2008 to 2010, but it ended unsuccessfully due to political developments. The EU has launched missions in the Middle East region with varying levels of European consensus and involvement, including Afghanistan, Israel-Palestinian conflict, and Iraq. The EU has police missions in Afghanistan, the Palestinian Territories, and a border-assistance mission at the Rafah crossing point. These missions aim to mentor and train local police forces, improve law enforcement capacity, and coordinate international efforts for development and self-sufficiency. The EU has various missions in different regions, including a border-assistance mission at the Rafah crossing point between Gaza and Egypt. The mission has been suspended since 2007 and remains on standby for reactivation. Additionally, the EU has a mission in Iraq to train police, prison officials, and judges, as well as a civilian monitoring mission in Aceh, Indonesia to monitor the peace agreement implementation. Perceptions about the results of CSDP are mixed. Perceptions about the results of CSDP operations are mixed, with analysts noting a modest positive contribution to international security. The EU's efforts in burden sharing and collective security have been acknowledged, with a focus on civilian missions reflecting its strengths. The EU's civilian missions reflect its strengths in rule of law and police training, essential for governance development. Despite challenges, there is a growing demand for these capabilities, with calls for the EU to do more in this area. Analysts see civilian operations as key to the future of CSDP, as the EU aims to play a more active global role. However, after nearly 15 years, CSDP has not significantly increased European military capabilities. European militaries face budget constraints and lack key capabilities for expeditionary operations. CSDP missions have had modest success, but concerns persist about defense budgets and transatlantic cooperation. The Eurozone crisis has worsened these issues, prompting austerity measures in many countries. The 113th Congress may focus on how the economic downturn in Europe affects defense capabilities. The 113th Congress may consider how the economic downturn in Europe, particularly the Eurozone debt crisis and budgetary austerity, could impact the transatlantic partnership in terms of international security and military affairs. Analysts suggest that European countries should explore more ambitious defense initiatives, such as pooling resources, joint procurement programs, and deeper defense integration. The Lisbon Treaty allows for \"permanent structured cooperation\" among member states to develop specific defense capabilities. The EU member states prioritize national defense as a core element of state sovereignty, while also valuing pooling, coordination, and integration to enhance defense capabilities. However, national governments are likely to maintain control over their military forces. The Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) reflects evolving European threat perceptions, with some emphasizing traditional military threats for territorial defense, while others focus on broader challenges like economics, demographics, and climate. The EU's strategic thinking prioritizes stabilization, peacekeeping, and crisis management over military force to address threats rooted in economics, demographics, climate, environment, migration, and terrorism. Concerns exist about Europe focusing too much on soft power, potentially leaving the US to bear the burden of providing \"hard\" power. Budget austerity in Europe may lead to cuts in military forces deemed too expensive. The EU aims to enhance its Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) by integrating it with other policy tools to address global challenges. Unlike the intergovernmental nature of some policies, many external policies are managed at the EU level. EU external policies cover areas such as trade, aid, neighborhood policy, and enlargement negotiations, where member states pool their sovereignty and decision-making. EU external policies are most integrated and firmly established in areas such as trade, humanitarian aid, development, and enlargement. The European Commission acts as the policy initiator or lead negotiator with outside countries, with measures approved by member states in the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The Commission is divided into departments called directorates-general (DG) with commissioners overseeing each, similar to U.S. department secretaries or agency heads. The High Representative in the European Commission is responsible for coordinating external relations in trade, humanitarian aid, development, and enlargement. The President of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, represents the EU's policies at the highest level. The EU's trade policies are overseen by the European Commission's directorate-general for trade, which manages a common trade policy for the world's largest trade bloc. In 2011, the EU accounted for about one-sixth of global merchandise trade, valued at approximately \u20ac3.22 trillion. The EU is the largest trade partner for the United States, China, Russia, Brazil, and India, as well as for various regional groupings. The EU is a major player in global trade, accounting for a significant portion of global merchandise trade. It is the largest trade partner for several countries and regional groupings. Additionally, the EU is the world's largest aid donor, providing over 40% of global humanitarian assistance and more than half of global development assistance through detailed frameworks and principles. DG ECHO, managed by the European Commission, delivers emergency EU assistance in crisis situations. The initial budget for 2013 is \u20ac856 million, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. The EuropeAid Development and Cooperation directorate-general addresses long-term issues like poverty, hunger, health, education, and governance. In 2011, the Commission disbursed \u20ac9.2 billion in official development assistance, with over 40% going to Africa. The EU and its member states spent \u20ac53.5 billion on ODA in 2011. Two rounds of enlargement in 2004 and 2007 increased the EU from 15 to 27 member states. The EU's enlargement into Central and Eastern Europe increased its member states from 15 to 27. The accession process involves negotiations with countries meeting democracy and human rights criteria. Croatia is set to join as the 28th member in 2013. There are five official membership candidates and three potential candidates. The European Neighborhood Policy aims to strengthen ties with neighboring countries. The European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) aims to deepen political and economic ties with neighboring countries through bilateral action plans. ENP participants may receive enhanced trade and economic ties with the EU, aid, and technical assistance. ENP also includes regional initiatives like the Eastern Partnership, the Union for the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea Synergy. Trade, aid, development assistance, enlargement process, and neighborhood policy are key instruments in the EU's external policy approach. The EU promotes its values by fostering interdependence through deepening economic ties, bolstering economic conditions and good governance, and encouraging the adoption of EU norms and practices. It exerts collective weight in global trade negotiations, aid forums, and the World Trade Organization. The enlargement process drives reforms in countries aspiring to EU membership. The EU promotes its values by fostering interdependence through deepening economic ties and encouraging the adoption of EU norms. ENP has made modest beginnings in establishing enhanced relations with neighborhood countries. Despite enlargement fatigue, room may be made for Iceland and Western Balkan countries in the future. Turkey's bid for EU membership faces significant obstacles. The EU's enlargement process may reach a stopping point, impacting its ability to influence neighboring countries through membership incentives. The European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) could serve as an alternative way to exert influence, potentially leading to enhanced relationships or \"privileged partnerships\" with countries unlikely to join the EU. ENP was launched in 2004 as a potential pathway for future EU membership. The EU's European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) was launched in 2004 as an alternative to membership incentives for neighboring countries. Critics have noted the limited influence of the EU in North Africa and former Soviet countries. The EU is reassessing the ENP to focus on values and democratic reforms, adding funds, creating partnerships, and improving market access for partner countries. The European Parliament has increased influence on EU foreign policy, especially in CFSP decision making. Representatives of the Council of Ministers consult with the EP on CFSP issues, and the EP indirectly influences member state debates on CFSP through its discussions and activities. The EP may issue resolutions on international issues. The European Parliament may issue resolutions on international issues and has a foreign affairs committee that monitors EU foreign policy. It also has delegations for parliament-to-parliament contacts with countries and regions around the world. The European Parliament plays a significant role in EU decision-making, including oversight of the EU budget and approval of the External Action Service structure. It also has the right to scrutinize non-military parts of the CFSP/CSDP budget and hold confirmation hearings for EU ambassadors. Additionally, under the Lisbon Treaty, the EP acts as a co-legislator in an expanded number of issue areas. The European Parliament's role as a co-legislator has expanded, requiring its consent on external agreements negotiated by the European Commission, including trade deals and security agreements. The EP is asserting itself as a more powerful actor within the EU's institutional triangle, influencing international agreements and legislative proposals. The changing dynamics of transatlantic relations have shifted the focus of U.S. foreign policy towards the Middle East and Asia, leading to a decreased priority on Europe. However, Europe and the United States continue to collaborate on global challenges of mutual interest. Many global challenges have emerged since the Cold War, requiring new capabilities to address. The world is perceived as increasingly multipolar, with countries like China, India, Brazil, and Russia rising in power alongside the United States and Europe. U.S. policymakers consider the role they want the EU to play in the world, viewing it as a potential partner for cooperation to achieve common goals. A united and decisive EU is seen as a better partner for the U.S., while a disunited Europe is deemed ineffective. Some analysts argue for a united Europe to act more assertively in international security issues, while skeptics prefer a bilateral approach with the United States. The debate centers on whether a united Europe should prioritize independence or maintain individual relationships with the U.S. The EU's Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) could become less relevant to the United States if EU policy making shifts to Brussels. Despite common member countries, NATO and the EU struggle to establish a cooperative relationship. Concerns about duplication of defense resources have been raised, but CSDP is increasingly seen as beneficial for building European capabilities and engaging in global challenges. The \"Berlin Plus\" arrangement allows EU-led military missions access to NATO assets, preventing resource duplication. The struggle with generating more European defense capabilities has been playing out in NATO despite the adoption of an updated Strategic Concept in November 2010. Analysts assert that NATO and the EU need to work more complementarily to efficiently use Euro-Atlantic resources. The NATO Strategic Concept emphasizes the need for NATO and the EU to play complementary roles in supporting international peace and security. Disagreements between Turkey and Cyprus hinder deeper cooperation and information sharing between NATO and the EU. Suggestions include dividing military tasks for NATO and peacekeeping missions for the EU, but rigid mandates are rejected. Solutions at the political level remain elusive. Some observers suggest enhancing practical cooperation between NATO and the EU, focusing on identifying mutually beneficial synergies. The recent Strategic Concept emphasizes the need for coordinated planning and mutual support in operations, as well as cooperation in capability development to maximize cost-effectiveness. The EU and NATO serve as the institutional toolbox for addressing global challenges, despite imperfect structures and arrangements. The Euro-Atlantic community has options to choose from EU, NATO, or other institutions based on capabilities and political circumstances. Recent security strategy documents show a convergence of perceptions among the US, EU, NATO, France, Germany, and the UK. A shared security strategy could improve the U.S.-EU-NATO relationship and help address global challenges by bridging institutional worldviews. A shared security strategy could accelerate the development of military and civilian capabilities for EU and NATO member countries. NATO remains central for Euro-Atlantic defense cooperation, but the EU needs to enhance its military capabilities for CSDP to be more credible. The UK blocked a proposal for a consolidated EU military command structure in 2011. The development of CSDP into a robust military actor could impact NATO's future. The future of NATO and the importance of a strong Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) are crucial for transatlantic security. As the U.S. evaluates its role in NATO and basing arrangements in Europe, developments in CSDP are of interest. Despite criticisms, Europe remains the U.S.'s closest global partner. In the evolving security landscape, a strong transatlantic partnership is essential, and addressing challenges collectively is more effective than dealing with them individually. Establishing a stable and enhanced U.S.-EU-NATO dynamic is crucial for transatlantic security. U.S. policymakers should express preferences to overcome resource constraints and ensure that strategy and capabilities align with threats and challenges."
