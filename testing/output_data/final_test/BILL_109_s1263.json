    "content": "The \"Save America's Biotechnology Innovative Research Act of 2005\" or \"SABIR Act\" allows for participation in the Small Business Innovation Research Program. The SABIR Act amends the Small Business Act to establish eligibility requirements for participation in the SBIR program, including having less than 500 employees and being majority owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or eligible venture capital companies. The eligibility requirements for participation in the SBIR program include being majority owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens, not more than 49 percent owned by a single eligible venture capital company, and meeting specific ownership criteria for joint ventures. The term 'employee' in the SBIR program refers to an individual employed by the business concern, excluding those employed by an eligible venture capital company providing financing to the business concern or any entity in which the eligible venture capital company is invested. In cases of ownership by an employee stock option plan, each stock trustee or plan member is considered an owner. In the SBIR program, ownership by a trust or start-up concern is defined. An eligible venture capital company is also defined as a business concern meeting specific criteria. In the SBIR program, an eligible venture capital company is defined as an entity registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or an investment company not registered under the Act because it is beneficially owned by less than 100 persons and is not controlled by a business concern that is not a small business concern. The term 'start-up concern' is defined as a business with limited sales or no positive cash flow for 2 out of 3 fiscal years, not formed for acquiring other businesses. The Small Business Administration must create regulations to implement these provisions within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Act requires the Small Business Administration to promulgate regulations, publish changes in eligibility, and communicate updates to federal agencies for the Small Business Innovation Research program. The amendments apply to businesses participating in the program after the Act's enactment date."
