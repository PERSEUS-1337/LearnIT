    "content": "The \"Philanthropic Facilitation Act\" includes provisions for program-related investments, declaratory judgment remedy, information returns, publicity of information, conforming amendments, regulations, and effective date. The Act aims to facilitate program-related investments. Subsection (c) of section 4944 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to clarify that program-related investments made by private foundations must not jeopardize their charitable purposes, are not considered business holdings, and may qualify as distributions. The amended subsection (c) of section 4944 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 clarifies that program-related investments by private foundations must align with charitable purposes, are not treated as business holdings, and may qualify as distributions. The criteria for qualifying as a program-related investment include the primary purpose being to achieve specific charitable goals, no significant income generation or property appreciation, and not aiming to achieve certain other purposes outlined in the code. Determinations of eligibility are based on all relevant facts and circumstances. The Secretary will establish a procedure similar to recognition of exemption under section 501(a) for entities seeking program-related investments by private foundations. This process will consider all relevant facts and circumstances for determining eligibility. Private foundations can make program-related investments in entities by following a procedure established by the Secretary. Once investments qualify, organizations can rely on the determination unless revoked. Seeking a determination is voluntary, and its absence does not affect a foundation's ability to make program-related investments. Private foundations can make program-related investments based on their own determination that the investment qualifies as such. Organizations treated as private foundations include those under sections 4940 through 4948, regardless of state or tribal law. SEC. 3 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include program-related investments as a declaratory judgment remedy. SEC. 4 introduces a new section for information reporting by for-profit organizations receiving program-related investments. Entities that have program-related investments must file an annual return with specific financial information, including gross income, expenses, and disbursements. This requirement applies when the investments are determined to be program-related by the IRS or a court. Entities with program-related investments must file an annual return including financial details such as disbursements for specific purposes, a balance sheet showing assets and liabilities, names of private foundations with investments, and details on capitalization obtained through investments. The annual return for entities with program-related investments must include distributions made, necessary information for financial reporting, and compliance with expenditure responsibility rules. SEC. 5. PUBLICITY OF INFORMATION. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on the publicity of information regarding organizations receiving program-related investments. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows for public inspection of petitions for program-related investment status and annual information returns of entities receiving determinations from the IRS. Entities receiving a determination from the IRS that private foundation investments are program-related must make petition and annual return copies available at their principal office during business hours. Individuals can request these copies at no charge, except for reproduction and mailing costs, within a three-year period. Entities must make petition and annual return copies available at their principal office during business hours for a three-year period. Requests for copies may be denied if the documents are widely available or if compliance is deemed part of a harassment campaign not in the public interest. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Conforming changes are made to sections 501(n) and 514(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding private foundation investments. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include program-related investments as defined in section 4944(c)(2). The Secretary of the Treasury must amend regulations within 1 year of the Act's enactment to implement amendments and provide examples of qualifying program-related investments. The amendments apply to investments made after the Act's enactment in taxable years ending after that date."
