This includes concerns about immigrants' impact on public budgets and the private economy, particularly in terms of wages and prices. The national debate on immigration focuses on its economic effects, questioning whether it provides net benefits to society. The report discusses the impact of immigrants on the pay and job opportunities of native-born workers, emphasizing the harm that lower wages could cause to U.S. workers. The analysis uses a framework to interpret empirical literature on the subject and concludes with policy implications. The addition of foreign-born workers increases the supply of labor, allowing firms to hire more workers at lower wages. This leads to an expansion of employment beyond the initial level until the last worker hired contributes just enough to match their wage. The addition of foreign-born workers increases the supply of labor, leading to a decrease in the wage rate for all workers. This results in a redistribution of national employment, with native-born employment decreasing and foreign-born employment increasing. As a consequence, some native-born workers may leave the labor force as work becomes less rewarding. The addition of foreign-born workers leads to a decrease in the wage rate for all workers, causing a redistribution of national employment. This results in native-born workers losing jobs to foreign-born workers, known as the \"displacement effect.\" The wage effect depends on labor demand and supply sensitivity to wage rate changes. National income is also redistributed, with less going to native-born workers and more to capital holders and foreign-born workers. Immigration leads to a redistribution of national income, with part going to foreign-born workers and the rest to capital holders. The increase in total employment and national income from immigrants entering the labor market results in a surplus that benefits capital owners. The model assumes homogenous labor and perfect interchangeability between immigrants and native-born workers. Foreign-born workers can be substitutes for native-born workers, affecting different groups based on skill levels. Immigrant inflows can depress wages for less skilled native-born workers but increase demand for complementary skills. The skill composition of foreign-born workers compared to native-born workers influences labor market outcomes. Immigration impacts labor supply in the short run, not labor demand. In the short run, immigration affects labor supply but not labor demand. Immigrants may expand aggregate output and increase labor demand through investments and purchasing U.S.-produced goods. This could mitigate adverse consequences for native-born workers. The model does not consider long-run adjustments native-born workers might make in response to immigration. In response to immigration, native-born workers can improve their labor market prospects by investing in their human capital through education and training. This can increase their productivity in current jobs or lead to changing occupations. Additionally, native-born workers can make long-run adjustments by moving across local economies to areas with fewer competitors and better opportunities. This mobility of factors of production can help offset any initial adverse effects of immigration and equalize the net gain for all native-born labor force participants. The theory suggests that native-born workers may be negatively impacted by immigration as it increases the labor supply available to employers. This could lead to lower wages and reduced job prospects for native-born workers. Additionally, movements of labor, capital, and goods from high-immigrant areas to other parts of the country could spread immigration's labor market impacts. The presence of foreign-born workers in the U.S. labor force has increased since the 1970s, but they make up less than one-fifth of participants. Immigration is unlikely to have significantly affected the average native-born worker's wages or job prospects, unless immigrants are concentrated in specific geographic areas. In such cases, native-born workers in those communities with similar characteristics to foreign-born workers might be impacted. The impact of immigrant population on the labor market outcomes of native-born workers has been studied in areas with high versus low concentrations of immigrants. Most studies found little difference in wage and employment experiences overall, or by race, gender, or skill level. Some studies showed a slight negative impact on low-skilled native-born workers. The impact of immigrant population on the labor market outcomes of native-born workers has been studied in areas with high versus low concentrations of immigrants. Most studies found little difference in wage and employment experiences overall, or by race, gender, or skill level. Some studies showed a slight negative impact on low-skilled native-born workers. Spatially based studies suggest that immigrants have no measurable effect on particular labor markets, but do not provide a complete picture of immigration's economy-wide effects. The mobility of labor and production factors could disperse the local effects of immigration across the nation. The impact of immigration on the labor market outcomes of native-born workers has been studied at both local and national levels. While spatially based studies suggest immigrants have no measurable effect on specific labor markets, national analyses have shown that immigration may contribute to wage inequality by increasing concentration at the lower end of the wage distribution. Various factors, including skill-biased technological change, international trade, minimum wage levels, wage-setting institutions, and immigration, have been identified as potential contributors to this trend. National analyses suggest that immigration has shifted the nation's skill composition towards more inexperienced workers without a high school degree, negatively impacting the labor market prospects of low-skilled native-born workers. However, the extent of this effect varies depending on how low-skilled workers are defined. Early studies using the \"factor-proportions\" methodology may have overstated immigrants' wage effects on U.S. workers by not directly estimating the responsiveness of natives' wages to the increase in low-skilled workers. Recent researchers taking a national approach have addressed criticisms of overestimating immigrants' wage effects on U.S. workers. Economy-wide analyses may also overstate immigration impact if they do not consider natives adjusting by pursuing more education or different career paths to avoid job competition with immigrants. The assumption that native-born workers quickly offset the effects of immigration is questionable, as past economic shocks have shown longer adjustment periods. The relationship between immigration and internal labor migration remains unresolved. The National Research Council found that immigration has a small adverse impact on the wage and employment opportunities of native-born workers, with effects dispersed across the United States as native workers migrate out of areas with high immigrant concentrations. The beneficial effect of immigrant groups on native labor and capital suggests a minimal negative impact on native workers' earnings, as shown by Bean, Lowell, and Taylor's study on Mexican immigrants in 1980. Legal Mexican immigrants slightly lowered the earnings of native-born women and non-Hispanic white men, while not affecting native-born minorities. The impact of authorized and unauthorized Mexican immigrants on the earnings of native-born workers was minimal, with unauthorized immigrants potentially raising the earnings of all groups except Mexican-origin men. Legal immigrants may compete for \"primary\" jobs, while unauthorized immigrants may take \"secondary\" jobs that are less attractive to native-born workers. Overall, there was no significant evidence that immigrants reduce the annual earnings of young native-born black and Hispanic males. The impact of immigration on the earnings of native-born workers, particularly less-skilled individuals, was analyzed by Altonji and Card. They found that immigration significantly reduced the earnings of less-skilled native-born workers with 12 or fewer years of schooling. Additionally, the study concluded that foreign-born labor inflows had neither a large nor systematically positive or negative impact on the job opportunities of less-skilled individuals. The impact of immigration on the job opportunities of less-skilled native-born workers was not significantly positive or negative overall. Some displacement was observed in high-immigrant cities in industries with large immigrant numbers, but overall employment outcomes were unaffected. Card's analysis of 1990 census data showed that recent immigrants in certain occupations had an impact on both native-born workers and earlier immigrants. Immigrants admitted to the United States between 1985 and 1990 in low-skilled occupations slightly reduced employment rates for natives and older immigrants in the same group. In cities where the influx of low-skilled foreign-born workers was significant, employment rates for young, less-educated natives were notably affected. However, the increase in male immigrants without high school diplomas had only a small adverse effect on the employment of native-born dropouts, with no impact on wages. Card's research suggests that industries in high-immigrant areas relying on low-skilled labor have absorbed the increase in immigrant supply without harming native-born workers. Schoeni's study in the 1970s and 1980s found that immigration has the largest adverse effect on the earnings of natives with less than a high school degree. Increased immigration during the 1970s and 1980s had negative effects on the wages and employment of low-skilled native-born workers, particularly those with less than a high school degree. Increased immigration during the 1970s and 1980s negatively impacted the wages and employment of low-skilled native-born workers. Schoeni's analysis in the 1980s showed that immigration had a significant effect on native-born workers with 12 or less years of schooling. However, he concluded that the economy-wide effects were small in 1990 as more than half of all workers were unaffected. Johannsson and Weiler's study from 1998-2002 found that metropolitan areas with an increase in low-skilled immigrant population had lower labor force participation rates among similar native-born workers, leading to reduced unemployment rates for low-skilled natives in those areas. Increased immigration during the 1970s and 1980s negatively impacted the wages and employment of low-skilled native-born workers. Topel's analysis in the 1980s showed that the wage gap between low-skilled and high-skilled men widened in every region, with the West experiencing the largest decline in low-skilled men's relative wage due to the increased presence of immigrants in the labor force. This led to a reduction in the supply of low-skilled men compared to high-skilled men, resulting in a larger fall in the relative wage of low-skilled men. Increased immigration during the 1970s and 1980s negatively impacted the wages and employment of low-skilled native-born workers. Topel's analysis in the 1980s showed that the wage gap between low-skilled and high-skilled men widened in every region, with the West experiencing the largest decline in low-skilled men's relative wage due to the increased presence of immigrants in the labor force. Enchautegui examined the decline in real wages among workers without a high school diploma in the 1980s, attributing just 4% of the 13% decline to the influx of low-skilled foreign-born labor. From a national perspective, the increase in the supply of foreign-born workers without a high school degree had little impact on the erosion in low-skilled workers' earnings during that time. The presence of low-skilled foreign-born workers in areas of high immigration accounted for a significant portion of the decline in wages for low-skilled workers during the 1980s. In Los Angeles, the change in the proportion of natives and immigrants contributed to more than half of the wage decline. Another study examined the impact of immigration on wages by looking at occupational differences in immigrants' share of employment. The study analyzed the impact of immigration on wages by examining occupational differences in immigrants' share of employment. As the share of foreign-born employment in an occupation increased, the earnings of native-born workers decreased. Specifically, for every 1% increase in immigrant composition, the weekly wage of the average native-born worker declined by 0.5%. Low-skilled labor was most affected, with a 1% increase in foreign-born employment share leading to a 0.66% reduction in weekly wages for natives with 12 or fewer years of schooling. Immigration significantly impacted the declining relative wage of low-skilled workers, with a 1% increase in immigrant composition leading to a 0.8% decrease in weekly wages for native workers in low-skilled occupations. Borjas, Freeman, and Katz found that immigration had little effect on wage inequality or the wage gap between college and high school graduates. They estimated that immigration between 1980 and 1995 expanded the supply of workers with less than a high school degree by 15%, affecting the relative wage of low-skilled natives. Immigration had a significant impact on the declining relative wage of low-skilled workers, with a 44% decrease in wages for workers with less than 12 years of schooling over a 15-year period. Borjas' analysis showed that an increase in immigrant labor supply between 1960-2000 reduced wages and employment for native-born men in similar skill groups. Between 1980 and 2000, immigration led to a decrease in wages for native-born workers across all skill groups, with young males without a high school degree being the most affected. The overall wage impact of increased immigration was moderated over time as the capital stock adjusted to the greater labor supply. The impact of immigration on wages for native-born workers varied depending on education and experience levels. Two researchers found that workers with at most a high school degree were close substitutes for those without one, reducing the competitive effect of immigrants on the least skilled native-born workers. In the long run, the average real wage of U.S. workers increased slightly (by 0.6%) due to immigration from 1990-2006. Short-term wage impact on native-born workers was negative but small (0.4%). Recent immigrants had the largest negative effect (6%) on previous immigrants. In January 2009, Card presented a lecture to the American Economic Association where he found common ground between cross-city studies and Ottaviano and Peri's national study. Using city-specific labor market measures from 1980 to 2005/2006, Card estimated the impact of immigration on wages, suggesting that workers with less than a high school education are perfect substitutes for workers with a high school education. The findings argue for using two education classes when estimating the impact of immigration on wages. Card's research suggests that immigrants and native-born workers in the same education groups are not perfect substitutes, unlike Borjas' assumption. The influx of immigrants since 1980 has had a minimal impact on the relative wages of native-born workers due to the similar distribution of college-equivalent workers between immigrants and natives. Immigrant arrivals have had little impact on the college-high school wage gap. Borjas, Grogger, and Hanson found that immigration led to declines in earnings for black and white men in certain skill groups, with black men experiencing greater decreases in employment and increases in incarceration rates. Immigration contributed to significant changes in employment and incarceration rates among black men since 1960. In the past four decades, there has been a substantial decrease in black employment and an increase in black incarceration rates. Some policymakers suggest strengthening the U.S. border with Mexico to limit unauthorized immigration and enforcing stricter sanctions on employers hiring low-skilled workers. Changing the composition of legal immigration, such as admitting high-skilled individuals under employment-based categories, is also proposed to address distributional issues. If the skill levels of immigrants vary by admission category, an across-the-board cutback in immigration may not help low-skilled U.S. workers. Changing the composition of immigration may not be the most effective solution to improve the situation of low-skilled native-born workers. Several explanations have been offered for the increase in U.S. wage inequality, including the role of skill-biased technological change. Curtailing the immigration of low-skilled foreign-born workers may not significantly impact the wage and employment outcomes of low-skilled U.S. workers. Shifting the composition of foreign-born persons entering the U.S. towards more skilled individuals could have unintended consequences, such as affecting the job opportunities of native-born workers in high-skilled occupations. Despite debates, Congress made amendments to the H-1B visa program to address the inadequate supply of native-born workers. Despite conflicting research results, there is no consensus on the impact of increasing foreign-born workers on high-skilled native-born workers in IT jobs. Some studies suggest that while H-1B workers may not depress wages, they could affect unemployment rates. Other analyses indicate that an increase in immigrants does not harm wages in professional occupations. Some studies show that H-1B workers in computer programming occupations are paid much less than U.S. workers in the same state, but the number of H-1B programmers may not be large enough to impact native-born programmers' wages. Another study found that an influx of foreign students in a doctoral field reduced earnings for competing science and engineering Ph.D. students. The admission of more high-skilled foreign-born workers may make it harder for low-skilled native-born workers to avoid wage suppression and displacement. This could impact the distributional effects of immigration and the need for students and low-skilled workers to acquire higher order skills to compete with immigrants."
