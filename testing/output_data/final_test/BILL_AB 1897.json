    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature in California acknowledges the historical development of licensing for community care facilities, particularly for infants and toddlers. While the current standards are deemed appropriate, the dual licensing system for early care is seen as unnecessary and problematic. California is one of only two states with a separate infant-toddler license, while other states have a single license for early childhood centers with age-appropriate standards. The Legislature in California aims to introduce a new facility license option for children from birth to entering first grade. This new license option will not replace existing infant, preschool, and toddler licenses but will be an additional option. It will require children to be grouped by developmental levels with appropriate staff-child ratios and group sizes. Children transition to age-appropriate classrooms based on their developmental level and group needs. Supervision by qualified staff is required, and toddlers can be grouped with infants or preschoolers. The focus is on improving early care and education quality for children up to first grade. Efforts are made to enhance efficiency in the Community Care Licensing Division through paperwork reduction and compliance visits. Efforts to improve efficiency in evaluating and licensing day care centers for children up to first grade are being made by implementing a single inspection visit. This will allow for a more holistic evaluation, leading to stronger health and safety practices. Providers will have the flexibility to choose the best facility license option for their specific needs, ultimately reducing costs and opening more spaces for children in California. The department will adopt regulations by January 1, 2018, for a birth to first grade license option for day care centers, including age-appropriate transition periods and considerations for children's needs and maximizing spaces. The regulations for a birth to first grade license option for day care centers include requirements for listing age groups served, applying all licensing regulations, and charging a fee for new applicants. A day care center licensee must maintain a facility that meets regulatory standards for the age groups of children in their care until a birth to first grade license option is obtained. Inspection standards will be based on the current license. Stakeholders consulted for regulations include State Department of Education, California Association for the Education of Young Children, Early Edge California, First 5 California, Children Now, Alliance for Early Success, and various other organizations."
