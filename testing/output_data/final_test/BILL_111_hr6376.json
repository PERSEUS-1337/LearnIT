REQUIREMENTS FOR PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION OF THERAPEUTIC HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT SERVICES.\" is about the regulations and guidelines regarding physician supervision of therapeutic hospital outpatient services. The text chunk discusses the physician supervision requirements for therapeutic hospital outpatient services under the Social Security Act. It specifies that general supervision by a physician or non-physician practitioner is required for payment, with exceptions for high-risk or complex medical cases. The Secretary will establish a process for designating therapeutic hospital outpatient services that require direct supervision due to complexity or high risk. Clinical experts will be consulted before designating such services. The Secretary will consult with a panel of outside experts, appointed based on nominations from hospital, rural health, and medical organizations, to advise on the supervision of therapeutic hospital outpatient services. The panel advising on the supervision of therapeutic hospital outpatient services must consist of at least 15 physicians and non-physician practitioners representing relevant medical specialties with practical experience in providing these services. The panel advising on therapeutic hospital outpatient services must have at least 50% rural representation among physicians and non-physician practitioners. The Secretary will consider a critical access hospital to have met the direct supervision requirement for designated outpatient services if the hospital meets personnel standards outlined in regulations. The Secretary will take into account compliance burdens on hospitals and critical access hospitals for direct supervision of therapeutic outpatient services, including resources, physician availability, and administrative burdens. Designation of services requiring direct supervision will only be done through notice and comment rulemaking. The Secretary will designate initial therapeutic hospital outpatient services for direct supervision in the proposed and final regulation for payment in 2012. Non-physician practitioners may supervise certain hospital outpatient services under specific conditions. Non-physician practitioners may directly supervise therapeutic hospital outpatient services, including cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation, as well as certain diagnostic services that require direct supervision under the fee schedule. Requirements must be met for non-physician practitioners to be eligible for this role.
