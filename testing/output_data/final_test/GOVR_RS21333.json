    "content": "Between 1969 and 1999, around 3,500 people died in political violence in Northern Ireland during \"the Troubles,\" a conflict rooted in the division of Ireland in 1921. The struggle involves Protestants (unionists) who identify as British and support UK incorporation, and Catholics (nationalists) who see themselves as Irish and desire a united Ireland. Loyalists and republicans, representing more militant factions, have used force to achieve their goals. The Troubles reignited in late 1968 with a civil rights movement led by discriminated Catholics. The civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, led by Catholics facing discrimination, was met with violence from unionists and police. This led to armed action by nationalists and republicans, prompting the UK government to deploy the British Army in 1969 and impose direct rule in 1972. After years of conflict, the Good Friday Agreement was reached on April 10, 1998, aiming to bring peace to Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, established the \"consent principle\" that any change in Northern Ireland's status requires the majority's consent. It recognized the desire for a united Ireland but also the majority in Northern Ireland wanting to remain part of the UK. The agreement included provisions for future polls on Northern Ireland's constitutional status if needed. The Good Friday Agreement established devolved government in Northern Ireland with power-sharing between unionist and nationalist parties. Key decisions required cross-community support to prevent domination. Provisions included decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, policing, human rights, demilitarization, and prisoner status. The Good Friday Agreement established devolved government in Northern Ireland with power-sharing between unionist and nationalist parties. Key decisions required cross-community support to prevent domination. Provisions included decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, policing, human rights, demilitarization, and prisoner status. Negotiations were contentious, leading to a final text with \"constructive ambiguity.\" New North-South and East-West institutions were created, including a North-South Ministerial Council and a British-Irish Council. Voters in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland approved the agreement in separate referendums on May 22, 1998, followed by elections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly on June 25, 1998. The new Northern Ireland Assembly, with 108 seats, took place on June 25, 1998. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) won 28 and 24 seats respectively. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) won 20 seats, Sinn Fein won 18, and smaller parties claimed the rest. Despite improved security since the Good Friday Agreement, full implementation has been challenging due to decommissioning and police reforms. Sporadic violence from dissident groups and sectarian strife between Protestants and Catholics continue. The peace process and sectarian strife between Protestants and Catholics fueled mistrust between unionist and nationalist communities. Assembly elections were held in June 1998, but devolution of power to Belfast was delayed due to unionist concerns about decommissioning paramilitary weapons. The Good Friday Agreement called for using only democratic, non-violent means in office, but unionists insisted on IRA weapons surrender before Sinn Fein could assume ministerial posts. The IRA, viewing decommissioning as surrender, resisted calls despite a ceasefire since 1997. In 1999, George Mitchell led a review of the Good Friday Agreement, convincing unionists to allow Sinn Fein representatives to assume ministerial posts without IRA decommissioning. Authority over local affairs was transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive on December 1, 1999. However, the devolved government was suspended in February 2000 due to First Minister Trimble's potential resignation over the lack of IRA decommissioning. After ongoing frustration with the lack of IRA decommissioning, Trimble resigned as First Minister on July 1, 2001. Negotiations to restore the devolved government were difficult, but in late October 2001, the IRA announced arms were put \"beyond use.\" The UUP rejoined the Executive, and the Assembly reconvened in November 2001. Trimble was reelected First Minister, and Mark Durkan became Deputy First Minister. In April 2002, the IRA carried out a second act of decommissioning. In October 2002, police raided Sinn Fein's Assembly offices and arrested four officials in connection with a suspected IRA spy ring. The UUP and DUP threatened to withdraw from the government unless Sinn Fein was expelled. London suspended the devolved government on October 14, 2002, leading to Assembly elections in November 2003. The elections saw a shift in power favoring hard-liners, with the DUP overtaking the UUP as the dominant unionist party and Sinn Fein becoming the largest nationalist party. In 2004, negotiations to restore the devolved government were stalemated. The DUP refused to enter government with Sinn Fein until the IRA disarmed and disbanded. Talks were complicated by a December 2004 bank robbery in Belfast believed to be carried out by the IRA and the January 2005 murder of Robert McCartney. Pressure increased on the IRA and Sinn Fein to address IRA criminality. In April 2005, Gerry Adams called on the IRA to abandon violence. In July 2005, the IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign. In July 2005, the IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign and instructed members to pursue objectives through peaceful means. Unionists were wary, as the statement did not address IRA criminality or disbandment. The DUP wanted Sinn Fein to support Northern Ireland's new police service. In September 2005, the IICD confirmed the IRA had put all arms beyond use. In October 2006, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern proposed the St. Andrews Agreement to break the political stalemate in Northern Ireland. The agreement called for negotiations between November 2006 and March 2007, leading to a power-sharing government formed on May 8, 2007, between the DUP and Sinn Fein. Sinn Fein's historic resolution to support Northern Ireland's police and criminal justice system was seen as a significant step towards reconciliation. On May 8, 2007, a power-sharing government was formed in Northern Ireland with Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness as First Minister and Deputy First Minister, respectively. The deal between the DUP and Sinn Fein was seen as a significant step towards reconciliation, although tensions still existed within the government and between unionist and nationalist communities. The Good Friday Agreement had previously failed to reach an accord on sensitive matters like policing and prisons. The parties in Northern Ireland reached an agreement to postpone the devolution of policing and justice powers due to disagreements over the timeline. This led to a standstill in the Assembly until a road map was agreed upon in late November 2008. The DUP and Sinn Fein agreed to establish a Northern Ireland Justice Department with an independent attorney general. They also decided on a system for selecting a justice minister through a cross-community vote in the Assembly. Progress on transferring police and justice powers to the devolved government was slow, causing concerns about political instability. British and Irish Prime Ministers held a summit in January 2010 to push for a deal on devolving authority for policing and justice affairs. On February 4, 2010, the DUP and Sinn Fein reached the Hillsborough Agreement, setting April 12, 2010, for the devolution of policing and justice authority from London to Belfast. The agreement also addressed managing contentious sectarian parades. On April 12, power over policing and justice affairs was transferred to Belfast, with David Ford elected as Northern Ireland's new Justice Minister. Police reforms are crucial for achieving peace in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement called for police reforms in Northern Ireland, including changes to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) to ensure widespread community support. The independent Patten Commission released a report with 175 recommendations, proposing a new name, badge, and symbols for the RUC. This was seen as crucial for achieving peace in Northern Ireland. The Patten Commission recommended reforms for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland, including a new name, badge, and symbols. The Police (Northern Ireland) Bill was introduced in the UK House of Commons in May 2000, with measures to reduce the force size and increase Catholic officers. The bill became law in November 2000, leading to the recruitment of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in March 2001. Nationalists criticized the amendments made to the Patten report's proposals. The PSNI was established in March 2001, with uncertainty over SDLP and Sinn Fein support for the Policing Board. London proposed concessions in July 2001 to gain nationalist support, leading to the SDLP accepting additional policing concessions in August. The Policing Board, with UUP and DUP members, was formed on November 4, 2001, with the first class of recruits from both Catholic and Protestant communities starting training. Sinn Fein criticized the changes as cosmetic. Sinn Fein initially criticized the cosmetic changes in the police service and expressed concerns about the PSNI being influenced by security services opposed to the peace process. Their absence from the Policing Board hindered more Catholics from joining the PSNI. Sinn Fein's acceptance of the PSNI and the Policing Board was contingent on a deal to revive devolved government and transfer policing powers. They eventually voted to support the police and joined the Policing Board in 2007. In March 2011, the 50-50 recruitment process for Catholic and Protestant PSNI officers was ended by UK officials, citing that Catholic officers now made up almost 30% of the PSNI. Some nationalists felt it was premature, while many unionists welcomed the decision, seeing the 50-50 rule as biased against Protestants. Concerns have risen about low Catholic recruitment due to suspicions within the community and fears of being targeted by dissident republicans. Only 77 out of 401 new officers recruited between 2013 and 2015 were Catholic. In 2015, only 77 out of 401 new officers recruited were Catholic. The PSNI introduced procedural changes in 2017 to attract more Catholics and women. The British army ended its military operation in Northern Ireland in 2007. Policing is now the responsibility of the PSNI, with 5,000 British troops remaining in Northern Ireland. Analysts view the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as mostly completed. In 2011, the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive completed its first full term in 40 years, with power-sharing governments led by the DUP and Sinn Fein. Despite ongoing distrust between unionists and nationalists, events like flag protests and political controversies have strained community relations and threatened government stability. In January 2017, the devolved government collapsed after 10 months, leading to snap Assembly elections. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein collapsed, leading to snap Assembly elections due to a scandal over flaws in a renewable energy program (RHI) overseen by First Minister Foster. The RHI problems are expected to cost Northern Ireland taxpayers \u00a3490 million. Sinn Fein called for Foster to step aside during an investigation, McGuinness resigned in protest. New elections were called for March 2, 2017, after Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned due to health reasons. Arlene Foster led the DUP's campaign, while Michelle O'Neill succeeded McGuinness as Sinn Fein's leader in Northern Ireland. Tensions with the DUP on various issues, including the RHI scandal, led Sinn Fein to force snap Assembly elections amid Brexit uncertainty. The DUP's support for Brexit, despite Northern Ireland voting against it, also played a role in the decision for new elections. In the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly elections, Sinn Fein made significant gains, reducing the gap with the DUP to just one seat. Key issues included the potential Irish Language Act and legalizing same-sex marriage, both supported by Sinn Fein but opposed by the DUP. The high voter turnout of almost 65% was fueled by anger over the energy scandal and concerns about Brexit's impact on Northern Ireland. The 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly elections favored Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party, leading to a loss of overall majority for unionist parties. The DUP's ability to trigger a \"petition of concern\" was also impacted. Despite continued polarization, negotiations for a devolved government remain stalled, with Sinn Fein's demands being a major sticking point. The biggest obstacle in reaching an agreement for a new devolved government in Northern Ireland is Sinn Fein's demand for a stand-alone Irish Language Act, which the DUP opposes. The 2017 UK general election and subsequent minority government have made negotiations more challenging. In February 2018, the DUP and Sinn Fein were close to a deal, but it fell through due to concerns about a \"package deal\" addressing language and cultural issues. Sinn Fein's demand for an Irish Language Act is a major obstacle to reaching a new devolved government in Northern Ireland. DUP opposes this demand, leading to difficulties in negotiations. In February 2018, a potential deal between DUP and Sinn Fein fell through over concerns about addressing language and cultural issues. Foster urged the UK government to make policy decisions, while Sinn Fein's leader, Mary Lou McDonald, rejected the idea of direct rule. Secretary of State Karen Bradley emphasized the importance of devolved government for Northern Ireland. Bradley and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney met with political parties in February 2019 to discuss proposals for restarting negotiations. Both Bradley and Coveney pledged to present proposals to restart negotiations for a new devolved government in Northern Ireland. The ongoing internal debate within the UK on Brexit, particularly the \"backstop\" issue, has overshadowed discussions on the devolved government. Progress on this matter is expected after Brexit and the backstop are resolved. Speculation exists about the potential establishment of joint authority by the British and Irish governments if a devolved government cannot be formed, but this is unlikely to be accepted by the DUP and other unionists. In the absence of a devolved government, Sinn Fein has called for the reconvening of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to promote cooperation between British and Irish ministers. Efforts have been made to resolve issues related to the peace process and reduce tensions between unionist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland. Efforts to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland have included initiatives such as the 2013 Haass initiative, the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, and the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement. Former U.S. diplomat Richard Haass was appointed to chair interparty talks addressing divisive issues like dealing with the past, sectarian strife, paramilitary activity, and dissident activity. Despite releasing a draft proposal in December 2013, a final agreement was not reached among Northern Ireland political parties. In 2014, the devolved government in Northern Ireland faced financial pressures and disagreements over UK-wide welfare reforms, leading to spending cuts and decreased public confidence in the government's effectiveness. First Minister Peter Robinson called for new interparty discussions to improve Northern Ireland's institutions. In 2014, the UK government announced talks with Northern Ireland's main political parties to address government stability, finances, and issues previously tackled by Richard Haass in 2013. On December 23, 2014, a broad agreement was reached on financial and welfare reform, governing structures, and contentious issues like parades, flags, and the past as part of the \"Stormont House Agreement.\" In the \"Stormont House Agreement,\" the five main political parties in Northern Ireland agreed to support welfare reform, balance the budget, address economic reliance on the public sector, and reduce government departments and Assembly members. London and Dublin welcomed the agreement, while some parties had reservations about issues like parades, Irish Language Act, and a bill of rights. In early 2015, the devolved government introduced a welfare reform bill as part of the Stormont House Agreement. However, Sinn Fein blocked the bill in March 2015, accusing the DUP of not fully protecting welfare claimants. This impasse also hindered progress on other aspects of the agreement, raising concerns about the collapse of the devolved government. On September 3, 2015, the UK and Irish governments decided to convene a new round of discussions. On September 9, 2015, the devolved government was rocked by the arrest of Bobby Storey, a senior Sinn Fein leader, in connection with the murder of ex-IRA member Kevin McGuigan. PSNI Police Chief George Hamilton stated that the IRA still existed, but McGuigan's murder was not sanctioned by them. Sinn Fein claimed the IRA had disbanded. Storey and two others were released without charge. The McGuigan killing and Storey's arrest raised unionist concerns about IRA activities, complicating the Stormont House Agreement implementation. A new \"Fresh Start Agreement\" was reached on November 17, 2015, welcomed in Northern Ireland but faced objections from other political parties. Negotiators failed to establish new institutions to address the past as per the Stormont House Agreement. The Fresh Start Agreement focused on welfare reform and stability improvements. The Fresh Start Agreement in Northern Ireland aimed to reform welfare and improve budget stability. The UK parliament implemented changes to the welfare system and provided a financial package of \u00a3585 million. In return, the UK government pledged up to \u00a3500 million for unique issues in Northern Ireland, such as security concerns and removing peace walls. Institutional reforms were also confirmed, including reducing the size of the Assembly from 108 to 90 members. The Fresh Start Agreement in Northern Ireland aimed to reform welfare, improve budget stability, and address paramilitary activity. It reduced the Assembly size from 108 to 90 members, decreased government departments, and established obligations to combat organized crime. Despite progress since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, peace and reconciliation efforts remain challenging. Despite progress since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, peace and reconciliation efforts in Northern Ireland remain challenging. Controversial issues include bridging sectarian divisions, managing key sticking points, dealing with the past, curbing paramilitary activity, and furthering economic development. The 2013 Haass initiative, the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, and the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement have attempted to address these challenges, but some measures have been delayed due to the absence of a devolved government. Concerns also exist about the potential implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland, which remains a divided society with Protestant and Catholic communities living parallel lives. Peace walls separating neighborhoods serve as a visible reminder of this division. The presence of peace walls in Northern Ireland, separating Protestant and Catholic communities, is a visible symbol of the ongoing sectarian divisions. Despite efforts by the Northern Ireland Executive to remove these barriers, a significant portion of the population still supports their existence. Additionally, many people have limited interaction with those from the other community, leading to predominantly single-identity schools and housing estates in the region. During the annual summer \"marching season\" in Northern Ireland, unionist parades commemorating Protestant history can be contentious, especially when held near Catholic communities. The existing Parades Commission, which arbitrates disputes over parade routes, is seen as biased by many Protestant organizations. Efforts to establish a new parading structure have stalled, with the DUP-Sinn Fein-led Northern Ireland Executive proposing new parades legislation in 2010. The DUP-Sinn Fein-led Northern Ireland Executive proposed new parades legislation in mid-2010 to abolish the Parades Commission and promote local solutions to disputed marches. The Protestant Orange Order opposed elements of the plan, emphasizing the need for their support. Frictions between unionist and nationalist communities were highlighted by protests in late 2012-early 2013 over the decision to fly the UK flag at Belfast City Hall only on designated days. In Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland, tensions rose with violent protests and death threats towards leaders. Talks led by Richard Haass in 2013 focused on parading, protests, and flags. A proposed agreement in December 2013 suggested a commission for public discussions on flags and emblems. The Stormont House Agreement in December 2014 supported the idea of a new Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture, and Tradition. The Haass proposals recommended setting up a new Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture, and Tradition with 15 members, transferring authority over parading to the devolved government, establishing two new institutions for event notifications and decision-making in disputes, and implementing a code of conduct for marchers and protesters. The Stormont House Agreement agreed to devolve responsibility for parades and protests to the Northern Ireland Assembly without providing specific details. The Stormont House Agreement did not provide specifics on parading institutions proposed by Haass. The Fresh Start Agreement in November 2015 aimed to move forward with measures on flags and parades. The Commission on Flags began work in June 2016, and a discussion paper on parading legislation is expected to address key issues like a code of conduct. The discussion paper on parading in Northern Ireland has not been presented due to the impasse in the devolved government. Addressing the legacy of violence is controversial, with various legal processes in place for examining crimes from the Troubles. Critics argue that these processes represent a piecemeal approach. Critics argue that legal processes for examining Troubles-related deaths are piecemeal, with over 3,000 unsolved deaths. The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) reviewed 3,200 deaths but progress was slow. The costly Bloody Sunday inquiry took 12 years to complete. Analysts and advocates call for a comprehensive mechanism to address Northern Ireland's past. Many in Northern Ireland disagree on how to address the past conflict, with differing narratives from unionists and nationalists. Recommendations from the Consultative Group on the Past in 2009 were criticized, leading to talks chaired by Richard Haass in 2013. The Stormont House Agreement in 2014 endorsed Haass's proposals for new mechanisms to handle police investigations and support victims and survivors. The Stormont House Agreement in 2014 endorsed new mechanisms for dealing with the past conflict in Northern Ireland. This included the establishment of the Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to handle outstanding cases from the HET process and the Police Ombudsman, overseen by the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Additionally, the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval (ICIR) was set up to allow victims and survivors to privately seek information about conflict-related violence. The ICIR was established to allow victims to seek information privately about conflict-related violence without disclosing their identities to law enforcement. The Northern Ireland Executive planned to create an Oral History Archive for sharing experiences related to the Troubles. The Implementation and Reconciliation Group (IRG) would oversee reconciliation efforts and reduce sectarianism. The UK government proposed legislation for the establishment of the HIU, ICIR, and IRG in September 2015. The UK government's proposal for legislation to establish the HIU, ICIR, and Oral History Archive faced delays amid a crisis in the devolved government. Controversy arose over national security caveats giving the UK government veto power over information release by the HIU, leading to divisions and hindering the final deal on establishing the bodies. The UK government's proposal for legislation to establish the HIU, ICIR, and Oral History Archive faced delays due to national security caveats. Concerns were raised about the government's veto power over information release by the HIU, hindering the final deal on establishing the bodies. Sinn Fein proposed an international panel of judges for appeals instead of the High Court to address concerns about \"national security caveats\" hindering the implementation of provisions in the Stormont House Agreement. The UK government launched a public consultation on a draft bill to establish legacy institutions, including the HIU, ICIR, Oral History Archive, and IRG, to address Northern Ireland's legacy of violence. The HIU would have a caseload of about 1,700 Troubles-related deaths. Concerns have been raised about potential bias against former soldiers and police officers. Nationalists oppose any statute of limitations on prosecutions. Human rights groups criticize the neglect of injured individuals' cases. The public consultation findings are pending release. The review commissioned by former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Villiers in 2015 found that all main paramilitary groups from the Troubles still exist but are on cease-fire, with their leadership committed to peaceful means. The findings of the review, conducted by the PSNI and MI5, have not been released yet. The main paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland are on cease-fire, with their leadership committed to peaceful means. While they still organize along militaristic lines, they are not planning or conducting terrorist attacks. However, individual members pose a threat to national security through violence and organized crime. The Fresh Start Agreement aimed to address these concerns by establishing new principles for members of the Executive and Assembly. The Fresh Start Agreement introduced new principles for members of the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland to work towards disbanding paramilitary organizations, challenge their control over communities, and not take instructions from them. It also established an independent panel, an international monitoring body, and a Joint Agency Task Force to tackle paramilitarism and organized crime across the island of Ireland. Some politicians and analysts felt that the proposals did not go far enough, with unionists expressing dissatisfaction with the new international monitoring body. The Fresh Start Agreement included increased security spending, with a focus on improving the PSNI's capabilities to address dissident groups and paramilitarism. A Three Person Panel made recommendations for disbanding paramilitary groups, leading to an action plan by Northern Ireland's Executive in July 2016. The Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) was established in September 2016 to monitor progress on ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. Despite some progress, paramilitarism remains a significant issue, exacerbated by the lack of political decision-making institutions since January 2017. Security assessments highlight the serious threat posed by dissident republican and loyalist groups opposed to the 1998 peace agreement. The 1998 peace agreement in Northern Ireland is still a serious issue. A review in October 2015 found that dissident republicans, not the evaluated paramilitary groups, pose the most significant terrorist threat. Loyalist groups also pose a smaller threat, with some heavily involved in serious crimes. However, experts note that dissident groups do not have the same capacity for sustained terror campaigns as the IRA did in the past. There are currently four main dissident republican groups identified by UK security services. The Continuity IRA (CIRA), \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann (\u00d3NH), Arm na Poblachta (ANP), and the New IRA are the four main dissident republican groups in Northern Ireland. These groups have targeted police officers, prison officers, and security services. Between 2009 and 2017, they were responsible for the deaths of two PSNI officers, two British soldiers, and two prison officers. While \u00d3NH declared a cease-fire in January 2018, the other groups, especially the New IRA, remain active and pose a severe threat. The New IRA has carried out about 40 attacks since 2012, including a car bomb in Londonderry in January 2019. Some experts fear that dissident republicans may increase attacks in Northern Ireland post-Brexit. To maintain peace and prevent recruitment to these groups, promoting economic development and equal opportunities for Catholics and Protestants is crucial. Despite significant economic progress in Northern Ireland since the 1990s, the 2008-2009 global recession had a negative impact. However, economic recovery has been slow but gaining momentum since 2017, with a 2.1% growth in economic activity in the four quarters ending September 2018. In September 2018, Northern Ireland's economy grew by 2.1%, surpassing the UK's overall growth rate of 1.5%. Unemployment in Northern Ireland is at 3.8%, lower than the UK average of 4.0%, the Republic of Ireland's 5.3%, and the EU's 6.7%. However, income and living standards in Northern Ireland remain below the UK average. The region also has high economic inactivity at 27% and a significant proportion of working-age individuals without qualifications. Despite strides in promoting workforce equality, historically poor areas, particularly those affected by the Troubles, continue to face deprivation, with many of the most deprived areas being predominantly Catholic. Northern Ireland has made progress in promoting equality in its workforce, with economic activity rates between Protestants and Catholics converging. Unemployment rate gaps have also decreased. To boost economic recovery, leaders aim to promote export-led growth, reduce dependency on the public sector, and attract foreign investment. The UK passed legislation in 2015 to devolve corporation tax-setting power to Northern Ireland, aiming for a 12.5% rate like in the Republic of Ireland. However, with the absence of a devolved government, this plan is on hold. Concerns arise about Brexit's impact on Northern Ireland's peace process, economy, and constitutional status. The EU membership of the UK and Ireland was crucial for the peace process post the Good Friday Agreement. The removal of security checkpoints and the shared single market led to the disappearance of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, fostering a cross-border economy. The goal of avoiding a \"hard\" land border in Ireland has been a major challenge in the UK's withdrawal agreement negotiations with the EU. Brexit poses a security risk in Northern Ireland due to concerns about a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. PSNI Police Chief warns that reinstating physical border posts could endanger lives and threaten the peace process. Establishing checkpoints along the Northern Ireland-Ireland border poses logistical difficulties and could jeopardize the peace process. UK, Irish, and EU leaders aim to prevent a hard border despite challenges in Brexit negotiations. In December 2017, the UK and EU reached an agreement on key issues, including commitments related to Northern Ireland. The UK pledged to uphold the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. They also committed to the backstop to ensure an invisible border. Negotiations on the backstop were challenging, leading to a draft withdrawal agreement and political declaration in November 2018. The withdrawal agreement includes a 21-month transition period for future UK-EU relationship negotiations. The backstop arrangement in the UK's withdrawal agreement would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU until a better solution is negotiated. Critics argue that the backstop would restrict the UK's ability to make its own trade deals and have a say in EU decision-making. The DUP is concerned about regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The UK Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement, leading to concerns of a disorderly \"no deal\" Brexit. Prime Minister May seeks alternative arrangements to the backstop, but the EU refuses to renegotiate. Regulatory differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK are a key issue. The UK government has been unsuccessful in gaining EU concessions for the withdrawal agreement. Prime Minister May plans to put the agreement to another vote in Parliament on March 12, 2019. If not approved, Parliament may consider a \"no deal\" Brexit or seek to extend the March 29 deadline, requiring unanimous agreement from the other 27 EU member states. The Irish government resists making plans for physical infrastructure on the Irish border, insisting on no hardening of the border under any circumstances. In the event of a \"no deal\" Brexit, negotiations for a backstop arrangement would be necessary. Irish Prime Minister Varadkar acknowledges the challenges that would arise in such a scenario. Analysts predict that the EU's priority would be to protect the single market, potentially leading to customs checks and border infrastructure. Some Brexiteers argue that the border issue is being used by those in favor of a \"soft Brexit\". There are discussions on the relevance of the Good Friday Agreement amidst the stalemate in Northern Ireland's government. Brexit has raised questions about Northern Ireland's status within the UK, with Sinn Fein suggesting it could lead to a united Ireland. However, experts believe conditions for a border poll are not currently met. Most people in Northern Ireland still support remaining in the UK, but a \"damaging Brexit\" could shift opinions. Concerns are growing in the UK government that a \"no deal\" Brexit could prompt a border poll on Irish unification. Brexit could have serious negative economic consequences for Northern Ireland, as it heavily depends on the EU market for exports, with Ireland being its top partner. A \"hard Brexit\" could jeopardize cross-border trade, integrated labor markets, and foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment may be hindered by Brexit, which could also result in the loss of EU regional funding and agricultural aid. UK officials are committed to safeguarding Northern Ireland's interests post-Brexit, emphasizing the importance of the UK market for businesses in Northern Ireland. The UK and DUP officials believe Northern Ireland will maintain trade with the EU post-Brexit, seeing new economic opportunities outside the EU. The US administrations have supported the Good Friday Agreement for peace in Northern Ireland, with involvement from the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations. Hillary Clinton and President Obama played key roles in urging Northern Ireland's leaders to reach agreements on devolution and justice powers. In February 2010, President Obama welcomed the Hillsborough Agreement. In June 2013, he visited Northern Ireland during a G8 summit and pledged ongoing support. The Obama and Trump administrations endorsed peace agreements in 2014 and 2015. Vice President Mike Pence praised Northern Ireland's progress in 2017. The State Department expressed concern over the impasse in power-sharing talks in November 2017. Many Members of Congress have actively supported the peace process in Northern Ireland for decades, advocating for progress on police reforms and lifting bans on contacts between the FBI and the PSNI. Congressional hearings have focused on peace process, policing reforms, human rights, and public inquiries into past murders involving collusion between security forces and paramilitary groups. Some Members of Congress have urged the Trump Administration to appoint a special envoy for Northern Ireland to show continued commitment to the region amidst challenges in reestablishing the devolved government. The United States has been a significant source of investment for Northern Ireland, with U.S.-based companies contributing \u00a31.48 billion between 2003-2004 and 2015-2016, creating 13,875 jobs. A special U.S. economic envoy worked between 2009 and 2011 to strengthen economic ties and support the peace process. The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) has also provided aid to the region since 1986. The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) was established in 1986 to support economic regeneration and social development projects in areas affected by civil unrest in Northern Ireland and the border areas of the Republic of Ireland. The United States has contributed over $540 million to the IFI, with additional funding from the EU, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. U.S. appropriations for the IFI averaged around $23 million annually in the 1980s and 1990s, and $18 million each year in the 2000s. The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) was established in 1986 to support economic regeneration and social development projects in areas affected by civil unrest in Northern Ireland and the border areas of the Republic of Ireland. The IFI has focused on projects in disadvantaged areas with high unemployment and little private sector investment. Initially, projects centered on economic and business development, but in 2006, the IFI shifted its focus towards promoting community reconciliation and overcoming past divisions. The IFI has received support from U.S. Administrations and Members of Congress to encourage economic development and unity in divided communities. Support for paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland has traditionally been strongest in communities with high levels of unemployment and economic deprivation. Many observers have long viewed the creation of jobs and economic opportunity as a key part of resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. Critics question the effectiveness of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI), viewing some projects as wasteful and unlikely to bridge community divides. Some argue that it is time to move the U.S. relationship with Ireland and Northern Ireland onto a more mature and equal footing. The International Fund for Ireland (IFI) was expected to wind down as an organization, with no funding requests from the Bush or Obama Administrations between FY2006 and FY2011. Despite this, Congress continued to appropriate funding for the IFI as a sign of ongoing U.S. commitment to the peace process. In FY2011, some Members of Congress called for an end to U.S. funding for the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) due to budget cuts, citing improved political and economic situations in Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, other Members supported continued funding, highlighting financial woes and sectarian tensions in the region. The IFI announced it would continue functioning with support from the British and Irish governments, Northern Ireland's Executive, and the Obama Administration allocating $2.5 million for specific activities to support peace and security in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Obama Administration requested $2.5 million in ESF funding for the IFI in FY2012, emphasizing the importance of a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland and the need for economic development to improve cross-community relations. The FY2012 budget request highlighted sectarian-driven hate crimes and paramilitary-style violence in Northern Ireland. U.S. assistance aimed to address root causes of violence and intolerance. The Obama Administration proposed $2.5 million for the IFI in FY2013 and FY2014 to promote peace and reconciliation programs. Funding from FY2011 to FY2014 helped meet a $7.5 million commitment to the IFI's Peace Impact Program. The Obama and Trump Administrations allocated $750,000 each from FY2015 to FY2017 ESF funds to the IFI for promoting peace in Northern Ireland and border counties. Programs included violence prevention workshops and job training for unemployed youth in communities with high joblessness and sectarian violence. The Trump Administration did not request funding for the IFI in FY2018 or FY2019 budgets."
