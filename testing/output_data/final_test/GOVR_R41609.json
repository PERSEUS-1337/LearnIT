    "content": "Since 1789, there have been at least 20 instances of attacks against Members of Congress, resulting in failed attempts, injuries, and deaths. Individual Members were targeted in 17 occasions, with three incidents targeting multiple Members. Notable attacks include the Alexandria shooting, a 2001 biologic attack, and a 1954 shooting in the House chamber. The presence of 243 Representatives was registered just before the incident. Violence against Members of Congress can be complex, involving attacks due to their role in public discussions on various topics. The focus is on incidents where Members were targeted outside of Congress, possibly due to their role. This report focuses on incidents where Members of Congress were targeted outside of Congress, excluding voluntary participation in violent activities and attacks on the Capitol where no Members or staff were injured. Examples include the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812 and bombings in the Capitol in 1915, 1971, and 1983. Some incidents resulted in fatalities, such as a gunman entering the Capitol in 1998. Two fatal incidents occurred outside of Congress. In 1998, a gunman entered the Capitol, resulting in the deaths of two USCP officers. In 2011, a shooting in Tucson led to the death of a congressional staff member. Other non-lethal incidents involving staff have also occurred, including a riot in 1905 and a bomb scare in 1935. In the 1954 House chamber shooting, two doorkeepers were injured. In a 1978 incident, Jackie Speier, a staff member for Representative Leo Joseph Ryan, was critically wounded by gunfire in Guyana. Representative Ryan was killed in the attack. Violence against congressional staff poses challenges in identification due to lack of public attention. The challenges in documenting violent incidents against congressional staff are highlighted, making it difficult to compile a complete inventory. An example is the death of Harold W. \"Hal\" Rosenthal in a 1976 terrorist attack in Istanbul, Turkey, where it is unclear if the attackers knew he was a congressional employee. The lack of official records hinders determining if Rosenthal was on official duties at the time of his death. The summary discusses the challenges in documenting violent incidents against congressional staff, specifically focusing on the uncertainty surrounding the death of Mr. Rosenthal in Istanbul. It mentions the limitations of available sources and the potential impact of violent incidents on policy and legislation. The enactment of laws in response to violent incidents involving Members of Congress, such as prohibiting duels after the death of Representative Jonathan Cilley and making it a federal offense to harm a Member of Congress following the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy. Congressional mail screening was initiated after anthrax attacks in 2001. The 1971 and 1983 Capitol bombings, along with the September 11, 2001 attacks, led to increased security measures and funding for the Capitol Visitor Center. Other violent incidents have sparked discussions on enhancing security for Members of Congress and staff, including proposals to restrict firearms in proximity to Members. In response to security concerns, discussions were held regarding access to House galleries after incidents in 1932 and 1954 where gunmen caused disruptions. Representative Blanton emphasized the need for proper vetting of gallery visitors to maintain order. Suggestions for installing shields between galleries and the House floor were considered but no action was taken. In response to security concerns following incidents in 1932 and 1954, discussions were held regarding access to House galleries. Representative Blanton emphasized the need for proper vetting of gallery visitors. Measures to enclose the visitors' galleries with transparent material were introduced in the 108th and 110th Congresses but no legislative action was taken. After the 2011 Tucson shooting, legislative proposals were introduced in the 112th Congress. H.R. 318 aims to amend title 18, United States Code, to punish threats against Members of Congress. Representative Laura Richardson introduced H.R. 367, the Freedom to Serve Without Fear Act of 2011, prohibiting firearm possession near venues where Members of Congress are present. H.R. 815, the Justice for Public Servants Act of 2011, was introduced by Representative Jim Gerlach to amend federal law. H.R. 815, the Justice for Public Servants Act of 2011, aimed to make the killing of a Member of Congress or law enforcement officer an aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. Representative Dan Burton introduced H.Res. 50 to enhance security in the House galleries. No further action was taken on these measures. Proposals introduced in response to violence against Members of Congress include H.Res. 411, which increased the Members' Representational Allowance by $25,000 per office. Additionally, H.R. 2940, the Congressional Self-Defense Act, would allow Members of Congress to carry concealed firearms in certain locations. H.R. 2940 and H.R. 2945 were introduced to allow Members of Congress to carry firearms for personal safety. H.R. 2940 permits concealed carry in specific locations, while H.R. 2945 authorizes carrying a firearm in any state with proper identification. Both bills were referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary but have not seen further action. On July 10, 2017, Representative Brian Babin introduced H.R. 2951 to allow Members of Congress to carry concealed handguns nationwide, with exceptions. The bill would authorize Members with proper identification and permits to carry firearms, except in restricted areas like the White House. The USCP chief would issue permits with specific terms. Members would be restricted from carrying firearms on air carriers without completing certain requirements. H.R. 2951 would restrict Members from carrying firearms on air carriers unless they complete the FFDO program. It authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to provide FFDO training upon request. Official funds can be used for firearms training programs. The bill was referred to multiple House committees for further consideration. The Wounded Officers Recovery Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Joe Linus Barton, authorizes the USCP Board to make payments from the U.S. Capitol Police Memorial Fund to USCP employees who sustain serious injuries in the line-of-duty. The measure was passed by the House and Senate in July 2017. The House passed H.R. 3298 with an amendment on July 27, 2017, and it became law on August 4, 2017. Senator Jeff Flake introduced S. 1608, a bill related to the U.S. Capitol Police Memorial Fund. Various administrative efforts were also made in response to the Alexandria shooting. On June 21, 2017, the FEC approved the use of campaign funds for residential security systems by Members of the House. The Committee on House Administration updated the Members' Congressional Handbook on June 29, 2017, to provide guidance on security equipment and measures, including MRA reimbursement for improvements to district offices and security items."
