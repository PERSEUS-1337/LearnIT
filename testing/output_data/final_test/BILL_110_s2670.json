    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teaming with Wildlife Act of 2008\" and its findings and purposes are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that a diverse array of fish and wildlife species in the United States holds significant value for various reasons, including aesthetic, ecological, educational, cultural, recreational, economic, and scientific purposes. Millions of citizens engage in outdoor activities like hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, providing economic benefits to local communities. It is in the national interest to preserve wildlife for present and future generations and prevent their decline. Congress created the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to support wildlife diversity and abundance through user fees paid by hunters and anglers. The Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account aims to expand support for fish and wildlife conservation needs, but lacks dedicated funding, hindering its goals and leading to wildlife decline in the United States. Each state has developed a wildlife strategy as part of this initiative. The Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account aims to provide dedicated funding for wildlife conservation in each state to prevent wildlife from becoming endangered. This Act supports comprehensive wildlife conservation strategies prepared by each state to address the needs of declining wildlife. The Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account requires states to prepare comprehensive wildlife conservation strategies to receive funds under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act. The Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account mandates states to develop wildlife conservation strategies to qualify for funds under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act. The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act is amended to establish the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account, which provides funds to states for wildlife conservation and restoration programs without the need for further appropriation. For fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer $175,000,000 from Outer Continental Shelf revenues and mining revenues to the fund for deposit in the Account. Treasury will transfer $175,000,000 to the fund for deposit in the Account."
