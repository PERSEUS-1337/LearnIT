    "title": "AB 748",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 75.21 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to provide exemptions for supplemental assessments under certain conditions, including eligibility and filing a claim for the exemption. If the property already has an exemption on the current or upcoming roll, the difference in the exemption amounts can be applied to the supplemental assessment. Any person eligible for an exemption against a supplemental assessment must file a claim within 30 days of notice to receive a 100% exemption. Unclaimed exemptions for property eligible for various exemptions will be canceled or refunded. For supplemental assessments, exemptions can be claimed to reduce tax, penalty, or interest by 90% if filed before the first installment becomes delinquent, or by 85% if filed thereafter. Provisions for welfare or veterans' organization exemptions apply. For property eligible for veterans' or homeowners' exemption, taxes can be canceled or refunded for 80% of the exemption amount if a timely application is filed before the first installment of supplemental tax becomes delinquent. For property eligible for veterans' or homeowners' exemption, taxes can be canceled or refunded for 80% of the exemption amount if a timely application is filed before the first installment of supplemental tax becomes delinquent. If a timely application is not filed, a portion of tax attributable to 90% of the exemption amount can be canceled or refunded if an appropriate application is filed before the first installment of taxes on the supplemental tax bill becomes delinquent. (A) Ninety percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon can be exempted if an application is filed before the first installment of taxes on the supplemental tax bill becomes delinquent. (B) Eighty-five percent of any tax or penalty or interest thereon, or any amount exceeding $250, can be exempted for each supplemental assessment if an application is filed thereafter. For the homeowners\u2019 exemption, veterans\u2019 exemption, or disabled veterans\u2019 exemption, a previously filed claim remains valid. If no claim is in effect, a claim for any of those exemptions for a single supplemental assessment from June 1 to December 31 applies. For two supplemental assessments from January 1 to May 31, one for the current fiscal year and one for the following fiscal year, a claim can be made. If granted, the exemption remains until the property changes ownership. The claim for homeowners' exemption, veterans' exemption, or disabled veterans' exemption remains valid until property ownership changes or the property becomes ineligible. (e) An additional exemption claim may not be required for a supplemental assessment due to new construction on previously exempt property. (f) No additional exemption claim is needed for a supplemental assessment resulting from a change in property ownership if the new owner uses the property in a similar manner as other exempt properties they own. An application for exemption must be filed within 90 days of property acquisition or by February 15 of the following year for a supplemental assessment due to a change in ownership. Property acquired by a qualifying organization after the lien date but before the start of the fiscal year may be eligible for exemption if it meets certain criteria. Property owned by a qualifying organization acquired after the lien date but before the fiscal year may be eligible for exemption. Property acquired after the beginning of a fiscal year by a qualifying organization may be eligible for exemption, based on the number of days it qualified during the fiscal year. Any tax or penalty imposed on property eligible for exemption under certain provisions can be canceled or refunded if an appropriate application is filed within the required time. Taxes exceeding $250 on such properties can also be canceled or refunded with a filed claim for exemption. Property acquired after the fiscal year's start will only receive partial tax relief if it qualifies. Exemptions for specific properties cease upon sale or transfer, leading to an escape assessment. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act."
