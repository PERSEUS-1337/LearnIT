The Act is titled the \"Veteran-Centered Access to Coordinated Health Care Act of 2014\" and emphasizes the importance of maintaining high-quality, coordinated care for veterans receiving health care in the community. It highlights the risks of poor health outcomes and inefficient use of resources when there is a lack of care coordination between Department of Veterans Affairs and community providers. The \"Veteran-Centered Access to Coordinated Health Care Act of 2014\" stresses the significance of veteran-centric care coordination for improved patient outcomes. It also emphasizes the need for cost-effective private sector care that complements the Department's larger health care system. The \"Comprehensive Contract Care Coordination Program for Veterans\" is established under SEC. 2. The Secretary shall provide eligible veterans with covered health services through non-Department entities if Department facilities are unable to economically furnish services due to geographical inaccessibility or lack of personnel or timely access. The Secretary ensures that veterans receive healthcare from non-Department entities in accordance with specified priorities, including Department facilities, other government agencies, and non-Department facilities as outlined in the law. The Secretary ensures veterans can efficiently reenter the Department's healthcare system after receiving care from non-Department entities by coordinating care. Covered health services include hospital care, medical services, rehabilitative services, and preventative health services authorized by the Secretary for eligible veterans enrolled in the healthcare system. The Secretary will contract with non-Department entities for care coordination to avoid duplicating administrative functions. Non-Department entities must have experience in providing healthcare services to veterans, meeting credentialing standards, and offering care coordinators for medical appointments.

The Veteran-Centered Collaborative Health Care Act of 2014 requires the Secretary to recommence a pilot program within each Veterans Integrated Service Network, ensuring medical appointments for veterans within 30 days of request. Outreach to veterans is also mandated. The Secretary must inform eligible veterans about the pilot program and the program will terminate three years after it begins."
