    "title": "SB 328",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to ensure that tenants are notified when landlords or authorized agents apply pesticides to rental property, similar to the notification required when a licensed pest control operator is used. Section 1940.8.5 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in rental properties, including \"adjacent dwelling unit,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" \"electronic delivery,\" \"landlord,\" and \"pest.\" (7) \u201cPesticide\u201d is any substance used to control pests, excluding antimicrobial pesticides.\n(8) \u201cLicensed pest control operator\u201d is someone licensed to apply pesticides.\n(b) A landlord must provide written notice to tenants before applying pesticides, including the pest to be controlled and the name of the pesticide product. The pesticide product proposed to be used must be disclosed to tenants as required by state law. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Proper use conditions must be followed for unlicensed pesticide use. Contact a physician if experiencing symptoms within 24 hours of exposure. For more information, contact the County Health Department for health questions and the Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information. The landlord or authorized agent must provide at least 24 hours notice to tenants before applying pesticides to the dwelling unit. The notification must include the approximate date, time, and frequency of the pesticide application, with a disclaimer that these details are subject to change. Notice can be given through first-class mail, personal delivery, electronic delivery, or posting a written notice at the unit entry. The tenant may agree in writing or electronically to immediate pesticide application by the landlord or authorized agent. An oral agreement can be made for immediate application if requested by the tenant before 24-hour notice can be given, including the name and brand of the pesticide product. The landlord or authorized agent must provide a written notice to a tenant before pesticide application, either in the dwelling unit or at the entrance. If adjacent tenants also need to be notified, they should receive the notice before the pesticide application begins. In a common interest development, landlords must provide written notice to tenants before applying pesticides in common areas. The notice should include details such as the pests to be controlled and the name of the pesticide product to be used. The pesticide product's name and brand must be provided as required by state law before application in common interest developments. CAUTION \u2013 PESTICIDES ARE TOXIC CHEMICALS. Proper use of certain pesticides is allowed based on scientific evidence to minimize risks. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide exposure, contact a healthcare provider or Poison Control. For more information, contact County Health Department or Department of Pesticide Regulation. The notice for pesticide application must include the date, time, and frequency of application. It should be posted in a common area before and after application for at least 24 hours. Landlords are not liable if the notice is removed without their consent. In case of immediate health threat, notification can be posted within one hour after application. If a common area lacks a suitable place for posting, the notice can be provided to each dwelling unit through first-class mail. The landlord must provide notice of pesticide application to tenants through various methods such as personal delivery, electronic delivery, or posting in a conspicuous place. Landlords must also provide written notice to tenants if pesticides are routinely applied in common areas. State law requires that tenants be given information about the pest to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals allowed for unlicensed use under certain conditions. Risks depend on exposure level, so minimize exposure. If experiencing symptoms after pesticide application, contact a healthcare provider or Poison Control. For more information, contact County Health Department for health questions or Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information. Landlords must provide notice to tenants before applying pesticides, using methods like mail, personal delivery, electronic delivery, or posting a written notice. If the type of pesticide changes, a new notice must be given. The landlord or authorized agent is not required to provide notice of pesticide use in common areas within a common interest development. A registered pest control company must still follow notification requirements. Landlords cannot enter a tenant's dwelling unit in violation of the law. If a tenant receives notice as required, no additional information is needed regarding pesticide application."
