    "content": "The Act titled \"Putting Drug Free Families First Act of 2011\" establishes a drug testing program for applicants and recipients of assistance under State TANF programs. The \"Putting Drug Free Families First Act of 2011\" requires drug testing for individuals applying for assistance under State TANF programs to prevent aid from being provided to those found using illegal drugs. The \"Putting Drug Free Families First Act of 2011\" mandates drug testing for TANF applicants to detect illegal drug use within a specified timeframe. The State must test for various drugs including marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines. The \"Putting Drug Free Families First Act of 2011\" requires drug testing for TANF applicants to detect illegal drug use. A positive test for drugs like marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines can result in denial of assistance, except for cases where the drug was used under a valid prescription or authorized by law. The State may not provide assistance under the program funded under this part to an individual who tests positive for drugs listed in subparagraph (B)(i) unless a 1-year (or 3-year for a second positive test) period has elapsed and the individual tests negative at the end of that period. Permanent ineligibility occurs after a third positive test result. If an individual tests positive for drugs listed in subparagraph (B)(i) for the third time, they will be permanently ineligible for assistance. For the first positive test result, the individual may be ineligible for 180 days. Individuals who have completed a drug rehabilitation program and test negative for drugs at the end of a 180-day period must pay for their drug testing. If they test negative for all drugs listed, they may receive assistance from the State program. If a parent of a minor child tests positive for drugs listed in the program, the State will designate someone else to receive assistance payments on behalf of the child. The designated individual must also undergo drug testing. In this paragraph, it is stated that an individual must test negative for each drug listed in order to be considered for a drug rehabilitation or treatment program. The definition of such a program is provided as one that offers rehabilitation or treatment for illegal drug use and complies with all relevant laws. Additionally, a penalty is outlined for failing to implement an illegal drug use testing program under the Social Security Act. The Secretary will reduce the grant to a State by 10 percent if they violate the illegal drug use testing program requirement. The effective date for these amendments is one year after the enactment of the Act."
