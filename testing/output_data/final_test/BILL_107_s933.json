    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Combined Heat and Power Advancement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that the development and deployment of combined heat and power technologies would encourage innovation, reduce energy prices, spur economic development, enhance productivity, increase employment, and improve environmental quality and energy self-sufficiency. The efficiency of the US electricity-generating system has been stagnant, but innovative onsite generation technologies could address this issue. Innovative distributed generation technologies can significantly increase productivity, double the efficiency of the US electricity-generating system, and reduce emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. It is crucial to replace a significant portion of the US energy infrastructure by 2010 with innovative technologies that improve efficiency and reduce pollution. The current chunk highlights the barriers hindering the development and dissemination of combined heat and power and other innovative energy technologies in the United States. These barriers prevent taxpayers from benefiting from the substantial research and development investments made by the Federal Government in innovative energy technologies. The Act aims to promote energy productivity and efficiency by addressing barriers to the development and deployment of combined heat and power technologies. The Federal Power Act is amended to define \"transmitting utility\" as an entity that owns or operates electric power transmission facilities for selling energy. It also defines \"appropriate regulatory authority\" and \"generating facility.\" The Federal Power Act defines terms like \"local distribution utility\" as an entity that owns or operates electric power distribution facilities for selling energy. It also addresses interconnection requirements for generating facilities. The Federal Power Act requires generating facilities to interconnect with local distribution utilities by complying with final rules and paying interconnection costs. These costs must be just, reasonable, and comparable to costs charged by the utility for similar facilities. The Federal Power Act mandates generating facilities to interconnect with local distribution utilities by following final rules and paying just and reasonable interconnection costs. The right to interconnect does not exempt facilities from other regulatory requirements or provide transmission or distribution services. The Commission is required to establish technical standards within a year of the enactment of this provision. The Commission is tasked with establishing technical standards for the interconnection of generating facilities with local distribution utilities, involving interested parties in the process. An advisory committee of experts will make recommendations to the Commission, and administration will be handled by non-federal regulatory authorities. The Commission establishes technical standards for interconnecting generating facilities with local distribution utilities. Non-Federal regulatory authorities may enforce the rules, and the Commission will do so if necessary. Local distribution utilities must offer backup power to interconnected generating facilities. The local distribution utility must offer backup power to interconnected generating facilities unless certain conditions are met. The local distribution utility must offer backup power to interconnected generating facilities at a just and reasonable rate, not required to offer backup power for resale, and can use backup power for new or expanded loads. The generating facility must pay for any necessary upgrades to the transmission, distribution, or generation system to serve a new load. Additionally, a transmitting utility is required to interconnect a generating facility with its transmission facilities if the owner complies with the final rule. The generating facility must comply with the final rule and pay for interconnection costs, which must be just, reasonable, and comparable to costs charged by the transmitting utility for similar facilities. The generating facility must comply with the final rule and pay for interconnection costs determined by the non-Federal regulatory authority in accordance with Federal law. The right to interconnect does not relieve the facility or transmitting utility of other Federal requirements. The Commission will establish technical standards for interconnecting generating facilities with transmission facilities of transmitting utilities within one year of enactment. The standards will be developed with input from interested parties. The Commission will establish an advisory committee of experts to make recommendations on developing standards for interconnecting generating facilities with transmission facilities. Transmitting utilities must offer backup power to generating facilities unless allowed otherwise by law or the utility. The Commission will establish an advisory committee to develop standards for interconnecting generating facilities with transmission facilities. Generating facilities can purchase backup power from entities other than the transmitting utility, using transmission facilities of any transmitting utility. Rates, terms, and conditions for backup power sales must be just and reasonable, considering the actual incremental cost to supply the service. The Federal Power Act is amended to specify that a transmitting utility is not required to offer backup power for resale to entities other than the purchaser. Generating facilities using backup power for new or expanded loads must cover any associated upgrade costs. The Federal Power Act is amended to include provisions promoting competition in electricity markets and removing the requirement for transmitting utilities to offer backup power for resale."
