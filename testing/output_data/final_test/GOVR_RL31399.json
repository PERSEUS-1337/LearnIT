    "content": "The \"Origination Clause\" in Article I, Section 7, clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution requires that all bills for raising revenue must start in the House of Representatives. The Senate can propose amendments but cannot originate revenue-raising measures. The clause has been refined through practice and precedent since its ratification. The Origination Clause in the U.S. Constitution requires revenue bills to start in the House of Representatives, refined through practice and precedent. The clause's historical origins, evolution, and resolution of disputes are analyzed, focusing on the roles of the House and Senate in revenue legislation. The compromise at the constitutional convention in Philadelphia established the House's exclusive authority to originate revenue measures. The debate over the Origination Clause in the U.S. Constitution focused on the assignment of authority for money legislation. Delegates at the Philadelphia Convention argued that money bills should originate in the House of Representatives, as it was directly elected by the people. Elbridge Gerry emphasized the link between taxation and representation, advocating for the House to have sole power over money bills. The convention debated the Origination Clause, with Gerry proposing that money bills originate in the House of Representatives. The Compromise Committee recommended that all money bills originate in the first branch of the Legislature and not be altered by the second branch. The convention voted to retain this restriction. The convention voted to strike the provision restricting the Senate's role in originating money bills, with Edmund Randolph proposing a more specific language that only prohibited bills for raising money for revenue or appropriating the same. The convention debated the Origination Clause, which restricted the Senate's ability to amend money bills. Randolph argued for the clause's importance in maintaining equal representation for smaller states. After several revisions and postponements, the clause was finally adopted on September 8 by a vote of 9-2. The Origination Clause was adopted by the convention, 9-2, and ratified later. The Constitution lacks specific guidelines on what constitutes a bill for raising revenue, leading to interpretation. Congress and federal courts establish precedents for the Origination Clause. The House enforces the clause most frequently, shaping the definition of a bill for raising revenue. House rules use the concept of \"revenue\" in procedures related to enforcing House prerogatives under the Origination Clause. The House enforces the Origination Clause through a \"blue-slip resolution\" and by maintaining exclusive jurisdiction over tax or tariff measures. The Speaker of the House sets policies at the start of each Congress to guide bill referrals and protect the House's authority to originate revenue bills. The House uses a broad standard based on revenue-affecting potential, not just direct revenue changes, to determine jurisdiction. The House enforces the Origination Clause through a \"blue-slip resolution\" and maintains exclusive jurisdiction over tax or tariff measures. House precedent interprets the chamber's prerogatives broadly to include any revenue proposal, not just direct revenue changes. This interpretation is framed by the Speaker in terms of House committee jurisdictions and referrals. The House rules grant exclusive jurisdiction over revenues to the Ways and Means Committee, allowing other standing committees to handle legislation on non-revenue receipts like user fees. These fees must be paid by those benefiting from the service and are not meant to finance government costs generally. The House rules distinguish between revenue and non-revenue receipts, with user fees falling under the latter category. User fees must be tied to the actual cost of the activity and borne by the entities directly involved, ensuring a reasonable connection between payors and the agency receiving the fee. An example highlighting this distinction is the case of S. 104 (105th Congress), where the House took action based on the repeal of an original fee rather than the Senate's origination of a new fee. The House distinguishes between revenue and non-revenue receipts, with user fees falling under the latter category. Fees collected in excess of costs were deposited in the general fund. Repeal of a fee was deemed to impact revenues and subject to the Origination Clause, leading to the measure being blue-slipped. House precedents show various tax and tariff actions excluded under this clause. Examples of measures returned to the Senate include reinterpreting a definition in the tariff act of 1922 and amending the Silver Purchase Act. The Senate's role in determining bills for raising revenues is influenced by its practices, which align with the House's interpretation of revenue in a constitutional sense. Examples include sustaining a point of order against bills that don't allocate revenues for a specific purpose and declining to do so for bills with postal rates. The Senate declined to sustain a point of order against a bill including postal rates, as postal charges are not considered revenue but payment for specific services. They also refused to consider a bill on international commerce in oil due to its impact on tariff revenues. The Senate's amending authority has been debated, with historical precedents showing a restrictive view in the 19th century. The Senate's amending authority has been debated historically, with the House limiting Senate amendments to be germane to the bill. In a specific example, the House objected to a Senate substitute to a revenue bill that expanded the bill's scope beyond the House's original intent. James A. Garfield emphasized that Senate amendments must relate to the subject matter of the House bill. The Senate's amendment authority has been debated historically, with the House limiting Senate amendments to be germane to the bill. Recent precedents show no general restriction on the Senate's amendment authority, allowing the Senate to propose any amendment allowed under Senate rules to House-originated bills. The Senate's authority to propose amendments to House-originated revenue bills is not limited by the requirement of germaneness. Recent precedents show that the Senate can propose a wide range of alternatives, including specific tax provisions, even though it may not originate tax measures. Chief Justice Edward White emphasized that the Senate can propose or concur with amendments as on other bills, allowing for flexibility in Senate action on revenue measures. The Senate has broad authority to propose amendments to House-originated revenue bills, including adding general surtaxes and major revenue increases. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Origination Clause may differ from the House's understanding, as some violations may not align with the Court's definition. The Origination Clause has been historically interpreted by the Supreme Court as applying to bills specifically for levying taxes, not for other purposes that may indirectly impact revenue. The Court is generally hesitant to invalidate laws passed by Congress unless they clearly violate the Constitution. The Origination Clause applies to bills for levying taxes, not for other purposes that may indirectly impact revenue. In United States ex rel. Michels v. James, a bill to increase postage rates was found not to violate the Origination Clause as it did not fall within the definition of a revenue bill. Certain legislative measures impose taxes or duties without providing an equivalent in return, unlike a bill regulating postal rates which provides a benefit in exchange for payment. The Origination Clause focuses on bills for levying taxes, with key principles narrowing its application to specific types of legislation. Two central principles include that raising money must be the primary purpose of the measure and resulting funds must be for government expenses generally. This is illustrated in cases like Twin City Bank v. Nebeker and Millard v. Roberts, where the primary purpose of the bill determined its classification under the clause. In Millard v. Roberts, the Court ruled that a tax bill for specific purposes, like providing railroad facilities, is not considered a revenue bill. Similarly, in United States v. Munoz-Flores, a law imposing a special assessment for crime victim compensation was not classified as a revenue bill solely because it generated new income for the government. The Court's interpretation of the Origination Clause's application in a given case depends on the method of fund-raising, the purposes for which funds are raised, and the connection between the two elements. Federal courts have not equated \"raising revenue\" with \"increasing revenue,\" as it would be a slippery label for legislation that may have an effect of increasing revenue under certain economic conditions. The Origination Clause is interpreted by courts based on how funds are raised and their purposes. Blue-slipping is the House's enforcement method, returning bills violating the Clause. This process is under House Rule IX, clause 2(a)(1). The Origination Clause in the House is enforced through blue-slipping, which returns bills violating the Clause. Resolutions regarding the privileges of the House are given precedence, with the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee typically offering such resolutions. Debate on these resolutions is conducted under the one-hour rule, with time divided between the proponent and designated leaders. The House can assert its constitutional privilege at any time, not limited to blue-slipping a Senate bill upon receipt. Various enforcement methods include ignoring Senate bills, taking action on House bills, referring Senate measures to a committee, or using a conference committee for Origination Clause questions. The House can assert its constitutional privilege by using a conference committee for Origination Clause questions. This can involve committing the subject to conference or removing offending provisions without blue-slipping. The House can also disagree with Senate amendments, giving the Senate options to proceed. The Senate can insist on its amendment, go to conference, or concur with a new amendment. Unanimous consent may be required for certain actions. Alternatively, the Senate can simply recede to the House-passed version. According to Riddick's Senate Procedure, when a question is raised in the Senate regarding the constitutionality of a measure, including whether it contravenes the Origination Clause, it is submitted directly to the Senate for determination. An amendment proposing to raise revenues would be out of order if offered to a non-revenue measure, and a point of order against such an amendment would be submitted to the Senate. If a revenue bill is found to violate the Origination Clause, the statute or provision would be held invalid by the courts. In enforcing the Origination Clause, the courts primarily focus on whether a measure is a revenue bill, rather than its origin. The Supreme Court typically does not delve into the bill's origins but instead determines if it fits the definition of a revenue-raising bill. This approach, known as the \"enrolled bill rule,\" limits the Court's role to examining the bill's designation as a House or Senate bill without scrutinizing the journals of either house. The \"enrolled bill rule\" restricts courts from questioning the certification of bills by legislative officers. This rule was applied in cases like Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. and Hubbard v. Lowe, where the Court upheld bills that were amended in the Senate or House, respectively, as long as they originated in the correct chamber. The House amended a Senate bill to include a prohibitive tax on certain contracts, which the Supreme Court upheld without questioning its origination. Justice Scalia emphasized the enrolled bill rule's importance in determining legislative validity. The Supreme Court upheld a Senate bill with a prohibitive tax without questioning its origination, emphasizing the importance of the enrolled bill rule in determining legislative validity. In a separate case, the Court held that judicial scrutiny of Congress' constitutional decisions is permissible, stating that congressional consideration does not prevent subsequent judicial review. The Supreme Court ruled that the House is not the sole authority on enforcing the Origination Clause, and judicial review of congressional enactments is necessary even if the House can reject bills violating the Clause. The Court emphasized that the judiciary should not refrain from reviewing constitutional challenges by labeling them as political questions. A law passed in violation of the Origination Clause is not immune from judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for judicial review of congressional enactments, stating that a law violating the Origination Clause is not immune from scrutiny. The Court can review questions regarding the Origination Clause and may not solely rely on the enrolled bill doctrine. The House can determine if the Origination Clause applies in a case, but its decision may be subject to Court review. Unlike House rules that can be waived, the Origination Clause cannot be simply ignored. The House historically asserted that the Origination Clause applies to bills to spend revenues as well as bills to raise revenues. Proponents argue that the Constitution's phrase \"bills for raising revenues\" is synonymous with \"money bills\" and that the House should have control over all money bills based on the British House of Commons' authority. The drafters intended to grant control over all money bills to the House, mirroring the authority of the British House of Commons. They argue that the House should have exclusive authority to originate money bills, citing Federalist No. 58. The practice of the House to insist upon originating appropriations dates back to the First Congress, showing a deliberate decision. The Senate has never originated appropriations bills, conceding that authority to the House of Representatives. Opponents argue that this practice was not explicitly outlined in the Constitution and developed over time. Congress has debated the extent of the Senate's authority to amend House-originated revenue bills, with varying results. In 1856, the House was unable to transact legislative business during a contest over the election of the Speaker. The Senate debated the issue of appropriations bills and in 1880, a Senate bill on appropriations was referred to the House Judiciary Committee for inquiry into the Senate's right to originate such bills. The majority of the committee concluded that the Senate could also originate appropriations bills, while the minority disagreed. In 1885, the House declined to investigate the Senate's authority to originate appropriations. The House has never formally acknowledged that the Origination Clause does not apply to appropriations and has returned appropriations bills to the Senate. In 1953 and 1962, the House returned appropriations bills to the Senate. In response, the Senate asserted its authority to originate money bills. The House declined to investigate the Senate's authority to originate appropriations in 1885. Concerns were raised about the proposal infringing on the House's prerogatives under the Origination Clause during hearings on creating a joint committee on the budget the following year. A study concluded there was no constitutional basis for the House originating appropriations, but no further action was taken. The Senate has generally deferred to the House on this issue. Questions regarding public debt and revenue are closely related, as the federal government borrows funds when revenues are insufficient. The House traditionally originates legislation on federal debt and debt limits, but neither chamber has claimed public debt legislation falls under the Origination Clause. House actions in 1946 are relevant to this issue. In 1946, the House debated legislation on public debt and debt limits, concluding that not all debt legislation falls under the Origination Clause. Representative John W. McCormack stated that raising funds through the sale of Government obligations does not violate the House's privilege as outlined in the Constitution. The House debated legislation on public debt and debt limits in 1946, concluding that not all debt legislation falls under the Origination Clause. Representative John W. McCormack stated that raising funds through the sale of Government obligations does not violate the House's privilege as outlined in the Constitution. The resolution in question instructs the Secretary of the Treasury on the use of already authorized funds, without increasing the limit of public-debt issues. An unnumbered House resolution to return S.J.Res. 138 to the Senate on the grounds of Origination Clause infringement was referred to the Judiciary Committee, which took no action on the constitutional question. In 1946, the House debated public debt legislation and concluded that not all debt laws fall under the Origination Clause. The Senate passed a bill to lower the debt limit, which the House did not return but instead passed a separate bill on the same subject. Congress has used Senate bills to increase the public debt limit in recent years. The Constitution's system of government balances authorities between federal and state governments, branches of the federal government, and within the legislative branch. The Origination Clause in the Constitution balances the authority between the House and Senate on taxation. It applies to bills raising funds for the federal government's general operation, with enforcement through congressional and judicial precedents. The Origination Clause enforcement historically relies on blue-slip resolutions by the House of Representatives, with other avenues like House inaction on Senate bills and Supreme Court review also playing roles. Various precedents and references support this enforcement mechanism. The History and Application of the Origination Clause is discussed in various sources such as the Tax History Project, Fordham Law Review, Boston University Journal of Tax Law, and American Law Reports Annotated. These sources provide insights into the enforcement mechanisms of the Origination Clause, including blue-slip resolutions by the House of Representatives, House inaction on Senate bills, and Supreme Court review. The Origination Clause in the American Constitution requires bills for raising revenue to originate in the lower house of Congress. Various sources discuss the history and application of this clause, including enforcement mechanisms such as blue-slip resolutions and Supreme Court review. The Authority of the Senate to Originate Appropriation Bills was discussed in a Senate Committee on Government Operations session in March 1963. This document from the 88th Congress explores this topic."
