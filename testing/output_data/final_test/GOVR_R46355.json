The SPR's role has evolved with changing oil market conditions, and the U.S. is required to maintain strategic petroleum stock holdings under the International Energy Program agreement. Congressional interest may be piqued due to recent changes in the oil market. Oil price volatility, driven by supply disruptions, demand growth, and geopolitical risks, has consequences for the U.S. economy. Crude oil prices are influenced by various factors such as supply, demand, dollar value, and geopolitical events, leading to market fluctuations that impact global economy and investments. Global price fluctuations in crude oil and petroleum products affect U.S. prices and economy due to their status as globally traded commodities. The oil market has shown signs of being better equipped to respond to supply disruptions, with lower crude oil prices since 2014, increased U.S. capacity, and technological advancements in production. The U.S. has become a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products, with record levels of exports. However, oil markets remain volatile, as seen in early 2020 with oversupply issues. The Department of Energy (DOE) may purchase crude oil to increase stockpiles in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), requiring appropriations from Congress. The creation of the SPR was a response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, where an embargo led to a tripling of crude oil prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, which caused a tripling of crude oil prices. The SPR aims to mitigate the impact of supply disruptions by providing a buffer of petroleum that can be released during emergencies to stabilize markets and prevent sharp price spikes. Congress established the SPR to address deliberate physical supply disruptions and economic effects of shortages caused by international events. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established to calm markets, mitigate price spikes, and reduce economic disruptions. The SPR can acquire crude oil to minimize costs with appropriated funds. The OAPEC embargo led to the creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which coordinates emergency responses to energy crises, including strategic reserves. Member countries, like the United States, commit to maintaining petroleum stocks equivalent to 90 days of prior year's net imports and developing demand restraint programs for emergencies. IEA member countries can meet the 90-day obligation through a combination of stock holdings by industry, a separate agency, and the government. Commercial stocks held by oil industry firms ensure continuous operation of the refining industry, but do not provide the same level of security as the SPR. Companies may have economic reasons to lower commercial stocks. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized by Congress in 1975 under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to address the imbalance between U.S. crude oil production and consumption. National oil companies (NOCs) in some countries, like Equinor in Norway, are government-owned or influenced. Commercial stocks held by oil industry firms serve the refining industry but do not offer the same level of security as the SPR. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established by Congress in 1975 to prevent economic disruptions like the 1973 Arab embargo. Managed by the U.S. Department of Energy, the SPR currently holds around 635 million barrels of emergency petroleum stocks, exceeding the IEA obligation. The SPR's capacity is limited to 713.5 million barrels, with plans for expansion up to 1 billion barrels. In 1978, Congress authorized expanding the SPR's capacity to 750 million barrels, with further expansion to 1 billion barrels in 2005. Advocates argued for a larger SPR to maintain stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports. Plans for additional capacity in the Gulf Coast were considered in 2005, but the rise of oil production from hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling led to the cancellation of expansion plans in 2011. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) authorizes the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to hold crude oil stocks. The SPR's capacity was expanded to 1 billion barrels in 2005, with plans to increase to 90 days of net imports. The decision to only hold crude oil was based on findings that the US had sufficient refining capacity. The SPR serves as a buffer during crises and buys time for diplomacy. US import dependency has been mainly on crude oil, not petroleum products. The United States has been a net exporter of petroleum products since late 2010, with potential supply disruptions affecting the US through crude oil, not necessarily petroleum products. Crude oil types are classified based on density and sulfur content, measured by API gravity and sweet to sour ratings. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) does not contain heavy crude oil but includes both sweet and sour crude oils. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) contains sweet and sour crude oils stored in salt caverns at four sites in Texas and Louisiana. Decisions on releasing SPR oil depend on whether to release sweet or sour crude, with past examples including the sale of light sweet crude to offset production curtailments. The sites offer access to marine terminals and pipeline systems for moving crude oil. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) sites in Texas and Louisiana provide secure and affordable storage in salt caverns. A $324 million life extension program (LEP I) in 1993 improved drawdown capability but did not address all equipment needs. A second program (LEP II) started in 2015 to upgrade equipment. The SPR has a maximum drawdown rate of 4.4 million barrels per day for 90 days, with oil taking about 13 days to enter the market after a presidential decision. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has a maximum drawdown rate of 4.4 million barrels per day for 90 days, with oil taking about 13 days to enter the market after a presidential decision. Refilling the SPR after a drawdown is at presidential discretion and can be done when the price of crude oil declines or market conditions are favorable. The International Energy Agency (IEA) requires members to hold a 90-day supply equivalent to net imports, with a drawdown maximum of 396 million barrels over a 90-day period. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has a maximum drawdown rate of 4.4 million barrels per day for 90 days, with oil entering the market after a presidential decision. Refilling the SPR is at presidential discretion. The International Energy Agency (IEA) requires members to hold a 90-day supply equivalent to net imports, with a drawdown maximum of 396 million barrels over a 90-day period. Presidential authority to authorize a drawdown depends on severe energy supply interruptions or preventing severe domestic disruptions. The United States is obligated to join an IEA-coordinated response to a supply disruption. The United States authorizes sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for various reasons, including revenue generation, testing SPR functionality, and modernization funding. Once a drawdown is authorized, DOE conducts a public sale through a competitive auction. Bids are reviewed, and oil could enter the market roughly two weeks after the sale notice. Through 2019, over 230 million barrels have been released from the SPR. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has released over 230 million barrels for various purposes through 2019. Presidents have ordered releases totaling 58.9 million barrels in response to energy supply interruptions. The SPR has also provided exchanges totaling around 75 million barrels to mitigate supply interruptions. Test sales and authorized sales for various reasons have reached around 88 million barrels through 2019. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has authorized the release of 88 million barrels through 2019 for revenue generation, deficit reduction, and modernization purposes. The 1975 EPCA allows drawdown of the SPR in case of severe energy supply interruptions, as determined by the President. An example of a coordinated release occurred in 2011 during the First Libyan Civil War, with a total release of 60 million barrels by all member countries. The IEA announced a total release of 60 million barrels from all member countries. The U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chu announced a sale of 30 million barrels from the SPR in accordance with IEA obligations. Congress amended EPCA in 1990 to extend SPR drawdown and sales in case of a domestic supply interruption, triggered by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. The amendment expanded authorities under EPCA for an SPR drawdown to prevent or reduce the impact of a severe domestic supply interruption. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to sell up to 30 million barrels of SPR petroleum over a 60-day period to prevent or reduce the impact of a supply shortage. The drawdown can only occur when the SPR inventory is above 340 million barrels, with a maximum test limit of 5 million barrels. The Secretary of Energy determines the sale price of SPR petroleum, which cannot be less than 95% of comparable crude oil prices. Congress must be notified 14 days before a test. Since 1975, various methods have been used to acquire petroleum for the SPR, including direct purchases and exchanges. The Secretary of Energy has specific powers outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a76239 to maintain and operate the SPR. Initially, the Department of Defense acquired crude oil for the SPR using appropriated funds until the inventory reached 591.7 million barrels in December 1994. In 1999, filling of the SPR resumed via an RIK program, where royalty payments were accepted as crude oil. President George W. Bush ordered the SPR to be filled to 700 million barrels in 2001, mainly through RIK crude oil acquisitions. The RIK program ended in 2009 after delivering roughly $4.6 billion worth of crude oil. In 2009, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced the end of the RIK program, which had delivered roughly $4.6 billion worth of crude oil. The Secretary of Energy can acquire crude oil for the SPR through purchase or exchange, with Congress appropriating funds for purchases and mandated sales of SPR oil starting in 2015. Since 2015, Congress has mandated the sale of 271 million barrels of SPR oil through FY2028, with actual sales totaling 34.93 million barrels by FY2019. In addition to mandated sales, modernization sales allow the Secretary of Energy to sell SPR oil based on a total dollar amount from FY2017 through FY2020, with proceeds deposited into the ESIMF for SPR facility construction and maintenance. The law mandates the use of the fund for SPR facility construction and maintenance. Congress created the SPR to ensure petroleum supply security and meet IEP obligations. With changing market conditions, Congress may need to modify SPR legislation, considering factors like the U.S. maintaining net export status and exceeding the 90-day IEP stockpile requirement. Some argue for maintaining current SPR levels as a national security asset. The role of the SPR in stabilizing oil prices and providing economic security may need to be expanded by Congress. Changes in global oil market dynamics and U.S. production levels have prompted a reevaluation of SPR utilization and policy options. Congressional actions, such as creating the SPR and restricting crude oil exports, have evolved to adapt to market developments. Maintaining current SPR levels is debated as a national security asset amidst shifting market conditions. In December 2015, Congress repealed restrictions on crude oil exports, leading to a debate on the size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). With the increase in domestic oil production and decrease in net imports, some stakeholders argue for a reduction in the SPR size. The U.S. has been exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than importing, prompting a reevaluation of the need for a large stockpile. The EIA projected that the United States will be a net petroleum exporter around 2020, but may return to being a net importer between 2040 and 2050. Some argue that maintaining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is important for oil security, as disruptions can impact all countries, leading to economic harm even for net exporting countries. If a global recession occurs, both exporting and importing countries will feel the economic impact. The United States may not always be a net exporter, as market conditions are changing with falling oil prices since January 2020. This could lead to decreased U.S. oil production, exports, employment, and industry consolidation. The Government Accountability Office recommended that the Department of Energy should consider private-sector responses, oil market projections, and costs when planning the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The United States may face delays in becoming a net exporter due to declining production and exports. Both public and private oil stocks play crucial roles in providing security during market disruptions and influencing oil prices. As market conditions evolve, the management of commercial stocks can impact oil prices, but this is limited by storage capacity. Reassessing the role of these components in U.S. energy security is necessary as the oil market changes. The storage capacity of the oil system can be adjusted, with oil industry firms holding stocks for continuous refining operations. Commercial stocks are mainly for short-term use, not long-term security. Experts debate the security level of commercial stocks compared to the SPR. Sales from the SPR during disruptions depend on commercial stocks and production capacity. Private oil stocks closely track production levels and oil prices, adjusting to global supply and demand. During supply disruptions, commercial stocks are likely to be used before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is tapped. The SPR takes about 13 days from decision to sale to deliver oil. In response to events like the 2019 attack on Saudi Arabia's oil production, the President can authorize SPR releases. Coordination with other IEA member countries for releases has occurred in the past, although not always announced. The IEA closely monitored the situation after the attack on Saudi oil production in 2019. The United States did not release oil from the SPR as commercial stocks stabilized prices. Experts believe the private sector is better equipped to respond to supply disruptions now compared to the 1970s. However, the US does not have a requirement for the private sector to respond to such disruptions, and there is no analysis on how they would react. Oil prices are influenced by global demand and supply conditions, impacting industry investments and production. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by Congress to address physical supply disruptions and economic effects from international events. Global oil prices dropped significantly in early 2020 due to reduced demand and the failure of OPEC+ to reach an agreement. The SPR can provide price relief and alleviate supply shortages for certain consumers. Congress may consider using the SPR in oversupplied low oil price environments. Due to low oil prices and the failure of OPEC+ to reach an agreement, discussions shifted from selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to purchasing oil to fill it to capacity. The Department of Energy (DOE) issued a solicitation to purchase an initial 30 million barrels of crude oil for SPR storage to absorb market oversupply. The SPR has a capacity of 713.5 million barrels, with current inventories at 635 million barrels. The Department of Energy (DOE) initially planned to purchase 77 million barrels of crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) but cancelled the solicitation due to funding uncertainty. Increasing SPR inventories may not significantly impact oil market rebalancing, as the SPR's capacity is limited. Congress authorized the SPR to store up to 1 billion barrels, offering a potential long-term solution. The DOE announced a solicitation for storing 30 million barrels in the SPR in exchange for a fixed premium, aiming to provide financial relief to U.S. producers. Challenges remain due to limited storage capacity at Cushing, OK. The limited storage capacity at Cushing, OK is impacting futures prices for crude oil contracts. As storage becomes more limited, prices may continue to fall as sellers discount their prices to attract buyers. Despite federal efforts to increase capacity at the SPR, Cushing storage remains a key factor for WTI prices. The Secretary is tasked with minimizing market impacts when acquiring petroleum for the SPR. The Secretary is tasked with minimizing market impacts when acquiring petroleum for the SPR under 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a76240. Acquiring SPR crude oil to reduce oversupply and increase prices could conflict with that objective. The impact on the market may be hard to determine, and a threshold level is not explicitly defined. DOE's objective is to minimize costs, and their exchange could result in a low-cost petroleum acquisition. Crude oil price increases result from market tightening due to increased demand, reduced supply, or both. A release from the SPR would likely provide temporary relief from rising prices, but high prices alone are not a trigger for a release. The U.S. government bases its notice of sale on the previous five-day average of the price of crude oil it intends to sell from the SPR. A release from the SPR provides temporary relief from rising prices caused by supply interruptions. While it may prompt a softening of prices, the long-term effect of an SPR crude drawdown is uncertain. Prices could decline if additional refined product is released into the market, but the quantitative impact is unpredictable. The IEA coordinated a petroleum release from the SPR in response to the Libyan Civil War, causing a 5% decline in crude oil prices. The oil was to be delivered by the end of August 2011, leading to a decline in prices through September. Some argue against using the SPR to mitigate high prices, preferring market resolution without government intervention. Some argue against using the SPR to mitigate high prices, preferring market resolution without government intervention. Congress could reduce the size of the SPR and sell off excess petroleum for the benefit of other programs while still maintaining the 90-day net import requirement. Determining the optimal level of oil holdings in the SPR is likely to remain controversial due to uncertain variables. The Bayou Choctaw storage site in Iberville Parish, LA has six storage caverns with a capacity of 76 million barrels. It began full operation in 1987 and has a current inventory of 71.8 million barrels. The site's design drawdown rate is 0.5 million barrels per day, with a fill rate of 110 thousand barrels per day. The Big Hill storage site in Jefferson County, TX has 14 storage caverns with a capacity of 170 million barrels. It began full operation in 1991 and has a cavern inventory of 143.3 million barrels as of April 2020. The site has a design drawdown rate of 1.1 million barrels per day and was designated as a special purpose Foreign Trade Zone in 1998. Despite this designation, foreign oil has not been stored at Big Hill according to the DOE's SPR calendar year 2016 report to Congress. The Bryan Mound storage site in Brazoria County, TX has 19 storage caverns with a total capacity of 247.1 million barrels. One cavern was emptied in 2013 due to failing a test, reducing the total to 19 caverns. Pumping to transfer oil to other caverns took place from 2015 to 2016. In 2018, two aboveground storage tanks needed maintenance, reducing the drawdown rate to 1.35 million barrels per day. The West Hackberry storage site in Cameron Parish, LA has 21 storage caverns with a total capacity of 220.4 million barrels. In 2012, Cavern 6 had a well stability issue and all accessible oil was transferred to other caverns by December 2017."
