The Economic Espionage Act of 1966 is amended to recognize the positive impact of Boys & Girls Clubs of America in communities, promoting the development of boys and girls through various programs and services. The program established by this section provides seed money for Boys & Girls Clubs of America to support local communities in offering education, youth development, and prevention programs. In 1990, there were 1,810 facilities serving 2,400,000 youths nationwide. This public investment has led to congressional appropriations and private partnerships. With congressional appropriations and private partnerships, there are now 4,387 Boys & Girls Clubs facilities across the US, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, serving 4,500,000 youths.
