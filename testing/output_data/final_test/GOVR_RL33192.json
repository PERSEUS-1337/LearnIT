    "content": "The current peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and China, signed in 1985 and set to expire in 2015, is up for renewal. A new agreement was submitted for congressional review in April 2015, with the required review period ending in July 2015. Congressional roles in crafting and implementing such agreements, known as \"123 agreements,\" are discussed in this report. These agreements are essential for nuclear cooperation, including exports of power plants and materials. The 1985 U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement was renewed in 2015. President Clinton signed certifications on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy and practices to implement the agreement. Congressional review ended in 1998, allowing the agreement to be implemented. The Obama Administration submitted a new agreement to Congress, meeting all terms of the Atomic Energy Act. The U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement could enter into force after a 30-day consultation period and a 60-day review period unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval. Congress has the option to approve or disapprove the agreement, with any efforts to block it subject to presidential veto. Chairman Bob Corker mentioned potential conditions that the Senate may want to place on the agreement. Two pieces of legislation have been introduced regarding this agreement. House Joint Resolution 56 (H.J.Res. 56) and S.J.Res. 19 were introduced regarding the U.S.-China Section 123 agreement. The resolution expressing disfavor was not acted upon before the review period ended on July 31, allowing the agreement to potentially enter into force. China's nuclear arsenal includes Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and other ballistic missiles, as well as submarines under production. China has approximately 250 nuclear warheads in its stockpile and is producing submarines that will carry nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. Beijing declared a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing in 1996 and signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty but has not ratified it. China became a nuclear-weapon state under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1992 and has a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA has the right to apply safeguards on all source or special fissionable material in facilities listed by China, but China can withhold some nuclear facilities from safeguards as a nuclear-weapon state. China, as a nuclear-weapon state, can withhold some nuclear facilities from safeguards under its agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The U.S.-China 123 agreement aims to ensure that nuclear material provided is used for peaceful purposes, advancing nonproliferation and national security interests. The agreement allows for specific transfers approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy approves licenses for specific transfers, not allowing restricted data or sensitive nuclear technology. Enrichment up to less than 20% U-235 and reprocessing of U.S.-obligated material is permitted at safeguarded sites. The agreement lasts 30 years and can be terminated with one year's notice. An Agreed Minute outlines steps for IAEA safeguards, ensuring peaceful use of transferred technology. Annual reviews are conducted for byproduct material. The Agreed Minute addresses byproduct material, annual information exchanges on byproduct material, retransfers, and technology exchanges between the United States and China. Retransfers to a third country require written consent and government assurances for technology transfers. Pre-Approved Activity and Nuclear Technology List and Pre-Approved Entity List are established for authorized technology transfers. The U.S.-China peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement includes transfer conditions and lists for authorized technology transfers. The U.S. nuclear industry pushed for the agreement in the 1990s to benefit from China's nuclear power growth. Westinghouse signed a contract to supply its AP1000 reactor to China and transfer its technology. Westinghouse agreed to transfer its reactor technology to China for the construction of AP1000 reactors. The first four reactors are under construction, with plans for 32 more. China has developed a larger version of the AP1000 and is set to start construction soon. China's nuclear power expansion program is the most aggressive globally, with 23 reactors under construction and plans for up to 100 more by 2030. This cooperation stems from the U.S.-China peaceful nuclear agreement to benefit from China's nuclear power growth. The United States has 99 power reactors as of June 2015. China plans to spend $11.2 billion annually on reactor construction for the next 10 years, creating a potential market for nuclear equipment suppliers worldwide. The Nuclear Energy Institute emphasizes the importance of renewing nuclear cooperation agreements with China and other countries for continued trade. A Department of Commerce study ranked China as the top export market for U.S. nuclear goods and services due to its rapid expansion in building new reactors. The value of U.S. nuclear exports to China and resulting U.S. employment are difficult to quantify. Major Chinese contracts awarded to U.S. nuclear suppliers have created billions in U.S. exports and tens of thousands of American jobs. Westinghouse's sale of four AP1000 reactors to China was announced at a value of $8 billion, with approximately 30 percent of the work being performed in the United States. Westinghouse's current contracts in the United States have created approximately 8,000 direct jobs and 20,000 indirect jobs in twenty states. The technology-transfer provisions in the contract may reduce U.S. participation in Chinese AP1000 projects over time. U.S. firms initially provided most of the nuclear-related components for the plants supplied under the deal. Westinghouse is in discussions in China for contracts for up to 20 additional AP1000 units, creating 7,000-8,000 jobs in the U.S. China's plans to export nuclear power plants based on Westinghouse technology may require U.S. suppliers due to certain products and services not available solely in China. China's plans to export nuclear power plants based on Westinghouse technology have raised concerns about U.S. control over the export of reactors and nuclear materials. The potential for Chinese dominance in the world nuclear power market with U.S. assistance is also a concern. The transfer of U.S. nuclear power technology to the Chinese naval reactor program, specifically the sealed pumps used by the AP1000, is another area of worry. The technology transfer agreement for the AP1000 grants the Chinese a nonexclusive license to use the technology in China, with Westinghouse retaining all intellectual property rights. The agreement with China allows them to modify the AP1000 design and export a larger passive plant, excluding the US and Japan. Westinghouse has the right to participate in these export projects or be compensated for their technology. China is developing the CAP1400 reactor for construction in 2015, with plans for exports. China's nuclear technology exports, especially to countries without nuclear power, could pose proliferation risks. Concerns arise over compliance with international safeguards and the potential development of fuel cycle facilities for nuclear weapons. China's nuclear export program relies on Westinghouse's AP1000 technology transfer, crucial for competitiveness in world markets. Authorization by the Secretary of Energy is required for nuclear technology transfers to foreign countries. Authorization by the Secretary of Energy is necessary for nuclear technology transfers to foreign countries under 10 C.F.R. Part 810. Recipient governments must provide assurances that the technology will be used for peaceful purposes and not retransferred without approval. Government-to-government assurances are required for the approval process, ensuring the technology is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. The Agreed Minute to the 123 Agreement prohibits retransfer of technology without consent. The U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement prohibits the transfer of technology to a third country without consent. Transfer conditions must be defined by mutual agreement before any transfer. Increased nuclear safety and reduced carbon emissions are reasons for extending the agreement. The NEI emphasizes the importance of deploying safe nuclear technologies in China, including the standardized U.S. advanced reactor design. This technology aims to reduce carbon emissions and disrupt China's nuclear development plans if U.S. nuclear cooperation is ended. The Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology being transferred to China incorporates passive safety features to minimize radioactive releases significantly. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the design, noting its advanced safety systems for accident prevention and mitigation. The AP1000 reactor technology being transferred to China includes passive safety features to reduce accidents. A probabilistic risk assessment by Westinghouse stated that the risk of nuclear core damage in the AP1000 would be significantly lower than existing nuclear power plants. China and the United States jointly announced targets to control carbon emissions, with the US agreeing to cut emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, and China agreeing to halt its rapid rise in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. China agreed to increase non-fossil-fuel energy to 20% by 2030, requiring 800-1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar capacity. Some question the safety and environmental benefits of expanded nuclear power, advocating for energy efficiency and renewable energy instead. Chinese wind and solar capacity additions exceed nuclear installations. In 2014, capacity additions totaled 56.6 GW of non-fossil fueled generating capacity, including hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear power. The new Section 123 agreement allows for reprocessing of U.S.-obligated spent fuel at IAEA safeguarded facilities with advance consent. This permission has been included in agreements with India and Euratom. The new Section 123 agreement allows for reprocessing of U.S.-obligated spent fuel at IAEA safeguarded facilities with advance consent. China plans to reprocess spent fuel domestically for reuse as mixed oxide fuel, raising concerns about increasing stockpiles of plutonium for weapons purposes. The agreement includes provisions for tracking material, data exchange, and site visits to ensure material is not used for military purposes. The 1985 Section 123 agreement with China allowed for potential reprocessing of spent fuel from U.S.-designed reactors for peaceful purposes, but no arrangements were made. Congress was concerned about unclear U.S. consent rights in the agreement. President Clinton's certification ensures that U.S. consent rights in the agreement with China must be exercised before certain activities can be carried out. Concerns exist that China could potentially use plutonium from commercial reactors for weapons if safeguards are disregarded in the future. The Nonproliferation Policy Education Center questions the policy of allowing reprocessing of plutonium from U.S.-designed reactors in China, raising concerns about the potential for a military diversion of weapons-usable plutonium. China may aim to accelerate its nuclear weapons build-up over the next 30 years. China may want to accelerate a nuclear weapons build-up over the next 30 years, but this scenario seems improbable. If China were to stop following its IAEA safeguards agreement, the US and China would consult to find a solution. China is unlikely to use nuclear material from US-supplied reactors for its arsenal due to reasons like not significantly increasing its nuclear arsenal in the near future and having enough fissile material for weapons. Beijing has sufficient fissile material for nuclear weapons, with a stockpile of 1.8 metric tons of plutonium. China mines and imports uranium, so additional sources may not be needed. U.S. reactors likely to be exported to China are light water reactors, which are not used for plutonium production for weapons. China is considered a nuclear weapons state since 1964. Analyst Mark Hibbs states that China, a nuclear weapons state since 1964, has military-grade plutonium and uranium inventories from dedicated military reactors and reprocessing plants. It is unlikely for China to divert U.S.-obligated civilian nuclear materials for future weapons production. Australia's uranium exports to China are closely monitored, with all nuclear material accounted for and used for peaceful purposes. The nuclear cooperation agreement between Australia and China has been in force since February 2007. The nuclear cooperation agreement with China, in force since February 2007, includes new monitoring measures for U.S.-obligated material. Concerns have been raised about potential misuse of U.S. nuclear technology by China's naval reactor program. Close scrutiny of end users of U.S. technology is necessary before technology transfers are approved. Before technology transfers are approved by the United States, government-to-government assurances are required, in which \"the recipient government pledges to use the acquired technology exclusively for peaceful purposes.\" Congress reviews the unclassified NPAS and its classified annexes as supporting documents, which give an overview of China's adherence to nonproliferation treaties and agreements. China has made nuclear security improvements and its civilian reactors are under IAEA safeguards. China has cooperated with the United States on detecting illicit nuclear materials and made nuclear security improvements. However, concerns remain about China's nonproliferation record, especially regarding the export of dual-use goods to Iran and North Korea. Chinese entities have been involved in transferring nuclear and missile technology to countries like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. China has provided missile-related items and assistance to countries like Iran, Libya, and North Korea, as well as nuclear material and expertise to Pakistan. There were past nuclear cooperation with Iran, including supplying reactors and technology that raised proliferation concerns. China has made significant progress in joining the international nonproliferation regime and implementing nuclear export controls since the 1985 nuclear cooperation agreement. This includes pledges to refrain from assisting unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, transferring certain longer-range missiles, and curtailing sensitive nuclear cooperation with Iran. U.S. reports indicate that China has increased restraint on weapons of mass destruction-related transfers and improved export controls. China has shown improvement in its export controls and proliferation behavior, with reports indicating concrete actions taken by Beijing to curb nuclear technology transfers and government-sanctioned assistance. The Defense Department noted in 2001 that China's proliferation behavior had improved in recent years. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Vann Van Diepen stated that China is no longer providing government-sanctioned nuclear assistance to most countries. China has shown improvement in its export controls and proliferation behavior, with reports indicating concrete actions taken by Beijing to curb nuclear technology transfers and government-sanctioned assistance. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Vann Van Diepen stated that China is no longer selling complete MTCR-class missile systems or complete production capabilities for such missiles like in the '80s and '90s, and these activities are not done at the behest of the Chinese government. China's behavior concerning transfers to Iran's nuclear program exemplifies Beijing's proliferation policy changes, such as canceling the transfer of a uranium conversion facility to Iran in 1997 and suspending the sale of two nuclear power reactors to Iran. Public U.S. intelligence community reports from 1997-2011 show that neither Chinese entities nor the Chinese government engaged in nuclear cooperation with Iran during that time. Despite improvements in export controls and proliferation behavior, Chinese entities have continued to engage in proliferation activities, raising concerns about the transfer of dual-use WMD goods to countries like Iran, North Korea, and Syria. The U.S. Government has sanctioned multiple Chinese companies and individuals for proliferation since 1997, with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) being repeatedly sanctioned. While SOEs have improved their proliferation records, smaller private companies remain a significant concern for proliferation sanctions. Chinese firms are a major concern for proliferation sanctions, especially in providing missile technology to countries like Iran and North Korea. Despite some improvements in export controls, Chinese entities continue to supply missile programs in countries of concern. The U.S. Government has sanctioned Chinese companies and individuals for proliferation activities since 1997, with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) being a focus. Smaller private companies are also a significant concern for proliferation sanctions. During a Senate hearing in May 2015, it was noted that China lacks the political commitment, bureaucratic enforcement capability, and necessary legislation to effectively control dual-use exports. While some improvements have been made in strategic export controls by government-owned companies, Chinese individuals and companies are still under U.S. sanctions for proliferation activities. Concerns remain about China's willingness and ability to detect and prevent illicit transfers. Congress may need to question the progress made in this area. China's construction of civil nuclear reactors in Pakistan has raised congressional concerns. Beijing has built two power reactors in Pakistan and plans to construct three more, all under IAEA safeguards. This violates NSG guidelines as Pakistan lacks IAEA safeguards on all its nuclear facilities. China's ongoing construction of new nuclear power plants in Pakistan is seen as inconsistent with its commitments. The U.S. has been grappling with the question of nuclear cooperation with China since the 1980s, considering its implications on diplomatic, security, and economic interests. Despite historical tensions and China's nuclear proliferation to countries like Pakistan and Iran, cooperation began in the 1970s. The risks and benefits of nuclear cooperation are carefully weighed, especially in light of China's construction of new nuclear power plants in Pakistan, which goes against NSG guidelines. The U.S. has been considering nuclear cooperation with China since the 1980s, weighing risks and benefits. Key developments in the agreement were timed for diplomatic summits between U.S. Presidents and PRC leaders. President Reagan witnessed the initialing of the agreement in 1984, and Secretary of Energy John Herrington signed it in 1985. Reagan submitted the agreement to Congress, considering a presidential certification on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy. The agreement on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy was signed by President Clinton in 1998 after almost 13 years of consideration and congressional review. Key congressional actions, including the passage of P.L. 99-183, played a crucial role in the agreement's implementation. After the 1989 Tiananmen Crackdown, Congress enacted sanctions suspending nuclear cooperation with China and requiring an additional presidential certification on the PRC's nuclear nonproliferation assurances. U.S. officials negotiating a nuclear cooperation agreement with China linked possible U.S. nuclear exports to China with its reported nuclear proliferation practices. Senators Gordon Humphrey, William Roth, and William Proxmire raised concerns about China's nuclear proliferation practices before an agreement was finalized. Senators Gordon Humphrey, William Roth, and William Proxmire urged Secretary of State George Shultz in December 1983 to draft an agreement with China that includes explicit pledges on nuclear nonproliferation. Concerns were raised about China's nuclear proliferation activities in Argentina and South Africa. This was in preparation for President Ronald Reagan's visit to China in April 1984 to improve bilateral relations. During President Reagan's visit to China in April 1984, negotiations for a civil nuclear cooperation agreement intensified. China initially objected to U.S. requirements under the Atomic Energy Act but eventually agreed not to enrich or reprocess fuel from U.S.-built reactors. President Reagan expressed pride in the agreement, stating it would benefit China's modernization efforts. During negotiations for a civil nuclear cooperation agreement, China agreed not to enrich or reprocess fuel from U.S.-built reactors and took steps to address U.S. concerns about nuclear proliferation. China joined the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1984 and the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004, despite initial opposition to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. China joined the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004 and agreed to safeguards for its nuclear projects in Pakistan. The PRC Minister of Nuclear Industry stated in 1984 that China would request recipient countries to accept safeguards for nuclear materials and equipment. China did not offer to place its civilian nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, remaining the only nuclear weapon state outside such arrangements. China made nonproliferation pledges during visits to the United States in 1984 and 1985, promising not to engage in nuclear proliferation or help other countries develop nuclear weapons. Questions remained about the specifics of these pledges and whether they would be publicly issued by China. The agreement was initialed during Reagan's visit to China in April 1984 but was not submitted to Congress until July 1985. In July 1985, during a visit by PRC President Li Xiannian to Washington, DC, an agreement on nuclear nonproliferation was signed by Secretary of Energy John Herrington and Li Peng. Despite some acknowledgments of problems and disagreements within the Administration, the agreement remained largely unchanged from previous assurances. The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) stated that the proposed Agreement meets all requirements of relevant acts and will benefit U.S. non-proliferation goals. This unique agreement with China, a nuclear-weapon state, required clarification on nuclear policies, which was successfully resolved. The potential threat to non-proliferation objectives is from \"maverick\" suppliers undermining safeguards. The agreement with China addresses concerns about non-proliferation objectives and the potential threat from \"maverick\" suppliers. China's past policies raised concerns due to non-adherence to international norms. Negotiations were challenging, especially regarding IAEA safeguards, which China adamantly refused to accept. The agreement aims to ensure that China's policies align with non-proliferation practices common to major suppliers like the United States. Adelman emphasized the need for mutually acceptable arrangements for U.S. exports to China, including visits to relevant sites and restrictions on reprocessing U.S. origin material without consent. He stressed the importance of ensuring that materials are used in line with the agreement. Additionally, ACDA provided a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement justifying the agreement with China under the Atomic Energy Act. ACDA provided a favorable assessment of the proposed agreement with China under the Atomic Energy Act, stating it would advance non-proliferation objectives. However, the NRC expressed concerns about the adequacy of assurances provided by China in the agreement. The NRC expressed concerns about the adequacy of assurances provided by China in the agreement, particularly regarding U.S. consent rights for reprocessing or enrichment of nuclear fuel. Additionally, there was a provision in the Agreement that could limit Congress's authority to enact future legislation affecting the activities covered. President Reagan submitted the Agreement to Congress on July 24, 1985. President Reagan submitted the \"Agreement Between the United States and the People's Republic of China Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy\" to Congress, highlighting China's plans for nuclear power stations and efforts to clarify nonproliferation policies. This was the first nuclear cooperation agreement with a Communist country and the only one with another nuclear-weapon state. Reagan did not address the NRC's concerns about U.S. consent rights for reprocessing or enrichment of nuclear fuel. President Reagan submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with China to Congress, emphasizing its positive impact on U.S.-China relations, economic benefits, and non-proliferation interests. He assured that the agreement would not pose an unreasonable risk to common defense and security. President Reagan submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with China to Congress, emphasizing its positive impact on U.S.-China relations, economic benefits, and non-proliferation interests. The agreement was submitted without exemption from Section 123(a) of the Atomic Energy Act, initiating a 30-day congressional review followed by a 60-day review. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Representative Dante Fascell, held a hearing where various officials testified, including Secretary of Energy John Herrington and ACDA Director Kenneth Adelman. Representative Edward Markey raised objections and submitted his legal analysis of the agreement. Representative Markey objected to the nuclear cooperation agreement with China, citing concerns about lax terms, lack of safeguards for U.S. nuclear materials, and China's nuclear exports to other countries. He criticized the Administration for not tightening the agreement language and relying on classified assurances regarding China's activities. Representative Markey raised concerns about the nuclear cooperation agreement with China, questioning the lack of safeguards for U.S. nuclear materials and China's exports to other countries. He criticized the Administration for relying on classified assurances from China, including a secret memorandum, to address these issues. Representative Markey raised concerns about the nuclear cooperation agreement with China, questioning the lack of safeguards for U.S. nuclear materials and China's exports to other countries. Kennedy testified that China assured orally they would require safeguards on their exports, but Markey stated the agreement did not comply with the Atomic Energy Act. The President should resubmit the nuclear cooperation agreement with exemptions from safeguards and prior consent requirements. Representative Markey questioned why China was not held to the same standards as the UK, a nuclear weapons state. He emphasized the need for U.S. approval for any nuclear reprocessing or enrichment activities. The lack of U.S. approval for China's nuclear reprocessing or enrichment activities led to legislative options including requesting the President to resubmit the agreement with exemptions from certain sections of the Atomic Energy Act. Representative Markey introduced H.Res. 269 for this purpose, while Representative Feighan introduced H.R. 3537 for adequate verification of nuclear exports to China. Senator Glenn also introduced S. 1754 for the same purpose. Senator John Glenn introduced S. 1754 for verification of peaceful nuclear exports to China, opposed by the Administration. Senator Durenberger supported the bill, while Senators Lugar and Helms backed the Administration. H.J.Res. 404 was introduced to approve the agreement, with an amendment by Representative Bonker adding conditions for presidential certification and a 30-day waiting period. The amendment added conditions for presidential certification and a 30-day waiting period for verification of peaceful nuclear exports to China. It required the President to certify the effectiveness of verification, China's nuclear nonproliferation policies, and that each export would comply with U.S. laws. Additionally, a presidential report on China's nonproliferation policies was mandated, and the agreement with China was not to set a precedent for future negotiations. The House Foreign Affairs Committee adopted an amendment to the bill, noting concerns about Chinese nuclear assistance to Pakistan. The committee's report highlighted that U.S. nuclear cooperation with China would not enhance its military nuclear capabilities. The House subsequently passed S.J.Res. 238 (P.L. 99-183) in lieu of H.J.Res. 404. The House passed S.J.Res. 238 (P.L. 99-183) in lieu of H.J.Res. 404. The Senate also passed S.J.Res. 238, relating to the approval of the nuclear cooperation agreement with China. President Reagan signed the bill into law on December 16, 1985. On June 4, 1989, Deng Xiaoping and other PRC leaders used the People's Liberation Army to suppress peaceful demonstrators in Beijing, resulting in the Tiananmen Crackdown. The military crackdown led to the deaths and injuries of hundreds, if not thousands, of demonstrators, followed by mass arrests, executions, and imprisonment. In response, Representative Markey introduced language to limit nuclear cooperation with China by amending the Foreign Assistance Act. The language aimed to ban export licenses and nuclear cooperation unless certain certifications were made regarding the end of martial law and the human rights situation in China. On June 29, Representative Dante Fascell introduced sanctions on China in an en bloc amendment to H.R. 2655, which passed the House by 418-0. H.R. 2655 was passed in the House but not the Senate. In the Senate, on July 14, 1989, Senators George Mitchell and Robert Dole introduced an amendment to S. 1160 seeking to impose additional sanctions against the PRC, including the limitation of nuclear cooperation. The Senate passed the amendment by 81-10. On July 21, the Senate incorporated the bill in the House version (H.R. 1487) and passed it in lieu of S. 1160, legislating comprehensive sanctions in response to the Tiananmen Crackdown. Section 902(a)(6) of P.L. 101-246 suspended nuclear cooperation with China until certain certifications were made to Congress. After the Tiananmen Crackdown of 1989, Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush did not certify progress in political reforms by the PRC government, leading to a deterioration in US-China relations. The Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996 further strained the relationship. President Clinton's 1998 certification to Congress acknowledged concerns about Chinese entities' involvement in the Pakistani nuclear weapons program, resulting in the suspension of the 1985 nuclear cooperation agreement. In 1997, discussions between Washington and Beijing included China's request for the implementation of an agreement regarding nuclear cooperation with Iran. The Clinton Administration considered this agreement as a key aspect of a state visit by PRC ruler Jiang Zemin to Washington, DC. Representatives Markey and Solomon urged President Clinton not to certify the agreement, leading to a hearing in the House International Relations Committee. In October 1997, hearings were held in the Senate and House regarding an agreement on nuclear cooperation with China. The House passed an amendment to extend congressional review to 120 days. U.S. firms lobbied Congress for access to a $50 billion market. The PRC joined the Zangger Committee and pledged not to start new nuclear projects in Iran. In October 1997, the U.S. and China signed agreements on peaceful nuclear technology cooperation. President Clinton signed certifications on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy and practices. The agreements included bringing Chinese scientists to U.S. nuclear facilities. President Clinton submitted certifications to Congress under P.L. 101-246, stating that it was in the national interest to terminate the suspension of nuclear cooperation with China. This decision aimed to promote U.S. nonproliferation and national security interests, as well as strengthen bilateral relations with China based on respect for international norms. President Clinton submitted certifications to Congress under P.L. 101-246, stating that it was in the U.S. national interest to build stronger bilateral relations with China based on respect for international norms. The Agreement will allow U.S. companies to compete in China's nuclear energy market. Clinton provided various documents to support his certification, including a Memorandum, Report on PRC's Nonproliferation Policies, and a Memorandum of Understanding on Exchanges of Information with China. During the debate on the agreement, concerns were raised about China's nonproliferation policies and practices. Some argued that China had not made enough changes to warrant certifications and that they did not align with U.S. interests. The House International Relations Committee held a hearing where Robert Einhorn from the Clinton Administration emphasized the need for cautious monitoring of China's behavior. President Reagan's advice to \"trust but verify\" was highlighted as a necessary approach. The Congressional review of the agreement with China ended on March 18, 1998, allowing implementation. U.S. firms can apply for financing and licenses for nuclear exports to China. On October 17, 1998, a requirement was enacted for the President to notify Congress upon granting licenses for nuclear exports to countries like China. The State Department issued a notification to Congress on June 9, 2000, regarding the export of tantalite ore to China. President Clinton submitted a certification with a Memorandum of Understanding in 1987, stating that arrangements met the certification standard for peaceful use of nuclear material. The agreement with China did not require bilateral safeguards and called for diplomatic channels to establish mutually acceptable arrangements. The Memorandum called for annual visits to reactors and consultations in case of discrepancies for mutually acceptable arrangements. The United States and the PRC signed the Memorandum of Understanding on May 6, 1998, for nuclear cooperation. On May 6, 1998, the United States and China signed a Memorandum of Understanding for nuclear cooperation. The Clinton Administration had concerns about China potentially transferring U.S. nuclear technology to other countries for military use. Disagreements over assurances led to the delay of 16 export authorization applications for U.S. technology. These cases, known as \"Part 810 cases,\" were regulated by Part 810 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In 2003, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham and China's Atomic Energy Authority agreed to prevent China from retransferring U.S. nuclear technology without U.S. consent. This understanding was formalized through an exchange of diplomatic notes to establish procedures for nonproliferation assurances. The Bush Administration continued seeking assurances to prevent unauthorized re-transfers by China. In September 2004, the State Department confirmed the significance of the 2003 diplomatic notes, following the 1998 agreement allowing nuclear transfers based on case-by-case review. The NRC and DOE issued licenses for nuclear exports to China under the nuclear cooperation agreement, with conditions and assurances for transfers of nuclear technology. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 imposed additional restrictions on licensing nuclear exports to countries with entities conducting certain energy-related transactions with Iran. The President can waive restrictions on nuclear exports to countries with entities involved in activities with Iran related to nuclear weapons or advanced weapons if certain conditions are met."
