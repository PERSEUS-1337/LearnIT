U.S. production of crude oil has more than doubled to 6.6 million barrels per day in 2014, while natural gas production has risen to 69.8 billion cubic feet per day. This growth has led to an oversupply of natural gas in U.S. gas-producing regions and shifted the energy supply and demand balance in key markets. The oversupply of certain light sweet Western crudes, such as those from the Bakken region, has led to calls for increased exports of domestic energy resources. Legislative proposals in the 113th Congress aim to facilitate overseas exports of crude oil and natural gas, subject to national interest determinations. The ongoing Congressional debate in the United States revolves around allowing overseas exports of crude oil and natural gas. Previous administrations and Congress have authorized such exports when beneficial to the country, with Alaska being a significant energy producer with a history of exports dating back decades. A review of Alaska's experiences with exports may provide valuable historical perspectives for policymakers. This report summarizes Alaskan crude oil and natural gas export authorizations since the late 1960s, excluding refined products, natural gas liquids, and coal. Alaska's energy-producing basins are located on the North Slope and in the Cook Inlet region. Development of North Slope oil began with the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field in 1968 and the subsequent development of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) in the 1970s. The North Slope contains significant oil reserves. The North Slope and Cook Inlet regions in Alaska have significant oil and natural gas resources. Crude oil drilling in Cook Inlet dates back to the early 1900s, while North Slope oil development began in 1968 with the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field. The Trans Alaska Pipeline System was authorized in 1973 to export oil from the North Slope. The Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) was completed in 1977, allowing for oil shipments from the North Slope to California for refining. Production peaked at nearly 2 million barrels per day in 1988. The United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 authorized limited exports of TAPS crude oil. The US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 allowed exports of up to 50,000 bbl/d of TAPS crude oil to Canada, meeting the needs of Vancouver refineries. This reciprocal access was sought by Canada to ensure a supply of oil and gas to the US. President Reagan found these exports to be in the national interest on December 31, 1988. In the mid-1990s, high volumes of Alaskan oil could only be economically shipped to the four western states, leading to falling oil prices and constrained domestic production. Complaints arose about artificially depressed prices, underutilized tankers, and negative impacts on marine employment and national defense. Efforts to address these issues failed until 1995. The 1994 DOE study concluded that allowing the export of Alaskan North Slope crude oil would benefit the U.S. economy by expanding markets, increasing value, and generating new economic activity and employment in California and Alaska. This would not raise gasoline prices and would result in increased producer revenues. The 1994 DOE study found that lifting the export restrictions on Alaskan North Slope crude oil would lead to increased revenues from accessing a broader market and transportation savings. Higher prices at the wellhead would also boost production in Alaska and California, resulting in additional income for the federal government and the state of Alaska. Opposition to crude oil exports from TAPS was driven by concerns from the U.S. maritime industry about the Jones Act requirements for U.S.-flagged vessels. The Jones Act requires shipments between U.S. ports to be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels. Opponents of exports from TAPS argued it would increase U.S. dependence on foreign oil, raise gasoline prices, and lead to job losses at West Coast refineries. Despite opposition, export ban repeal bills in the 104th Congress passed by large margins. President Clinton signed the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Amendment Act in November 1995. The Pipeline Amendment Act (P.L. 104-58) in November 1995 allowed oil transported through TAPS to be exported unless the President determines it is not in the national interest. After an interagency review, President Clinton authorized North Slope oil exports in April 1996, stating it would not impact the economy or environment significantly. The Pipeline Amendment Act in November 1995 allowed oil from TAPS to be exported unless deemed against national interest. President Clinton authorized North Slope oil exports in April 1996, with conditions to mitigate environmental risks. TAPS exports started at 36,000 bbl/d in 1996, reaching a high of 74,000 bbl/d in 1999, representing 7% of North Slope production. Between 1996 and 2004, Alaskan crude oil exports from TAPS were mainly shipped to South Korea, Japan, China, and Taiwan. TAPS exports temporarily ceased in May 2000 due to competition from foreign buyers. In 2004, an additional cargo was sent to China for repairs. TAPS exports resumed in September 2014, with a shipment to South Korea. Despite reaching peak export levels in 1999, the volumes were not considered significant by market analysts. In a July 1999 report, the General Accounting Office (GAO) found that lifting the North Slope oil export ban increased prices by $0.98 to $1.30 per barrel but had minimal impact on production. The ban lift raised costs for some refiners but had limited effects on consumers and the oil-shipping industry on the West Coast. Alaskan crude oil exports are restricted under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 restricts Alaskan crude oil exports. The President can allow exemptions for exports deemed consistent with national interest. The Secretary of Commerce implements EPCA, granting export licenses through the Bureau of Industry and Security. In 1985, an exemption was granted for crude oil exports from Alaska's Cook Inlet to boost oil development in the region. Crude oil production from Cook Inlet state waters was declining due to lack of investment. The Secretary of Commerce addressed the benefits of exporting Cook Inlet crude oil, including increased investment incentives, transportation efficiencies, and energy security enhancements for allies. The initiative aims to encourage other countries to remove trade barriers to U.S. goods and services. The BIS license policy allows for exports of crude oil from Alaska's Cook Inlet. The licensing policy allows for exports of crude oil from Alaska's Cook Inlet. BIS export licenses have a one-year term and can be revoked in case of a serious interruption to U.S. oil supplies. Alaska receives royalties from oil and gas production in the Cook Inlet. The state of Alaska began exporting its RIK oil from the Cook Inlet to Taiwan in 1987, with exports continuing through competitive auctions until 1991. The total volume of RIK Cook Inlet crude oil exported to Taiwan between 1987 and 1991 was 3,587,088 barrels. These exports ceased after the eruption of Mount Redoubt volcano disrupted oil operations. Today, nearly all crude oil produced in Cook Inlet is supplied to a nearby refinery. The Cook Inlet region exports crude oil to a refinery near Kenai, AK, which produces most of Alaska's gasoline. The 1988 US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement allowed up to 50,000 bbl/d of TAPS crude oil to be exported to Canada, a provision later included in NAFTA. However, a 1996 determination allowing unlimited exports from TAPS raises questions about potential conflicts with the 1988 agreement. The Kenai Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Nikiski, AK, began operation in 1969 as the first commercial LNG export facility in the United States. It was developed by Phillips Petroleum and Marathon Oil, with export authority granted by the Federal Power Commission in 1967. The export authority has been extended multiple times, most recently in 2014 by the DOE for 40 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The Kenai LNG Plant in Alaska, the first commercial LNG export facility in the US, has exported over 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since 1969. ConocoPhillips announced plans to close the plant in 2011 due to market conditions and inability to secure long-term gas supplies from Cook Inlet. The plant resumed shipments in May 2012 due to increased demand after Japan's disasters. The Kenai LNG Plant in Alaska, the first commercial LNG export facility in the US, has exported over 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since 1969. ConocoPhillips announced plans to close the plant in 2011 due to market conditions and inability to secure long-term gas supplies from Cook Inlet. The plant resumed shipments in May 2012 due to increased demand after Japan's disasters, and in 2014, it reopened again to export excess production. The Kenai LNG export authority was granted on April 14, 2014, allowing exports to non-FTA countries for a two-year period. ConocoPhillips argued that the exported natural gas would help sustain existing gas fields and incentivize further gas development in the region. No evidence was presented to oppose the authorization. The DOE expedited approval for additional exports from Kenai LNG to non-FTA countries in December 2013, citing its unique characteristics compared to other projects in the queue. Arctic Alaska has substantial natural gas resources, with estimates of over 200 trillion cubic feet of conventional reserves on the North Slope. The USGS estimates up to 80 Tcf of shale gas and 158 Tcf of methane hydrates on the North Slope of Alaska. While methane hydrate resources are not yet developed, future technologies may make production economically viable. Congress has been encouraging the development of these natural gas resources for over forty years, with plans to construct infrastructure for supply to southern Alaska, the lower-48 states, or export markets. The USGS estimates significant natural gas resources on the North Slope of Alaska, with plans to construct a pipeline to the lower-48 states. Congress has supported this project for over forty years, with various presidential administrations also backing the initiative. The proposed Alaska gas pipeline is considered a major construction project in North America, with estimated costs of $27 billion. The Alaska gas pipeline project, estimated at $27-30 billion in the mid-2000s, faces challenges due to lower natural gas prices in the lower-48 states. Alaskan officials and North Slope producers are considering an alternative plan to construct a pipeline to Nikiski for LNG export, as international LNG prices have risen. The project, known as Alaska LNG Project L.L.C., aims to tap into the lucrative LNG export market. The Alaska LNG Project L.L.C. is a $45-65 billion project that includes a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile pipeline, and an LNG liquefaction plant. It is being developed by ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, BP, and TransCanada, with the state of Alaska as an equity partner. The project aims to export approximately 929 billion cubic feet of LNG annually to both FTA and non-FTA countries over a 30-year term. Alaska LNG requested expedited review and exemption from new procedures for export of natural gas. Energy Secretary Moniz agreed to treat Alaska differently due to its isolated gas reserves. Final authorization requires environmental review and approval from FERC. Alaska LNG requested expedited review and exemption from new procedures for natural gas export. President Reagan's finding in 1988 allowed Alaska natural gas exports to comply with market criteria. President Reagan's finding in 1988 allowed Alaska natural gas exports to comply with market criteria, with our comprehensive energy policy. Alaska LNG's export application argues that this finding still applies to the current project, although debate exists on whether a new finding under ANGTA is necessary. The project is largely conceptual with unresolved issues in engineering, technical, regulatory, environmental, economic, and permitting aspects. Development time for the pipeline could be lengthy, but prior experience suggests technical feasibility. The North Slope in Alaska is a contentious political issue due to its habitat for endangered species. Congressional debate continues on allowing overseas exports of crude oil and natural gas. Alaska's export policies consider regional production trends, market prices, and commodity demand. Despite long-standing export approvals, exports from Alaska have been relatively modest. The Alaska experience with crude oil and natural gas exports has been modest, raising questions about energy exports from other U.S. regions, the impact on the maritime shipping industry, capital investment expectations, environmental effects, and international trade agreements. The U.S. government may need to adjust its oil and natural gas export policies by region. Statutory limits on TAPS oil exports are outlined in the Trans Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act of 1973. Before any crude oil can be exported under the Export Administration Act of 1969, the President must make a finding that such exports will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United States, and are in the national interest. Congress has sixty days to consider the findings and determine if the exports are in the national interest. The Export Administration Act of 1979 allows for the export of domestically produced crude oil under certain conditions. The President must make a finding that the exports are in the national interest, and Congress has sixty days to pass a resolution of disapproval if they disagree. No domestically produced crude oil transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted pursuant to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act can be exported, except for exchanges with adjacent foreign countries. The Export Administration Act of 1979 allows for the export of domestically produced crude oil under certain conditions, including exchanges with adjacent foreign countries and temporary exports for transportation efficiency. The President must recommend the export, and Congress has the opportunity to disapprove within sixty days. Oil can be exported to Canada in limited amounts, and ocean transportation must use US-documented vessels. The Export Administration Act of 1979 allows for the export of domestically produced crude oil under specific conditions recommended by the President to Congress. The exports must not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum in the United States, result in lower acquisition costs for refiners, and reflect savings in wholesale and retail prices of refined products. Export contracts can be terminated if US crude oil suppliers are interrupted. The Export Administration Act of 1979 allows for the export of domestically produced crude oil under specific conditions recommended by the President to Congress. The exports must not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum in the United States, result in lower acquisition costs for refiners, and reflect savings in wholesale and retail prices of refined products. Export contracts can be terminated if US crude oil suppliers are interrupted, threatened, or diminished. The President may export oil to any country under bilateral agreements or the International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Amendment Act of 1995 allows for the export of Alaskan North Slope oil unless the President determines it is not in the national interest. The President must evaluate if the exportation would diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United States and conduct an environmental review within four months. The President must evaluate the potential environmental impact and consider anticompetitive activity before allowing the export of crude oil. The determination must be made within five months or after an environmental review. Terms and conditions may be imposed to ensure consistency with national interest. The export of crude oil must be evaluated for environmental impact and anticompetitive activity. Terms and conditions may be imposed to ensure consistency with national interest, including the requirement for oil to be transported by a US-owned vessel when exported. The President retains authority to prohibit oil exportation under various acts. The Emergencies Act prohibits the exportation of oil, with the Secretary of Commerce issuing rules for implementation within 30 days. If anticompetitive activity causes oil supply shortages or price increases, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend action against the exporter. The President has the authority to take action against individuals involved in exporting crude oil, including modifying or revoking export authorizations. Administrative actions related to export authorizations are not subject to certain sections of the United States Code. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 allows the President to restrict exports of coal, petroleum products, natural gas, petrochemical feedstocks, materials, and equipment necessary for energy exploration, production, refining, or transportation. The President has the authority to restrict exports of energy supplies and facilities within the United States. The President may prohibit the export of crude oil and natural gas produced in the United States, with exemptions allowed based on national interest. Exemptions may be based on various factors such as purpose for export, seller or purchaser class, or country of destination. The President has the authority to restrict exports of energy supplies and facilities within the United States, including coal, petroleum products, natural gas, and petrochemical feedstocks. The Secretary of Commerce can impose restrictions as specified in any rule under the Export Administration Act of 1969. Any actions taken must consider the national interest and the need for uninterrupted exchanges with foreign entities. The United States allows temporary exports for transportation convenience or efficiency with foreign states, including Canada and Mexico."
