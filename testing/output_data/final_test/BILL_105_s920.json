    "content": "The \"Adoption Report Card Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Social Security Act to include an annual report card on state performance in protecting children. The \"Adoption Report Card Act of 1997\" amends the Social Security Act to require the Secretary to issue an annual report card with ratings on how well each State protects children in adoption, foster care, or with a guardian. Outcome measures for categories related to family conditions of the children are included, developed in consultation with child advocacy organizations. The \"Adoption Report Card Act of 1997\" requires the Secretary to issue an annual report card with ratings on how well each State protects children in adoption, foster care, or with a guardian. It includes outcome measures such as the length of stay in foster care, time between availability for adoption and actual adoption, and finalization of placement plans for children in foster care. It also specifies the number of children in foster care, including those with special needs. The curr_chunk provides details on various factors related to foster care and adoption, such as costs, termination of parental rights, and placement for adoption. The curr_chunk discusses measures related to foster care and adoption, including the average number of placements before adoption, deaths of children in foster care, and cases of abuse or neglect. The Secretary will use the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System for outcome measures and develop a rating system based on state performance. The Secretary will use state-provided adoption, foster care, and guardianship information to issue annual report cards rating state performance on outcome measures. The report cards will analyze high and low performances, provide recommendations for improvement, and be submitted to Congress. Amendments to the Social Security Act will align with these measures. The Social Security Act is amended to require states to annually provide adoption, foster care, and guardianship information to the Secretary. This information will be used to rate state performance and issue report cards with recommendations for improvement to Congress. Additionally, the Act now includes a provision for states to provide required information under section 479A."
