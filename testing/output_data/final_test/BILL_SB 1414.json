    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25402.12 of the Public Resources Code mandates the commission to approve a plan by January 1, 2019, promoting compliance with regulations for central air-conditioning and heat pump installations. The plan must consider technological and economic factors, as well as the impact on property owners, HVAC industry, local governments, and building officials. The commission may adopt regulations to increase compliance with permitting and inspection requirements for central air-conditioning and heat pumps, and associated sales and installations, consistent with the plan approved pursuant to subdivision (a). Section 399.4 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to ensure prudent investments in energy efficiency programs for cost-effective energy savings and peak load reduction. The commission shall supervise the administration of these programs authorized by statutory authority. If a customer or contractor receives a rebate or incentive from a public utility for energy efficiency improvements, they must certify compliance with permitting requirements and California Building Standards Code. The public utility is required to verify the contractor's appropriate license for the work performed. The public utility provides rebates or incentives for central air-conditioning or heat pump installations only if proof of permit closure is provided by the customer or contractor. The utility is not responsible for verifying the documentation. This does not give the utility authority for enforcing building energy and water efficiency standards or appliance efficiency standards. The commission has the authority to impose additional requirements on rebate recipients. They must consider local interests, multifamily dwellings, and energy service capabilities in program design. The commission will review and update policies for energy efficiency programs to meet established targets. Authorize market transformation programs with appropriate funding for deeper energy efficiency savings, pay for performance programs linking incentives to measured savings, programs for deeper savings through operational activities, and ensuring customers have certainty in incentive values and methodology based on measured results."
