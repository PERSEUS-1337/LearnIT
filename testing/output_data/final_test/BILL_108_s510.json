    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Truck Highway Safety Demonstration Program Act of 2003\". Congress finds that public safety on US highways is a top concern, especially regarding heavy commercial trucks. Federal law limits vehicle weight on Interstate highways to 80,000 pounds, leading to trucks diverting onto smaller roads in Maine, causing economic hardships and safety challenges. Permitting heavy commercial vehicles on Interstate highways in Maine would enhance public safety by reducing the number of heavy vehicles on town and city streets, decreasing dangerous interactions with other vehicles. It would also lower highway maintenance costs as Interstates are built to accommodate heavy traffic. The secondary roads in Maine are more durable as they are built to accommodate heavy vehicles. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"covered Interstate System highway\" as a highway in Maine designated on the Interstate System, excluding certain exempt portions. \"Interstate System\" is defined as per title 23, United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a program in Maine to demonstrate the safety effects of allowing certain vehicles on Interstate highways. This program is part of a waiver related to vehicle weight on Interstate highways. The State of Maine is allowed to permit vehicles over 80,000 pounds on Interstate highways without funding reduction. The vehicles must meet specific criteria and not exceed state weight limitations. The State of Maine can allow vehicles over 80,000 pounds on Interstate highways without funding reduction if they meet specific criteria and state weight limitations. The prohibition will take effect once the Secretary of Transportation notifies the Commissioner of Transportation in writing after certain administrative conditions are met. The prohibition on vehicles over 80,000 pounds on Interstate highways in Maine will remain in effect unless terminated by the Secretary of Transportation within three years if safety concerns arise. The Secretary of Transportation may terminate the prohibition on vehicles over 80,000 pounds on Interstate highways in Maine if the Commissioner of Transportation fails to use the highway safety committee or collect data. The Secretary must consult with the highway safety committee before making a determination. SEC. 6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STATE OF MAINE. For section 5 compliance, the State of Maine must submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation and establish a highway safety committee chaired by the Commissioner of Transportation. The committee includes representatives from state agencies, municipalities, and organizations focused on highway safety evaluation and promotion. The State of Maine must submit a plan to the Secretary of Transportation and establish a highway safety committee to collect data on the safety effects of commercial trucking on Interstate highways in Maine."
