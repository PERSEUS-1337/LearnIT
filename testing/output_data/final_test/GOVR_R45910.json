    "content": "Contemporary antitrust doctrine aims to promote economic competition by encouraging businesses to cut costs, improve productivity, and innovate. In a perfectly competitive market, businesses must price their products at marginal cost to avoid losing customers to competitors. However, real-world markets often deviate from this ideal, leading to firms with market power who can raise prices above competitive levels. Monopolies can form when a single firm holds significant and lasting market power. Antitrust laws are justified to prevent such anti-competitive behavior. Contemporary antitrust doctrine aims to prevent firms from exercising significant market power, which harms consumers by raising prices and reducing output. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 prohibits monopolization and anticompetitive behavior. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 aims to prevent firms from monopolizing trade or commerce. The Supreme Court has clarified that monopolization requires possessing monopoly power and engaging in exclusionary conduct. To succeed in a Section 2 case, plaintiffs must demonstrate the defendant's monopoly power. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 aims to prevent firms from monopolizing trade or commerce by possessing monopoly power and engaging in exclusionary conduct. Monopoly power is described as the ability to control prices or exclude competition, requiring more than just market power. Plaintiffs in a Section 2 case can establish a defendant's monopoly power through direct evidence of charging prices significantly above competitive levels or indirect evidence of a large market share and entry barriers. In antitrust litigation, plaintiffs must prove that the defendant has a dominant market share and is protected by entry barriers. Market definition is crucial, with parties often disputing the scope of the market in which the defendant operates. The size of the market is a key factor in determining market share, leading to vigorous contests over market definition in antitrust cases. The Supreme Court uses the SSNIP test to determine market definition by assessing product substitutability based on demand substitution. Various factors such as industry recognition, product characteristics, prices, and specialized vendors are considered in this analysis. The DOJ and FTC provide market-definition guidance in their Horizontal Merger Guidelines, endorsing the \"hypothetical monopolist\" test. This test focuses on demand substitution and determines relevant antitrust markets based on the profitability of raising prices despite buyer incentives to substitute other goods. The test assesses whether a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose a \"small but significant and non-transitory increase in price\" (SSNIP), typically a 5% increase. The SSNIP test is used to define antitrust markets by assessing if a hypothetical monopolist could profitably raise prices by 5%. For example, Ford passenger cars may not qualify as a distinct market because of potential buyer substitution, while passenger cars as a whole likely do. This test is particularly relevant in technology markets with zero-price offerings. The SSNIP test is challenging to apply in zero-price technology markets because a 5% increase from zero remains zero, making the test inoperable. Some courts have exempted zero-price markets from antitrust scrutiny, as seen in Kinderstart.com, LLC v. Google, Inc. Some commentators argue that antitrust law should apply to zero-price markets, as consumers may \"pay\" for free services with attention and personal data. They suggest that certain free products may have negative equilibrium prices under competitive conditions. Some argue that firms in zero-price markets should pay consumers for their attention and data under competitive conditions. Antitrust law can promote consumer welfare by ensuring nonprice competition in these markets, as firms compete on dimensions other than price. Regulators at the DOJ also believe that antitrust law applies to zero-price markets. Some argue that in zero-price markets, regulators should consider quality-adjusted prices using the SSNDQ test to determine monopoly power. This approach suggests that decreases in quality of \"free\" services can be equivalent to price increases. Alternatively, qualitative assessments of zero-price markets can also be used to evaluate market scope. In zero-price markets, regulators can assess market scope by qualitatively comparing digital products and services to determine interchangeability. This characteristics-based approach, supported in U.S. antitrust doctrine, considers a product's unique features and functions to define relevant markets. While some view this qualitative method as outdated compared to modern econometric evidence, it remains valid under Brown Shoe's practical indicia approach. Regulators can assess market scope in zero-price markets by comparing digital products qualitatively to determine interchangeability. This approach, supported in U.S. antitrust doctrine, considers unique features and functions to define relevant markets. Courts and regulators may rely on qualitative evidence like corporate conduct and expert testimony to determine market scope. In antitrust cases, determining market scope in zero-price digital markets can be done qualitatively. To establish monopoly power, a plaintiff must show a defendant's dominant market share, with no fixed percentage indicating monopoly power. Court decisions suggest a 90% market share can establish monopoly power, while shares below 75% are not conclusive. The Second Circuit's ruling in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America provides guidance on market share thresholds. The Tenth Circuit requires a market share between 70% and 80% to establish monopoly power, while the Third Circuit considers a share between 75% and 80% as sufficient. Courts emphasize the need for significant entry barriers for a defendant to possess durable monopoly power in antitrust cases. Entry barriers, such as legal requirements, control of essential resources, buyer preferences, capital costs, and economies of scale, can shield Big Tech companies. The significance of these barriers depends on specific evidence uncovered by the DOJ and FTC. Network effects, where a digital platform's value increases with more users, are identified as potential barriers in certain digital markets. Some digital platforms exhibit network effects where their value increases with more users, either directly or indirectly. This can create entry barriers for small firms competing with larger incumbents in certain markets. Additionally, the significant volume of user data generated by certain platforms provides advantages to established companies. Access to large amounts of user data from digital platforms benefits established companies by improving product quality and attracting more customers. Some argue that this \"big data\" feedback loop reinforces the dominance of large firms. Lock-in effects in certain digital markets make it difficult for consumers to switch platforms, giving an advantage to established companies. Some causes of platform lock-in include the fear of losing personal data, contractual ties between products, and consumer behavioral biases. These factors give incumbent firms a first-mover advantage and deter potential competitors. Google has refuted claims of having significant entry barriers in digital markets. The claim that Google is insulated from rivals due to low switching costs is challenged, as history shows upstart rivals can supplant dominant companies. To prove monopoly power under Section 2, plaintiffs must show exclusionary conduct. While no general standard exists, courts require harm to the competitive process, not just competitors. Courts evaluate specific behaviors under Section 2 for monopolistic practices, such as predatory pricing. The Supreme Court limits charging low prices as exclusionary conduct, requiring proof of pricing below cost and a \"dangerous probability\" of recouping losses. The Brooke Group test provides a safe harbor for above-cost pricing. Some commentators suggest affirmative defenses to predatory pricing allegations, even if Brooke Group requirements are met. Firms may defend by arguing certain below-cost pricing practices are procompetitive. For instance, in a DOJ lawsuit on e-books, Amazon avoided predatory pricing charges by pricing certain e-books below cost for procompetitive reasons. Some firms charge below-cost prices for e-books as \"loss leaders\" to promote other goods or services. This practice is different from predatory pricing, where prices are below cost to eliminate competitors. The application of predatory pricing doctrine in Big Tech markets is discussed further in the context of Amazon. The Supreme Court allows companies to choose their business partners but has also addressed refusals to deal. The Supreme Court allows companies to choose their business partners, but in certain circumstances, monopolists are required to do business with their rivals. In Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Co., a dominant ski operator was found liable under Section 2 for refusing to do business with a competitor, which included terminating a joint venture and refusing to sell daily ski tickets to prevent competition. The Court found the dominant ski operator liable under Section 2 for eliminating its rival from the market by refusing to do business with them, despite lacking a plausible justification. However, the Court has since interpreted Aspen Skiing narrowly, as seen in Verizon Communications, Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, where it rejected the argument that a monopolist must provide adequate interconnection services to its downstream rivals. The Court in Trinko distinguished the Aspen Skiing case, stating that the telephone monopolist did not cease dealing with competitors or refuse to sell a product to the public, therefore not requiring them to do business with rivals under Section 2. Lower courts have recognized cases where monopolists have a duty to deal with rivals under the concept of Essential Facilities. The essential-facilities doctrine recognizes cases where monopolists have a duty to deal with rivals, as seen in United States v. Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis and Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States. This doctrine stems from the Supreme Court's decisions where monopolists were found to violate Section 2 by denying access to necessary facilities or refusing to transmit power to competitors. The essential-facilities doctrine requires a plaintiff to show that a monopolist controls access to a necessary facility, competitors cannot easily duplicate it, access has been denied to a competitor, and sharing access is feasible. Courts have ruled that a facility doesn't have to be indispensable but must be economically infeasible to duplicate. Mere inconvenience is not enough for a claim, and reasonable alternatives may lead to rejection of Section 2 claims. Section 2 discusses the criteria for essential-facilities claims, including the assessment of reasonable alternatives, refusal to deal, and feasibility of sharing facilities in the context of normal business operations. The application of these doctrines to Big Tech companies is also explored in detail. The application of essential-facilities doctrines to Big Tech companies, including tying arrangements that can violate Section 2, is discussed in detail. Tying products together in various ways, such as bundled ties, contractual ties, and technological ties, can harm competition according to the Supreme Court. Tying arrangements can harm competition by allowing a firm with monopoly power in the market for the tying product to extend its dominance into the market for the tied product. Plaintiffs can establish per se illegal tying if they can demonstrate the existence of two separate products, conditioning the sale of one on the purchase of the other, affecting a substantial volume of interstate commerce, and the defendant having market power in the tying product market. Plaintiffs can prevail on tying claims even without certain showings, evaluated under the Rule of Reason. The burden-shifting framework requires the plaintiff to prove harm to competition, with the defendant needing to show procompetitive benefits. If successful, the factfinder weighs these benefits against anticompetitive harms. Lower courts have specific case law on technological ties. The case law on exclusionary product design, also known as technological ties, has developed a separate body of law. Courts are generally skeptical of these claims due to concerns about chilling innovation. For example, in California Computer Products v. IBM Corp., the Ninth Circuit rejected claims that a dominant computer manufacturer violated Section 2. The Ninth Circuit rejected claims that a dominant computer manufacturer violated Section 2 by introducing a new line of computers integrated with certain peripherals, citing cost reduction and improved performance. The Second Circuit in Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co. held that a dominant camera manufacturer did not violate Section 2 by launching incompatible products, emphasizing lack of exclusionary conduct despite evidence of superiority. The court deferred to market forces regarding a new superior camera. In United States v. Microsoft Corp., the court evaluated Microsoft's integration of Internet Explorer with Windows OS, alleging exclusionary practices. The D.C. Circuit evaluated Microsoft's integration of Internet Explorer with Windows OS, alleging exclusionary practices that harmed competition in the market for internet browsers. The court concluded that Microsoft successfully rebutted the government's case for overriding default browser choices but failed to establish procompetitive justifications for its actions. The court found Microsoft's integration of Internet Explorer with Windows violated Section 2 as it lacked procompetitive benefits. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit in Allied Orthopedic Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Health Care Group LP rejected exclusionary-design claims, stating that design improvements are tolerated by antitrust laws regardless of anticompetitive effects. Lower federal courts are divided on the proper analytical approach. The lower federal courts are split on the approach to exclusionary-design claims, particularly in relation to Big Tech companies. Monopolists can violate Section 2 through exclusive-dealing agreements that harm competition by limiting sources of supply or distribution. Exclusive-dealing agreements can have procompetitive benefits, such as overcoming free-rider problems and guaranteeing a secure source of supply or distribution. Lower federal courts evaluate these agreements under the Rule of Reason, weighing their anticompetitive harms against their benefits. Plaintiffs must show substantial foreclosure of supply or distribution to challenge exclusivity provisions. Exclusive-dealing agreements are evaluated under the Rule of Reason, with courts looking at factors like substantial foreclosure, duration of exclusivity provisions, procompetitive justifications, coercive behavior, and use by competitors. The degree of foreclosure considered unlawful varies among courts, with less than 30% likely not harming competition. The application of exclusive-dealing doctrine in Big Tech markets is discussed in more detail in \"Android: Tying and Exclusive Dealing\". Section 2 of the Sherman Act addresses unilateral exclusionary conduct, while Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act prohibits mergers that may reduce competition. The DOJ and FTC evaluate market share and concentration levels in horizontal mergers, and competition concerns arise in vertical mergers when a powerful firm enters an adjacent market. Vertical mergers can lead to market foreclosure and raise entry barriers by requiring competitors to enter both markets. Despite potential concerns, antitrust agencies are less aggressive in policing vertical mergers due to the belief that they can result in efficiencies and rarely threaten competition. The DOJ and FTC review large proposed mergers under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, with the authority to unwind consummated mergers. Parties must report mergers to antitrust agencies under the HSR Act, and if a merger threatens competition, agencies can block it or negotiate conditions. Lawsuits to unwind consummated mergers are rare. The DOJ and FTC rarely unwind consummated mergers under the HSR Act. Antitrust scrutiny on Big Tech companies like Google is fact-intensive and dependent on specific evidence uncovered during investigations. The agencies have not publicly disclosed the conduct categories being evaluated, making it challenging to assess the strength of antitrust cases against these companies. Google has faced antitrust scrutiny for its business practices, including discrimination against rivals, copying content, and restrictions on advertisers. The FTC declined to pursue legal action after Google agreed to make changes, while European authorities have fined the company in three separate investigations. In June 2017, the European Commission fined Google 2.4 billion euros for antitrust violations related to Google Search's preferential treatment of Google Shopping. Subsequent fines of 4.3 billion euros in July 2018 and 1.49 billion euros in March 2019 were imposed for tying arrangements related to Android and restrictive-dealing agreements involving AdSense. The DOJ's inquiry into Google's conduct is expected to address similar issues as the European investigations. Google content has been under scrutiny for search bias allegations, focusing on Google's monopoly power in online search. The FTC investigated complaints that Google unfairly promoted its vertical properties over competitors like MapQuest and Yelp. The FTC investigated complaints that Google unfairly promoted its vertical properties over competitors like MapQuest and Yelp. The FTC ultimately declined to pursue a lawsuit related to these practices after concluding that Google's \"primary goal\" was to quickly answer users' search queries and improve search results. The EC found in June 2017 that Google's preferential treatment of Google Shopping violated EU antitrust law. If the DOJ were to reevaluate Google's alleged search bias, it would need to determine if Google possesses monopoly power in the market for horizontal search. Google was found to have monopoly power in the market for horizontal search, with a 71% market share. Recent estimates suggest Google's share is even higher. Entry barriers like high fixed costs and access to big data protect Google Search. Some argue against Google Search having monopoly power, stating users have reasonable alternatives for obtaining information online. Some skeptics argue that Google's large market share in horizontal search does not equate to monopoly power, citing low switching costs for consumers and the ability of alternative search engines to compete. Establishing Google's monopoly power would require proving anticompetitive abuse of that power, which may be challenging under existing monopolization doctrine. The Court held that a monopolist's refusal to deal with a competitor can violate Section 2 if motivated by a desire to eliminate the competitor from the market. In Trinko, the Court narrowly construed Aspen Skiing, making refusal-to-deal claims against Google difficult. Google's refusal-to-deal case is challenging due to the lack of previous dealings with websites in search results. The termination of these relationships did not involve a sacrifice of short-term profits, as Google's decision to prioritize its own content maximizes short-term profits by increasing user clicks. This action may harm vertical competitors but benefits Google financially. A lawsuit challenging Google's alleged search bias would face difficulties under the essential-facilities doctrine as it is unclear if high placement in search results is essential. Plaintiffs must show more than inconvenience to prevail, and courts have rejected claims when reasonable alternatives exist. Premium placement in Google's search results may benefit vertical rivals, but it is uncertain if it qualifies as essential. Google's vertical rivals may struggle to prove that high placement in Google's search results is essential under the essential-facilities doctrine. It is unlikely that Google can feasibly share this allegedly essential facility, as only one website can receive the highest ranking. The FTC's investigation found that Google's privileging of its own content was motivated by a desire to quickly answer users' search queries, which Google is likely to rely on in any legal challenges. The DOJ may investigate Google's search bias and practices related to its Android operating system, following the lead of European antitrust authorities. The EC found Google dominant in markets for mobile operating systems, app stores, and general internet search. The EC found Google dominant in markets for mobile operating systems, app stores, and general internet search. Google abused its monopoly positions by tying the Google Search app and Google Chrome to the Google Play store, creating a bias against competing search engines and web browsers. Google also made illegal payments to certain device manufacturers for exclusivity. Google illegally obstructed the development of competing Android operating systems by requiring device manufacturers to exclusively pre-install Google Search and Google Play. Google is appealing the EC's decision. The DOJ lawsuit targets Google's tying of Google Search and Google Chrome to Google Play, raising complex legal issues. The D.C. Circuit held in Microsoft that software platforms have unique features making per se liability inappropriate for tying arrangements. Courts have moved away from per se tying liability, suggesting Google's tying arrangements would likely be evaluated under the Rule of Reason. It is unclear if mandatory pre-installation of apps triggers per se liability. The EC's Android enforcement action raised concerns about Google's mandatory pre-installation practices. The EC raised concerns about Google's mandatory pre-installation practices in its Android enforcement action. The D.C. Circuit has suggested that tying arrangements involving software platforms, like Google's Android ties, would likely be evaluated under the Rule of Reason due to limited judicial experience with the effects of mandatory pre-installation. Google's Android ties, like Google Search and Google Chrome to Google Play, may face Rule-of-Reason scrutiny similar to past cases. Courts will assess the anticompetitive harms versus procompetitive benefits, focusing on concerns about pre-installed apps limiting user choice. The DOJ's investigation into Google's tying arrangements will depend on evidence of harm to competition. Google's procompetitive justifications for pre-installation practices will be crucial in a potential Section 2 case. The EC rejected Google's argument that tying arrangements benefitted consumers, stating that Google can monetize Android in other ways. Google's decision to charge licensing fees for Google Play and certain apps instead of offering them for free follows the EC's ruling. Google will charge manufacturers licensing fees for Google Play and certain apps to make up for lost revenue from tying arrangements. Some argue this may lead to higher device prices for consumers. The legal debate continues on whether promoting competition in online search will harm consumers in the mobile device market. Antitrust commentators debate tradeoffs in tying cases and balancing harms in different markets. It is uncertain if courts would consider harm from Google's tying arrangements against benefits in mobile devices. Antitrust regulators may weigh cross-market tradeoffs in deciding to bring a case. Exclusive dealing challenges with device manufacturers depend on DOJ findings. Court assessment of Google's payments for exclusivity agreements would likely occur. A court assessing Google's pre-installation agreements would consider consumer behavior impact, market share foreclosed, competition ability, and procompetitive justifications. Similarly, evaluating Google's restriction on selling Android forks would involve balancing anticompetitive harms against procompetitive benefits, such as hindering the development of alternative distribution channels for search engines and apps. The EC rejected Google's argument that restricting the sale of Android forks is necessary to prevent fragmentation of the Android ecosystem. U.S. antitrust regulators could argue that Google could brand Android to distinguish it from forks. The DOJ may be investigating Google's agreements with websites using AdSense for ad revenue. During the FTC's 2011-2013 investigation, clauses in Google's agreements with publisher websites prohibiting business with competing ad-brokering platforms were found to violate Section 2. The EC also concluded in March 2019 that similar clauses violated EU antitrust law. The EC identified exclusivity clauses from 2006-2009 and Premium Placement clauses after 2009 in Google's agreements with publisher websites. The EC found that Google used its dominant position in online search advertising intermediation to suppress competition by imposing exclusivity and Premium Placement clauses on publisher websites. Google is appealing the EC's decision, and a U.S. antitrust case would involve a similar analysis of these agreements. In antitrust discussions, Google's market dominance is being evaluated based on factors like market share, agreement duration, competition from other ad-brokering platforms, and procompetitive justifications. Amazon's antitrust issues mainly revolve around discrimination against vertical rivals and predatory pricing, particularly concerning its dual role as a marketplace operator and seller of private-label products. Amazon has faced allegations of favoring its own products on the Marketplace, potentially engaging in predatory pricing, and revoking seller privileges when entering relevant markets with private-label products. Amazon has faced allegations of predatory pricing, including selling baby products below cost to eliminate rivals like Diapers.com. The company also allegedly priced e-books below cost to dominate the market, securing 90% by 2009. Amazon faced allegations of predatory pricing, including selling products below cost to eliminate rivals and securing 90% of the market by 2009. A potential monopolization case against Amazon would require regulators to prove monopoly power in specific markets, such as online marketplaces connecting third-party merchants with consumers. If proven, regulators would need to establish that Amazon used its power to harm competition. To prove a monopolization case against Amazon, regulators would need to establish that Amazon used its power to harm competition. This may be challenging under existing refusal-to-deal doctrine, similar to Google's alleged search bias issues. The Supreme Court's reasoning in Trinko suggests that a refusal-to-deal claim against Amazon for vertical discrimination would be unlikely to succeed. Amazon's preferential ranking of its private-label products on its Marketplace maximizes short-term profits, similar to Google's vertical properties. A claim targeting this discrimination is unlikely viable under the essential-facilities doctrine. Refusal-to-deal claims against Amazon for revoking merchants' access to its Marketplace may present a closer question. Amazon's termination of profitable relationships with third-party merchants may raise questions about the application of Section 2 doctrine, potentially leading to essential-facilities claims due to the dominant position of Amazon's Marketplace in certain online-retail markets. Lack of access to Amazon's Marketplace could severely handicap merchants in some online-retail markets. Amazon's potential vulnerability to predatory-pricing claims, particularly in relation to its acquisition of Quidsi, raises questions about the application of Section 2 doctrine. While some allegations suggest below-cost pricing with a \"dangerous probability\" of recouping losses by eliminating competitors, Amazon may defend certain charges by arguing that products were intended as \"loss leaders.\" This defense would require a fact-intensive inquiry into pricing motivations. Antitrust commentary on Facebook has mainly focused on its acquisitions. The antitrust commentary on Facebook has mainly focused on its acquisitions of potential competitors, particularly Instagram and WhatsApp. Legislators and commentators have urged regulators to examine whether these acquisitions violated antitrust laws. The FTC is investigating Facebook's acquisition practices, with a focus on the Instagram and WhatsApp deals. The FTC is also looking into Facebook's 2013 acquisition of Onavo Mobile Ltd., which may have helped Facebook identify and acquire potential competitors before they became threats. This could potentially lead to a monopolization case against Facebook based on its acquisition strategy. Regulators may face challenges in defining the relevant market, especially since Facebook's social network is free for users. In an action to unwind Facebook's key acquisitions in the social media market, the strength of the case would depend on the relevant market definition and methodology for calculating market shares. Regulators may try to prove harm to competition directly, bypassing the need for detailed market share analysis. Antitrust plaintiffs can establish monopoly power with direct evidence of supra-competitive prices, rather than solely relying on indirect market-share evidence. Facebook's potential monopoly power could be proven through evidence of quality degradation after the disappearance of competitors. The FTC could establish anticompetitive effects of Facebook's acquisitions, weighing them against any efficiencies claimed by Facebook. The FTC may challenge Facebook's defense by arguing that post-acquisition investments have improved performance. Apple, like Google, has faced antitrust claims related to its mobile-device software, specifically regarding the design of iOS. Class-action lawsuits allege that Apple has monopolized the market for iPhone apps by creating a closed system with security measures preventing purchases outside of the App Store. In May 2019, the Supreme Court allowed customers and developers to challenge Apple's conduct. The DOJ may be considering a similar action against Apple's iOS design, following lawsuits challenging the App Store's exclusivity. The outcome will depend on the findings during litigation, with potential anticompetitive harm. Apple's design limits competition to one seller, raising Section 2 claims that hinge on procompetitive justifications and evaluation standards. If a court were to follow the D.C. Circuit's approach, it would balance the anticompetitive harms of Apple's design choices against their procompetitive benefits. Courts following more deferential standards may side with Apple if plausible reasons for design choices improving products are identified. The current circuit split on exclusionary-design claims' analytical framework may impact the outcome. The DOJ may bring a lawsuit challenging Apple's design of iOS, potentially leading to a circuit split on exclusionary-design analysis. This could prompt the Supreme Court to clarify the doctrine. Congress is also considering legislation to address anticompetitive conduct by large technology companies. Some commentators propose changes to antitrust doctrine to promote digital competition, including addressing pricing practices of dominant technology firms like Amazon. Critics argue that current predatory-pricing doctrine, such as Brooke Group's \"recoupment\" requirement, is inadequate. Critics argue that Brooke Group's \"recoupment\" requirement does not effectively deter predatory pricing by dominant online platforms. They suggest that the requirement fails to consider the unique ability of these platforms to sustain below-cost pricing for extended periods and use hard-to-detect recoupment tactics like price discrimination. Some propose a presumption that below-cost pricing by dominant platforms constitutes prohibited exclusionary conduct. Additionally, critics challenge the requirement for predatory-pricing plaintiffs to prove that a monopolist charged below-cost prices, stating that anticompetitive behavior can occur even when prices are above cost. Critics argue that courts should reevaluate predatory pricing strategies that exclude potential entrants without a price-cost test. Some suggest eliminating the first Brooke Group requirement to address this issue. There are calls for enhanced merger review for dominant technology companies, with a presumption that mergers between monopolist technology companies and potential competitors are unlawful. Additionally, some propose stricter scrutiny for mergers and acquisitions involving dominant technology companies. Some academics propose lowering or eliminating size thresholds for technology startups in merger reviews. Critics suggest courts should be less deferential towards exclusionary product designs of tech companies. Legislation could clarify standards for evaluating such claims. Some academics argue that certain digital markets favor large incumbent firms by creating barriers to entry. Courts are hesitant to hold companies liable for anti-competitive practices, such as limiting consumer choice or favoring their own products. Analysts suggest sector-specific regulations, like data mobility and interoperability rules, to address competition concerns in the technology industry. Some suggest implementing interoperability standards and nondiscrimination requirements to address competition concerns in the technology industry. Lawmakers and academics propose separation regimes to prevent monopolists from entering adjacent markets, drawing parallels to historical structural prohibitions in other industries. Some commentators advocate separation regimes for certain industries like railroads, banks, and technology companies to prevent conflicts of interest and discrimination against rivals. Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed prohibiting dominant technology companies from owning companies on their platforms, with support from the House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman. Many lawmakers are concerned about Facebook's plan to develop a new cryptocurrency, leading to a proposal to prevent large technology platforms from entering the financial industry. The draft legislation titled the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act would prohibit these platforms from affiliating with financial institutions or operating digital assets for widespread use as a medium of exchange."
