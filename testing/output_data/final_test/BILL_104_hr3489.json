    "content": "The \"Ballistic Missile Defense Act of 1996\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings related to ballistic missile defense. The \"Ballistic Missile Defense Act of 1996\" states that the deployment of theater missile defenses is a top priority to protect US Armed Forces from short-range ballistic missiles. The Act also emphasizes the development of ground-based defensive systems to defend against limited ballistic missile attacks on US territory. The national territory requires missile defenses, arms control agreements, and nonproliferation measures to lower the threat of ballistic missile technology. The United States' massive retaliatory capability deterred the Soviet Union and other nations from launching intercontinental ballistic missile attacks during the Cold War. The Nuclear Posture Review affirms the effectiveness of deterrence now and in the future, with the risk of intentional attacks receding but the possibility of accidental or unauthorized attacks by Russia or China remaining remote. United States arms control agreements, such as the START I and START II Treaties, play a crucial role in curbing the spread of ballistic missile technology. The START I and START II Treaties aim to reduce the threat of large-scale nuclear attacks on the United States by lowering deployed warheads. START I will decrease warheads by over 40% below 1990 levels, with only Russia deploying nuclear weapons by the end of 1996. START II, if implemented, will further reduce Russian warheads by 66%. As offensive weapons decrease, defensive systems become more effective, potentially shifting deterrence from massive retaliation to effective defenses. Countries hostile to the United States are interested in developing long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching the US, but without external support, these threats may take up to 15 years to fully develop. International treaties and US efforts to enforce export controls aim to prevent or delay the assistance these countries need to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, adding to strategic stability. The ABM Treaty contributes to strategic stability by limiting strategic weapons. Abrogating the treaty for a noncompliant system could hinder START I and START II Treaty implementation, maintaining risks of unauthorized launches and large-scale attacks. Maintaining the US nuclear arsenal at START I levels may result in significant unbudgeted costs. The ABM Treaty contributes to strategic stability by limiting strategic weapons. Abrogating the treaty for a noncompliant system could hinder START I and START II Treaty implementation. Maintaining the US nuclear arsenal at START I levels may result in significant unbudgeted costs for ballistic missile defenses and other defense requirements. Missile defense systems consistent with the ABM Treaty can defend against limited ballistic missile attacks. If a national missile defense system requires modification of the ABM Treaty, the treaty allows for amendment by the parties. The United States aims to develop a National Missile Defense System by 2000 for deployment in 2003, capable of defending against limited ballistic missile attacks. The system will undergo rigorous testing before deployment, with plans for continuous improvements if deployment is delayed. The United States prioritizes maintaining Armed Forces readiness, completing theater missile defense systems, and developing space-based sensors for deployment by 2003. The Secretary of Defense is required to initiate a National Missile Defense Program to deploy a system by the end of 2000, including ground-based interceptors, radars, space-based sensors, and BM/C3. The Secretary of Defense is mandated to implement the National Missile Defense Program by initiating deployment readiness plans, conducting system testing, using streamlined acquisition policies, and developing technologies to enhance the system. Reporting requirements are also specified. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress by March 15, 1997, detailing the plan for the National Missile Defense Program. This report should include the system architecture selected for development, justification for the chosen architecture, estimated appropriations needed for fiscal years 1997 through 2003 to achieve operational capability by 2003. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress detailing the plan for the National Missile Defense Program, including system architecture, promising technologies, and activities conflicting with the ABM Treaty. SEC. 8. POLICY REGARDING REDUCTION OF THE THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES FROM WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. Measures to address threats from weapons of mass destruction include enhancing efforts to prevent terrorist organizations from obtaining such weapons, assisting in improving safety of fissile materials in certain countries, and preventing smuggling of weapons components into the United States. To address threats from weapons of mass destruction, the United States has implemented improved security measures at ports of entry, increased Border Patrol presence, and enhanced monitoring of international borders. Additionally, efforts are being made to promote international adherence to export control measures and enhance conventional weapons systems for deterrence against weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles. The President will urge Russia to ratify the START II Treaty, pursue deactivation of strategic forces, and collaborate on improving command and control technology for intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Secretary of Defense will enhance a program to complement these efforts. The Secretary of Defense will enhance a program to improve US capabilities against chemical or biological weapons attacks within the country. This includes research, development, and testing of technologies for detection, interception, protection, response, and decontamination. The establishment of an interagency task force to assess and make recommendations on US capabilities against chemical or biological weapons attacks within the country, including training personnel, decontamination of affected areas, and identifying equipment for transfer between agencies. The interagency task force will assess and recommend improvements for US capabilities against chemical or biological weapons attacks within the country, including detection, interception, protection, preparedness, response, decontamination, and public education. Membership will include representatives from various departments and agencies. The interagency task force will consult with various departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Justice, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Health and Human Services. Additionally, the task force will seek input from State and local government law enforcement and emergency planning authorities. The interagency task force will consult with various departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Justice, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Health and Human Services. State and local government emergency planning authorities will also be involved. Administrative support for the task force will be provided by the Secretary of Defense. The President will submit an annual report to Congress on actions taken to comply with the provisions of this section. SEC. 9. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY. The President is required to carry out the policies of the ABM Treaty, seek amendments if necessary for the National Missile Defense system, and treat any negotiated amendment as a treaty. The United States is not bound by modifications restricting TMD systems. The ABM Treaty does not bind the US to any amendment restricting theater ballistic missile defense systems unless certain conditions are met. The ABM Treaty, as defined in this Act, refers to the Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems signed in 1972, including Protocols and amendments."
