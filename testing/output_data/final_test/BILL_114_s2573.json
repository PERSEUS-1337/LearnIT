    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE. The \"Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2016\" acknowledges the dangers of lead poisoning, especially for children, and highlights the prevalence of lead paint hazards in housing units. Federal funding for lead abatement programs is limited, with only 18,600 homes receiving assistance in fiscal year 2015. The purpose of the section is to promote the safe removal of lead hazards from homes to reduce childhood lead poisoning and its negative health effects. Abatement or interim control measures can significantly decrease lead poisoning cases in children. The Home Lead Hazard Reduction Act Tax Credit is a new section added to the Internal Revenue Code to promote safe removal of lead hazards from homes and reduce childhood lead poisoning cases. The Home Lead Hazard Reduction Act Tax Credit allows a 50 percent credit against the tax for lead hazard reduction costs incurred by the taxpayer for eligible dwelling units. Taxpayers can also elect to apply costs to the previous taxable year. There are limitations on the amount of credit allowed for each eligible dwelling unit. The Home Lead Hazard Reduction Act Tax Credit allows a 50 percent credit for lead hazard reduction costs incurred by the taxpayer for eligible dwelling units. The credit is limited to $3,000 for lead abatement measures and $1,000 for interim lead control measures. Additionally, other tax credits may be available at the state or local level for qualifying costs. The State or local tax credit amount limits the credit allowed for lead hazard reduction activity costs for eligible dwelling units to the difference between the cost paid by the taxpayer and the tax credit amount. The cumulative credit for a dwelling unit over all taxable years cannot exceed $4,000. The term 'lead hazard reduction activity cost' refers to the expenses associated with assessing and addressing lead-based hazards in eligible dwelling units. This includes the cost of a certified risk assessor conducting an assessment and a certified lead abatement supervisor performing abatement measures. The lead hazard reduction activity cost covers expenses for addressing lead-based hazards in eligible dwelling units, such as removal, encapsulation, replacement of surfaces, windows, and soil, interim lead control measures, specialized cleaning, repairs, maintenance, and ongoing monitoring. The cost for certified lead abatement activities includes expenses for preparation, cleanup, disposal, and testing conducted by qualified contractors under the supervision of a certified lead abatement supervisor. The curr_chunk discusses interim lead control measures, costs incurred for relocation, and limitations on lead hazard reduction activity costs. It defines eligible dwelling units for any taxable year. The curr_chunk defines a 'dwelling unit' as a unit placed in service before 1978, located in the United States, and with residents having a cumulative adjusted gross income of less than $110,000. It also explains a 'qualified contractor' as one who has completed a training course on lead safe work practices approved by relevant authorities. No credit allowed for eligible dwelling units unless certified inspector or risk assessor provides documentation that unit meets lead hazard reduction criteria. The eligible dwelling unit must meet lead hazard evaluation criteria established by a State or local program, and documentation is required to show that the lead hazard reduction activity meets the requirements. The basis of the property for which the credit is allowed will be reduced by the amount of the credit. Any deduction for costs related to the credit for lead-based abatement will be reduced by the amount of the credit attributable to those costs. Inflation adjustments will apply for taxable years after 2016. Beginning in a calendar year after 2016, dollar amounts in certain subsections will be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment. Conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are also made. The amendments made by this section apply to lead hazard reduction activity costs incurred after December 31, 2015, in taxable years ending after that date."
