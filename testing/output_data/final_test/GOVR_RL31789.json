Duties on knit apparel were 18.6%, woven apparel 16.3%, miscellaneous food items 7.3%, and plastics 5.4%. The elimination of U.S. import duties under the FTA would primarily affect duties on imports of apparel, miscellaneous food items, and plastics. The United States already has free trade agreements with several countries and is negotiating more FTAs. The United States has low trade barriers except for certain protected sectors like light trucks and textiles. In 2002, the US collected $87.5 million in duties on imports from Singapore, with an average duty of 0.6%.

The Advisory Committee on Textiles and Apparel supports the elimination of duties and quotas, as they are set to be removed under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. The free trade agreement between the United States and Singapore includes phased-out tariffs for exports over five years and liberal rules of origin for textiles. The agreement contains rules of origin to ensure only U.S. and Singaporean goods benefit from it, especially important due to Singapore's role as a major transshipment port. Antidumping duties imposed through unfair trade practices are not covered by the FTA. The Industry Sector Advisor Committee on Textiles and apparel in the FTA review focused on rules of origin and their potential impact on other trade agreements. Members supported a yarn forward rule to benefit agreement signatories only, similar to the North America Free Trade Agreement, to create parity among U.S. trading partners. Concerns were raised about potential issues with the rule. The Industry Sector Advisor Committee on Textiles and apparel in the FTA review supported a yarn forward rule similar to NAFTA to create parity among U.S. trading partners. Concerns were raised about high tariffs levels that could undermine origin rules in the early years of the agreement. Apparel members expressed disappointment with the FTA, arguing that the restrictive NAFTA rule of origin would be worsened by additional complications and burdens, discouraging apparel trade among beneficiary countries. They urged that the rule of origin in this FTA not set a precedent for other agreements. The FTA allows imported inputs to be classified differently from the final product, with specific value-added percentages determining origin for electronic products. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore allows products to claim tariff preferences if a certain percentage of value added is done in Singapore. Customs authorities provide rulings on origin, and an Integrated Sourcing Initiative applies to certain products, including medical devices. The FTA list comprises 155 line items. The FTA with Singapore allows products to claim tariff preferences if a certain percentage of value added is done in Singapore. The initiative includes 155 line items such as data processing machines, video cameras, and medical devices. Products from Batam or Bintan islands in Indonesia can be considered of Singapore origin if they meet the rules of origin requirement. This initiative aims to help American companies by eliminating extra paperwork and fees. The FTA with Singapore aims to eliminate extra paperwork and fees for American companies by allowing products from Batam or Bintan islands in Indonesia to claim tariff preferences if they meet the rules of origin requirement. Critics raised concerns about the potential application of the provision to other nations, including China, leading to the deletion of certain language before the final agreement was signed. The final text of the FTA with Singapore states that a good listed in Annex 3B is considered originating when imported into the territory from another Party. The U.S. Trade Representative interprets this as requiring a qualifying product to be shipped from the United States to Singapore, incorporated into a product subject to regional content requirements, and then shipped back. Labor interests have objected to this initiative due to concerns about labor, environmental, and other provisions not applying to factories outside of Singapore, and Indonesia not providing reciprocal access to U.S. companies. There are also concerns that the initiative may attract more U.S. investment to Indonesia. The FTA with Singapore includes a sourcing initiative to attract U.S. investment to Indonesia. The agreement requires meetings to explore expanding product coverage. The U.S. will waive fees for Singaporean exports and vessel repairs. Negotiations focused on access to services markets, with substantial market access granted. The FTA with Singapore includes a negative list approach for the services sector, with exceptions for certain sectors. Each country must treat the other's services suppliers equally. The agreement also includes a mechanism to lock in future liberalization of exempted measures.

U.S. investors are granted the same treatment as local Singaporean investors, with due process protections and fair market value rights in case of expropriation. The Singapore-US FTA grants U.S. investors fair market value rights in case of expropriation, prohibits certain performance-related restrictions, and ties investor protections to customary international law standards. The agreement incorporates the U.S. Supreme Court's test for indirect expropriation. The Singapore-US FTA obligates both countries to provide investors with treatment according to \"customary international law\" rather than \"international law\" as in NAFTA. The FTA explicitly rejects interpretations that include obligations from other international agreements. It clarifies that breaches of other provisions or international accords do not violate the minimum standard of treatment. The FTA also specifies that investors must be accorded the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, and that obligations for \"fair and equitable\" treatment do not create additional substantive obligations. The Singapore-US FTA clarifies that breaches of other provisions or international accords do not violate the minimum standard of treatment. It includes an investor-to-state mechanism for dispute resolution through international arbitration, ensuring impartiality and transparency. Singaporean investors can take disputes to a tribunal for resolution. The Singapore-US FTA allows the federal government to resolve disputes through international arbitration for Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), including copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets.

Pharmaceutical industry representatives have welcomed the agreement's patent provisions. Singapore commits to enact laws regulating anti-competitive business conduct and create a competition commission by January 2005. Government procurement under the FTA allows market access by service suppliers of both countries unless specifically reserved. The U.S.-Singapore FTA includes provisions for government procurement, with lowered monetary thresholds and transparent procurement procedures. Singapore also commits to strong disciplines on procurement procedures and timely bid review processes. The U.S.-Singapore FTA includes specific obligations on customs procedures, requiring transparency, efficiency, and sharing of information to combat illegal trans-shipment of goods. It also facilitates clearance of express delivery shipments. The agreement creates separate categories for temporary business personnel and workers from each country to engage in business activities on a temporary basis. The U.S.-Singapore FTA allows for temporary entry of business visitors, treaty traders, intracompany transfers, and professional workers without requiring labor certification or numerical limits, except for professional workers with a cap of 5,400 per fiscal year. The agreement aims to facilitate entry for individuals who comply with immigration measures. The U.S.-Singapore FTA allows for temporary entry of business visitors, treaty traders, intracompany transfers, and professional workers without labor certification or numerical limits. Title IV of S. 1417 / H.R. 2739 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act to create the H-1B-1 visa for professional workers entering through the FTA, with similar educational requirements to the H-1B visa but requiring only specialized knowledge. The bills amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to create the H-1B-1 visa for professional workers under the U.S.-Singapore FTA, with specialized knowledge requirements. It includes labor attestation for employers and sets a limit of 5,400 new entries per fiscal year from Singapore. Unlike H-1B workers, FTA professional workers have no annual renewal limit but are counted against the H-1B cap upon entry and renewal. The House Judiciary Committee held a \"mock\" mark-up of the USTR's draft language on July 10, 2003. Chairman Sensenbrenner stated that \"immigration policy does not belong in free trade agreements,\" with members agreeing and some calling the draft language an \"insult to Congress.\" The Committee recommended including FTA professional workers in the H-1B program. The House Judiciary Committee recommended including FTA professional workers in the H-1B nonimmigrant visa and counting them against the H-1B cap. Title IV of S. 1417 / H.R. 2739 also included citizens of Singapore as E-1 treaty traders and E-2 treaty investors. USTR emphasizes the importance of cross-border mobility for U.S. companies in developing new markets and business opportunities abroad. The USTR has faced criticism for including immigration provisions in FTAs, with concerns that it could limit Congress's ability to revise immigration laws. The issue of FTA professional workers has sparked debate, with the Labor Advisory Committee critical of the provisions. The USTR has faced criticism for including immigration provisions in FTAs, with concerns about the temporary entry of business personnel and professional workers from Singapore. Critics worry about potential loopholes and less stringent standards compared to existing H-1B laws. The USTR argues that the labor attestations required under the FTA would be as rigorous as those under the current H-1B visa program. Fees may also be collected along with the labor attestations. The USTR has faced criticism for including immigration provisions in FTAs, with concerns about temporary entry of business personnel and professional workers from Singapore. Labor attestations, education and training fees, and numerical limits have been added in response to congressional concerns. Questions have been raised about legal authority to enforce immigration law, specifically regarding the ability of an international panel to overrule decisions by officials in rejecting visa applicants from Singapore. The USTR clarifies that the panel would be bi-national and only handle cases brought by a Party with alleged violations. The agreement is said to meet environmental objectives set by Congress for granting Trade Promotion Authority. The trade agreement includes environmental obligations to ensure high levels of protection and prohibits weakening domestic environmental laws for trade. It also enforces labor standards consistent with International Labor Organization obligations. The trade agreement requires parties to uphold labor standards consistent with international principles and prohibits weakening domestic labor protections for trade purposes. Parties must effectively enforce their own labor laws, with enforcement mechanisms in place through dispute settlement procedures. The agreement aligns with Congress' objectives for labor and environmental standards in trade negotiations. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aims to strengthen trade between the United States and its partners, promote core labor standards, and protect the environment through sustainable development. Critics, like the AFL-CIO, argue that the FTA may lead to a negative trade balance, job losses, and inadequate economic development. The Agreement establishes a joint committee to oversee its implementation and review the trade relationship between the Parties. The joint committee established by the Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Singapore meets annually to review and enhance trade relations, settle disputes, and consider amendments to the Agreement. Consultations can be requested by either country to address any issues affecting the Agreement's operation, with a commitment to engage in good faith discussions. All core obligations, including labor and environmental provisions, are subject to the Agreement. The agreement between the United States and Singapore includes labor and environmental provisions subject to dispute settlement procedures emphasizing compliance through consultation and trade-enhancing remedies. An enforcement mechanism with monetary penalties enforces commercial, labor, and environmental obligations. The non-implementation phase for disputes involving labor and the environment differs from other cases. The dispute settlement procedures for labor and environmental violations in the agreement between the United States and Singapore allow for the imposition of an annual monetary assessment not exceeding $15 million, adjusted for inflation. Some argue that this amount is too small. Some argue that the $15 million annual monetary assessment in the US-Singapore agreement is too small. The agreement also allows for tariff benefits suspension if the assessment is not paid. In 2002, the US collected $87.5 million in duties from Singapore, which could be reimposed to collect unpaid assessments. The final negotiation in the FTA focused on capital outflow controls and their relation to dispute settlement mechanisms during the Asian financial crisis. During the Asian financial crisis, countries like Thailand and South Korea saw their exchange rates plummet, causing significant losses for portfolio investors. The Thai baht and South Korean won lost 40% of their value, while the Indonesian rupiah dropped nearly 70%. In FTA negotiations, the Singaporean government sought to retain the ability to intervene to prevent such catastrophic losses in the future. The language in the U.S.-Singapore FTA mirrored that of the U.S.-Chile FTA, categorizing capital outflows related to foreign direct investment. During the Asian financial crisis, countries like Thailand and South Korea experienced significant exchange rate drops, causing losses for investors. In FTA negotiations, Singapore aimed to prevent such losses by categorizing capital outflows into two categories: foreign direct investment-related outflows and other capital outflows. The FTA included provisions for a \"cooling off period\" before investors could challenge capital restrictions and seek arbitration. If damages were awarded, they would be calculated starting from the 365th day after the measure was imposed. In a settlement case, damages would be calculated from the 365th day if capital flows were \"substantially impeded.\" A side letter from U.S. Under Secretary of Treasury provided details on what constitutes substantial impediment, including factors like national treatment, price-based measures, and non-confiscatory practices. The letter clarifies that measures impeding transfers should not interfere with investors' ability to earn a market rate of return in Singapore. If transfers are substantially impeded, investors must prove the diminution in asset value. Speculation on exchange rate favorability is not sufficient evidence. The letter clarifies that measures impeding transfers should not interfere with investors' ability to earn a market rate of return in Singapore. If transfers are substantially impeded, investors must prove the diminution in asset value. Speculation on exchange rate favorability is not sufficient evidence. The FTA eliminates import tariffs on products from Singapore, resulting in reduced import duty collections for the federal government. In the Bush Administration's FY2004 budget, estimated revenue losses are mentioned. The U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement resulted in estimated revenue losses for the federal government, totaling $268 million over the period of FY2004-2008. The Agreement allows for termination by either Party with a six-month notice. The fundamental issue was whether the U.S. should pursue bilateral free trade and investment relations with Singapore. The United States should pursue bilateral free trade and investment relations with Singapore instead of maintaining existing trade practices or pursuing more liberalized trade through other means. The effects of liberalized trade on U.S. employment, imports, exports, and access to Singapore's markets in services are key considerations. This decision ties into the broader issue of globalization's impact on the U.S., particularly on labor and wages. Opponents of increased global economic interaction, including with Singapore, cite concerns about competition from imports and threats to certain industries and U.S. production. The Labor Advisory Committee rejected the U.S.-Singapore FTA, citing concerns about repeating the mistakes of NAFTA and potential negative impacts on trade balances, jobs, rights, and economic development. Other trade advisory committees generally endorsed the agreement, with some dissenting opinions and reservations. The Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations strongly endorsed the FTA. The Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations endorsed the FTA, stating it promotes US economic interests. However, the labor representative dissented, citing concerns about labor and environmental objectives. Proponents of FTAs argue they bring increased export opportunities and a more efficient economy, with foreign countries having higher trade barriers than the US. Several large corporations and business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Conference of State Legislatures, support the U.S.-Singapore FTA. They argue that the U.S. may be left behind as other countries form FTAs without including the U.S. The US-Singapore FTA Business Coalition, with membership from various organizations, also strongly supports the FTA. The U.S.-Singapore FTA affords foreign investors greater rights than U.S. investors and property owners regarding state laws, local ordinances, and regulations. The trade with Singapore has a positive impact on the U.S. economy, with analysts quantifying the welfare impact as 0.19% of GNP, or about $18 billion. The U.S. has had trade surpluses with Singapore for the past three years, leading to a generally positive effect on U.S. employment. However, industries like electronic equipment and machinery may face increased import competition under the FTA, while the domestic apparel industry could suffer due to tariff reductions. The U.S.-Singapore FTA includes strict rules of origin to neutralize the impact of tariff reductions on the domestic apparel industry. In 2002, the U.S. imported $233.79 million in knitted or crocheted apparel from Singapore with duties totaling $43.4 million. Additionally, the agreement provides greater access to Singapore's services market for U.S. companies. The U.S.-Singapore FTA offers greater access to Singapore's services market for U.S. companies, including lowering regulatory barriers and providing legal protections. U.S.-based companies can sell services without border barriers or customs fees. Critics argue that bilateral FTAs can distort trade flows by diverting exports and imports towards the countries involved. Some Asian manufacturers have relocated to Mexico for tariff-free access to the North American market. Trade diversion inefficiencies may be offset by gains in trade creation. Factors mitigate significant trade diversion or creation from the U.S.-Singapore FTA due to low trade barriers, long distances, and Singapore's small economy. Singapore has a substantial economy with a GDP of about $88 billion and two-way trade with the U.S. of roughly $30 billion, amounting to only 1.6% of total U.S. trade. The US-Singapore FTA, accounting for only 1.6% of total U.S. trade, is unlikely to significantly impact new exports or imports. While some trade diversion is possible, factors like Singapore's higher costs make it unlikely for many factories to relocate there. Strengthened customs procedures address potential illegal trans-shipments. Bilateral FTAs play a role in trade liberalization. FTAs play a role in trade liberalization by allowing countries to bypass slow multilateral negotiations and create agreements with like-minded nations. This can lead to trade diversion and pressure for other countries to join or create their own FTAs. Bilateral FTAs can be building blocks for global trade liberalization. The FTA provisions on temporary entry of business personnel and professional workers are causing concerns in the field of immigration as they were negotiated without clear authority from Congress. The Labor Advisory Committee criticized these provisions for potentially allowing workers from Singapore to enter the US without proper protections for domestic workers. This issue was addressed in mock markup sessions in the House and Senate Judiciary committees. Some express concerns that FTA provisions may limit Congress in revising immigration laws for business personnel and professionals. USTR argues that allowing entry of professionals aligns with Trade Promotion Authority Act goals to reduce barriers for U.S. services and investments. Cross-border mobility is crucial for U.S. companies. The USTR emphasizes the importance of mobility for professionals and businesspersons for U.S. companies to expand into new markets abroad. Labor attestations required under the FTA are said to be as rigorous as those under current U.S. law, modeled after the LCA for H-1B visas. The Integrated Sourcing Initiative has sparked debate over whether certain IT goods and medical equipment can be considered Singaporean to avoid U.S. customs fees. The Integrated Sourcing Initiative (ISI) aims to help companies avoid U.S. customs fees by shipping products through Singapore. Concerns were raised about other countries like China using this provision. However, language changes in the final text of the FTA seem to address this issue. To take advantage of ISI, a third country would need to ship a qualifying product from the U.S. to Singapore, incorporate it into a product with regional content, and then ship it back to the U.S. The U.S.-Singapore FTA addresses concerns about using it as a template for negotiations with other nations, including those with lower labor and environmental standards. The agreement emphasizes high levels of environmental protection and enforcement of domestic laws, as well as reaffirming obligations to the International Labor Organization. The U.S.-Singapore FTA requires parties to enforce domestic labor and environmental laws, with penalties for non-compliance. It does not mandate specific labor standards but strengthens economic ties with Singapore. Singapore signed access agreements with the U.S. allowing limited use of air and naval facilities. The agreements stemmed from the U.S. withdrawal from the Philippines. The 1990 MOU permits U.S. forces to operate in Singapore, including resupply vessels and access to naval and air facilities. An amendment in 1998 granted access to a deep-draft pier at Changi Naval Base. The USS Kitty Hawk was the first foreign vessel to dock there in 2001. The FTA with the U.S. does not impact defense cooperation but could strengthen economic ties. The anti-terror campaign has seen a shift of radical Islamist activity to Southeast Asia, evident in the 2002 Bali bombings. The October 12, 2002, bombings in Bali and other attacks in Southeast Asia raised concerns about the region becoming a terrorist haven. Singapore arrested members of a terrorist cell with links to Al Qaeda. The FTA with the U.S. could enhance cooperation on counterterrorism efforts. Singapore's potential as a transshipment point for illegal cargo and its measures to enhance maritime security, including implementing anti-terrorism provisions, make it a key partner for cooperation on counterterrorism efforts with the United States. The U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement is not expected to have a significant impact on Singapore's economy. It may lead to increased imports in electronics and machinery sectors from Singapore, while U.S. agriculture exporters could benefit. The agreement allows greater access to Singapore's service sector and sets a standard for future FTAs. The debate over the FTA revolves around liberalized trade versus concerns about job loss and globalization's impact on income distribution and the environment. The House Committees held hearings on trade agreements with Chile and Singapore in 2003. The impact of globalization on income distribution, jobs, and the environment was discussed. On June 25, 2003, a resolution welcomed the Prime Minister of Singapore and expressed gratitude for cooperation in the campaign against terrorism. Legislation for the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement was introduced in July 2003 by Representative DeLay and Senator Grassley. Committees held mock markups for the implementation of the agreement. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a mock markup of the legislation on July 14, 2003. House Judiciary Committee reported out H.R. 2739 on July 15, 2003. House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee approved H.R. 2739, U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on July 17, 2003. Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved S. 1417, the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act on July 17, 2003. The House passed H.R. 2739 on July 17, 2003. The Senate approved H.R. 2739 on July 24, 2003. The text provides information on U.S. imports and exports from Singapore, as well as reserved service sectors/activities under the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.
