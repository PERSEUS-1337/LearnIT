    "content": "The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is a federal/state initiative aimed at promoting self-sufficiency of families with absent parents by ensuring financial support for their children. States administer the program with federal assistance in funding, monitoring, and locating absent parents. Established in 1974, the program's primary goals are reducing welfare costs by obtaining support from noncustodial parents. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to obtain ongoing support from noncustodial parents and establish paternity for children born outside of marriage to reduce welfare costs. Enacted in January 1975, the program operates in all 50 states and receives federal matching funds. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975, operates in all 50 states and receives federal matching funds. States must have their CSE plans approved by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to qualify for funds and incentive payments based on performance indicators. The OCSE oversees state CSE programs, provides technical assistance, maintains records, audits programs, and submits annual reports to Congress. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program operates in all 50 states, providing services such as parent location, paternity establishment, and support order enforcement. State CSE agencies use various methods for collecting support payments, including income withholding and intercepting tax refunds. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program in all 50 states includes intercepting lottery winnings, withholding licenses, seizing assets, and passport restrictions for debtor parents. Federal law also mandates civil or criminal contempt procedures, criminal nonsupport laws, and international enforcement of child support. In FY2015, $28.6 billion was collected at a cost of $5.7 billion. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program has been highly respected since its inception in 1975, with significant improvements in child support collections and paternity establishment. Reforms in 1984, 1988, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2006 have helped achieve its goals of reducing welfare costs and obtaining support from noncustodial parents. The program's mission has evolved from welfare cost-recovery to broader objectives. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 expanded the program's mission to focus on service delivery and broadened the criteria for incentive payments to states. The \"family first\" policy, established in 1996, prioritizes child support arrearage payments for former welfare recipients to prevent them from returning to welfare. Reforms in 2006 further extended this policy by incentivizing states to allocate more child support to both former welfare families and those still on welfare. The Child Support Enforcement program has seen a decline in cash welfare rolls since the mid-1990s, leading to a shift towards collecting and paying child support to nonwelfare families. The program has had bipartisan congressional support for over 32 years, with data showing caseload, collection, and expenditure trends from FY1978 to FY2015. The tables in the report are based on data from the OCSE website. The tables in the report are based on data from OCSE, obtained from state-submitted reports on program status. The 38-year trend data for CSE collections and caseload has been disaggregated into TANF and non-TANF cases. OCSE started classifying the CSE caseload into current TANF assistance, former TANF assistance, and never TANF assistance categories in FY1999. Tables displaying TANF cases, collections, or expenditures include Title IV-E foster care cases as well. Table 1 summarizes child support program statistics for the nation from FY1978 to FY2015. Child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly from $1 billion to $28.6 billion over a 38-year period. The number of children with established paternity through the program rose by 1,237%, and child support obligations increased by 223%. The CSE caseload expanded by 256%, with expenditures per case increasing from $75 to $390. The CSE program handles child support cases, serving both TANF and non-TANF recipients. In FY2015, 14.7 million cases were managed, with 47% being non-TANF families, 43% former-TANF families, and 11% TANF families. A CSE \"case\" is defined as a noncustodial parent responsible for child support. The CSE program handles child support cases for TANF and non-TANF recipients. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state and cooperate to establish paternity. Collections from TANF families go towards reimbursing the state and federal governments. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program handles child support cases for TANF and non-TANF recipients. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state. Non-TANF families must apply for CSE services and pay a $25 application fee. Child support collected on behalf of non-TANF families goes directly to the family. Additionally, families who have never been on TANF must pay a $25 annual user fee when child support enforcement efforts are successful. The CSE program handles child support cases for TANF and non-TANF recipients. Rights are assigned to the state by a caretaker, and a referral to the state CSE agency is made. Former assistance cases involve children previously receiving TANF or foster care services, while never-assistance cases involve children currently receiving CSE services but not eligible for TANF or foster care. The trend in the CSE caseload shows a decline in TANF cases from FY1995 to FY2015, especially after the 1996 welfare reform law. The CSE program handles child support cases for TANF and non-TANF recipients. The CSE caseload peaked in FY1998 with 19.4 million cases and has steadily decreased since then. The number of children born to unmarried women peaked in 2008, with 41% of births to unmarried women from 2008 to 2013. In 2014, it dropped slightly to 40%. In FY2015, there were 14.7 million CSE cases, a 24% reduction since FY1998. TANF cases comprised about 10% of the caseload in FY2015, while non-TANF cases increased to almost 90%. In FY2015, the CSE caseload increased by 256% from FY1978, reaching 14.7 million cases. The data shows a shift towards non-TANF cases, which now make up almost 90% of the caseload. The number of families currently receiving TANF has decreased over time, while those who formerly received TANF has increased. Additionally, the proportion of families who never received TANF has also increased since FY1999. In FY2015, the CSE program saw a significant increase in caseload, with non-TANF families making up the majority. Former TANF families and current TANF recipients accounted for smaller percentages. The goal is for child support to provide stable income, reducing the need for TANF assistance. The child support program aims to help families achieve self-sufficiency and combat child poverty by establishing paternity for child support orders. In FY2015, CSE cases were categorized into TANF, former-TANF, and never-TANF cases by state. Paternity must be legally established for children born outside of marriage to receive child support. Federal law mandates states to have procedures for paternity establishment. Federal law requires states to establish paternity for children under 18, with TANF applicants needing to cooperate. Noncooperation results in a 25% reduction in benefits. Paternity must be established for 90% of CSE cases, with a simple civil process and affidavit acknowledgment. Signed paternity acknowledgments are legally binding unless rescinded within 60 days. The state must ensure that paternity is established for children under 18, with a simple civil process and affidavit acknowledgment. Signed acknowledgments are legally binding unless rescinded within 60 days, and can only be challenged in court on specific grounds. Genetic testing is required in contested cases, and voluntary acknowledgment procedures include hospital-based programs. If a father does not admit paternity voluntarily, the state can establish it through court or administrative action. In judicial cases, child support staff collects information and evidence about the alleged father and refers the case to the state child support attorney for legal action. The IV-D attorney represents the state child support agency. Paternities established or acknowledged in the CSE program increased substantially from FY1978-FY1999, dropped in FY2000, and fluctuated between FY2001. The number of paternities established or acknowledged nationwide increased significantly from FY1978 to FY2009, peaking at 1.8 million in FY2009 and then decreasing to about 1.5 million in FY2015. In FY2003, more fathers were identified through voluntary paternity acknowledgment than through the courts or CSE agency. In FY2015, paternity was established or acknowledged for 1.5 million children in the CSE program. The national CSE paternity establishment percentage was 95.62%, with 10.1 million children having paternity determined out of 10.6 million born outside of marriage. Paternity establishment performance varied by state, ranging from 69% in the District of Columbia to 140% in Arizona. In FY2015, paternity was established for 1.5 million children in the CSE program, with performance varying by state from 69% in the District of Columbia to 140% in Arizona. Some states have improved paternity establishment for newborns but struggle with older children. Child support orders legally require noncustodial parents to financially support their children, typically established during divorce, dissolution of unmarried couples, or welfare cases. Payments help fulfill financial responsibilities for childrearing costs. Child support orders are established to ensure noncustodial parents contribute to childrearing costs. Guidelines are used to determine the order amount, aiming to protect children's best interests and promote fairness. The total number of CSE cases with established child support orders is shown in Figure 5. The total number of CSE cases with a child support order increased from FY1991 to FY2013, then decreased in FY2014 and FY2015. The number of cases with a child support order established increased by about 60% over a 25-year period, from almost 7.9 million in FY1991 to 12.6 million in FY2015. In FY2015, almost 86% of the 14,744,538 CSE cases had an established child support order. The number of child support orders established by states decreased by 1.3% from FY2011 to FY2015, dropping from almost 12.8 million to 12.6 million. Florida had 18% fewer cases in FY2015 compared to FY2011, with an establishment percentage of nearly 83%. In contrast, Texas had 19% more cases in FY2015 than in FY2011, also with an establishment percentage of nearly 83%. Nationally, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly from $1 billion in FY1978 to $28.6 billion in FY2015, a 718% increase adjusted for inflation. Child support collection methods used by CSE agencies include income withholding, interception of tax refunds, liens against property, reporting to credit bureaus, garnishment of wages, and seizure of assets. In FY2015, total CSE collections amounted to $34.1 billion, with $28.6 billion distributed to families in the program. In FY2015, income withholding accounted for 72% of total child support collections received, amounting to $24.5 billion. States utilize various enforcement techniques, including civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws, to assist a wide range of CSE families. OCSE began categorizing data in FY1999, distinguishing between current assistance (families currently receiving TANF cash assistance) and former assistance (families no longer on TANF). Child support collections decreased for current TANF cases, increased for former TANF cases, and increased for families that never received TANF over a 17-year period. Nationally, child support payments collected and distributed increased by almost 5% from FY2011 to FY2015. Collections varied among states, with increases in 34 jurisdictions and decreases in 20 jurisdictions during this period. Child support collections varied across states, with a 24% decrease in the Virgin Islands and a 25% increase in Texas. Despite a 7% decline in the CSE caseload, child support collections continued to rise. Many families receiving CSE services do not receive payments due to various reasons such as paternity or support order not established, noncustodial parent not located or incarcerated. In FY2015, 34% of TANF families received child support, while former TANF families and those who never received TANF received 60% and 69% respectively. In FY2015, child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families decreased from $192 in FY1999 to $129 in FY2015, while payments for families that had never been on TANF decreased from $427 to $332 in constant dollars. Former TANF families and families that had never received TANF received child support payments at rates of 60% and 69% respectively. Child support payments collected for families formerly on TANF increased slightly from $189 in FY1999 to $197 in FY2015. The average monthly child support payment for families who received a payment was $264 in FY2015. Child support arrearages remain a significant issue, with only about 45% of custodial parents receiving the full amount owed in 1999 and 2013. In FY1999, the CSE program collected only about 18% of the child support obligations it was responsible for when arrearage payments are considered. In FY2015, the CSE program collected 20% of child support obligations with arrearage payments taken into account (otherwise 65%). Each state CSE agency operates under a state plan approved by the OCSE and funded with state and federal dollars. States are required to track financial and statistical data on their programs, with the federal government reimbursing 66% of allowable expenditures on CSE activities. The federal government reimburses states for 66% of allowable expenditures on CSE activities, effectively tripling the state's contribution. The funding is open-ended with no limit, and states receive incentive payments for effective programs. CSE expenditures increased annually until FY2009, then decreased until FY2011, remained unchanged in FY2012, decreased in FY2013, and increased again in FY2014 and FY2015, but still below FY2009 levels. Total CSE administrative expenditures increased by 452% in real dollars from FY1978 to FY2015, reaching $5.749 billion. From FY1999 to FY2015, expenditures remained constant when adjusted for inflation. Nationally, CSE expenditures increased by less than 2% from FY2011 to FY2015. Expenditures varied among states, with some experiencing significant increases or decreases. Average monthly CSE expenditures per case rose from $6 in FY1978 to $32. Average monthly CSE expenditures per case increased from $6 in FY1978 to $32 in FY2015, a 52% increase adjusting for inflation. The cost-effectiveness ratio for the CSE program in FY2015 was $5.26 in child support collected for every dollar spent on CSE activities. In FY2015, states collected $5.26 from noncustodial parents for child support, a 28% increase from FY1999. There were wide variations in cost-effectiveness ratios among states, ranging from $1.89 in Delaware to $12.26 in Texas. Massachusetts saw a 43% decrease in ratio, while Kansas had a 68% increase. Nationally, the ratio increased by 3%. The CSE program generates income and expenditures for the federal government and states. The CSE program provides partial reimbursement and incentive payments to states from the federal government. States also retain a share of child support collections. State budgets were positively impacted by the program for the first 24 years. In FY1999, state CSE income exceeded state CSE expenditures by $49.7 million nationally, but since FY2000 state CSE expenditures have exceeded CSE income. By FY2015, state CSE expenditures exceeded state CSE income by $1.2 billion due to nonwelfare collections growing faster than welfare collections. Child support collections increased for families not on TANF or federal foster care by 38% from FY1999-FY2015, while collections for TANF and foster care families decreased by 62%. The CSE program has evolved to focus on delivering services to custodial parents and promoting responsibility among noncustodial parents. The CSE program has seen significant growth over the years, with collections increasing 8-fold to $28.6 billion and program expenditures almost 6-fold to $5.7 billion from FY1978 through FY2015. The number of children with established paternity through the program also increased 13-fold to 1.5 million, while the number of cases with child support orders nearly doubled to 12.6 million. The program's multiple purposes and broadened mission have not negatively impacted its effectiveness. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program has shown significant growth, with collections increasing to $28.6 billion and program expenditures to $5.7 billion from FY1978 through FY2015. The number of children with established paternity increased to 1.5 million, and cases with child support orders almost doubled to 12.6 million. Despite being second only to the IRS in terms of collection/enforcement, the program has only collected a small fraction of child support obligations, around 20% in FY2015. The average monthly child support payment for families is $264. In FY2015, the Child Support Enforcement program established paternity for almost 96% of its caseload, with $264 per month being the average child support payment. Paternity acknowledgment process identified more fathers than courts or CSE agencies. States have improved in establishing paternity for newborns but struggle with older children. The CSE program has shown improved performance, but there is still room for growth. Congress has high expectations for the program, with nearly 50 laws enacted since 1975. While bipartisan support is common, changes to the program often coincide with controversial adjustments to other social programs. In FY2015, only 3% of CSE collections were for TANF families, with most of the funds going to the families or divided between state and federal governments. Additionally, nearly $9 billion was collected for former TANF families, with the majority going to the families. In FY2015, 90% of CSE collections went to families, while the remaining 10% reimbursed state and federal governments for TANF benefits. This indicates successful implementation of the \"family first\" policy. The CSE program is ensuring children receive support from noncustodial parents. The HHS Justifications for Appropriations for the Administration for Children and Families highlighted challenges facing the CSE program, including state budget cuts, high unemployment and incarceration rates affecting noncustodial parents' ability to pay child support, difficulties in collecting support from self-employed individuals, and outdated statewide systems. The CSE program plays a crucial role in ensuring children receive support from noncustodial parents. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is essential for welfare reform, providing significant income for single-parent families. In FY2014, it served 16.3 million children, impacting more children and for longer periods than most federal programs."
