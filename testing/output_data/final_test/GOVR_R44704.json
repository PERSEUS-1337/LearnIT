    "content": "Default in the context of contract law refers to the failure to make a payment or perform an action as specified in a private contract. This can include failing to pay interest or principal on a bond, taking on additional debt, or not delivering collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Private contracts can outline specific actions that constitute default and the consequences that follow. Default can sometimes be remedied to bring a party back into compliance with the contract. In contract law, default refers to failure to comply with a contract, which can be remedied by actions like payment or legal action. Third parties may assess compliance with contract terms for future dealings. Third parties evaluating compliance with contract terms may face challenges due to differing interpretations and lack of disclosure in private contracts. Academic research on sovereign default shows discrepancies with credit rating agencies, leading to judgments not solely based on contract terms. Credit ratings agencies and the credit default swap market rely on committees to determine when a \"credit event\" or default has occurred, which may not always align with parties' interpretations of contract terms. Default can trigger legal consequences, such as under the Dodd-Frank Act. Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act allows the Treasury Secretary to put a financial institution into receivership if it is in default or in danger of default to prevent damage to the financial system. Contracts are incomplete as they cannot anticipate all future contingencies, leading to potential risks in credit markets. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Uniform Offering Circular (UOC) specifies conditions for Treasury securities, detailing sale procedures, payment timelines, and redemption rules. The UOC ensures that the U.S. government will pay principal on bills, notes, and bonds upon maturity. The UOC does not address payment delays or defaults, assuming U.S. Treasury securities are risk-free. Legal consequences would depend on contract law if payment issues arise. The Prompt Payment Act requires federal agencies to pay bills on time and imposes interest charges on late payments. The federal government is mandated to pay clean claims from Medicare providers within 30 days or pay interest as specified in the Prompt Payment Act. Treasury securities payments are regular and predictable to reduce borrowing costs, while other federal payments may be less consistent. The U.S. Treasury aims to maintain regular and predictable debt management processes to uphold the reputation of Treasury securities as risk-free assets. Any disruption to Treasury interest payments could impact the availability of credit for holders of Treasury securities. The quality of collateral affecting credit availability and borrowing costs for the government and others. Expectations of timely federal payments may be weaker, leading to delays in payments to international organizations and administrative processes. Federal agencies must avoid improper payments, which may be challenging with compressed schedules. Well-informed payees may protect themselves from payment delays, especially for Social Security beneficiaries who may not have taken precautions. In cases of payment delays, the intentions of payors matter less, as good intentions do not excuse nonpayment. Good intentions may influence creditors' decisions to take action against debtors, but ultimately nonpayment may still have consequences. Excused defaults may occur in situations where nonpayment is due to events beyond the debtor's control. Financial markets may react differently to nonpayment in these cases. Some research suggests financial markets are less likely to react adversely to defaults due to natural disasters or commodity price falls than to defaults that are viewed as strategic. Judging whether a default is avoidable or strategic may be difficult, leading to creditors being less willing to excuse defaults. Treasury Secretary Lew and predecessors have urged Congress to act during debt limit episodes to avoid unprecedented failures to meet obligations. The federal government's history of meeting obligations has been questioned in events like the War of 1812, the Great Depression gold standard withdrawal, and the 1979 \"mini-default.\" Other incidents include Revolutionary War paper money refusal, Civil War \"greenbacks,\" and the 1970s gold standard abandonment. War challenges in 1812 exposed institutional deficiencies hindering government operations. During the War of 1812, the federal government faced severe financial difficulties due to institutional deficiencies. The closure of the Bank of the United States in 1811 complicated federal finances, leading to default examples and challenges in mobilizing sufficient financial resources for military operations. Treasury had to deposit its funds in local banks, further complicating the situation. During the War of 1812, the federal government's financial situation worsened as Treasury's funds were spread across 21 local banks, causing operational issues. With the repeal of direct and excise taxes in 1802, the government relied on tariff and customs revenue, which was further impacted by shipping restrictions. Treasury Secretary Gallatin initially believed war expenses could be covered by loans, but by December 1811, he proposed internal taxes due to falling customs revenue. Despite doubling customs rates and issuing notes after the war declaration in June 1812, customs revenue fell while war costs increased, leading to borrowing challenges by mid-1813. By mid-1813, the government's ability to borrow on reasonable terms had dwindled due to rising war costs. President Madison called Congress to consider new revenue sources, resulting in the reinstatement of internal revenue sources to raise $5 million and authorization to borrow $7.5 million. However, the government's creditworthiness continued to deteriorate, leading to high borrowing yields. Internal revenue rates were raised at the end of 1814, but most revenues were collected after the war. The U.S. Treasury faced challenges with the lack of control over monetary policy after the War of 1812. State banks issued bank notes, leading to inflation and the suspension of specie payment in most of the country. This resulted in the inability to use bank notes across different states. The U.S. Treasury had to expand accounts in multiple banks due to the breakdown of banks' willingness to accept notes from other banks. By 1814, the Treasury had accounts in 94 banks and had to keep separate accounts for different types of securities. Despite holding $2.5 million in bank credits, they were widely dispersed and difficult to transfer. The federal government could no longer demand specie for tax payments, leading to acceptance of heavily discounted bank notes. Alexander J. Dallas played a key role in managing the Treasury during this time. The Treasury faced difficulties meeting obligations in 1814, with interest on federal debt to Boston investors going unpaid. Despite still having borrowing authority, banks and investors were reluctant to lend or accept Treasury notes. Public opinion played a crucial role in determining public credit at that time. Government finances improved after the end of the war and the rebound in customs revenues, leading to the revival of public credit. The Second Bank of the United States, chartered in 1816, provided a more stable foundation for banking and currency. By the 1820s, public finances were restored as land sales and customs revenues exceeded federal expenditures. The decision to move off the gold standard in the 1930s was seen by some as a repudiation of contract terms, including those of the Second Liberty Bonds issued in 1917. The abandonment of the gold standard in 1933 was the result of a banking crisis during the Great Depression. Treasury securities in the early 20th century had gold clauses to ensure payment in gold coin. Omitting these clauses would have made bonds harder to sell and increased debt service costs. Investors were concerned about the U.S. government leaving the gold standard. The Wall Street crash of October 1929 led to a financial crisis, causing a sharp drop in prices and rise in unemployment. Over 9,700 banks failed between 1929 and 1933, leading to a loss of public trust in banks. State governors imposed bank holidays to prevent further bank runs and allow for financial reorganization. During Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration, the governor of New York declared a banking holiday, following other closures authorized by the Comptroller of the Currency. International investors withdrew funds from the US due to uncertainty about the new President's policies. The Federal Reserve raised discount rates in 1931 and 1933 to attract gold, leading to credit tightening and price level falls. U.S. deposit withdrawals strained the Federal Reserve's gold reserves, required to be at least 40% of currency value. The Federal Reserve's gold reserves fell below the required 40% minimum in March 1933, leading to a banking crisis. President Franklin Roosevelt declared a federal bank holiday, suspending all banking activities and trade in gold bullion to resolve the crisis. In response to the banking crisis in March 1933, President Roosevelt declared a federal bank holiday and suspended all banking activities and trade in gold bullion. Congress then passed the Emergency Banking Act, giving the President control over gold shipments and reducing the gold content of the dollar by half. This action helped improve the U.S. trade balance by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. In October 1933, the Roosevelt Administration directed purchases of gold at set prices, linking the value of a dollar to gold. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 set a book value of gold at $35, reestablishing a gold standard and bringing all federal holdings of gold under the control of the U.S. Treasury. The cancellation of gold clauses led to some investors suing the government, but the Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to regulate the value of money. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to regulate the value of money, stating that the cancellation of gold clauses did not damage bondholders as they would have had to sell the gold to the government at a set price. The dissent argued that Congress's actions aimed to destroy private obligations and repudiate national debts. Despite the cancellation of gold clauses, the Treasury had no trouble borrowing, and investors shifted investments to countries still on the gold standard. The U.S. Treasury had no trouble borrowing even after suspending the gold standard in 1933. Over 80% of Treasury securities holders with gold clauses reinvested in new issues. The devaluation of the dollar improved the balance of trade, bringing gold back. The suspension of the gold standard helped stimulate economic recovery and laid the foundation for modern monetary policy. Researchers found that the gold standard spread shocks globally during the Great Depression. Countries leaving the gold standard in the 1930s recovered quicker from the Great Depression. The U.S. economy grew at a rate of 9.4% annually from 1933 to 1937. Despite calls for a return to the gold standard, no country currently operates on it. A delay in U.S. Treasury payments in 1979 led to a \"mini-default\" and coincided with a rise in Treasury yields. In 1979, a delay in U.S. Treasury payments led to concerns about credit risks and inflation expectations affecting market prices. However, interest rate movements were likely driven by anticipated changes in U.S. monetary policy. The payment delays inconvenienced small investors, but the wider market stability in Treasury securities was not at risk. In late April and early May 1979, approximately 4,000 Treasury checks worth $122 million for interest payments and redemptions of securities were delayed. The foregone interest due to the delays was estimated at $125,000. Wire transfers to financial institutions and large-scale investors were unaffected as over 90% of marketable Treasury securities were held in book-entry form. Payment delays were due to back-office technical and organizational problems, with check processing returning to normal by May 14, 1979. The U.S. Treasury faced challenges in its operations in the late 1970s due to automation, reorganization, and equipment failures. Rising demand for T-bills from small investors, attracted by increasing yields, led to pressures on Treasury operations. Yields on Treasury securities exceeded interest rate ceilings on standard demand deposit accounts, prompting many small investors to invest directly in Treasury securities. By the late 1970s, small investor demand for Treasury securities was rising rapidly, with purchase requests for Treasury bills increasing significantly. Small investors were given the option to roll over the principal for maturing Treasury bills into new bills, leading to additional administrative burdens on debt management. The U.S. Treasury faced delays in payments, partly due to rollover requests and postponed auctions during a debt limit episode in 1979. Despite having the financial means to make payments, operational capacity to cut checks may have been impaired. There is no legal mechanism for the Treasury to compensate investors for delayed payments. Treasury bond offering documents did not anticipate payment delays. Claire Barton of Encino, CA, filed a class action suit against the U.S. government in 1979 for payment delays to bondholders. The government offered a settlement to affected investors, with over 80% accepting. A bill was introduced to compensate remaining investors, but no further action was taken. In 1979, a class action suit was filed against the U.S. government for payment delays to bondholders. A bill was introduced but no further action was taken. The suit was dismissed with prejudice in 1980. A 1989 article highlighted the impact of the 1979 mini-default on Treasury yields, leading to increased borrowing costs for the government. This warning to investors was reflected in the spike in Treasury bill yields shown in Figure 1. In November 1978, banks raised lending rates after economist Henry Kaufman predicted a rise in interest rates. By October 1979, the Federal Reserve changed monetary policy. The spike in Treasury yields raised concerns about risk-free assets and monetary policy shifts. President Carter's nomination of Paul Volcker reflected worries about inflation. The Treasury payment delays in 1979 raised concerns about inflation and signaled a shift in monetary policy. Market traders may have been aware of the delays before they were reported by the Wall Street Journal. Treasury yields fell after the news of the delays, indicating market movements. Market movements of Treasury yields around the time of payment delays did not reduce demand for Treasury securities. Traders may have learned of the delays before they were reported, potentially leading to short selling to profit from the information. Short sellers aim to convince others of a decrease in asset value and aggressively propagate this information once a short position is established. The lag between the first payment delay and its report suggests few short sellers traded on this information. Market reactions to Treasury payment delays were minimal, indicating other factors may have caused a spike in yields. On the same day as the payment delays, monetary policy signaled a shift towards credit tightening due to inflation concerns. The Federal Reserve announced an unexpected increase in the U.S. money supply, leading to new expectations of credit restriction. A Federal Reserve research paper suggested redefining money measures to include near-money substitutes like money market funds and repo agreements. This could impact Federal Reserve policy statements. The Federal Reserve's unexpected increase in the U.S. money supply led to market expectations of credit restriction. This prompted the Federal Reserve to tighten credit, signaling a potential increase in benchmark interest rates. Market concerns about inflation, credit conditions, and a rapid money supply expansion in late April 1979 influenced Treasury yield movements. Delayed payments by small investors were not a significant factor in the movement of Treasury yields, as timely federal payments make the U.S. government a more reliable business counterparty. In the late 1970s, federal payments were often delayed, especially for benefits like Social Security. A 1978 GAO report found that many contractor bills were not paid within 30 days, leading to an average payment time of 74 days. In response, Congress passed the Prompt Payment Act of 1982 to ensure timely payments by federal agencies. The Payment Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-177) requires agencies to pay bills on time or pay interest on delayed payments. A 1986 GAO study found that timeliness of payments had improved but could still be better. Various causes of payment delays were identified, including lags in acknowledging delivery of goods and paperwork acquisition. The U.S. Treasury also delayed some tax refunds in 1980 as part of a cash management strategy. The historical record does not support the claim that the U.S. government has always had a flawless payment record. The federal government defaulted in 1814 under Treasury Secretary Alexander Dallas, facing a \"bankrupt\" Treasury. The suspension of the gold standard in 1933-1934 is controversial as bondholders were repaid under different terms. Severing the gold-dollar linkage allowed for a modern monetary policy to promote economic recovery. Claims of payment delays to small investors are also mentioned. Claims of payment delays to small investors holding Treasury securities in 1979 are disputed, with arguments suggesting it did not constitute a default. The federal government responded to mitigate the inconvenience for affected investors, and there was no default clause in the legal terms for Treasury securities. Claims that these delays increased federal borrowing costs are considered weak, as other factors like monetary conditions and policy shifts played a more significant role. Delays in meeting financial obligations within the complex federal government structure may be inevitable. After the War of 1812, federal revenues rebounded, allowing the retirement of federal debt in 1835. Research shows little difficulty in borrowing after the 1933-1934 gold standard suspension. In 1979, monetary policy shifts explain changes in Treasury securities yields. Bondholders affected by the 1979 mini-default were a small fraction of those impacted by federal payment delays. The federal government's ability to borrow was not significantly damaged by these events. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow was not hindered by events in the 19th century or 1930s, suggesting that a Treasury default in the present day may not have minor consequences. The market for U.S. Treasuries is broad and liquid, enabling efficient supply. The U.S. Treasury's ability to borrow efficiently promotes credit supply, but concerns about collateral quality can disrupt credit markets. Historical episodes show the government's unpreparedness for financial challenges. Recent changes in cash management policies aim to ensure operational continuity during catastrophic events. Fiscal constraints like balancing budgets may not be enough to prepare the federal government. The federal government's historical episodes reveal its unpreparedness for financial challenges despite commitments to fiscal discipline. Constraints like balancing budgets may not adequately prepare for fiscal emergencies, as seen in instances such as Treasury Secretary Gallatin's debt reduction efforts before the War of 1812 and Congress's directive to balance the budget before the Treasury payment delay in 1979. The lack of key operational capabilities, such as a fiscal agent or administrative capacity for internal revenues, presented obstacles that could not be quickly overcome. The U.S. Treasury's historical challenges with financial preparedness, such as during the War of 1812 and in 1979, highlight the importance of operational capabilities and fiscal resources. President Franklin Roosevelt benefited from proposals drafted by the Hoover Administration, while the Reconstruction Finance Corporation provided a powerful economic policy tool. Congress's slow response to military and fiscal preparations also played a role in these financial challenges. In historical instances like the War of 1812, Congress was slow in military and fiscal preparations. Modern macroeconomists emphasize the importance of \"fiscal space\" for governments to respond to economic downturns. The U.S. Treasury's payment history is relatively strong compared to other advanced countries, highlighting the benefits of maintaining a strong fiscal and credit reputation."
