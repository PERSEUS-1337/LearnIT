    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act\". In 2007, children accessing HIV treatment did not keep up with new pediatric infections. Children represent 16% of new HIV cases but only 9% receiving treatment under the Act. Basic interventions like counseling and testing are effective and cost-efficient in preventing new infections and providing care to those with AIDS. The challenge is to expand these interventions nationally in a sustainable way. A simple intervention can reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV significantly. Giving a single dose of an anti-retroviral drug to the mother during labor and to the baby in the first 3 days of life can reduce transmission by 50%. Expanding access to prevention services is crucial in preventing new pediatric HIV infections. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 is amended to include a description of activities to achieve specific targets. Additionally, bilateral efforts are emphasized in the fight against HIV transmission. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide assistance in achieving HIV/AIDS targets and promoting infant feeding options for HIV positive mothers in line with WHO guidelines. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide assistance in achieving HIV/AIDS targets, including support for HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral medications. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide assistance for HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral medications under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. SEC. 311. FINDINGS. \"Congress finds that approximately 1,100 children worldwide are infected with HIV daily, mostly through mother-to-child transmission. Interventions can reduce transmission rates significantly, with the standard of care in the US reducing transmission to as low as 2 percent.\" Global coverage of services to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV remains low, with less than 10 percent of pregnant women with HIV in resource-poor countries having access to these services. Prevention programs not only reduce transmission rates but also provide health benefits for women and children, serving as an entry point for mothers to access treatment for their own HIV infection. Connecting and integrating these programs with HIV care, treatment, and prevention is crucial for improved outcomes. Prevention programs are essential for improving outcomes for HIV-affected women and families. Access to comprehensive HIV prevention services needs to be increased for pregnant women, whether infected or not, to protect themselves and their partners. Preventing unintended pregnancies among HIV-infected women is crucial, and access to high-quality family planning and reproductive health care is necessary for informed decision-making. In 2007, children accessing HIV treatment lagged behind new pediatric infections. Children represent 16% of new HIV cases but only 9% receive treatment. Over 420,000 children were newly infected with HIV in 2007. Without proper care, half of infected children die before age 2, and 75% before age 5. Providing HIV care for children poses unique challenges, including limited access to reliable testing. The challenges in providing HIV care for children include limited access to reliable testing, shortage of trained pediatric care providers, weak linkages between prevention and treatment services, and the need for affordable pediatric HIV/AIDS medications. \"SEC. 312. POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS.\" The United States Government's response to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic prioritizes prevention of mother-to-child transmission and care for children affected by HIV/AIDS. Collaboration with various stakeholders is essential. The comprehensive global strategy should establish targets for prevention efforts by 2013. The United States Government prioritizes prevention of mother-to-child transmission and care for children affected by HIV/AIDS. Targets include ensuring pregnant women receive HIV counseling and testing, providing anti-retroviral medications for prevention, and integrating prevention, care, and treatment programs. By 2013, children should account for at least 15 percent of those receiving treatment under this Act. The United States Government aims to prioritize prevention of mother-to-child transmission and care for children affected by HIV/AIDS. This includes expanding programs for children orphaned by AIDS and developing a timeline for better prevention regimens. Strategic planning documents and funding agreements must align with these goals. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel is established by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally to review and provide recommendations for scaling up prevention services under the Act. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel, chaired by the Coordinator, consists of up to 15 members appointed within 60 days of the Act's enactment, including experts from the Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Agency for International Development. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel consists of up to 15 members, including health ministers, organizations implementing prevention activities, healthcare researchers, patient advocates, and representatives from NGOs with expertise in the field. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel, consisting of up to 15 members, reviews activities and scientific evidence related to preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. They assess the effectiveness of current prevention programs and collaborate with international programs funded under this Act. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel, consisting of up to 15 members, collaborates with international entities to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. They identify barriers to access prevention services, address stigma hindering pregnant women from testing, and improve linkages between prevention services and care programs. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel evaluates financial assistance for HIV prevention services and submits a report to congressional committees within 14 months of the Act's enactment, which will be made public. The Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission Panel evaluates HIV prevention services and submits a public report with recommendations to the Coordinator. The Coordinator considers the recommendations and includes a description of the response activities in the annual report. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Panel. The Panel authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2009-2011 to carry out HIV prevention services. The Panel terminates 60 days after submitting the report to Congress. Amendments include coordination with governments, donors, and NGOs for HIV/AIDS programs. The Panel authorized appropriations for HIV prevention services for fiscal years 2009-2011, including coordination with governments, donors, and NGOs. Additionally, the report includes tracking the number of women receiving comprehensive strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV."
