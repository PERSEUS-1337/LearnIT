    "content": "The President and Vice President's term of office is an accepted constitutional norm with little controversy in the 21st century. The four-year term and two-term tradition were established by George Washington and incorporated in the Constitution in 1951. The issues of tenure and reelection were intensely debated during the Constitutional Convention of 1787, resulting in a compromise of a four-year term and eligibility for reelection. Several changes to the conditions for the President's term of office have been proposed as constitutional amendments, with relatively few conditions added since the original provisions were established. The Twelfth, Twentieth, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments have set qualifications for the President and Vice President, clarified succession and vacancy filling procedures. Single term proposals were popular in the 19th century. In the 19th century, there were proposals for a single presidential term, with amendments introduced to change the term length. By the 20th century, a single six-year term became a preferred option. However, interest in these issues has declined in recent decades, and the questions of presidential term and tenure seem to be settled in the contemporary context. Amendments to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment for unlimited reelection were introduced as recently as the 113th Congress. The terms and tenure for the President and Vice President of the United States have evolved over nearly two centuries, from the earliest provisions in the U.S. Constitution to the Twenty-Fifth Amendment ratified in 1967. The Constitution sets a four-year term for both positions. Amendments have been proposed, including a single six-year term, but interest in change has declined in recent decades. The Twelfth, Twentieth, Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution have impacted the terms and tenure of the President and Vice President. These amendments set qualifications, term limits, and succession procedures for these offices. Proposals to change the President's term of office have been introduced in Congress since the early 19th century. The preferred alternative by the 20th century was a six-year single term with limitations on reelection. The Twenty-Second Amendment, ratified in 1951, limited the number of times a person could be elected President. Most proposed amendments related to the President's term have called for a six-year term without the possibility of reelection or the repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment. The idea of a six-year term for the President and Vice President has a long history, with numerous proposed amendments introduced in Congress. However, since the 116th Congress, no amendment proposing a six-year term has been introduced. Most proposals called for a six-year term with limitations on reelection or the repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment. Proposed amendments in Congress have suggested a single six-year term for the President and Vice President, with limitations on reelection. Advocates argue that this would eliminate the constant campaign for reelection and allow the chief executive to focus on governing without partisan distractions. Advocates propose a single six-year term for the President to eliminate partisan distractions and focus on governing, legislation, and policy development. This would allow for greater consistency in policy decisions and give the President more time to advocate for and implement policies effectively. Former President Jimmy Carter endorsed the idea. Former President Jimmy Carter endorsed the idea of a longer single presidential term, suggesting that it could provide greater moral authority and credibility to the President. This could lead to more focus on governing and policy formation, resulting in greater stability and continuity. Critics argue against the proposal. Critics of the proposal to restrict the President to a single term argue that it is undemocratic as it limits voters' choices. They believe a one-term President would be a lame duck from the start, less responsive to public opinion, and too insulated from political discourse. Opponents argue that a single six-year term for the President would extend the tenure of failed or inadequate Presidents while shortening the tenure of successful ones. The proposal has been a recurring idea since the early days of the republic, with 212 similar amendments introduced between the 19th and 104th Congresses. Between the 19th and 104th Congresses, 212 amendments were introduced proposing a single six-year term for the President and Vice President, with some including provisions for repealing the Twenty-Second Amendment. These proposals were often in response to incumbent Presidents considering a third term, such as Ulysses Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, and others. During the 92nd and 93rd Congresses in the 1970s, there were proposals for a six-year presidential term due to concerns about the balance of power between the President and Congress. Hearings were held in both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees to discuss these proposals. In the late 1970s, there was a decline in the volume of amendment proposals regarding a six-year presidential term. The most recent stand-alone amendments were offered in the 101st Congress, but they received no action beyond committee referral. Subsequent proposals in later Congresses sought to establish a comprehensive system of term limits for both Congress and the President. In the late 1970s, there was a decline in amendment proposals for a six-year presidential term. Representative Richard Schulze introduced H.J.Res. 28 for a single six-year presidential term with a two-term limit. Representative Frank Mascara later proposed a similar term limit with a four-year term for Representatives and a 12-year limit for Members of Congress. Efforts to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment began in 1956, but no significant action has been taken on recent proposals. Efforts to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment began in 1956, with 46 proposed amendments introduced in Congress. Congressional interest in repealing the amendment receded over time, possibly due to its acceptance as a settled element of the constitutional order and the turbulent history of the 1960s and 1970s. The turbulent history of the 1960s and 1970s may have influenced public sentiment for repealing the Two-Term Amendment. During the period between 1961 and 1980, five Presidents served, with two presidencies ending prematurely and two others being defeated for reelection. During the 1960s and 1970s, public sentiment for repealing the Two-Term Amendment grew as Presidents faced challenges like opposition to military action in Vietnam. Interest in repealing the amendment was seen when term-limited Presidents approached the end of their time in office, with examples like President Eisenhower in 1960 and President Nixon in 1973. In the 1980s, there were suggestions to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment to allow President Reagan to serve a third term. Despite some support, the proposal faced mixed reviews and was ultimately abandoned after Republican losses in the 1986 elections and the Iran-Contra scandal. The 1986 congressional elections and the Iran-Contra events dampened enthusiasm for repealing the Twenty-Second Amendment. Support for repeal resurfaced during President Bill Clinton's second term and in 2014, a petition sponsored by Change.org aimed to enable President Obama to run for a third term. Despite occasional surges in support for repeal during popular Presidents' second terms, public opinion has not favored repealing the amendment since its ratification. In 2013, 17% of respondents supported removing the term limit for Presidents. In 2013, 17% of respondents supported removing the term limit for Presidents, while 81% were opposed. Proponents argue that the Twenty-Second Amendment is undemocratic and restricts voters from electing a qualified candidate they favor, especially during times of crisis. The 22nd Amendment restricts presidential leadership continuity, leading to inexperience and mistakes in office. Repealing it could reduce presidential stumbles, especially during crises. Supporters argue that reelecting Presidents as lame ducks diminishes their influence and authority. Supporters of presidential term limits argue that eight years is sufficient for any individual in such a powerful position as the presidency. They believe that the founders intended for a time-limited presidency to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in the executive branch. Presidential term limits are seen as essential to prevent excessive power accumulation in the executive branch. Proposals to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment have been simple, calling for its outright repeal. Some proposals have suggested a single six-year term for the President as an alternative approach. The proposal to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment, which limits presidential terms, has been ongoing since the 1950s. Former President Harry Truman supported the repeal in the 86th Congress, but the movement lost momentum after that period. The movement to repeal the Twenty-Second Amendment, which limits presidential terms, reached its peak in the 1950s. Congressional interest in repeal waned for some time but resurged in the 1970s. Repeal proposals continued to be introduced in almost every Congress until the early 21st century, with the most recent one being H.J.Res. 15 in the 113th Congress (2013-2014). The President and Vice President's terms were originally set at four years with the possibility of reelection by the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. The debate over term length and reeligibility was a major topic at the Constitutional Convention, with delegates divided between federalists and anti-federalists. Federalists wanted a strong federal government with an independent and authoritative executive. The Constitutional Convention debated the duration of the executive's term, with most delegates agreeing on a four-year term for the President. The anti-federalists preferred a less powerful executive with limited authority, resembling the President of Congress under the Articles of Confederation. The concept of a plural executive was rejected in favor of a single President. The Constitutional Convention debated the duration of the executive's term, with most delegates agreeing on a four-year term for the President. They also discussed the issue of reelection and who should elect the President, balancing continuity with concerns of dictatorship or monarchy. During the Constitutional Convention, there was debate over the executive's term length and reelection eligibility. Some delegates opposed reelection to prevent excessive congressional influence or prolonged presidential tenure. Others prioritized establishing an independent executive, viewing reelection eligibility as less problematic. The debate fluctuated over two months as positions shifted. During the Constitutional Convention, the delegates debated the executive's term length and reelection eligibility. Initially considering three-year and seven-year terms, they eventually settled on a seven-year term without reelection eligibility. They also shifted the election process from Congress to state electors, aiming to reduce congressional influence over the presidential election. Additionally, they voted to eliminate the prohibition on reelection and discussed shortening the executive's term to six years. The Constitutional Convention debated the executive's term length and reelection eligibility, eventually settling on a seven-year term without reelection. The issue of restoring election by Congress led to a heated debate on reinstating the one-term requirement, with supporters of independent election opposing the motion. Various proposals were suggested, including an indefinite term and terms of 11, 15, and 20 years, before the resolution was referred to the Committee on Detail. The Convention referred a resolution to the Committee on Detail for a National Executive consisting of a single person chosen by the Natl. legislature for a seven-year term, ineligible for reelection. The debate continued on who should elect the President, with various proposals considered and rejected, including election by state legislatures, electors chosen by Congress, and popular election. Agreement on the election process remained elusive. After months of debates and failed proposals on the election process for the National Executive, delegates at the convention voted to refer the presidency question to a Committee on Postponed Matters. The committee, known as The Committee of Eleven, offered a fresh perspective on the issue after recognizing the impasse. The Committee of Eleven, tasked with resolving the impasse on the presidency issue, proposed a four-year term with eligibility for reelection and a new method of election by an electoral college appointed by each state's Legislature. Despite opposition, their solution was ultimately accepted, leading to the agreement on the President's term and tenure. The Constitution was finalized, approved, and proposed for ratification on September 17, 1787. The Constitution was finalized and proposed for ratification on September 17, 1787, with debates on the presidential term and tenure. Federalists argued for energy in the executive, while opponents warned of potential power concentration. George Washington's universal respect helped alleviate doubts in the short term. The Constitution addressed presidential vacancies in Article II, Section 1, clause 6, stating that the Vice President would assume the presidency in case of removal, death, resignation, or inability of the President. However, it did not address vacancies in the vice presidency, which was later addressed by the 25th Amendment. The 25th Amendment addressed presidential disability and set the precedent of limiting presidents to two terms in office. Only 12 out of 44 presidents served two full consecutive terms. The average presidential tenure in the United States is 62 months over 227 years and 9 months. This fluctuation is influenced by factors such as presidential mortality, reelection rates, political disquiet, and socioeconomic volatility. Proposals to extend the executive's term or limit Presidents to a single term have been suggested throughout history. The period between 1789 and 1825 saw stability in presidential tenure, with four of the first five Presidents serving two consecutive terms. This was attributed to factors like the triumph of the Jeffersonian Republican Party and the demise of the Federalists, leading to a de facto one-party government. The average presidential tenure during this period was 86 months, similar to the period between 1981 and 2017. During the period of 1789-1825, there was stability in presidential tenure with four of the first five Presidents serving two consecutive terms. The Jeffersonian Republican Party dominated, leading to a de facto one-party government. The Era of Good Feelings, marked by unity, ended with the contentious election of 1824. George Washington set a precedent for presidential tenure by retiring after two terms. George Washington's decision to retire after two terms was based on personal reasons, not to set a precedent for his successors. John Adams, his immediate successor, did not face the question of how many terms he would serve. The two-term tradition is more accurately attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who expressed concerns about \"perpetual reeligibility\" in the presidency. Thomas Jefferson declined re-election, citing the importance of fixed term limits to prevent the presidency from becoming a lifelong position. He believed in the principle of short periods of responsibility in government for the greatest happiness of mankind. Jefferson's decision set a tradition of serving only two terms in office. Jefferson's decision to decline re-election set a tradition of serving only two terms in office. His successors, Madison, Monroe, and Andrew Jackson, retired after their second terms, while John Quincy Adams was defeated for re-election in 1828. The vice presidency also saw stability during this period. The balance of the 19th century was more volatile politically, socially, and economically. The \"Era of Good Feelings\" Democratic-Republican coalition fractured after James Monroe's retirement in 1824. The \"Era of Good Feelings\" Democratic-Republican coalition fractured under sectional pressure, leading to a contingent election in 1824. John Quincy Adams was chosen by the House of Representatives despite Andrew Jackson winning more popular and electoral votes. Jackson's denouncement of the House's decision as a \"corrupt bargain\" fueled his successful campaign to defeat Adams in the election of 1828. During a period of 64 years, only Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant were reelected for a second term, with Grant serving two full consecutive terms. The idea of limiting Presidents to a single term gained support, with Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison both suggesting constitutional amendments for a single four- or six-year presidential term. During the mid-19th century, there was a growing acceptance of the single-term presidency, with calls for a one-term limit by the Whig Party and some Democrats. Several Presidents, including James Polk and James Buchanan, announced their intention to serve only one term. However, only Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant were reelected for a second term during this period. The idea of limiting Presidents to a single term gained support, with Andrew Jackson and William Henry Harrison proposing constitutional amendments for a one-term presidency. During the late 19th century, the two-term presidency was not common, with only a few exceptions like Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. There were proposals for a single-term presidency amendment, and Rutherford B. Hayes declined to seek a second term. Grant briefly considered a third term but public outcry led to its abandonment. During the late 19th century, the two-term presidency was not common. Rutherford B. Hayes declined a second term and proposed a single-term amendment. James A. Garfield won the GOP nomination in 1880 but was assassinated shortly after his inauguration. Chester Arthur succeeded him but was denied a second term. Grover Cleveland advocated for a single-term amendment in his acceptance message to the Democratic National Convention. Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms as President, beating his successor in 1892 to return for a second term. William McKinley won in 1896 and was the first President elected to a second term since Grant. McKinley intended to respect the two-term tradition but was assassinated three months into his second term, succeeded by Theodore Roosevelt. This period from 1825 to 1901 contrasts with the era of the founders in terms of presidential tenure. During the era from 1837 to 1901, various factors led to shorter average presidential tenure, including the deaths of five Presidents, political volatility, the Civil War, financial crises, and support for a one-term limit. The 18 chief executives during this period served an average of 43 months in office, highlighting political instability post-Jackson. Between 1837 and 1901, presidential tenure was short, with an average of 43 months due to various factors like deaths of Presidents, political volatility, and the Civil War. However, from 1901 to 1945, average presidential tenure lengthened to over 74 months, mainly because of the long terms of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson. Between 1837 and 1901, presidential tenure was short, averaging 43 months due to various factors like deaths of Presidents, political volatility, and the Civil War. From 1901 to 1945, average presidential tenure lengthened to over 74 months, mainly due to the long terms of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson. Theodore Roosevelt adhered to the two-term tradition, retiring in 1908 after serving most of McKinley's second term. Theodore Roosevelt retired in 1908 but ran again in 1912 as the Progressive Party candidate, dividing the Republican vote and ensuring Woodrow Wilson's election. The Democratic National Convention responded by proposing a constitutional amendment for presidential term limits, which passed the Senate in February 1913. The Senate resolution for presidential term limits passed in February 1913 but no further action was taken, and it expired with the end of the 62nd Congress on March 4, 1913. Wilson's opposition to the single-term amendment was revealed in 1916, leading the House Democratic leadership to shelve the amendment. Wilson considered running for a third term in 1920, possibly as a referendum on his League of Nations plan. The lack of follow-through on Wilson's League of Nations plan is attributed to various factors, including rumors of his ill health, the two-term tradition, succession struggles within the Democratic Party, and fears of voter backlash. Despite the 1920 Democratic National Convention requiring 44 ballots to choose James M. Cox as the party's candidate, Wilson's name was never nominated. Wilson's three immediate successors did not serve two full terms, with Warren Harding dying in office, Calvin Coolidge declining a second term, and Herbert Hoover being defeated for reelection. President Calvin Coolidge declined to run for a second term in 1928 despite continued suggestions for his candidacy. He ended speculation with a brief statement on August 2, 1927, stating, \"I do not choose to run for President in 1928.\" This decision broke the two-term tradition, which was later broken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. In 1940, President Roosevelt decided to accept his party's nomination for a third term after the outbreak of war in Europe. Germany's rapid victories in Europe influenced his decision, and he only agreed to run if it was a draft nomination. President Roosevelt's ambiguous statement at the Convention signaled his acceptance of the nomination. He was duly nominated by an overwhelming margin on July 17. As the 1944 election approached, with the nation deeply involved in World War II, Roosevelt's failing health was concealed from the public. President Roosevelt's failing health, including coronary artery disease, was concealed from the public. He was elected to a fourth term but succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage in April 1945. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, succeeded him. The Twenty-Second Amendment was proposed in 1947, limiting Presidents to two terms. Truman was not covered by the amendment, but all Presidents since have been subject to its provisions. Between 1945 and 2017, five Presidents served two full consecutive terms, contributing to the longest average tenure in office. However, the period between 1961 and 1981 saw a high rate of presidential turnover with five Presidents serving in 20 years. Between 1961 and 1981, five Presidents served in rapid succession: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter. The turnover in office was influenced by adverse political and economic developments, similar to the turbulent 1840s and 1850s. Amendments like the Twentieth, Twenty-Second, and Twenty-Fifth altered presidential and vice presidential terms and tenure. The Twelfth Amendment in 1804 extended qualifications for the President to the Vice President, marking the first change in presidential and vice presidential term and tenure since then. Prior to 1937, presidential and vice presidential terms ended on March 4 following a presidential election, with a four-month interval between the choice of presidential electors and the presidential inauguration. The Twelfth Amendment in 1804 extended qualifications for the President to the Vice President, marking the first change in presidential and vice presidential term and tenure since then. Congress and the presidential inauguration, both of which occurred on March 4 of the following year, were connected with the presidential term of office. Congressional sessions were required to assemble at least once a year, usually convening after elections for its successor had been held and continuing through March 4. These \"lame duck\" sessions were criticized in the 20th century for including retired or defeated Members and being dominated by repudiated political parties.

These \"lame duck\" sessions were criticized in the 20th century for including retired or defeated Members and being dominated by repudiated political parties. Efforts to shorten the four-month presidential transition and eliminate time limits on the short session faced opposition in the House of Representatives throughout the 1920s. Proponents argued that the changes would prevent obstructionism and filibusters, while opponents feared it would eliminate a politically salubrious \"cooling off period\" after elections. The opponents of extending congressional sessions in the 1920s feared that it would lead to perpetual sessions and abuse of legislative power. They believed that a \"cooling off period\" after elections was necessary to prevent the negative effects of the passions generated during the campaign. In 1932, a bipartisan coalition proposed an amendment to Congress, which included provisions such as ending the terms of the President and Vice President on January 20 following an election, and terms of Representatives and Senators ending on January 3. Congress would meet annually on January 3 unless a different day was appointed by law. If the President-elect died, the Vice President-elect would assume the presidency. Congress could also address vacancy or deadlock issues in the contingent election process. The Twentieth Amendment, ratified in 1933, aimed to address vacancy or deadlock issues in the contingent election process. It also shifted the responsibility of counting electoral votes and declaring election results to the newly elected Congress. The effective dates for the legislative branch and the President and Vice President were in 1935 and 1937, respectively. The Republican Party regained control of Congress in 1946 and proposed term limitations for the presidency in 1947 due to President Roosevelt's unprecedented 12 years in office. The Republican Party proposed term limitations for the presidency in 1947, following President Roosevelt's 12 years in office. Supporters argued it was to prevent excessive power concentration, while opponents viewed it as undemocratic. A prominent journalist called the amendment an act of retroactive vindictiveness against Roosevelt. In 1947, the Republican Party proposed presidential term limits following President Roosevelt's 12 years in office. Two approaches emerged: a single six-year term or a limit of two four-year terms. The House quickly approved H.J.Res. 27 on February 6, 1947. The House approved H.J.Res. 27 on February 6, 1947, with a vote of 285 to 121, largely along party lines. The resolution had bipartisan support with votes from 47 southern Democrats. Senate consideration of the amendment proceeded at a slower pace than in the House. The House resolution for the amendment required ratification by ad hoc state conventions instead of state legislatures. The Senate removed these provisions but added clarification on the number of times a Vice President succeeding to the presidency could be elected. The Senate passed a resolution allowing a Vice President who becomes President in the latter two years of a predecessor's term to be eligible for two full terms, totaling 10 years of service. If the Vice President serves more than two years of a predecessor's term, they may only be elected to a single subsequent term. The resolution was supported by 16 Democratic Senators and all 43 Republicans, with 23 Democratic Senators voting against it. There was no evidence of a conference committee meeting to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The Senate passed a resolution allowing a Vice President who becomes President in the latter two years of a predecessor's term to be eligible for two full terms, totaling 10 years of service. The House accepted the Senate's amendments to H.J.Res. 27 on March 21, proposing an amendment limiting the number of terms a person can serve as President. The amendment was ratified by Minnesota on February 27, 1951. The Twenty-Second Amendment was ratified on February 27, 1951, and became effective on March 1 of the same year. It has applied to six Presidents who were elected twice to the Presidency, including Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Richard Nixon, who resigned from office, was also covered by the amendment. Two Presidents who succeeded to the presidency have been covered by the amendment's provisions for succession to their predecessors' uncompleted terms. The Twenty-Second Amendment limits a President to two terms in office. Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded to the presidency after JFK's assassination and could have been elected to two full terms. Gerald R. Ford, who succeeded Nixon, was only eligible for one full term. The amendment also raises the question of whether a two-term President could later serve as Vice President and potentially succeed to the presidency again. The issue of whether a former two-term President could succeed to the presidency from other positions in the line of presidential succession was raised during discussions of the Twenty-Second Amendment in 1960. This scenario questions if a former President could potentially become Chief Executive from positions such as Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, or Cabinet positions as outlined in the Presidential Succession Act. This question was initially raised in relation to President Eisenhower and later concerning former President Barack Obama. Some argue that the Twelfth Amendment may prevent a former two-term President like Barack Obama from serving as Vice President or succeeding to the presidency from other positions in the line of succession. Others believe that the Twelfth Amendment only applies age, residence, and citizenship qualifications to the Vice President, not eligibility to serve as President. The Twenty-Second Amendment may only restrict eligibility for election, not service as President. The Twenty-Second Amendment may only restrict eligibility for election, not service as President. Legal scholars argue that a former President could succeed to the presidency from various positions in the line of succession, such as Speaker of the House or Cabinet officer. The Twenty-Second Amendment may restrict eligibility for election, not service as President. Legal scholars suggest a former President could succeed to the presidency from positions in the line of succession. The Constitution Annotated supports this interpretation but notes untested issues. The Amendment bars only the election of two-term Presidents, allowing someone who served two terms to become President through succession. The Twenty-Second Amendment restricts eligibility for election, not service as President. Legal scholars suggest a former President could succeed to the presidency from positions in the line of succession. The Amendment bars only the election of two-term Presidents, allowing someone who served two terms to become President through succession. The House Judiciary Committee considered making former two-term Presidents ineligible to hold the office of President, raising questions about their eligibility for other positions like Vice President or Speaker of the House. The Succession Act of 1792 addressed the issue of presidential succession, filling a gap in constitutional procedures. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment established procedures for filling vacancies in the vice presidency. Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson commented on the issue in 1960, stating it may be unlikely but not unconstitutional. The Act of 1792 addressed presidential succession by authorizing temporary replacements until a special election. The vice presidency was not included in the succession acts of 1881 and 1947, leading to 14 instances of vacant vice presidential office between 1809 and 1965. Vacancies ranged from 67 days to 47 months. During the 1950s, Congress considered proposals for presidential disability following President Dwight Eisenhower's health issues. Hearings were held in 1958 and 1959, but no action was taken. Senator Birch Bayh took over leadership on succession and disability reform after Senator Kefauver's death in 1963. The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 led to the proposal of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which addressed presidential succession and disability. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded Kennedy, but the Vice President's office remained vacant for 14 months until Senator Hubert Humphrey was elected in 1964. Concerns arose about potential successors due to age and health issues. Senator Bayh introduced a constitutional amendment after President Kennedy's death to address presidential succession, vice presidential vacancies, and presidential disability during the Cold War. The proposal included provisions for the Vice President to become President in case of the removal, death, or resignation of the President. Section 2 of the constitutional amendment addresses the vacancy of the Vice President's office, requiring the President to nominate a successor confirmed by Congress. Section 3 outlines the process for the Vice President to serve as Acting President if the President declares disability. Section 4 details the steps for the Vice President and Cabinet to declare the President incapacitated, with provisions for the President to resume duties if no inability is confirmed. The proposed constitutional amendment outlines procedures for declaring presidential disability. If the Vice President and a majority of either the Cabinet or the Vice President and a disability review body dispute the President's message, Congress decides with a two-thirds vote needed to sustain the Vice President's judgment. Section 4 generated controversy for its detailed provisions on disputed presidential disability. The proposed constitutional amendment outlined procedures for declaring presidential disability, with controversy arising over the method of addressing disability in the amendment. Senator Everett Dirksen advocated for Congress to handle disability procedures through legislation, but his amendment was rejected. The Senate passed S.J.Res. 1 without Dirksen's amendment, followed by House passage of H.J.Res. 1. The amendment was proposed to the states on July 6 and quickly ratified, with Nevada becoming the 38th state to do so. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment was ratified on February 10, 1967, with Nevada being the 38th state to do so. It was declared in effect on February 23 of the same year. Sections 1 and 2 of the amendment, regarding presidential and vice presidential term and tenure, have been implemented since then. In 1974, President Richard Nixon resigned, and Vice President Gerald R. Ford became President without incident. Section 2 of the amendment has been implemented twice since its ratification. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 and has been implemented twice since then. In 1973 and 1974, the provisions of Section 2 were invoked due to the Watergate scandal and the resignation of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. In 1973, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned and pleaded \"no contest\" to tax evasion charges. President Nixon nominated Representative Gerald Ford to be Vice President, activating Section 2 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. Senate hearings began on November 1, 1973. Rules Committee hearings began on November 1, 1973, and continued until the committee voted unanimously to report the nomination favorably to the full Senate on November 20. The House Judiciary Committee opened its first session on November 15, and on November 29, the committee voted 30-8 to report the nomination favorably to the full House. The Senate confirmed Ford as Vice President on November 27 by a margin of 93 to 2, and the House confirmed him on December 6 by a vote of 387 to 35. Ford took the oath as Vice President before a joint session of Congress in the House chamber the same day. On August 9, 1974, Richard Nixon resigned as President due to the Watergate scandal, leading to Gerald Ford becoming President. Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President on August 20. Congressional hearings on Rockefeller's nomination were delayed due to legislative business and the reelection campaigns of committee members. Governor Rockefeller's complex personal finances also contributed to the delay. The Senate hearings for Nelson Rockefeller's nomination as Vice President were conducted in two parts due to his complex personal finances. The Rules Committee and Judiciary Committee both voted to report the nomination favorably, leading to a somewhat anticlimactic floor debate. The Senate ultimately confirmed Rockefeller with a vote of 90 to 7. The Senate confirmed Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President with a vote of 90 to 7.
