    "content": "The core of a thermonuclear weapon, known as a \"pit,\" is made of weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu), specifically plutonium-239 (Pu-239). Production of pits at the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado ceased in 1989, with only 29 pits made in the US since then. The Department of Defense (DOD) requires the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to have the capacity to produce 50 to 80 pits per year. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico is designated for pit production, potentially using smaller structures connected to the main building. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 directed NNSA to demonstrate the capacity to produce 80 pits per year by 2027. This report focuses on meeting that requirement by ensuring enough Material At Risk (MAR) and space for production. MAR is the amount of radioactive materials available for processing, measured in Pu-239 equivalent (PE). Space refers to the laboratory floor space for plutonium operations. Margin is used to measure the space available for pit production and supporting tasks. The report focuses on ensuring enough Material At Risk (MAR) and space for pit production to meet the requirement of producing 80 pits per year by 2027. The Radiological Laboratory-Utility-Office Building (RLUOB) near PF-4 houses most of the analytical chemistry (AC) functions. Available space and MAR figures exist, but the required figures for producing 80 pits per year have not been calculated rigorously. The report presents 16 options to increase margin for production. The report presents 16 options to increase the feasibility of producing 80 pits per year by 2027. Factors such as margin, cost, schedule, throughput, and safety will be considered in the decision-making process. NNSA needs a capacity to manufacture 50 to 80 pits per year, and a second shift at Los Alamos could increase pit-manufacturing capacity by 60%. Equipment to produce 50 pits per year with a single shift might meet the 80-pit requirement with less cost and space. Adding a second shift at Los Alamos could increase pit-manufacturing capacity by 60%, but it may strain equipment and reduce maintenance time. Surge production beyond 80 pits per year would be challenging. LANL is located on one side of Los Alamos Canyon, with the Royal Crest trailer park being the closest non-lab structures to PF-4. Structures in the city of Los Alamos are about 6,000 feet away from PF-4. Royal Crest is the location of the maximally-exposed offsite individual (MEOI) for PF-4, receiving the highest radiation dose from an accident. Relocating the MEOI could allow for an increase in Material-At-Risk (MAR) at PF-4, potentially at a lower cost than new construction. NNSA calculates that reducing the dose to the MEOI would permit increasing MAR in PF-4. NNSA calculates dose to an MEOI from an accident at PF-4 using computer models, considering factors like plutonium release, atmospheric conditions, and accident scenarios. Changes to accident modeling could involve using different dispersion models, adjusting evacuation procedures, and considering time-of-day factors for particle dispersion. The current model for calculating dose at PF-4 assumes daytime MAR and nighttime dispersion. Harmonizing MAR and time of day could significantly reduce calculated dose, allowing for a higher MAR limit. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board is monitoring safety issues at DOE defense nuclear facilities. LANL management is facing challenges with degraded gloveboxes in PF-4, which have contributed to contamination events. Removing the gloveboxes would reduce contamination risks, free up space, and comply with DOE's MAR limits. There is a tradeoff between removing them sooner or later due to cost considerations. LANL management is considering the removal of degraded gloveboxes in PF-4 to reduce contamination risks and comply with DOE's MAR limits. Dose calculations for accidents are based on conservative values to ensure safety, but extreme conservatism can lead to higher safety costs for nuclear facilities. LANL management is considering removing degraded gloveboxes in PF-4 to reduce contamination risks and comply with DOE's MAR limits. Using mean values for safety analysis is proposed for reasonable conservatism. Bounding values in accident calculations result in significantly higher estimated doses compared to median values. Increasing the MAR ceiling in PF-4 could allow for production of 80 pits per year. RLUOB is well-suited for AC, but DOE regulations restrict its capacity. DOE regulations limit facilities like RLUOB to 26 g of weapons-grade plutonium. Increasing the MAR ceiling could support production of 80 pits per year. Additive manufacturing (AM) is seen as the future of manufacturing, offering time and cost savings, waste reduction, and increased throughput. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers time and cost savings, reducing the risk of error. Congress allocated $12.6 million for AM in the nuclear weapons program. NNSA is developing a strategic plan for using AM to reduce costs at production facilities. AM is being explored for applications in the nuclear weapons complex. Within the last year, over half of the new fixturing at the Kansas City National Security Campus was made using additive manufacturing (AM) processes. AM parts, like tools and fixtures, could enhance pit production by being stronger and lighter than traditionally made tools. This technology allows for quick prototyping and customized tool production, potentially increasing efficiency. Congress is considering the potential applications of AM in pit production. The electrorefining process for purifying plutonium in magnesium oxide crucibles has challenges such as adhesive failure, increased waste production, and the need to break the purified plutonium ring for casting. These issues impact throughput and cost efficiency in pit production. The United Kingdom's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) is developing a crucible to address challenges in the electrorefining process for purifying plutonium. The crucible eliminates the need to break the purified plutonium ring, reducing risks to technicians and radiation exposure. This innovation could increase throughput and support a higher pit production rate. The development of new crucibles for U.S. electrorefining operations is ongoing, with no operational experience yet. Placing plutonium in containers designed to withstand accidents can reduce the risk of material-at-risk (MAR). The damage ratio measures the fraction of plutonium expected to escape, with a lower ratio leading to a reduced MAR. Crediting the reduction in the damage ratio in PF-4's safety analysis can help limit the amount of MAR allowed. The Documented Safety Analysis in PF-4 sets limits on MAR allowed. Containers undergo intense testing to qualify for a certain damage ratio. Newer containers have a lower damage ratio than older ones. Placing plutonium in these containers for storage could reduce MAR on the main floor, but the impact on plutonium processing needs consideration. LANL conducts plutonium analytical chemistry in the CMR building, which is in poor condition and set to halt programmatic activities by FY2019. NNSA plans to move most AC to RLUOB, but it is uncertain if there is enough space and a high enough MAR limit to support pit production. Reducing space and MAR for AC analysis is crucial to support the production of 80 pits per year. Reducing space and MAR for AC analysis is crucial to support the production of 80 pits per year. Analyzing fewer samples per pit could enable fewer pieces of equipment, reduce space requirements and costs, increase throughput, and decrease waste generated. Using less accurate analytic techniques may increase throughput, although there is a concern about a reduction in precision. As pit production rate increases, fewer samples per pit taken during metal production may suffice. The final step in purifying plutonium for use in pits involves electrorefining. An ingot of impure plutonium is placed in a crucible with a salt mixture acting as an electrolyte. Through high temperature and an electric current, purified plutonium is produced along with byproducts. The Pu-salt mixture and heel containing plutonium are dissolved in acid to recover the plutonium. PF-4 has two process lines using hydrochloric acid and nitric acid to dissolve plutonium compounds. Data from electrorefining runs at LANL show 9.2% of plutonium left in the heel, 10.7% stuck to the crucible, and 78.8% purified in the product ring. The possibility of discarding the Pu-salt mixture and heel to reduce burden is considered. The Pu-salt mixture and heel containing plutonium could potentially be discarded to avoid the need for complex recovery processes. This would result in some plutonium loss, but with the U.S. plutonium inventory being surplus to defense needs, it may not be a significant issue. Sending the Pu-salt mixture to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) and converting the heel to plutonium oxide for shipment could streamline the process and potentially support a higher rate of pit production. Congress may need to weigh the costs and benefits of discarding the plutonium. The costs of discarding plutonium include reduced yield, increased time, space, equipment, and worker exposure. Hydrochloric acid processing produces a waste stream that requires further treatment. Using calcium chloride as an electrolyte offers advantages and has been used by LLNL and AWE for over a decade. Using calcium chloride as an electrolyte in the electrorefining process increases plutonium yield. A \"salt scrub\" process can further remove plutonium from the mixture, resulting in minimal plutonium in the waste salt. LANL plans to revisit this method, drawing on LLNL and AWE resources. LANL will initially use sodium chloride and potassium chloride but aims to switch to calcium chloride if successful. This approach could support higher pit production rates. Weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) consists of several plutonium isotopes, with Pu-241 decaying faster than others to produce americium-241 (Am-241). Removing Am-241 is important due to its intense emission of low-energy gamma rays, which can pose a risk to workers handling aged WGPu. Metal chlorination is a process that can effectively remove Am-241. After 50 years, 89% of Pu-241 in newly produced WGPu will have decayed to Am-241. Most U.S. WGPu was produced between 1956 and 1970. After 50 years, most U.S. weapons-grade plutonium produced between 1956 and 1970 will have decayed to Am-241. The average age of plutonium in the DOE inventory is estimated to be about 50 years. Metal chlorination can effectively remove Am-241 from aged plutonium, reducing the risk to workers. Weapons laboratories have certified weapons with pits that are 30 years old and older as acceptable for use in the stockpile. The final run of metal chlorination would reduce worker exposure and eliminate the need for additional runs for WGPu. Pu-241 decays faster than other plutonium isotopes, with uranium forming at a rate of 0.17% after 50 years. The question is whether newly fabricated pits can use unpurified plutonium or if the uranium would affect pit performance. The last year the U.S. made pits for the stockpile was 1989, with plans for a life extension program for the B61 bomb. The newest pit in B61s would be at least 30 years old in 2020. The LEP plans to use existing pits for the B61 bomb and the W76 warhead, without the need for new pits. Studies have shown no evidence of plutonium aging affecting primary performance in a detrimental way for decades. Capacity for pit production could be reduced by allowing a higher uranium content in the WGPu specification. Near net shape casting (NNSC) of hemishells involves pouring molten plutonium between molds with a thinner space, reducing the amount of plutonium needed and machining required. This method may result in a higher reject rate due to less margin for error, but electronic techniques can help align and remove excess material more precisely. LANL and LLNL have conducted research and development on Near Net Shape Casting (NNSC) of hemishells using electronic techniques for precise alignment and material removal. NNSC reduces the amount of plutonium needed for pit production, potentially supporting higher production rates. LLNL has demonstrated NNSC using plutonium die casting, while LANL plans to use gravity feed method if successful. Die casting technology is seen as a promising approach for future pit manufacture. LANL and LLNL have been researching Near Net Shape Casting (NNSC) for pit production. Die casting technology is a promising approach to reduce plutonium requirements. PF-4, operational since 1978, faces increased seismic threat. LANL is strengthening PF-4 against collapse with seismic upgrades, including adding a drag strut to the roof. In 2013, LANL reduced PF-4's MAR limit to mitigate potential dose from collapse and fire. LANL is strengthening PF-4 against collapse by adding a drag strut to the roof and reinforcing columns with carbon fiber. They are also working on strengthening ties between girders and removing combustible material to reduce fire risk. Upgrades to the water delivery system for firefighting are planned. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 provided $1 million for seismic safety upgrades at PF-4 and nearby facilities to reduce plutonium release in case of an earthquake or fire. Plutonium-238 is highly radioactive and used in deep space probes. PF-4 held 1.6 kg of Pu-238 in February 2013, accounting for 24.5% of the building's MAR. Building modules with lab space connected by tunnels is one approach to create more space for pit fabrication in PF-4. NNSA plans to construct modular structures with lab space connected to PF-4 by tunnels to accommodate Pu-238 work and potentially enable pit production. Building one module could free up space in PF-4 for other plutonium work, with each module designed for specific missions to reduce costs and provide valuable lessons for future modules. The NNSA plans to construct modular structures connected to PF-4 to accommodate Pu-238 work and potentially enable pit production. Building modules could reduce costs and provide valuable lessons for future modules. However, there are concerns that design flaws or the need for larger modules could increase costs. Various options are being pursued to manufacture pits at a rate of 80 per year by 2027, but a combination of options will be needed to meet this goal. Congress will need to evaluate and approve any package of options. The NNSA plans to construct modular structures connected to PF-4 for Pu-238 work and pit production. Various options are being considered to achieve a production rate of 80 pits per year by 2027. Congress will need to evaluate and approve any package of options, considering factors such as margin, cost, worker safety, and throughput. Techniques to optimize the package include MAR reduction methods and increasing space margin through different strategies. To boost U.S. pit production capacity towards the mandated 80 pits per year by 2027, cost-effective techniques like a Pu-238 module and conservative dose calculations are being considered. Complex analyses are needed to determine the best options that balance risk and benefits for workers and the public."
