    "content": "The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD or \"Rio+20\") will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from June 20-22, 2012. The conference aims to renew political commitment to sustainable development, assess progress in meeting commitments, and address new challenges. Up to 115 heads of state and 50,000 participants are expected to attend, with a focus on identifying new Sustainable Development Goals and reforming international environmental institutions. No legally binding agreements are anticipated. The conference agenda at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD or \"Rio+20\") includes a focus on environmental institutions such as the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development and the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP). In 1992, the \"Rio\" conference endorsed the objective of sustainable development, leading to the creation of Agenda 21 and the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development. These initiatives aim to achieve economic, environmental, and social development without compromising the needs of future generations. The Rio+20 meeting opened for signature two treaties: the UNFCCC and the CBD. It summarizes the objectives and major issues to be discussed by various stakeholders. The report also outlines US policy towards the conference and possible issues for congressional consideration, including sustainable development and foreign policy. Few Members of Congress are expected to attend. Few Members of Congress are expected to attend Rio+20, with experts anticipating no immediate outcomes. However, elements of any communique may align with U.S. national interests and foreign policy, warranting examination through briefings or hearings. Background documents like the Global Environmental Outlook may offer valuable data on sustainable development discussions outside the U.S. that could inform congressional decision-making. Additional issues related to Rio+20 may also require attention or communication with constituents. There are differences in views on sustainable development between the federal executive and legislative branches in the United States. Some segments of the population express suspicion and opposition to sustainable development, particularly concerning its impact on national sovereignty. Concerns about Agenda 21 have been raised, which may be referenced in the 2012 conference. There is a lack of agreement on the role of sustainable development in the U.S., unlike in much of the world where it is seen as crucial for economic, social, and environmental reasons. Dialogue in Congress on sustainable and green topics may lead to identifying common ground. Stakeholders are increasingly resistant to top-down decision-making by national governments and international entities. There is a shift towards greater inclusion of civil society, local communities, and the private sector in international processes. The broad inclusiveness of Rio+20 may result in a cacophony of messages rather than a clear consensus. The output of Rio+20 may be lengthy and ambiguous, lacking clarity and consensus. Rio+20 is based on the analysis that the sustainable development goals from the 1992 Rio conference have not been met. The fifth Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-5) found progress on only 4 out of 90 goals. Optimists see it as a chance for progress, while others believe it may end in a stalemate. Leaders are expected to adopt practical measures for sustainable development. Rio+20 includes three days of public meetings (Sustainable Development Dialogues), followed by three days of meetings among diplomatic delegations from 193 nations, including many heads of state. Governments outlined three overall objectives for the conference: securing a renewed political commitment for sustainable development, assessing progress and remaining gaps in implementation of sustainable development efforts, and addressing new and emerging challenges. The Rio+20 conference aims to address the objectives outlined by governments, including renewing political commitment for sustainable development, assessing progress, and addressing new challenges. The draft Communique, titled The Future We Want, is still being negotiated with only a quarter agreed upon and discussions ongoing about creating new Sustainable Development Goals and strengthening financing. The Rio+20 conference process includes proposals for a new global environment agency, financing, technology transfer, and capacity building in nations. The main themes are the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and the institutional framework for sustainable development. Discussions revolve around the lack of agreement on the definition of the green economy and its relationship to sustainable development. The green economy is seen as a key element in achieving sustainable development, consisting of economic, social, and environmental pillars. There is debate over whether the emphasis on the economic pillar risks overshadowing social aspects. Rio+20 organizers aim to establish policy options for promoting the green economy and enhancing international cooperation through various practices at community, national, international, and corporate levels. The conference preparations focus on fostering a green economy through diverse approaches and involvement of community, national, international, and corporate actors. There is widespread agreement on the importance of the private sector in sustainable development, with potential outcomes including private deals on renewable energy, pollution control, and water infrastructure. Trade issues such as protectionism, subsidization, and compatibility with WTO rules are also being examined. Participants may discuss the role of essential technologies in environmentally compatible development. At Rio+20, stakeholders may debate the development and dissemination of essential technologies for environmentally compatible development. There is a focus on the institutional framework for sustainable development, with discussions on reforming international processes and institutions. Many support strengthening the U.N. Environment Programme, with proposals to elevate it to a specialized agency of the United Nations or create a world environmental agency under the UN for stronger regulatory and compliance measures. Some proposals at Rio+20 include expanding UNEP membership to all countries, creating a new Council for Sustainable Development in the UN, strengthening regional councils, and involving the public in decision-making for sustainable development. There are also discussions about developing Sustainable Development Goals to succeed the MDGs. Participants propose that Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could provide a framework for sustainable development beyond 2015. There is disagreement on the specific language and applicability of SDGs to all countries. Wealthier countries stress the importance of rapidly developing economies, while lower-income countries argue for greater assistance. Contention remains on integration and other key areas. Areas of contention in the development of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include integration of social, economic, and environmental pillars, concerns about prioritizing social and economic aspects, and the unresolved process of developing SDGs. G-77 countries prefer an inter-governmental process, while others suggest guidance from an office or agency. Priorities for SDGs are still being debated among delegations. Delegations diverge on priorities for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The United States opposes including \"equity\" and \"sustainable production and consumption\" in priority areas. Only two SDGs were agreed upon ad referendum: SDG 1 and SDG 2. The MDGs are seen as a useful tool for focusing on specific development gains. The importance of sustainable development goals based on Agenda 21 and JPOI, respecting the Rio Principles and international law, addressing all dimensions of sustainable development, and integrating them into the United Nations Development Agenda beyond 2015. The fifth Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-5) highlights the lack of significant progress in achieving internationally agreed sustainable development goals. Despite some success in areas like deforestation reduction, overall environmental challenges have not decreased in scope or speed over the past five years. The GEO-5 report highlights challenges in achieving sustainable development goals, including deteriorating air quality, rising greenhouse gas concentrations, depleting groundwater reservoirs, and loss of biodiversity. These issues are most acute in rapidly developing low-income countries lacking the capacity to address them. The GEO-5 report emphasizes the need for improved monitoring of environmental and related processes to inform decision-making. It suggests best practices for environmental governance, such as multi-level/multi-stakeholder participation and strategic environmental assessment. The report also calls for better access to data, public participation, and capacity strengthening of all actors. The U.S. interest in sustainable development and security issues related to freshwater in the international context is discussed in relation to the Rio+20 event and negotiations. Water's role in achieving poverty, health, and climate objectives is generating discussions at U.N. conferences, despite not being the focus of recent international negotiations. International freshwater issues are a priority, with attention to water indicators and progress assessments. The rising attention to international freshwater issues as a security concern is highlighted in a 2012 Intelligence Community Assessment. Water is seen as critical to political stability, food and energy supplies, and climate change mitigation. The report warns that water stress could lead to instability in nations important to U.S. national security interests. Some U.S. decision makers and stakeholders are considering actions to influence the future role of water in international security, with Rio+20 seen as an opportunity. The \"zero draft\" of the Communique for Rio+20 emphasized the right to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right, in line with the 2010 UN Declaration. It also supported goals for wastewater management and a renewed commitment to integrated water management. The curr_chunk discusses the necessity of setting goals for wastewater management and proposes a renewed commitment to integrated water resources management and water efficiency plans. It also mentions the potential development of Sustainable Development Goals by 2015 to supplement or replace the current MDGs. Additionally, there are proposals for specific water targets and discussions on water-related issues in various background documents. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address water and sanitation issues, including elevating water to its own goal and giving more attention to sanitation. The United States submitted views on sustainable development for the next twenty years, emphasizing clean energy, urbanization, water systems, and sustainable manufacturing. The United States submitted views on sustainable development for the next twenty years, focusing on Access for All, Urbanization, Water Systems, Sustainable Manufacturing, and Human Capacity. The U.S. vision includes elements like Ecosystem Management, Rural Development, Modernizing Global Competition, and Strengthening International Environmental Governance. The specific positions on Rio+20 proposals are not clearly stated, but some views can be inferred from statements. The United States opposes adding a Council on Sustainable Development to the U.N. architecture, making UNEP a specialized agency of the United Nations, discussing intellectual property rights, and new funding for sustainable development. They encourage actions by stakeholders, emphasize transparency and public awareness, and resist commitments related to climate change. The United States opposes commitments related to climate change and other issues addressed in other fora. The United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted the eight Millennium Development Goals in 2000, which are aspirational and not legally binding. The goals include eradicating extreme hunger and poverty, achieving universal primary education, and promoting full and productive employment. The United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted the eight Millennium Development Goals in 2000, which are aspirational and not legally binding. One of the goals is to ensure universal primary education, promote gender equality, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, and ensure environmental sustainability by specific targets. The United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000 established the eight Millennium Development Goals, including ensuring universal primary education, promoting gender equality, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria, and ensuring environmental sustainability. Additional goals include integrating sustainable development into country policies, improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation, enhancing the lives of slum dwellers, and developing a global partnership for development. This involves creating an open, rule-based trading system, addressing the needs of developing countries, tackling debt issues, providing affordable essential drugs, and making new technologies accessible."
