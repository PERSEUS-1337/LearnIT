    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are key, along with block grant programs like HOME and CDBG for community development. Other specialized grant programs help homeless persons. HUD's specialized grant programs assist homeless persons, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for home buyers with low downpayments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus funds from FHA have been used to offset HUD's budget costs, which also receives emergency supplemental funding. Recent allocations include $20 billion for Hurricane Katrina recovery and over $13 billion from the 2009 economic stimulus legislation. Total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years are shown in Table 1. Total enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years, including emergency funding, have increased by about 40% since 2002. The growth rate has been fluctuating, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year since FY2006. However, the trend reversed in FY2011 with a decrease of nearly 11% compared to the previous year. Adjusting for inflation, HUD's budget grew by about 15% over a 10-year period. HUD's funding grew by about 15% over a 10-year period, with most of the growth occurring in FY2009 and FY2010. The funding is made up of regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets, with programs funded mainly through regular annual appropriations. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters. HUD's funding is provided outside of regular appropriations acts, often through emergency supplemental spending bills. Congressional appropriators face limits on new non-emergency discretionary funding, which can be managed by providing less in regular annual appropriations or finding offsets. These offsets include rescissions of unobligated balances and offsetting receipts from fees paid by HUD partners. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by new appropriations, offsets, rescissions, receipts, and collections. This net budget authority is the \"cost\" of the HUD budget as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Despite an increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002 to FY2011, there are important trends masked by this overall increase. Between FY2002 and FY2010, HUD's net non-emergency budget authority increased by 57%, with regular annual appropriations growing by only 37%. Offsetting receipts and collections decreased by more than 70% and rescissions by 96% during the same period. This trend was reversed in FY2011 when Congress cut appropriations and available offsets. In FY2011, HUD's funding was cut by 11% compared to FY2010, with regular appropriations only reduced by about 4%. The difference in the cut is due to a 43% increase in offsets. The growth in regular appropriations was mainly driven by HUD's Section 8 programs, which saw a 77% increase from FY2002 to FY2011. In FY2011, HUD's funding was cut by 11%, with regular appropriations reduced by about 4%. Section 8 programs accounted for over 60% of HUD's regular appropriations, with funding growing while other HUD programs declined. Appropriations for Section 8 programs combined grew by nearly 80% from FY2002 to FY2011, but growth rates varied between tenant-based and project-based rental assistance. Appropriations for Section 8 programs, specifically the project-based rental assistance (PBRA) program, grew by 75% from FY2005 to FY2011. This growth was largely due to renewing old project-based Section 8 contracts funded in the 1970s and 1980s. The Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) program, or Housing Choice Voucher program, saw a smaller growth of about 24% during the same period. Offset receipts declined by about 70% between FY2002 and FY2010. In FY2011, offsetting receipts from FHA increased to over $4 billion, the highest level in a decade, due to FHA's increasing market share and policy changes. This increase reversed a trend of declining offsetting receipts from FHA. In FY2011, FHA offsetting receipts reached over $4 billion, the highest in a decade, due to market share growth and policy changes. The final CR of the 111th Congress extended funding for HUD programs and FHA mortgage limits through FY2011. Congress then approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government until March 18, 2011, maintaining FY2010 funding levels for HUD programs except for the Community Development Fund. In April 2011, Congress approved short-term CRs to extend funding for HUD programs through P.L. 112-6 and P.L. 112-8 before enacting the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10). This act provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for HUD, maintaining some programs at FY2010 levels while reducing funding for others and increasing funding for Section 8 programs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012 (H.R. 2112, P.L. 112-55) signed into law on November 18, 2011, provided $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 11% from FY2010. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, with a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to increased offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012 provided $37.3 billion in net funding for HUD, a 9% decrease from FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported an FY2012 THUD funding bill with $3 billion less in net budget authority and $1.3 billion less in regular appropriations for HUD compared to FY2011. The Minibus, S.Amdt. 738 to H.R. 2112, included FY2011 appropriations for agencies under the THUD subcommittee's jurisdiction. The FY2012 THUD funding bill for agencies under the jurisdiction of the THUD subcommittee was approved by the full Senate on November 1, 2011. The bill included about $3 billion less for HUD than in FY2011 and $4 billion less than requested by the President. The President's budget request for FY2012 included nearly $47.9 billion in gross new appropriations for HUD. The President's request for net new budget authority for HUD in FY2012 totaled over $42 billion, after accounting for rescissions and offsets. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, funded through tenant-based rental assistance, is the largest program administered by HUD. It provides funding for the annual renewal of 2 million vouchers and administrative costs for PHAs. The President's budget requested over $19.2 billion for Section 8 vouchers in FY2012, an increase of over $800 million from FY2011. The requested amount was intended to fund existing vouchers and create new ones for homeless veterans, families in the child welfare system, and collaborative demonstrations for homeless and at-risk families with children and disabilities. The President's budget requested over $19.2 billion for Section 8 vouchers in FY2012 to fund existing vouchers and create new ones for homeless veterans, families in the child welfare system, and collaborative demonstrations for homeless and at-risk families with children and disabilities. P.L. 112-55 provides $18.9 billion for tenant-based rental assistance, with $17.2 billion for voucher renewals. Despite appearing higher than FY2011, $650 million was rescinded from the advance appropriation for FY2012, resulting in $18.3 billion available for the TBRA account in CY2012, with $16.6 billion for voucher renewals. The law directs HUD to reduce funding allocation to PHAs with excess. The law directs the Secretary of HUD to reduce funding allocation to PHAs with excess balances in their reserve accounts, known as net restricted assets (NRA), to spend down reserves equivalent to the rescission. This funding mechanism has been used in prior years, with the Senate bill proposing a similar strategy. The public housing program provides rental units for very low-income families and is HUD's oldest housing assistance program. Public housing, the third-largest funded program in HUD's budget, receives federal funding through three accounts to support over 1 million units owned by more than 3,100 public housing authorities. Funding is provided for ongoing maintenance, utilities, administration, capital projects, and modernization needs. HOPE VI is a competitive grant program that also provides funding. The HOPE VI program provides funding to demolish and redevelop distressed public housing, focusing on mixed-income communities. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a 14% reduction in public housing operating funding, with a plan to offset funding allocations to PHAs with large reserves. This would result in PHAs with reserves receiving less than 80% of their eligible funding, while those without reserves would receive more. The President's FY2012 budget proposed a 14% reduction in public housing operating funding, with a plan to offset funding allocations to PHAs with large reserves. PHAs without large reserves would receive more than 80%, forcing certain PHAs to spend down their reserves. The proposal was opposed by PHA industry groups, who argued that reserves are important assets and that the proposal punishes well-managed PHAs. HUD argued that in a limited funding environment, this strategy ensures higher funding levels for PHAs without reserves. The final FY2012 HUD funding law matches the Senate-passed appropriations bill, with operating fund funding at the President's requested level. The law includes authority to reduce funding to PHAs with large reserves, capped at $750 million. The President's budget requested $2.4 billion for public housing capital funding, a 4% decrease from FY2010 but a 19% increase from FY2011. HUD acknowledges that capital funding alone may not meet the backlog of needs in public housing. The final FY2012 appropriations law provides less than $1.9 billion for the capital fund, matching the Senate proposal but exceeding the draft House bill by over $200 million. The President's budget for FY2012 requested no new funding for HOPE VI, instead proposing $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a program aimed at revitalizing distressed public housing. The FY2012 appropriations law provides $120 million for Choice Neighborhoods, with $80 million designated for public housing. The law also limits the use of funds for PHA staff salaries. The FY2012 appropriations law limits funding for PHA staff salaries above level IV of the federal Executive Schedule. The President's budget requested changes to HUD's rental assistance programs, including broadening the definition of \"extremely low-income\" and revising deductions for elderly or disabled families. The FY2012 appropriations law did not include proposed policy changes to HUD rental assistance programs, such as increasing the standard deduction and allowing recertification of fixed-income families every three years. President Obama's budget requested funding for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative. The \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative proposed in the FY2011 budget aims to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs by allowing property owners to leverage outside resources. The $200 million requested would transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance. In FY2012, HUD proposed the initiative be treated as a demonstration called the \"Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD)\" to convert public housing units to long-term Section 8 contracts or project-based Section 8 vouchers. The FY2012 appropriations law includes language authorizing a modified version of RAD, allowing up to 60,000 units of public housing and/or Section 8 properties to convert to project-based Section 8 contracts. The law permits HUD to transfer funds to cover conversion costs, but does not include the portability provisions requested in the budget. The FY2012 appropriations law includes a modified version of RAD, allowing public housing and Section 8 properties to convert to project-based Section 8 contracts. The law permits HUD to transfer funds for conversion costs, but does not include the portability provisions requested in the budget. P.L. 112-55 also includes an assisted housing preservation provision allowing project-basing of certain tenant protection vouchers funded through the Community Development Fund (CDF) account. The CDBG program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, provides federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed a total funding level of $3.781 billion for programs funded under the CDF account, representing an 8% increase from the previous year. The budget also suggested restructuring the CDF account by eliminating certain programs not directly related to the CDBG program. This included the elimination of funding for the Neighborhood Initiative (NI) and Economic Development Initiative (EDI) programs, as well as the transfer of Sustainable activities. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed restructuring the CDF account by eliminating funding for certain programs and transferring Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to a new account. The budget requested an 11.5% increase in funding for the CDBG formula component, including grants to insular areas and funding for Indian tribes. Additionally, it sought funds for Rural Innovation Grants and assistance to Guam for community development needs arising from military facility relocations. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed restructuring the CDF account by eliminating funding for certain programs and transferring Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to a new account. The budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, two programs subject to congressional earmarks. The House draft bill recommended $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants to states, local governments, and insular areas; and $35 million for Indian tribes. The subcommittee-approved draft bill would have maintained overall CDF appropriations at the FY2011 funding level, but there were recommendations to eliminate the program in the future. The House draft bill proposed changes to the CDF account, including shifting funding priorities and reducing funding for certain programs like the Sustainable Communities Initiative. It also recommended lowering the percentage of funds grantees could use for administrative expenses. The Senate bill suggested a significant reduction in the CDF account. The Senate bill recommended a substantial reduction in the CDF account, with overall funding declining to $3.0 billion, excluding $400 million for CDBG supplemental disaster assistance. The final FY2012 HUD appropriations law appropriated $3.408 billion for CDF activities, with $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants, about 12% less than FY2011. The FY2012 CDBG formula grants received less funding than appropriated in FY2011, the President's request, and the House recommendation, but slightly more than the Senate recommendation. The act did not include provisions to restrict the use of federal grants for loan repayment or reduce administrative expenses. It does require a study on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs to be completed within 180 days. The FY2012 CDBG formula grants received less funding than appropriated in FY2011. HUD is directed to submit progress reports on grantee accountability and analyze CDBG fund usage for matching fund requirements. $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance is included for recovery efforts in disaster-declared areas. The CDBG program provides $400 million in supplemental disaster assistance for recovery efforts in disaster-declared areas. Eligible states and local governments must submit disaster recovery plans detailing the use of funds. HUD can waive certain provisions governing the use of CDBG funds, except for fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. $100 million is exempt from discretionary spending limits. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to use their annual CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities. They can borrow up to five times their CDBG allocations for qualifying activities, with current and future allocations as security. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million. The Administration proposed increasing the loan commitment ceiling for the Section 108 loan guarantee program from $500 million in FY2010 to $500 million in FY2012. This increase aimed to help local governments finance large-scale projects at a rate slightly above Treasury yields. The proposal included charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The House draft bill recommended $6.8 million in credit subsidies for $275 million in loan guarantee commitments, while the Senate bill recommended $4.960 million in credit subsidies for $200 million in loan guarantee commitments. The Senate bill approved amendments for inclusion in the bill, including S.Amdt. 796 proposed by Senator Coburn. The amendment aimed to prevent grants from being used to repay federal loans, impacting the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported for the third year in a row. P.L. 112-55 maintains the program. The Senate bill approved amendments, including one to prevent grants from repaying federal loans in the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. P.L. 112-55 maintains the Section 108 loan guarantee program structure with $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in commitments. It also prohibits states from diverting proceeds from Section 108 loan guarantee-backed notes to other communities. The Administration requested $150 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative in FY2012, $51 million more than in FY2010. The Administration's FY2012 request for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) was $51 million more than in FY2010. The request included funding for Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants to support sustainable development efforts in metropolitan areas. The Administration requested $40 million for Community Challenge Grants to promote sustainable growth and discourage inefficient land use patterns. $10 million was requested for research on the benefits of sustainable communities and improving technical capacity. These initiatives were to be administered through the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD. The House draft bill did not include funding for the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI), while the Senate bill recommended $90 million for SCI activities, $60 million less than requested by the President. P.L. 112-55 did not specify an appropriation for SCI activities, but noted they could be funded through CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program provides block grant funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income households. The HOME program provides funding for affordable housing for low-income and very low-income households. Since 1992, it has supported nearly 979,000 housing units and rental assistance for 234,000 families. The proposed budget for FY2012 was $1.65 billion, with the House bill allocating $1.2 billion and the Senate bill allocating $1 billion. The Senate bill for the HOME program allocated $650 million below the President's budget request and included provisions related to fund expenditure. Concerns were raised about mismanagement of funds in a Washington Post article, leading to proposed reductions. HUD's oversight of HOME funds was questioned in a 2009 OIG report, prompting calls for improvement. HUD defends its oversight, stating that block grant programs delegate responsibility to participating jurisdictions. The HOME program allocation in P.L. 112-55 includes $1 billion for HOME program funding, with provisions for expenditure to participating jurisdictions. The Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program provides funds for SHOP, capacity building, and the Housing Assistance Council, benefiting low-income families through sweat equity and volunteer-based homeownership programs. The President's FY2012 budget proposed eliminating SHOP funding, redirecting it to capacity building. HUD's FY2012 Congressional Budget Justification highlighted SHOP activities as options for states and participating jurisdictions. The House draft bill and the Senate bill both provided funding for SHOP, with the final enacted law allocating $13.5 million for SHOP. Capacity building was funded within the SHOP account. The primary federal funding for housing for homeless individuals and families is through HUD Homeless Assistance Grants. The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act consolidated Homeless Assistance Grants in the 111th Congress. The Act created the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program and the Continuum of Care (CoC) program, with an option for rural communities to apply separately through the Rural Housing Stability (RHS) grant program. The ESG program funds emergency needs and prevention activities, while the CoC program focuses on longer-term housing and services for the homeless. Congress allocated $1.9 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants in FY2012, less than the President's proposed $2.4 billion. In FY2011, $1.9 billion was allocated for Homeless Assistance Grants, less than the President's proposed amount for FY2012. The funds appropriated in P.L. 112-55 are for new programs authorized by the HEARTH Act, with $250 million designated for the ESG program and nearly $1.6 billion for the CoC and RHS grants. HUD has been directed to implement the new grant programs as soon as possible, with draft regulations for the ESG program already released. HUD has not released regulations for the CoC program yet. Additional funding for homeless veterans in FY2012 is provided through the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. Congress has funded Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans since FY2008, with $75 million appropriated in P.L. 112-55 for an additional 10,000 vouchers. The President's budget also proposed funding these vouchers at $75 million. The budget proposed $57 million for a demonstration program to provide vouchers for homeless individuals with health issues and families with children. The House draft bill and P.L. 112-55 did not include the demonstration. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing Section 8 contracts between HUD and property owners to subsidize low-income families' rent. No new contracts have been entered into since the 1980s. The project-based rental assistance program, which funds Section 8 contracts between HUD and property owners, has grown to become the second-largest account in HUD's budget. The President's budget request includes a $165 million increase in funding for this program to renew contracts that now require new appropriations. The final appropriations law for FY2012 funds the account about $100 million below the requested level, reflecting revised estimates of need provided by HUD. The House and Senate bills proposed funding levels close to the requested amount for the Section 202 and Section 811 Supportive Housing programs, which provide capital grants and rental assistance for elderly and disabled residents. HUD has funded over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and over 30,000 units of Section 811 housing. The Section 811 program historically funded tenant-based vouchers for persons with disabilities, with approximately 14,811 vouchers currently funded. The Housing for the Elderly budget includes funding for Section 202 housing, Service Coordinators, and the Assisted Living Conversion Program. Congress reduced funding for Section 202 and related programs by $24 million in FY2012, from $399 million to $375 million. Within the FY2012 appropriation, $91 million is reserved for Service Coordinators and $25 million for the Assisted Living Conversion Program. In FY2012, $232 million is allocated for the Section 202 program to renew rental assistance contracts and potentially provide assistance to new tenants. There is not enough funding for new housing units. Congress appropriated $165 million for the Section 811 program, an increase from the previous year. Total funding for housing units authorized through the Section 811 program also includes Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance. In FY2012, the Section 811 program received $165 million in funding, with an additional $112 million allocated for the renewal of Section 811 vouchers through the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account, totaling $277 million. In FY2012, $165 million was allocated for the Section 811 program, with an additional $112 million for renewing Section 811 vouchers through the Section 8 account, totaling $277 million. The funds can also be used for a new rental assistance program in conjunction with other subsidized housing. No funds are available for new construction or rehabilitation of units. The House draft bill and the President's budget request both proposed $310 million for housing programs, including Section 811 and Section 8 accounts. This funding would support the creation of new Section 811 units and provide grants for housing counseling services such as homeownership counseling and mortgage delinquency counseling. In recent years, congressional appropriations for HUD's housing counseling program had been increasing, partly in response to increased mortgage default and foreclosure rates. However, in FY2011 Congress did not provide any funding for HUD's housing counseling program, reflecting concerns over distribution time and potential duplication of services. In FY2011, Congress did not fund HUD's housing counseling program, despite increased mortgage default rates. Proponents argue for funding restoration due to the program's broader counseling scope compared to NeighborWorks funds limited to foreclosure counseling. The President's FY2012 budget requested $88 million for HUD's program, while the House draft bill included no funds. The House draft bill did not allocate funds for HUD's housing counseling program, while the Senate bill proposed $60 million to be awarded within 120 days. P.L. 112-55 ultimately included $45 million for housing counseling, with the same 120-day award requirement. Additional funds have been provided to NeighborWorks America for foreclosure mitigation counseling. For more information, refer to CRS Report R41351 on Housing Counseling. NeighborWorks America, a nonprofit corporation, provides foreclosure mitigation counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). It receives annual appropriations separate from NFMCP funding. In FY2012, P.L. 112-55 allocated $80 million for NFMCP. In FY2012, P.L. 112-55 allocated $80 million for the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), $15 million more than in FY2011. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgage loans to make credit more accessible and affordable. Borrowers pay fees for FHA insurance through two program accounts in the HUD budget. The FHA insurance program includes the MMI Fund for single-family home loans and the HECM program for reverse mortgages. The MMI Fund has historically had a negative subsidy rate, generating more fees than claims paid out. The MMI Fund historically generates more fees than claims paid out, not needing an appropriation from Congress to operate. It is divided into Purchase and Refinance risk category and HECM risk category, with estimated negative subsidy rates for FY2012. The FHA's MMI Fund is estimated to have a negative credit subsidy of about $5 billion in FY2012, with increased demand for FHA-insured mortgages due to tighter lending standards in the private market. Despite higher loan volumes and improved credit quality of newer mortgages, the default rate on FHA-insured loans remains high, especially for loans originated in earlier years. The default rate on FHA-insured loans is high, particularly for loans originated in earlier years, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% within 10 years of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act of 1990. The ratio fell below 2% in FY2009 and continued to decline, reaching 0.24% in FY2011. FHA made changes in FY2010 to increase its capital reserves. In FY2010, FHA implemented changes to boost capital reserves, including raising borrower premiums and strengthening underwriting criteria. The FY2012 HUD Budget Justification proposed another increase in FHA insurance premiums, which took effect in April 2011 to further enhance capital reserves. P.L. 112-55 also reinstated higher loan limits for FHA in certain areas, based on area median home prices. Loan limits are capped by a national floor and ceiling, impacting low-cost and high-cost areas. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 temporarily raised FHA loan limits in response to the housing downturn. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established new statutory limits based on area median home prices. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 specified loan limits in different areas. The FHA loan limits were set at the higher of ESA or HERA limits through 2009, with extensions until FY2011. P.L. 112-55 reinstated higher limits through 2013. Changes affect high-cost areas and areas with varying home price trajectories. The Budget Control Act of 2011, signed by President Obama, includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit through discretionary spending caps and sequestration. If spending caps are exceeded, funding for all agencies must be reduced proportionally. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aims to reduce the federal deficit through discretionary spending caps and sequestration. HUD's discretionary programs are not exempt from sequestration. The BCA also established a deficit reduction \"super committee\" to find additional savings, but its failure led to automatic sequestration in FY2013. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, automatic sequestration will occur in FY2013 if the desired $1.2 trillion in savings is not achieved through reduced discretionary budget caps for FY2014-FY2021. The annual budget resolution sets spending and revenue parameters for Congress and provides allocations to House and Senate committees for appropriations bills. Each subcommittee is responsible for a specific appropriations bill. The House and Senate budget committees began considering the FY2012 budget resolution after receiving the President's budget. The House Budget Committee reported its FY2012 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 34) on April 6, 2011, with a target completion date of April 15. The budget resolution provides allocations to subcommittees for appropriations bills, setting parameters for funding decisions. The House passed its FY2012 budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 34) on April 15, 2011, with the THUD subcommittee receiving $47.7 billion, a 15% decrease from FY2011. Section 408 of the resolution could impact HUD's budget by changing how FHA receipts are scored, potentially requiring appropriations instead of generating $5 billion in offsetting receipts as estimated. The Senate Budget Committee did not consider an FY2012 budget resolution but used the FY2012 discretionary spending cap and procedural provisions of the BCA as an alternative. The Senate allocated $57.3 billion for THUD for FY2012, higher than the House allocation under H.Con.Res. 34. The Senate allocated $57.3 billion for FY2012 THUD, higher than the House allocation under H.Con.Res. 34, and this higher Senate allocation was used for conferencing on the final FY2012 THUD appropriations law (P.L. 112-55)."
