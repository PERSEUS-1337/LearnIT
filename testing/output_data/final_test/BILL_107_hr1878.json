    "content": "The Act titled \"National Family Farm Dairy Equity Act of 2001\" provides direct payments to dairy producers based on annual milk marketings. The National Family Farm Dairy Equity Act of 2001 provides direct payments to qualified producers for milk marketed in the US. Payments are $0.50 per hundredweight, limited to 2,600,000 pounds or producers' total milk production. Producers must enter into an agreement to limit milk marketings based on their base milk production history. The base milk production history for a farm is determined by the average annual quantity of milk produced and marketed for commercial use in the previous two calendar years. Adjustments are made based on the percentage change in the demand adjustment factor for the previous year. New producers without a production history for the previous two calendar years are also considered. The Secretary establishes a production base for a farm based on its dairy operation size. The demand adjustment factor for a farm is calculated based on the base production history and changes in milk consumption and population. If annual milk marketings exceed the permitted quantity, repayment is required. The Secretary requires producers to repay all payments made under the agreement, including interest. Payments do not count towards the farm limitation. Repayments are made quarterly during the calendar year. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO DAIRY PRODUCERS TO OFFSET LOW MILK PRICES. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to milk pricing, including average milk price, Class I, Class II, Class III, and Class IV milk under Federal milk marketing orders. The Secretary will make payments to producers on a farm if the average milk price is below the target price of $12.50 per hundredweight for milk with 3.50 percent butterfat, regardless of whether they market their milk within the Federal milk marketing order system. Payments will be made to producers on a farm if the average milk price is below the target price, regardless of whether they market their milk within the Federal milk marketing order system. The payment amount is calculated based on the difference between the target price and the average Class III and Class IV milk prices, multiplied by the percentage of milk used for each class. The payment limitations for producers under this section include a maximum of $50,000 per farm per calendar year and a quantity limitation based on the producers' average monthly production. The payment limitations for producers include a maximum of $50,000 per farm per calendar year and a quantity limitation based on average monthly production, which can be determined using the production from the previous calendar year, the current calendar year, or an appropriate production base. New producers without a production base from the previous year will have the quantity limitation based on current monthly production only. Payments must be made by the 21st day after the end of the month. SEC. 4. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\nThe Secretary will implement the Act without increasing payments for farm reconstitution. The Act will be funded and administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation. It will be effective from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2006. A report analyzing the Act's impact on farm income, milk production, prices, and costs will be submitted to Congress within three years of enactment."
