Criminal investigations include financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, and computer fraud. The protection mission involves safeguarding the President, Vice President, their families, former Presidents, major candidates, the White House, and foreign missions in DC. Additionally, the Service is responsible for security activities beyond its mandated assignments. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) is responsible for security activities such as National Special Security Events (NSSEs) and has a focus on legislation related to financial and computer crime investigation mission activities. Legislation in the 113th Congress includes bills on cyber privacy security and information technology security. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee addressed security breaches at the White House, including a perimeter breach and an incident where a private security contractor was allowed to share an elevator with President Obama. The committee questioned if protection procedures, training, funding, personnel shortages, or morale contributed to these breaches. The U.S. Secret Service faced security breaches at the White House, including an incident where a private security contractor shared an elevator with President Obama. The USSS Director resigned the following day. The report discusses potential policy questions for Congress regarding the Service's mission, organization, history, and statutory authorities. Appendices list direct assaults on Presidents and statutes addressing USSS activities. Since 1865, USSS has evolved into a federal law enforcement agency within DHS. The U.S. Secret Service, now under the Department of Homeland Security, has expanded its original mission of investigating currency counterfeiting to include criminal investigations into financial crimes. The agency's history includes investigations into the Ku Klux Klan and counter-espionage activities during World War I. Today, the Secret Service also operates a forensic services division. The USSS's forensic services division analyzes evidence like documents, fingerprints, and credit cards to aid investigations. They also run a Criminal Research Specialist Program for intelligence analysis and provide technical assistance to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The USSS has a history of protecting presidents since 1894. The USSS has a history of protecting presidents since 1894, with protection activities expanding over the years. Authorized individuals for USSS protection include the President, Vice President, President- and Vice President-elect, their immediate families, former Presidents and their spouses, former Presidents' children under 16, and visiting heads of state. In 2008, USSS protected a spouse of a former President who was a presidential candidate and a Vice President not running for his party's nomination. The USSS protection mission has evolved over the years to include not only agents as \"bodyguards\" but also advance security surveys, coordination with local enforcement, and intelligence analysis. Protection is provided to Presidents, Vice Presidents, their families, former Presidents and their spouses, children under 16, visiting heads of state, and major presidential candidates and their families. The USSS protection mission has expanded to include advance security surveys, coordination with local enforcement, and intelligence analysis for various high-profile individuals. Congress has allocated approximately $1.6 billion annually for USSS operations, with distinct budget authority for the \"Investigation Mission\" and \"Protection Mission.\" Since the transfer to DHS, statutes authorizing Treasury Secretary involvement in USSS responsibilities have been affected by informal decisions and congressional actions. The DHS Secretary now assumes functions previously held by the USSS, with Congress passing laws to address the Service's role and responsibilities. In 1806, the Enforcement of Counterfeiting Prevention Act allowed for investigation and prosecution of counterfeiters, later transferred to the Department of Treasury in 1860. Congress also passed laws to regulate U.S. currency and increase sanctions against counterfeiters. In 1863, the National Currency Act was passed to regulate U.S. currency and increase sanctions against counterfeiters. The Treasury Secretary directed the Office of the Solicitor of Treasury to investigate counterfeiting. By 1865, a significant portion of U.S. currency in circulation was counterfeit, leading to the establishment of the Secret Service Division (SSD) to restore public confidence in the money of the country. The SSD's main responsibility was to investigate counterfeiting, forging, and altering of U.S. currency and securities. The Secret Service Division (SSD) was established in 1865 to investigate counterfeiting, forging, and altering of U.S. currency and securities. The SSD's mission expanded in 1889 to include espionage activities during wars, and in 1894, it informally acquired the protection function at the request of President Grover Cleveland. In the early 1900s, the Secret Service Division (SSD) expanded its mandate to investigate land fraud in the western United States. Congress continued to authorize the Treasury Secretary to direct and use the SSD to detect and arrest individuals violating counterfeit laws. In 1948, the SSD was also authorized to investigate crimes against various financial institutions. Congress amended the Service's investigation mission from 1950 to 1984, including funding for confiscating counterfeit currency due to the rise of financial crimes involving computers and electronic devices. In 1984, Congress authorized the USSS to investigate credit card and computer fraud. In the 1990s, laws were amended to allow investigations of crimes against financial systems, including those involving federally insured financial institutions. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made international counterfeiting a crime. Laws were also enacted regarding telemarketing fraud and identity theft. Following the enactment of laws related to telemarketing fraud and identity theft, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. This act authorized the establishment of nationwide electronic crime task forces by the Secret Service to combat computer-based crimes. Additionally, the Secret Service began protecting President Grover Cleveland in 1894 and provided limited protection to President William McKinley during and after the Spanish-American War. Following the assassination of President McKinley in 1901, the Secret Service was asked to protect the President. In 1907, Congress allocated funds for this purpose, and in 1908, the protection mission was expanded to include the President-elect. President Theodore Roosevelt transferred some agents to the Department of Justice in 1908, laying the foundation for the FBI. Congressional authorization for protecting the President and President-elect began in 1913, with increased threats during World War I leading to a law in 1917. In 1917, a law was passed making it a crime to threaten the President, and Congress authorized the Secret Service to protect the President's immediate family. The White House Police Force was established in 1922 to secure and patrol the Executive Mansion and grounds in Washington, DC. In 1930, Congress mandated that the White House Police Force be supervised by the Secret Service. In 1943, Congress appropriated funding for investigating and protecting against counterfeiting and other crimes, as well as protecting the President, President-elect, and their families. In 1951, Congress permanently authorized the \"U.S. Secret Service\" to protect the President, his immediate family, the President-elect, and the Vice President. In 1963, legislation was enacted to provide protection for Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy and her children for two years after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1965, Congress authorized permanent protection for former Presidents and their spouses. In 1965, Congress authorized permanent protection for former Presidents and their spouses, extending protection to their children until age 16. The protection of former Presidents' widows and minor children was deferred until 1967 and became permanent in 1968. Following the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, the Treasury Secretary was authorized to determine which presidential and vice presidential candidates should receive Secret Service protection. An advisory committee was established to assist the Treasury Secretary in determining which candidates could receive USSS protection. The committee included key political figures and was involved in expanding the protection mission, renaming the White House Police Force to the Executive Protection Service (EPS) in 1970. Congress authorized the USSS Director to administer the EPS's protection of various entities as directed by the President. In 1977, Congress expanded the Secret Service's protection mission to include foreign diplomatic missions, visiting heads of foreign states, and other distinguished foreign visitors. They also authorized protection for United States' official representatives on special missions abroad and established criminal penalties for obstructing agents. Additionally, protection was extended to the Vice President's immediate family, and regulations were set in the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976. In 1976, the Protection Assistance Act (P.L. 94-524) regulated USSS protection for specified individuals. Congress expanded protection to presidential and vice presidential candidate spouses in 1976, and to specified federal officials and their families in 1977. Former Vice Presidents and spouses were added in 1982, and a consolidated list of individuals eligible for protection was enacted in 1984. Temporary residences of the President and Vice President could also be protected if occupied. The 1994 legislation amended 18 U.S.C. Section 3056, identifying all Secret Service protectees. Protection for former Presidents and spouses was limited to 10 years post-office. Presidential directives affected the list of protectees, including protecting spouses of visiting foreign heads of state. Any protectee can decline protection except for specific high-ranking officials. The Treasury Police Force merged into the Secret Service Uniformed Division in 1986. President Clinton addressed terrorist threats with Presidential Decision Directive 62 in the late 1990s. President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 62 (PDD 62) in the late 1990s, establishing a framework for federal counter-terrorism programs. PDD 62 designated specific federal departments and agencies as lead agencies in the event of terrorist attacks, with the USSS taking a leadership role in operational security for events of national significance. The Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 authorized the USSS to coordinate security at National Special Security Events, including presidential inaugurations and major international summits. It also established the National Threat Assessment Center to assist law enforcement agencies with threat assessment training and research. The Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011 amended 18 U.S.C. 17522, making it a crime for unauthorized individuals to enter a building secured by the USSS. Congress may consider the optimal mission of the USSS, including investigation and protection, and whether current resource allocation efficiently achieves both missions. The protection mission of the USSS, which began in 1906, received 63% of the agency's funding in FY2014, totaling $920 million. This mission employs the majority of agents and resources, with most congressional action focused on it. The costs associated with increased protection for individuals, events, and facilities may explain this allocation. The Secret Service's protection mission has seen an increase in funding, with a focus on protecting individuals, events, and facilities. Congressional actions have expanded the Service's role in providing protection, such as the enactment of the Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008. This highlights Congress's interest in enhancing the Service's protection capabilities. The Secret Service's protection mission has expanded due to increased terrorist threats and the need for enhanced protection activities. The transfer of the USSS to the DHS reflects a response to the evolving terrorist threat. Congress may consider establishing a single or distinct primary and secondary mission for the USSS in light of these threats. The Secret Service's protection mission has expanded due to increased terrorist threats. Congress has raised concerns about the Service's dual missions of protection and investigation. Some argue for an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the Service's training in both areas. There are debates on whether the Service should focus solely on protection or also investigate financial crimes. In 2012, the USSS faced an increased protection workload, including safeguarding presidential candidates and preparing for potential presidential transitions. The Secret Service's protection mission has expanded due to increased terrorist threats. In 2012, the USSS faced an increased protection workload, including safeguarding presidential candidates and preparing for potential presidential transitions. Former USSS Director Sullivan mentioned that candidate protection began in November 2011, with increased protection resulting in agents being reassigned from investigation missions. The USSS has a history of investigating financial crimes and protecting senior officials, but has recently focused more on cybersecurity and protection activities due to events like the 9/11 attacks and wars in Iraq. The Secret Service's protection mission has evolved in response to events like the 9/11 attacks, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and evolving technology in crimes. The Service has had to balance increasing costs and protectees, especially during presidential campaign election years. Presidential safety has been a concern throughout history, with examples like threats to Abraham Lincoln and breaches of security at White House events. The breach of Secret Service security at a White House State Dinner in 2009 was attributed to a \"human error\" by personnel. Despite media reports, there was no increase in death threats to President Obama compared to previous presidents. Legislation in 1917 made it a crime to threaten the President, but the extent of threats remains uncertain due to security classification. Since 1906, the Secret Service has protected Presidents, with seven assaults occurring, resulting in one death (President John F. Kennedy). Ten Presidents have been victims of direct assaults, with four resulting in death. The concern for presidential safety is genuine due to the number of attempted and successful assaults against Presidents."
