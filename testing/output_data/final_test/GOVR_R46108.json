    "content": "Congress has a long-standing interest in ensuring access to broadband internet service in rural areas through federal subsidies. Despite billions of dollars injected into rural broadband markets, over 20 million Americans still lack access as of 2019. Stakeholders and experts believe that federal spending has not considered local conditions that affect demand for broadband in rural areas, potentially hindering private-sector investment and federal efforts to expand service. Many argue that federal broadband programs should focus on increasing demand in underserved areas rather than just infrastructure provision. A study found rural households lag behind urban ones in broadband adoption by 12-13 percentage points, with 52% of the rural-urban gap due to lower adoption rates. The assumption that demand-side issues will resolve with ample supply of broadband has been questioned by experts. The geographic and demographic distribution of rural broadband demand is uneven, with unmet demand in some areas. Factors such as lower wealth, older populations, and lower educational attainment negatively correlate with broadband adoption. Barriers like affordability, perceived value, computer ownership, and literacy persist. Even with subsidies, rural areas may still struggle to attract significant investment in broadband service. This report focuses on the demand for fixed broadband among rural households and small businesses, excluding community anchor institutions. It discusses the role of schools and libraries in providing broadband access and training to rural residents. Additionally, it explores broadband-enabled services like telemedicine and precision agriculture that may encourage rural adoption. The report discusses the demand for broadband in rural households and small businesses, federal programs to promote broadband adoption, and options for Congress. 60 million Americans live in rural areas, which make up 3% of the U.S. land mass but contain over 80% of the population. The report highlights the geographical concentration of fixed broadband network infrastructure in urban areas, such as Huntington Beach, CA, where broadband providers pay rent for access to utility poles and city-owned fiber-optic cable. This concentration benefits areas with favorable economic conditions, while rural areas face challenges in broadband access. In rural areas, the cost of providing broadband service may exceed the return on investment, requiring government support. Some rural markets are attractive due to unique characteristics, while others are less commercially viable. A growing rural-urban broadband market divide is predicted by long-term demographic trends. According to a 2018 USDA analysis, rural areas have seen improvements in unemployment, incomes, and poverty rates, with more people moving to densely settled or scenic rural areas near cities. However, sparsely settled and remote areas face economic challenges. Demographic trends, geography, and economic context impact broadband demand in rural areas, affecting infrastructure investment by providers and raising questions about federal assistance distribution. Adoption rates for broadband service in rural areas are influenced by the valuation households and small businesses place on internet access. Studies show that rural households, which tend to be older, less educated, and less wealthy, have a lower willingness to pay for broadband compared to urban households. This disparity in valuation is attributed to factors such as knowledge of computers, computer ownership, and perceived relevance of the internet. Rural households, less wealthy than urban counterparts, show lower willingness to pay for broadband. Some low-income households don't subscribe even when offered for free. Despite challenges, some rural residents go to great lengths to access the internet. A 2010 study found respondents willing to pay $45 extra for fast internet speeds. The 2010 study found that most consumers value basic internet access at speeds adequate for everyday use, but are only willing to pay a small amount extra for very fast speeds suitable for gaming and high-definition movies. Consumers with higher levels of broadband connectivity and belonging to wealthier, better-educated demographic groups are more willing to pay for very fast service. The FCC conducted field experiments to understand broadband demand among low-income households for the Lifeline program. A 2015 report showed that most participants were willing to pay $3 more for moderate broadband speeds, but only one out of 118 was willing to pay $10 more for faster speeds. The Lifeline program is undersubscribed despite reducing costs for consumers. A 2014 study found that two-thirds of respondents would not consider adopting broadband at any price, with non-adopters being disproportionately rural. The remaining one-third expressed interest in adoption, citing price and availability as main barriers. Rural respondents were more likely to be interested despite making up a large share of non-adopters. A 2012 study on broadband usage among Kentucky farmers revealed that younger, better educated, higher earning households with internet experience were more likely to adopt broadband. The study also found that a 10% increase in subscribership among those who considered price as a factor would require a 15% average price decrease. Additionally, it showed that a 45-year-old producer earning over $50,000 on a 750 acre farm was willing to pay $171.42 for local infrastructure buildout for broadband access, while a 63-year-old producer with a smaller farm and lower income was less likely to subscribe to broadband even when available. The Kentucky Department of Agriculture reported a demographic shift among farmers towards younger producers, potentially increasing demand for broadband service expansion in rural areas. Small businesses prioritize broadband access more than residential households, but willingness to pay varies within the sector. The 2010 study sponsored by the Small Business Administration found that broadband is crucial for U.S. small businesses, with a 90% adoption rate. Both rural and urban businesses see high-speed internet as essential for achieving strategic goals and improving competitiveness. The study found that non-agricultural rural businesses were less likely to have their own website and unwilling to pay more for improved service compared to urban businesses. Despite increased internet access in rural areas, small businesses still prioritize basic functions over advanced online capabilities. Many small rural businesses prioritize basic online functions like listing their name and location on internet searches, with few utilizing high-bandwidth advanced business applications. A 2017 study in North Carolina revealed that most rural businesses have limited web presence, with over half using their websites solely for basic business information. Despite having broadband access, rural businesses lag behind urban counterparts in utilizing websites, e-commerce, and social media for business support. Broadband advocacy groups suggest that new applications and web development strategies may increase demand for improved service over time, especially in healthcare and knowledge-intensive sectors. Business location and type can significantly influence the need for higher-speed broadband, with rural businesses primarily focusing on basic online functions. A study by the Central Coast Broadband Consortium found that local businesses in the Monterey Bay area have significant data and file transfer needs. Rural broadband markets are highly localized, with varying conditions affecting deployment and adoption. Investment in rural markets with little internet usage history is seen as high-risk. Investment in rural markets with little internet usage history is considered high-risk for broadband providers. Subsidies may lower financial risk, but providers still prefer low-risk, high-return projects. Merit Network, Inc. highlighted the challenges faced by broadband providers in nascent rural markets, emphasizing the importance of accurately estimating adoption rates and building a solid financial model for repayment and sustainability. Urban areas may be more profitable for telecommunications companies. \"Rural areas are less attractive markets for telecommunications companies due to lower returns on investment compared to urban areas. A 2019 report from the Arkansas governor's office identified low broadband adoption rates as a primary barrier to investment, particularly among older demographics.\" The Arkansas report highlighted low Lifeline program enrollment as a barrier to broadband investment, suggesting that increasing adoption rates could attract private companies to invest in infrastructure. Similar findings were reported by the Appalachian Regional Commission in 2015, noting that providers are less likely to serve sparsely populated areas due to lower returns on investment. Federal programs and policies play a significant role in strengthening the business case for broadband deployment. Federal programs and policies, such as those from the USDA and FCC, are crucial for rural broadband market development due to challenging economics. In 2018, these agencies spent $9.1 billion on broadband programs, mainly in rural areas. The USDA's Rural Utilities Service and the FCC's Universal Service Fund are the primary sources of federal funding for rural broadband, focusing on infrastructure deployment and affordability initiatives. The USDA and FCC provide crucial federal programs and policies for rural broadband market development. These include affordability initiatives for low-income households, rural healthcare providers, and schools. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) offers assistance programs like the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, Community Connect Grant Program, and ReConnect Program to finance broadband deployment in rural areas. Legislative authority for these programs comes from the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 and subsequent amendments in farm bills. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Community Connect program and increased funding for the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program to support broadband service in rural communities. The bill also directed improved coordination of federal agency broadband programs and provided technical assistance for applicants. The ReConnect Program was separately funded at $600 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. The ReConnect Program, funded at $600 million through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, includes loans and grants to promote broadband deployment in rural areas with limited access. Other programs like the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program and Distance Learning and Telemedicine grants also support rural broadband deployment. Congress funds these programs annually. In FY2019, Congress allocated funds for various rural broadband programs, including $5.83 million for Rural Broadband Access loans, $30 million for Community Connect grants, $550 million for the ReConnect Program, $1.725 million for Telecommunications Infrastructure loans, and $47 million for DLT grants. The Universal Service Fund (USF) was established by the FCC in 1997 to support telecommunications services through fees from carriers, not annual appropriations. The FCC receives fees from telecommunications carriers for interstate service, which it can spend without congressional appropriations. The FCC's supply-side support for broadband infrastructure, mainly through the USF High Cost program, totaled nearly $14 billion from FY2016 to FY2018. This program includes funds that support broadband deployment in high-cost areas, ensuring comparable service rates with urban areas. The subsidy indirectly benefits households and businesses by offering below-market subscription rates. The USF programs include Lifeline, Schools and Libraries, and Rural Health Care, which subsidize broadband plans and equipment purchases for eligible institutions. Broadband providers have discretion in participating in these programs, with investment behavior influenced by demand and return on investment. The federal government can adjust funding levels to encourage participation within the existing legislative framework. The FCC adjusts funding programs to promote private-sector investment in rural areas for broadband services. It reviews data speed benchmarks annually, with debates on whether benchmarks should be aspirational or reflect market demand. Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act requires yearly reports on deploying advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans. The FCC determines advanced telecommunications capability and aims to accelerate its deployment by removing barriers and promoting competition in the market. Since 1999, 11 Section 706 reports have assessed broadband deployment, with the FCC setting minimum data speeds for broadband service. In 2015, the FCC raised the minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed to 25 Mbps. The FCC raised the minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, which has sparked policy debates on regulatory roles and broadband expansion. Stakeholders emphasize market demand for improved service in FCC's annual Section 706 determinations. The FCC increased the minimum fixed broadband speed to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps during the Obama Administration to keep pace with consumer behavior and bandwidth needs. Stakeholders argued for higher speeds due to increased demand for high-quality video content online. Some opposed the move, citing lack of demand for faster service and costly fiber-optic installations. Some criticized the FCC for subsidizing infrastructure buildout under one standard, which was then superseded by a new higher standard. Commissioner Ajit Pai argued that consumer preference should drive broadband definition, with 71% of consumers choosing not to purchase fixed 25 Mbps service. Pai has maintained the 25/3 Mbps standard as meeting the Telecommunications Act requirement. Concerns were raised by broadband providers about increasing speed requirements beyond 25/3 Mbps. The Free State Foundation argues against changing the 25/3 Mbps standard, stating it would burden providers unnecessarily. Rural co-ops and independent providers advocate for a higher speed benchmark to receive federal subsidies. Broadband systems funded with limited federal funds should meet the growing speed and data consumption needs of today and into the future. Trade organizations have avoided discussing speed benchmarks, focusing on issues like mobile broadband substitutability. FCC data shows higher adoption rates of 100/10 Mbps in less rural counties compared to 25/3 Mbps in more rural counties. The data shows higher adoption of the current standard of 25/3 Mbps in less rural counties compared to more rural ones. There is a debate about whether the investment in fiber internet is justified, as most internet uses do not require its speed and capacity. Providers argue that even when broadband is available, customers do not subscribe as expected. The authors advocate for measures to promote broadband affordability and adoption, as customers often do not subscribe even when broadband is available. The RUS and USF High Cost programs aim to expand broadband availability in underserved areas, with funding awarded based on ISP commitments. The RUS programs offer loans that recipients must repay, requiring a financial forecast to demonstrate project feasibility and sustainability. The RUS programs prioritize buildout to unserved or underserved areas over subscription rates or other business performance metrics. Priority is given to applicants proposing to offer broadband service to households without an incumbent service provider. The RUS programs prioritize projects based on tiers ranging from 25% to 100% of unserved households. Loan terms can be up to 35 years with a 4-year principal deferral for areas with at least 50% unserved households. The ReConnect program offers grants and loan-grant combinations, with priority given to Substantially Underserved Trust Areas like tribal lands. Reviewers use a points-based system to evaluate applications based on criteria like population density and the number of farms, businesses, and educational facilities served. The FCC's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) prioritizes broadband buildout in areas without a private sector business case for deployment. USF programs require providers to offer broadband service in their service areas at rates comparable to urban areas. Census blocks are used to determine eligibility for support. The FCC's Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) aims to expand broadband coverage in underserved areas by providing support to providers. The program prioritizes buildout in areas without a private sector business case for deployment, focusing on higher data speeds and usage allowances. Concerns have been raised about providers lacking incentives to aggressively market their services or stimulate demand beyond profitable areas. The FCC has concerns that providers may limit RDOF subscribers to sell capacity to more profitable non-RDOF subscribers. They propose introducing subscribership milestones for RDOF recipients to address this issue. The FCC is considering introducing subscribership milestones for RDOF recipients to ensure broadband providers meet subscription goals in rural areas. Private sector participation in rural broadband programs is a concern for both the FCC and USDA. Federal programs aim to stimulate demand for broadband in underserved areas through various initiatives, including end-user subsidies. The FCC's Lifeline program targets broadband adoption by residential subscribers with end-user subsidies for those earning less than 135% of the federal poverty level. Enrollment rates vary by state, with an average of 28% of eligible beneficiaries receiving support for monthly service charges. The Lifeline program supports broadband adoption for low-income residents through end-user subsidies. The program indirectly assists subscribers by providing support to their chosen service providers. Proposed changes by the FCC in 2017 aimed to restrict resellers from participating, potentially reducing enrollment by 70%. Concerns were raised about low-income subscribers being priced out if minimum service standards were updated in 2019. The FCC's 2019 decision to increase monthly data minimums for Lifeline subscribers raised concerns about low-income individuals being priced out of the market. NTCA\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Rural Broadband Association warned that subscribers may be forced to upgrade to higher speed tiers they can't afford. Despite retaining the existing subsidy level, the FCC reduced the minimum data from 8.75 to 3 gigabytes, citing provisions from the 2016 Lifeline Order. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) is a grant program funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, providing approximately $4 billion for broadband infrastructure, public computer capacity expansion, and broadband adoption programs. Administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA), BTOP aims to encourage sustainable adoption of broadband service. BTOP awarded $3.48 billion for infrastructure buildout, $201 million for public computer centers, and $250.7 million for sustainable broadband adoption. NTIA continues to monitor existing grants. A 2015 GAO report identified affordability, lack of relevance, and lack of computer skills as barriers to broadband adoption. Outreach, training, and discounts were suggested as key approaches to address these barriers. NTIA has not assessed the effectiveness of grantee best practices in addressing adoption barriers. The FCC's E-Rate Program provides discounts for broadband to schools and libraries. Some believe that increasing internet access can help non-adopters subscribe to at-home service. However, a study found that increasing internet-accessible computers in libraries did not significantly increase residential broadband adoption rates. The USDA's DLT grants fund end-user equipment. The USDA's Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grants fund end-user equipment and broadband facilities for rural communities to use telecommunications for education and healthcare. Eligible applicants include entities in rural areas providing education or health care through telecommunications. The FCC Rural Health Care Program offers similar benefits to eligible healthcare providers in rural areas. Providers may receive a 65% discount on broadband service costs. The USDA's DLT grants fund end-user equipment and broadband facilities for rural communities for education and healthcare. Rural counties with limited medical care access also lack broadband internet access. A 2018 USDA study found that rural residents use telehealth services less than urban residents, even with broadband availability. The study found a usage gap between rural and urban patients in online health research, maintenance, and monitoring. Cost was closely linked to usage rates, with online health research being the most used due to its low cost and accessibility. Lack of internet service at home did not deter everyone from conducting online health research. Rural connectivity was sufficient for health maintenance activities, but acceptance and remuneration levels by the health insurance industry and government were cited as impediments to online health monitoring implementation. Some industry groups argue that subsidized broadband buildout can promote telehealth use, including new applications like virtual reality and wearables. Regulatory issues, such as varying state Medicaid reimbursement regulations, may hinder telehealth implementation. The 2018 farm bill established a task force to review connectivity and technology needs in precision agriculture. The task force aims to promote broadband Internet access on unserved agricultural land, but adoption of precision agriculture methods has been slow due to concerns over costs and complexity. The 2018 farm bill authorizes initiatives for precision agriculture research and development, but does not address end-user affordability. Despite bipartisan support for universal broadband access, adoption lags in rural areas, impacting private sector investment. Congress could consider options to address rural broadband demand issues. The FCC's Lifeline program aims to address broadband affordability for low-income households through changes to provider eligibility rules and minimum service requirements, sparking debate. Congress may oversee rulemaking or direct FCC actions through legislation, focusing on beneficiary eligibility, ISP requirements, and oversight authorities. The current benefit is $9.25 per household, with additional benefits for tribal land residents. In addition to connectivity costs, issues include ISP eligibility and shared oversight between federal and state governments. Cost barriers may hinder rural broadband demand for services like telehealth and precision agriculture. Congress should consider further research on these factors and ways to overcome them. Federal support for broadband education is mainly through housing and education grant programs. Grant recipients often spend the majority of funds on non-broadband-related categories, which are central to housing development and education goals. Congress may need to consider a focused grant program for broadband-enabled applications to improve rural adoption of technology and small businesses' use of broadband technology. The use of broadband technology in rural areas can be improved through education on web-based applications and telehealth services. Federal programs rely on private-sector providers for infrastructure buildout, requiring attractive conditions for participation. Taxpayer value-for-money is a policy concern with wide-scale broadband adoption. The current RUS program rules heavily favor applicants proposing to build infrastructure in remote, underserved areas, which may not have a strong business case. Congress may seek to change end-user subsidy programs or adjust program rules to encourage investment in broadband buildout projects. The FCC rules for broadband providers focus on ensuring service availability at specific speeds and latency benchmarks within designated areas. Congress may consider legislative changes to incentivize ISP investments in broadband adoption, such as adjusting subsidy terms or service quality metrics. Service quality metrics for broadband providers are debated as part of FCC's Section 706 responsibilities. Higher requirements may enhance technological leadership but could increase costs for providers and customers, potentially impacting rural broadband adoption. Congress must weigh the costs and benefits of proposed service requirements."
