    "content": "The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 imposed higher efficiency standards for light bulbs in the United States. More than 4 billion incandescent light bulbs are currently in use, despite their low energy conversion rate. Lighting accounts for 20% of electricity consumption in the U.S., with residential lighting alone representing 14% of usage. The Department of Energy predicts a 33% reduction in household lighting energy use by 2020 due to the new standards. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandated higher efficiency standards for light bulbs in the U.S., aiming to reduce energy use for lighting per household by 33% below 2009 levels by 2020. The law did not ban incandescent bulbs but required new bulbs to be 25%-30% more efficient. Energy-efficient alternatives like CFLs and LEDs are expected to gain market share. After the implementation of EISA, incandescent bulbs are projected to remain widely available and used for years to come. Higher-efficiency halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the law's standards are already on the market. The total number of light bulbs purchased annually is expected to decrease as product lifespan increases. However, there is controversy surrounding the lighting provisions of EISA, with opponents arguing against the government mandating the type of light bulbs consumers should buy. Previous conservation efforts using CFLs have had limited success due to concerns about light quality. Consumers have expressed concerns about the small amounts of mercury in compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) and the initial higher cost of CFL or LED bulbs compared to incandescent bulbs. Some states, like Texas and South Carolina, have debated legislation to allow the sale of incandescent bulbs that do not meet federal standards. Governor Rick Perry signed a bill in Texas to continue the sale of incandescent bulbs produced in the state. Arizona also passed a similar bill in 2010, which was vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer. In 2010, Arizona passed a bill similar to Texas to allow the sale of incandescent bulbs that do not meet federal standards, but it was vetoed by Governor Jan Brewer. California implemented EISA standards early with no significant consumer complaints. The House passed an amendment in 2011 to prohibit DOE from enforcing incandescent light bulb standards, which was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act signed by President Obama. The Burgess amendment prohibits the use of DOE funds to enforce lighting standards, with limited impact as major companies plan to comply. The funding limitation does not affect the ability of other agencies to enforce the law. Repealing EISA provisions could hinder energy conservation and next-generation products like LEDs. The lighting industry is experiencing a revolutionary change with the rise of LED products, which are more energy-efficient and allow for customizable lighting options. Venture capital is flowing into companies developing LEDs, with projections that LEDs could make up half of the global lighting market by 2020. The technology also has potential for communication and other applications. The Obama Administration opposed efforts to repeal EISA, emphasizing the importance of energy conservation and next-generation products like LEDs. The Obama Administration opposed repealing EISA, as the U.S. lighting industry has lost manufacturing to Asian countries due to production costs. LED technology offers new manufacturing opportunities, with access to investment capital. Public policy could stimulate demand and provide research and startup assistance. EISA imposes higher efficiency standards for light bulbs, with tighter standards for different wattages implemented on specific dates. Manufacturers and importers must comply with the new standards, but existing inventory can still be sold. The law also includes standards for candelabra and intermediate base bulbs, with enforcement delays for some types. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 set higher efficiency standards for various types of light bulbs, such as fluorescent tube lighting and incandescent reflector bulbs. The law also directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to consider more stringent standards for general service, screw-in light bulbs by 2020, with a minimum efficiency level of 45 lumens per watt. The lighting industry has been preparing to meet these standards since January 2012. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 set higher efficiency standards for light bulbs, including halogen incandescent bulbs which are about 25% more energy-efficient than traditional incandescent bulbs. These bulbs retail for about $1.50 each on average. Halogen incandescent bulbs retail for about $1.50 each on average, compared to 50 cents for traditional incandescent bulbs. Some halogen bulbs last three times longer, while others last about the same. Total cost may be equivalent to traditional bulbs over the product's life. Compact fluorescent bulbs are 75% more energy-efficient and last 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. CFLs have struggled with consumer acceptance due to issues with light quality, lifespan, and size. Compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) have improved in shape and light color, with some now compatible with dimmable fixtures. They can cost from $0.50 to $9.99 each, offering lower operating costs and longer lifespan. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are even more energy-efficient, with estimated savings of 75%-80% compared to incandescent bulbs. LEDs have a lifetime of 50,000 hours. LEDs have a lifetime of 50,000 hours or more, with some products available in stores. However, they have not replaced incandescent bulbs due to higher costs. Prices for LED bulbs can be up to $20 each, but are falling. Retailers and the DOE are providing consumer information on LED bulbs. The FTC crafted a new packaging label for light bulbs, resembling a nutrition label, providing information on brightness, yearly cost, product life, light color, and mercury content. The focus is on lumens rather than wattage. Analysts note the label does not help consumers compare wattage on new products to former products easily. The Energy Information Administration estimates that in 2010, residential and commercial consumers used about 507 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity for lighting, with residential lighting consuming about 207 billion kWh and commercial users accounting for nearly 300 billion kWh. Some analysts worry that consumers may opt for higher wattage-equivalent bulbs to increase brightness, potentially undermining energy savings. In 2006, manufacturing lighting accounted for 2% of total U.S. electricity use. Incandescent bulbs were used for 85% of household lighting, while fluorescents were predominant in the office, commercial, and industrial sectors. Conventional incandescent bulbs provided 12% of total light in the U.S. in 2009. The $11 billion U.S. lighting industry includes companies producing light bulbs, parts, and fixtures for various uses. Major international companies manufacturing lighting in the U.S. include Philips Lighting, GE, and Osram Sylvania. Leading lighting fixture and equipment manufacturers are Hubbell Lighting, Cooper Lighting, Juno Lighting Group, and Acuity Brands. The U.S. lighting industry, including companies like Hubbell Lighting, Cooper Lighting, Juno Lighting Group, and Acuity Brands, has seen a decline in output and employment over the past few decades due to competition from abroad, particularly from China and Mexico. Companies like GE have closed U.S. factories that produced incandescent bulbs due to global competition and changing energy standards. The consolidation in the industry has been ongoing, with GE announcing plant closures in the United States and Brazil in 2007. Demand for traditional incandescent bulbs has been declining, leading to overcapacity and inefficiencies in manufacturing. Large lighting manufacturers like Osram Sylvania and GE are refitting or opening facilities to produce more competitive products, such as halogen incandescent bulbs. GE has invested $60 million to expand a facility in Ohio for increased fluorescent lighting production. Philips and GE are also manufacturing components for halogen incandescent bulbs in the United States. Lighting manufacturers like Philips are producing components for halogen incandescent bulbs in the United States. Imports of light bulbs have significantly increased, with China being the largest importer. China has become the world leader in CFL production, raising concerns about quality control. The NEMA, representing 95% of U.S. lighting manufacturers, endorsed federal light bulb standards in 2007 to stay competitive and reduce uncertainty as states and foreign governments considered imposing stricter regulations. China is working on improving product safety controls, including oversight on hazardous substances like mercury. A public-private partnership is promoting U.S. LED manufacturing. In 2007, California passed AB 1109 requiring a 50% increase in efficiency for residential lighting by 2018. Other countries like Australia, the European Union, and Canada have also upgraded their lighting standards. NEMA supported federal light bulb standards in 2011, while some industry officials and a lighting designer opposed them, citing concerns about energy savings, consumer costs, and freedom of choice. DOE predicts that the standards will reduce energy use. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) lighting provisions are expected to reduce energy use and save costs for consumers. Forecasts suggest a potential decrease in U.S. primary energy consumption by 21 quadrillion BTU and a decline in greenhouse gas emissions by 330 million metric tons over the next 30 years. Consumer choice of bulbs, influenced by factors like purchase price and product satisfaction, plays a crucial role in achieving these savings. However, widespread acceptance of energy-saving technology, as seen with CFLs, is necessary for significant energy savings to be realized. The promotion of CFLs in the U.S. market since the 1970s led to increased purchases by American consumers, but incandescent bulbs were still predominantly used due to higher prices and concerns about light quality and mercury content. CFL sales declined in 2009 to 272 million units from 397 million units in 2007, possibly influenced by the recession, longer lifespan of CFLs, and consumer reluctance to switch to higher-cost bulbs. The lighting industry has responded to consumer concerns by offering higher-efficiency halogen incandescent bulbs as replacements for traditional incandescent bulbs. These bulbs meet energy-saving requirements and may be preferred by consumers over CFLs. EISA exempts some commonly used incandescent bulbs from efficiency standards, providing more options for consumers. The lighting industry is undergoing a transformation with advances in LED technology. LED bulbs can be much more efficient than incandescent bulbs and CFLs. Solid-state lighting, a semiconductor-based technology, is expected to dominate the market by 2015. LED technology is transforming the lighting industry, with applications in electronics and residential markets. LED prices are falling, with projections of further cost reductions. By 2024, general use LED bulbs could cost as low as $5. LED technology is rapidly advancing, with major companies like Philips Lighting, GE, and Osram Sylvania investing in the market. U.S.-based manufacturers like Cree and Philips Lumileds hold a significant portion of worldwide LED production. The North American LED bulb market is expected to grow to over $11 billion by 2015 due to stricter lighting efficiency standards. Global LED production is projected to reach $18 billion by 2015, with major manufacturing nations including the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The industry also sees advancements in OLED technology for commercial electrical appliances. The lighting market is expected to integrate more as LED usage expands, according to the Department of Energy. The ultimate value of SSL is in the development of integrated luminaires that serve a particular function. Fixtures and replacement lamps must be designed for LED light sources to avoid poorly performing products. Consumer acceptance of LEDs may face barriers due to variations in product performance, with China's manufacturing capacity leading to issues with light quality and lifetimes. The outlook for U.S. manufacturing is uncertain. The outlook for U.S. manufacturing in the LED industry is uncertain, with China and other countries offering incentives to attract companies. The rapid technological changes and availability of materials like rare earth minerals are key factors affecting profitability. China is a major player in LED production and a key supplier of materials needed for LEDs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 aims to support U.S. LED manufacturing. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created the Next Generation Lighting Initiative to support LED technology research and development. DOE is funding LED manufacturing projects to reduce costs and improve products. A report by the National Academy of Sciences in 2013 highlighted limitations in LED and OLED efficiency and performance due to materials issues. Breakthroughs in technology and manufacturing are needed to create high-efficiency LED-based luminaires and lamps at affordable prices. Breakthroughs are required to develop LED-based lighting products with high efficiency and lower costs than fluorescent fixtures. Policy recommendations include increasing DOE's SSL program, seeking 50% cost sharing for manufacturing projects, and evaluating the effectiveness of lighting efficiency incentives. DOE utilized funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for LED manufacturing R&D to enhance domestic efficiency and prevent the loss of technological expertise and jobs to other countries. Efforts also include improving LED consistency and quality through the CALiPER program. The Commercial Building Tax Deduction Program provided incentives for energy-efficient lighting until 2013. The Commercial Building Tax Deduction Program incentivized energy-efficient measures, including lighting equipment, until 2013. Green building, focusing on LEED criteria, is a rapidly growing sector. The lighting industry has invested heavily in meeting EISA requirements and advancing LED technology. Concerns exist about the industry's rapid technological changes, government mandates on consumer choices, and potential job losses. Congress has a history of involvement in energy efficiency. The recent lighting standards mandated by Congress, along with tighter standards in other countries, are driving increased demand for more efficient products globally. The lighting industry has developed products meeting EISA efficiency standards, such as halogen incandescent bulbs, available at a similar price to conventional bulbs. Consumers will have more choices when purchasing replacement light bulbs. The recent lighting standards mandated by Congress are driving increased demand for more efficient products globally. U.S. manufacturers have been moving operations overseas for decades to capture lower production costs. Industry officials are calling for an expanded federal-business effort to build LED fabrication facilities and increase domestic capacity. EISA exempts 22 types of traditional incandescent bulbs from energy-efficiency standards. DOE will monitor sales of exempted products to ensure compliance with energy conservation standards. If sales of any exempted lamp type double, DOE must establish a standard for that bulb type. This provision aims to prevent exempted products from taking market share from bulbs affected by new efficiency standards. The text chunk mentions the use of specific types of lamps with wattage restrictions and length specifications."
