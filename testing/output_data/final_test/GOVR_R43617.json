    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding for agencies in three federal departments and related agencies. Title I funds Department of the Interior agencies, Title II funds the Environmental Protection Agency, and Title III funds agencies in other departments and related entities. Regular FY2015 appropriations for these agencies were not passed before the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2015. Before the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2015, regular FY2015 appropriations for Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies were not enacted. Continuing appropriations were provided under the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 (CR), with agencies receiving funding at the FY2014 level minus a 0.0554% reduction. The CR provided appropriations through December 11, 2014, with subsequent laws extending funding through December 17, 2014. Regular FY2015 appropriations were enacted for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies on December 16, 2014, totaling $30.48 billion. This report gives an overview of FY2015 appropriations levels, comparing requested appropriations with FY2014 levels and discussing appropriations in H.R. 5171 and the Senate Interior Subcommittee recommendations. The report compares FY2015 enacted appropriations with prior years and highlights the complexity of appropriations laws, including large budget requests and numerous funding changes. It does not provide detailed account-level information or discuss agency highlights under different legislative drafts. For FY2015, the President requested $30.69 billion for agencies funded in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations law. The request varied among different agencies, with the DOI agencies receiving $10.86 billion, EPA receiving $7.89 billion, and other entities receiving $11.94 billion. The appropriations for agencies in FY2015 varied widely for various reasons. Contact key policy staff for more information on specific agency appropriations. The President's FY2015 request for agencies funded in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations law totaled $30.69 billion. Funding varied widely among agencies, with a small subset accounting for most of the total. For example, appropriations for EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service made up 59.4% of the total requested. DOI agency requests ranged from $72.4 million to $2.61 billion, with 6 of the 10 agencies exceeding $1 billion in funding. The President's FY2015 request for agencies funded in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations law totaled $30.69 billion. Nearly half of the $10.86 billion requested for DOI agencies was for the National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs. Funding levels for Related Agencies in Title III varied widely, with requests ranging from $2.5 million for the Commission of Fine Arts to $5.71 billion for the Forest Service. The Indian Health Service and the Smithsonian Institution also received significant funding, while 14 agencies would have received less than $80 million each. The President's FY2015 request for agencies funded in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations law totaled $30.69 billion, with nearly half allocated to the National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs. Funding levels for Related Agencies varied widely, ranging from $2.5 million to $5.71 billion. The President's request would have been a 1.9% increase over FY2014 enacted appropriations. The President's FY2015 budget proposal included various funding increases and decreases for different agencies. For example, funding for DOI agencies would have increased by $381.3 million (3.6%), while funding for EPA would have decreased by $310.0 million (-3.8%). The total for all Related Agencies in Title III would have increased by $500.5 million (4.4%). The President proposed increases for 7 out of 10 DOI agencies, with varying dollar amounts and percentages. The lowest increase was $2.4 million (3.1%) for the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, and the highest was $182.2 million (19.5%) for Department-Wide Programs, mainly for Wildland Fire Management. Three DOI agencies saw decreases, ranging from $5.3 million (-3.5%) to $10.4 million (-1.7%). The President's proposed decrease for EPA in the FY2015 budget was largely due to a reduction in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account by $529.8 million (-15.0%). This decrease was attributed to funding cuts for grants that provide financial assistance to states for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account saw the largest increase of $113.0 million (4.3%) among EPA accounts. The President's proposed increase for EPA in the FY2015 budget included additional funding for the Forest Service, Indian Health Service, and Smithsonian Institution. The Forest Service would receive funds for wildland fire suppression, the Indian Health Service for various programs, and the Smithsonian Institution for its operations. The President's proposed increase for EPA in the FY2015 budget included additional funding for various programs and activities, such as clinical services and contract support costs. The Smithsonian would receive funds for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, outreach, facilities services, and revitalization of facilities. Other agencies funded in Title III would either receive level funding or varying reductions, with funding eliminated for National Capital Arts and Cultural Affairs. H.R. 5171, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, allocated $30.28 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2015, including $470.0 million in additional suppression funding for the Forest Service. The FY2015 budget included $470.0 million in additional suppression funding for the Forest Service to address a projected shortfall in fire suppression appropriations. The Senate Interior Subcommittee draft recommended $30.71 billion, with $1.19 billion in emergency appropriations for Wildland Fire Management activities. No further legislative action occurred on the House or Senate bills. The Senate draft total was $424.0 million more than the House committee-reported bill. The Senate Interior Subcommittee draft proposed higher funding for DOI agencies compared to the House committee-reported bill, with a total appropriations figure of $11.05 billion, primarily due to including $442.0 million for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program. The Senate Interior Subcommittee also recommended $8.18 billion for EPA, $699.3 million more than the House committee-reported bill, with different levels of appropriations for all EPA accounts. The House committee-reported bill included $11.75 billion for all Related Agencies in Title III, slightly more than the $11.69 billion in the Senate Interior Subcommittee draft. The House bill had higher funding for the Indian Health Service, while other agencies had equal or higher funding in the Senate draft. Both the House bill and Senate draft had higher appropriations compared to FY2014 for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. The House committee-reported bill and the Senate Interior Subcommittee draft proposed higher appropriations for various agencies. The House committee version included an increase of $162.0 million (0.5%) over FY2014, while the Senate Interior Subcommittee proposed an increase of $586.0 million (1.9%). The House committee's proposed increases included $416.3 million (66.8%) for DOI Departmental Offices, $207.9 million (4.7%) for the Indian Health Service, $113.7 million (4.5%) for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and $85.7 million (1.6%) for the Forest Service. The largest decrease proposed was for EPA\u2014$717.3 million (-8.7%) less than the FY2014 level. The Senate Interior Subcommittee draft proposed increases for various agencies, including $175.9 million (18.8%) for Department-Wide Programs, $111.2 million (2.5%) for the Indian Health Service, $100.5 million (1.8%) for the Forest Service, and $71.2 million (2.8%) for the National Park Service. The total appropriations for FY2015 were $30.48 billion, with DOI agencies receiving $11.09 billion and EPA receiving $8.14 billion. In FY2015, appropriations were concentrated on a few agencies, with EPA, Forest Service, and Indian Health Service receiving the majority of the funding. The National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs also received significant appropriations. DOI agencies received funding ranging from $72.4 million to $2.61 billion, with National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs accounting for nearly half of the total enacted for DOI agencies. In FY2015, appropriations for DOI agencies ranged from $72.4 million to $5.06 billion, with the Indian Health Service receiving $4.64 billion and the Smithsonian Institution receiving $819.5 million. The total appropriations increased by $358.0 million (1.2%) over FY2014, with a $616.4 million (5.9%) increase for all DOI agencies due in part to the inclusion of $372.0 million for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program. In FY2015, DOI agencies received additional funding, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service seeing significant dollar increases. The Bureau of Indian Affairs received $70.2 million for various programs, while the National Park Service received $53.1 million in anticipation of increased visitation for its centennial in 2016. However, EPA appropriations decreased by $60.1 million from the previous year. In FY2015, appropriations for all Related Agencies decreased by $197.3 million, mainly due to a reduction in funding for the Forest Service. The Wildland Fire Management account saw a significant decrease, while other Forest Service accounts increased slightly. Only two other agencies received decreases, eleven remained at the same funding level, and six saw budget increases. The Indian Health Service received the largest dollar increase. Appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies decreased in FY2015 compared to FY2014. The decline was primarily due to reduced funding for the EPA, which saw a significant decrease. Overall appropriations for these agencies peaked in FY2010 and have been decreasing since then. In FY2015, appropriations for EPA decreased by $2.15 billion (-20.9%), while appropriations for DOI agencies and Related Agencies increased. FY2015 appropriations were higher than previous fiscal years, with an increase of $867.0 million (2.9%) compared to FY2011. However, FY2015 enacted appropriations were lower than the President's request and the Senate Interior Subcommittee draft. Total appropriations enacted for FY2010 through FY2015 for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies were compared with the appropriations requested by the President, reported by the House Appropriations Committee, and recommended by the Senate Interior Subcommittee. Appropriations for EPA decreased in FY2015, while appropriations for DOI agencies and Related Agencies increased. FY2015 enacted appropriations were higher than previous fiscal years but lower than the President's request and the Senate Interior Subcommittee draft."
