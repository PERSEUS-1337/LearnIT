    "content": "Recent research on margin theory has shown that optimizing the margin distribution is more important than maximizing the minimum margin. The Optimal margin Distribution Network (ODN) embeds a loss function based on the optimal margin distribution, with theoretical analysis confirming its significance for classification in deep networks. Empirical results demonstrate that the ODN model consistently outperforms the baseline cross-entropy loss model across various regularization scenarios. The large margin principle has been crucial in machine learning research, providing theoretical analysis and practical results for classification and regression tasks. Margin-based generalization bounds have been proposed for neural networks, with recent advancements showing stronger bounds for deep networks through a compression approach. Margin theory has also been used to explain the success of AdaBoost in avoiding overfitting. AdaBoost is resistant to overfitting, with the margin distribution playing a key role. Designing a classifier for optimal margin distribution is crucial, considering both margin mean and variance. The Optimal Margin Distribution Machine (ODM) optimizes margin distribution by maximizing mean and minimizing variance simultaneously. In this paper, an optimal margin distribution loss for convolutional neural networks is proposed, inspired by the Optimal Margin Distribution Machine (ODM). The method aims to maximize the margin mean and minimize the margin variance simultaneously. Additionally, a novel generalization bound based on margin distribution is derived using the PAC-Bayesian framework, showing the capacity of the model can be restricted by controlling the ratio between first and second-order statistics. The research introduces an optimal margin distribution loss for deep neural networks, aiming to explain the generalization performance of deep learning models. Various techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay have shown improvements in generalization, but lack a solid theoretical foundation. The proposed loss function has a generalization bound that restricts the hypothesis space complexity by utilizing appropriate statistics dependent on data. The research introduces an optimal margin distribution loss for deep neural networks to explain generalization performance. It compares this loss with cross-entropy under different regularization methods for a classification problem. The decision boundary and margin distance are defined for each class pair to approximate in nonlinear situations. The research introduces a margin loss for deep neural networks to improve generalization performance. It defines the margin distance for each class pair and aims to learn a decision function with low generalization error. The margin loss function is adapted for deep learning models, connecting it to deep neural networks. The margin loss function introduced aims to optimize the decision boundary by considering the entire sample margin distribution, not just points near the boundary. It uses hyper-parameters to balance deviations and enforce ties with zero loss, maximizing the inclusion of sample points. The paper introduces a new margin distribution network that optimizes the decision boundary using the entire sample margin distribution. It presents a new margin bound for the optimal margin distribution loss and simplifies the definition of deep networks. The paper introduces a new margin distribution network that optimizes the decision boundary using the entire sample margin distribution. It simplifies the definition of the loss function and discusses the Bayesian framework for expressing prior knowledge in supervised learning. The PAC-Bayesian theorem relates the distribution Q learned from training data to a prior distribution P over functions in H. It provides a bound on the expected risk for a predictor f w by considering perturbed loss and margin distribution. The perturbed restriction is related to the margin distribution (margin mean r and margin variance \u03b8). The margin variance information does not affect the conclusion of the perturbed restriction. The layer cushion is defined as the largest number \u00b5 i for error-resilience in BID0. The interlayer cushion \u00b5 i,j is defined as the largest number for error-resilience in nonlinear operators. It captures the local linear approximation of the operator M from layer i to layer j. Activation contraction is defined as the smallest number that decreases the norm of the pre-activation vector by a small constant factor. A perturbation bound is needed to relate the change in output to the network structure and prior distribution. Neyshabur et al. proved a restriction on output change based on parameter weight norms. Hyper-parameters r and \u03b8 are set to ensure parameter weights satisfy a specific condition. Theorem 1 provides a new margin-based generalization bound for the Optimal Margin Distribution Network, linking the change in output to the network structure and prior distribution. The bound is dependent on hyper-parameters r and \u03b8, ensuring parameter weights meet a specific condition. The proof of Theorem 1 in Appendix B shows that the margin bound is relevant to r and \u03b8, dependent on the network structure. The complexity is influenced by the ratio \u03b8 and margin r, with smaller \u03b8 and larger r leading to smaller complexity. Finding the right values for r and \u03b8 improves generalization performance. In this section, the effectiveness of the optimal margin distribution loss is empirically evaluated on generalization tasks, compared with cross-entropy loss, hinge loss, and soft hinge loss. Experiments are conducted on limited training data from MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, varying data ratios. The combination of optimal margin distribution loss with dropout and batch normalization is also investigated. Features learned by deep learning models with different loss functions are visualized and compared. Three commonly used loss functions in deep learning are introduced for comparison. In the experimental section, various loss functions in deep learning are compared, including Cross-entropy Loss, Hinge Loss, and Soft Hinge Loss. Different deep models are used with specific datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. The implementation of optimal margin distribution loss involves a gradient term in the loss itself, which can be computationally expensive. To reduce costs, a constant gradient term is considered in the backpropagation step. In the experimental section, different loss functions in deep learning are compared, including Cross-entropy Loss, Hinge Loss, and Soft Hinge Loss. Special hyperparameters are tuned for the ODN model and hinge loss model through hyperparameter searching. Common hyperparameters like learning rate and momentum are set to default values. Batch stochastic gradient descent is used as the optimizer. The baseline cross-entropy model achieves a test accuracy of 99.09%, while the hinge loss model achieves 98.95% on MNIST. The ODN model achieves 99.16% test accuracy on MNIST and 84.61% on CIFAR-10. Optimal margin distribution loss based models can generalize well with insufficient training data. The ODN model achieves high test accuracy on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Optimal margin distribution loss based models perform well with limited training data, outperforming other models consistently. The ODN model shows superior performance with limited training data on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, outperforming other models by significant margins. Our optimal margin distribution loss consistently outperforms dropout and batch normalization, especially with small training sample sizes. It can cooperate with batch normalization and dropout to achieve the best performance. The margin bound in our loss helps restrict model capacity and alleviate overfitting efficiently. The ODN models show excellent performance, and we aim to ensure that the data distributions in the learned feature space align with the generalization results. In this experiment, t-SNE method is used to visualize data distribution on the last hidden layer for training and test samples. The ODN model outperforms others, showing more compact distribution of samples with the same label. Variance decomposition is performed to quantify the compactness of the distribution in the embedding space. The optimal margin distribution loss function leads to a more compact distribution of samples with the same label in the embedding space. This helps in deriving a good feature space and alleviating overfitting in deep learning. The ODN model shows the largest margin mean and smallest margin variance compared to other models in the experiment. Our ODN model has a larger margin mean and smaller margin variance compared to other models. The ratio between margin mean and standard deviation is 3.20, higher than other models. This sharper distribution prevents small margin instances, allowing our method to perform well with limited training data. The ODN model aims to optimize margin distribution for better generalization performance in deep networks. The ODN model designs a loss function to control the margin mean-to-variance ratio, with theoretical analysis confirming its importance in generalization. Experimental results show its superiority in limited data scenarios, and it can enhance generalization when used with batch normalization and dropout. Inspired by optimal margin distribution, Zhang & Zhou (2017) propose a multi-class optimal margin distribution machine. The optimal margin distribution machine characterizes the margin distribution based on first-and second-order statistics. It includes parameters to penalize the norm of weights and control the deviation of the margin mean. In the linear situation, the margin mean can be normalized as 1, with parameters to balance deviations and control the number of support vectors. The parameter \u03b8 controls the number of support vectors and margin variance in the zero loss band. In non-linear settings, the margin mean cannot be directly normalized to 1. A linear approximation is used to normalize the weight norm magnitude, transforming the optimization target into a loss function. Larger margin variances lead to worse model performance due to noise in the data. It is desired for larger margin means to have larger losses to improve model effectiveness. The proof involves bounding the perturbation of parameters to satisfy the margin condition and calculating the KL term for the final margin generalization bound. The network is structured with normalized weights, and the ReLU activation ensures the empirical and expected loss are the same. The spectral norm can be assumed to be equal. The spectral norm is assumed to be equal across layers. A method is proposed to set \u03c3 based on an approximation \u03b2 on a pre-determined grid to avoid dependency on the learned predictor. The generalization bound for all w is established with a bound for the spectral norm of each layer perturbation. The spectral norm of each layer perturbation is bounded by \u03c3 2\u03c1 ln(4L\u03c1) with probability \u2265 1 2. Using the PAC-Bayesian framework, a generalization bound is established for all w with a chosen distribution for P \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 I). This method allows for proofing generalization bounds with the optimal margin distribution."
