Some worry about the lack of funding for promoting U.S. interests overseas, including humanitarian assistance and support for strategic partners. On the other hand, some Members of Congress and Americans view foreign affairs funding, especially foreign aid, as expendable to reduce the deficit. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over a 10-year period. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to reach an agreement, leading to automatic spending cuts through sequestration in 2013 and lower spending limits until FY2021 to achieve $1.2 trillion in savings. The Budget Control Act of 2011 amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, requiring OMB to allocate reductions to defense and other areas to achieve $1.2 trillion in savings. Spending limits were set for FY2013-FY2021, with reductions achieved through sequestration and appropriation adjustments. Failure to meet spending caps would result in sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated automatic budget reductions to defense and nondefense spending through sequestration. The Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 required OMB to report on the potential impact of sequestration triggered by the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The OMB Report outlined the methodology and estimated sequestration at the account-level. The State-Foreign Operations (SFOP) appropriations, representing about 1% to 1.5% of the federal budget, support international affairs programs. SFOP includes foreign economic and security assistance, contributions to international organizations, State Department and USAID operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated $85.3 billion in automatic cuts between defense and nondefense accounts in FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandated $85.3 billion in automatic cuts between defense and nondefense accounts in FY2013. OMB calculated a 5% reduction for nondefense discretionary funding and a 5.1% reduction for nondefense mandatory programs from March to September 30, 2013. The CR, P.L. 112-175, provided appropriations for foreign affairs spending at FY2012 levels plus a slight increase. Congress approved legislation (H.R. 933) to fund the federal government through the fiscal year. The Consolidated and Further Continuing appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) funded the State Department and Foreign Operations through the end of the fiscal year, mostly at the same rate as in FY2012. Sequestration and an additional across-the-board rescission reduced FY2013 funding by an estimated 2%. Sequestration cuts were made at the PPA level as required by the Budget Control Act. The FY2012 appropriation act defined PPAs for foreign operations, particularly foreign aid programs, at the account level or country allocation level. Section 7023 of P.L. 112-74 states that for Foreign Operations, ''program, project, and activity'' shall be defined at the appropriations Act account level, including funding directives, ceilings, and limitations. For certain accounts like ''Economic Support Fund'' and ''Foreign Military Financing Program'', ''program, project, and activity'' also includes country, regional, and central program level funding. The FY2012 appropriation act defined PPAs for foreign operations at the account level or country allocation level. Section 7023 of P.L. 112-74 states that for Foreign Operations, ''program, project, and activity'' shall be defined at the appropriations Act account level, including funding directives, ceilings, and limitations. Sequestration was applied at the account level for various programs and funds such as International Disaster Assistance, Transition Initiatives, and USAID's Capital Investment Fund. Sequestration was applied at the account and country allocation levels for various foreign assistance programs and funds, allowing the Department of State and USAID to reprogram funds to protect specific countries or activities, but resulting in reductions to other program, project, and activity (PPA) areas within those accounts. Transfer authority was also available under sequestration. PPAs in accounts were further reduced under sequestration. Transfer authority was available as per Section 7009, Title VII, Division I of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, P.L. 112-74. An additional 0.032% rescission was required by Section 3004 of the FY2013 CR (P.L. 113-6) for foreign affairs discretionary accounts to meet spending limits. Certain foreign affairs funds were exempt from sequestration, including mandatory funds like the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund, intragovernmental payments, and voluntary payments. The FY2013 State Department operations and related agency total was reduced by 0.9% and the foreign operations total was reduced by 2.4%, compared with FY2012 levels. Department of State officials say that within the FY2013 CR, Congress and the Administration agreed to increase some funding accounts with respect to the Syria crisis, Middle East. In FY2013, funding changes varied for foreign affairs accounts. Some accounts saw significant declines, such as Conflict Stabilization Operations (-73.4%) and Transition Initiatives (-42.5%), while others increased, including State Department's Embassy Security (+70.6%) and International Disaster Assistance (+41.6%). State Department officials caution against comparing FY2013 post-sequestration funding with FY2011 levels, as FY2011 was uniquely low. State-Foreign Operations FY2013 funding increased by 6.5% over FY2011 actuals. State Department operations funding was 12.1% higher, Foreign Operations funding was 3.8% higher, and specific accounts were greater than FY2011 levels. For example, State's Diplomatic and Consular Programs funding was nearly 11% higher. Foreign aid funding in FY2013 increased significantly compared to FY2011 levels, with various programs seeing notable boosts in funding. The Department of State expresses concerns about the impact of sequestration on long-term foreign affairs programs and foreign policy goals, emphasizing the importance of robust funding for influencing world events, protecting U.S. interests, and preventing conflict and terrorism. Proponents argue that U.S. foreign aid benefits national security, exports, American jobs, and global stability. They believe that foreign aid achieves a lot with a small budget, around 1% of the total U.S. government budget. Critics question the importance of foreign aid programs, especially during a time of economic deficit, suggesting a focus on defense and domestic funding instead. The debate continues on the significance of foreign affairs spending and the potential consequences of funding cuts. The ability for current and future Administrations to do more overseas with less will be crucial as budget reductions continue to FY2021 and beyond."
