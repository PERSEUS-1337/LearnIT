The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include a new section on nuclear cooperation with states not party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Cooperation may be undertaken with such states if they meet certain requirements related to nuclear weapon testing and fissile material production. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to allow nuclear cooperation with states not part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty if they meet specific criteria, including banning fissile material production for nuclear weapons, providing a comprehensive plan to separate civil and military nuclear facilities, and placing future nuclear reactors under IAEA safeguards. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to allow nuclear cooperation with states meeting specific criteria, including signing an IAEA Additional Protocol, addressing nuclear proliferation challenges, establishing a national export control system, and adhering to Nuclear Suppliers Group and Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to allow nuclear cooperation with states meeting specific criteria, including adherence to Nuclear Suppliers Group and Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines, stringent physical protection measures, compliance with nuclear cooperation agreements, and no engagement in illicit procurement for nuclear weapons programs. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to allow nuclear cooperation with states meeting specific criteria, including adherence to guidelines, stringent physical protection measures, compliance with agreements, and exclusion of certain equipment or technology for nuclear weapons programs. Cooperation becomes effective upon presidential certification to Congress of meeting all requirements. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to allow nuclear cooperation with states meeting specific criteria, including adherence to guidelines, stringent physical protection measures, compliance with agreements, and exclusion of certain equipment or technology for nuclear weapons programs. Cooperation becomes effective upon presidential certification to Congress of meeting all requirements. The cooperation agreement with the IAEA requires safeguards in perpetuity for civil nuclear facilities and materials, conforming to IAEA standards. The President must submit the proposed agreement to Congress, which must adopt a joint resolution within 60 days of continuous session, and the President must certify NSG consensus for transfer of trigger list items. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 allows for nuclear cooperation with states meeting specific criteria, including adherence to guidelines and exclusion of certain equipment for nuclear weapons programs. Any proposed cooperation agreement must be considered according to specified procedures. Certain provisions do not apply to states with cooperation agreements, both for past and future activities. Future activities under Section 129(1)(D) do not apply to states with cooperation agreements. Nuclear exports may be terminated if a state violates the agreement, terminates IAEA safeguards, or violates IAEA safeguards. The condensed text chunk is: \n\nStates may face consequences if they violate IAEA safeguards agreements, transfer nuclear materials against NSG guidelines, transfer ballistic missiles against MTCR guidelines, produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, conduct nuclear weapon tests, or assist non-nuclear weapon states in activities related to nuclear explosive devices. The condensed text chunk is: \n\nThe President can allow exports of nuclear explosive devices unless it harms US non-proliferation goals or security. Congressional review is required for the President's determination to take effect. The President's determination on nuclear explosive device exports requires Congressional review for approval. The President must submit an annual report to Congress on states that have cooperation agreements regarding nuclear matters. Definitions for IAEA, MTCR, and NSG are provided in this section. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is defined in the Control Regime. Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 include changes to subsections a. and i. to incorporate references to specific sections."
