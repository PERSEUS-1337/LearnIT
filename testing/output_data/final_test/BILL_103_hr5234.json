    "content": "The \"Food for Trade Act of 1994\" establishes the Food for Trade Program under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. The Food for Trade Act of 1994 establishes a pilot program to create self-sustaining organizations in eligible countries for economic development activities. The Secretary will work with non-profit facilitators to implement approved projects using agricultural commodities. Organizations can participate by submitting proposals for projects in eligible countries. The Secretary will provide agricultural commodities to facilitators for approved projects in eligible countries. Assistance can be given in annual installments for up to 5 years. Facilitators will transport and sell the commodities received for funding the project. The facilitator in the program is responsible for storing, transporting, and selling agricultural commodities in eligible recipient countries. The proceeds from the sale will be used to establish a self-sustaining investment fund in the recipient country as per guidelines set by the Secretary. The facilitator will establish an advisory board to manage the investment fund and coordinate its transfer to the joint commission in the recipient country. Project proposals must include expense projections for carrying out the project, including monetization of agricultural commodities. The facilitator will establish a self-sustaining investment fund in the recipient country from sales of agricultural commodities. The fund will be managed to provide the best return without undue risk, and investment profits will support development activities. The facilitator will establish an advisory board in each recipient country to advise on the management of the investment fund. Board members will be selected from the business and investment community and will serve without pay. The advisory board will continue to provide advice after control of the project is transferred to the joint commission. The advisory board advises the joint commission on investment fund issues. The joint commission is established in each recipient country with representatives from the country, local and international NGOs, and the US diplomatic mission. The joint commission in each recipient country, with representatives from various entities, elects a board of directors and may hire administrative personnel. Its duties include selecting recipients for loans and grants and dispersing funds from investment profits. The joint commission may use profits from the investment fund for developmental activities such as providing loans to local banks, credit unions, venture capital organizations, organizations offering micro-credit, and local entrepreneurs. Grants may be awarded for technical assistance, research, education, extension endowments, and humanitarian and infrastructure development projects under this section. After 5 years of project operation, control of the investment fund will be transferred to the joint commission. The Secretary will establish guidelines for project proposals and selection of recipient countries under this section. Criteria for selecting recipient countries under this section include interest in privatizing agriculture and land ownership, legal structures for private banking, favorable tax laws for small business development, no restrictions on foreign investment, freeing wages and prices from government control, and economic conditions allowing for profitable tax-exempt foundations. The curr_chunk outlines procedures for the monetization of agricultural commodities, establishment and operation of an investment fund, transfer of operational control to the joint commission, program evaluation, and termination of the project if mismanaged. The curr_chunk outlines guidelines for program operation, reporting requirements, evaluation, and audits. The facilitator must submit an annual progress report to the Secretary, and evaluations will be conducted every 4 years. The Comptroller General will also conduct periodic audits. The curr_chunk defines key terms for the program, including \"facilitator,\" \"eligible recipient country,\" and \"eligible organization.\" The Secretary is required to allocate at least 20 percent of funds for this section of the program."
