It also addresses integrated plans. The Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act, also known as the Act, defines the term \"Administrator\" as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include Integrated Plan Permits, with definitions for green infrastructure and integrated plans. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a framework on June 5, 2012, defining municipal discharge as wastewater or stormwater from treatment works or municipal storm sewers. The term includes discharges from multiple municipalities under the same permit. Integrated Plan Permits are also introduced, allowing the Administrator or a State to approve permit programs. The EPA introduced a framework defining municipal discharge as wastewater or stormwater from treatment works or storm sewers. Integrated Plan Permits allow municipalities to develop a comprehensive plan integrating various requirements under the Act. The EPA allows municipalities to incorporate an integrated plan in their permits for municipal wastewater discharge. Compliance schedules can span multiple permit terms if authorized by state water quality standards. Actions under the schedule may include green initiatives. The schedule of compliance may include green infrastructure as part of a water quality-based effluent limitation and can be reviewed at permit renewal. Existing authorities regarding applicable standards and flexibility are retained. The schedule of compliance can include green infrastructure for water quality-based effluent limitations and may extend beyond permit expiration with approval. State authority is clarified. The Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act allows states to authorize compliance schedules in water quality standards for effluent limitations in permits, without affecting existing judicial orders or consent decrees. The Water Infrastructure Flexibility Act allows states to authorize compliance schedules for effluent limitations without affecting existing judicial orders or consent decrees. The Municipal Ombudsman office provides technical assistance to municipalities for compliance with environmental laws and assists the EPA in implementing agency policies. The Municipal Ombudsman works with the Environmental Protection Agency to provide municipalities with information on available federal financial assistance, flexibility under environmental laws, and the opportunity to develop an integrated plan for water pollution control. The municipal ombudsman prioritizes municipalities with affordability concerns related to federal water pollution and safe drinking water compliance. They share information on technical and financial assistance, flexibility, and resources on the EPA website. The EPA informs municipalities of the opportunity to develop integrated plans in conjunction with enforcement actions related to municipal discharges under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Municipalities under administrative orders or settlements can modify their plans accordingly. Municipalities under administrative orders or settlements can request modifications based on integrated plans developed in accordance with section 402(s). The EPA will report to Congress on integrated plans developed and implemented through permits, orders, or judicial consent decrees since June 5, 2012. The EPA report from June 5, 2012, outlines control measures, costs, and compliance schedules for requirements in an integrated plan. SEC. 4. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PROMOTION. Title V of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a new section promoting green infrastructure by the Environmental Protection Agency. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for promoting and integrating green infrastructure into various programs, planning efforts, research, technical assistance, and funding guidance. This includes coordinating with other federal departments, state, tribal, and local governments, and the private sector to increase the use of green infrastructure. The Administrator directs regional EPA offices to promote green infrastructure, including outreach, training, and integration into regulatory programs. Additionally, green infrastructure information sharing is promoted through an Internet website. The Administrator promotes green infrastructure through an Internet website to provide information and assistance to various entities for reducing water pollution, protecting water resources, complying with regulations, and achieving environmental goals. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL CAPABILITY GUIDANCE. Definitions in this section include \"affordability\" as the ability to pay utility bills without hardship, \"financial capability\" as a community's ability to invest in water quality improvements, and \"guidance\" as specific instructions from the Administrator. The Administrator shall not use median household income as the sole indicator of affordability for a residential household. Within 1 year of a study completion to establish a definition and framework for community affordability, the Administrator must revise the guidance described in subsection (a)(3). The Administrator must use revised guidance instead of the current guidance once finalized. When revising the guidance, the Administrator must consider recommendations from relevant studies, local economic conditions, essential community investments, and potential adverse impacts on distressed populations. The revised guidance for evaluating water infrastructure investments should consider impacts on low-income ratepayers, address rate structures for low-income consumers, evaluate various factors, and weigh economic, public health, and environmental benefits. The revised guidance for evaluating water infrastructure investments must be developed in consultation with stakeholders. Once revised, the Administrator must publish it in the Federal Register and submit it to relevant committees. If the Administrator chooses not to follow certain recommendations, an explanation must be provided. This section does not preempt or interfere with other actions. Effect: This section does not preempt or interfere with any obligation to comply with Federal laws, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act."
