    "content": "The Washington Post published \"the Afghanistan Papers\" in December 2019, consisting of interviews with policymakers and memos from Donald Rumsfeld. The Papers are compared to the Pentagon Papers but differ in content and classification. The SIGAR Lessons Learned documents reveal shortcomings in U.S. policies in Afghanistan, leading to outcomes that did not meet stated objectives. Some Members of Congress are calling for further investigation, while analysts debate the significance of the information contained in the interviews. The SIGAR Lessons Learned documents, obtained by The Washington Post, highlight U.S. policy shortcomings in Afghanistan. These documents include interviews with policymakers and recommendations for future operations. SIGAR released documents including a 2015 interview with Michael Flynn and conducted 428 interviews with officials. The Washington Post sued to disclose names of interviewees criticizing the war, while SIGAR argues they are whistleblowers. A decision from the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC is pending as of January 2020. In 2020, a decision from the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC is pending regarding documents totaling 2,000 pages from SIGAR interviews. Key themes include the misuse of $132 billion in U.S. development assistance in Afghanistan. Several interviewees have disputed the views attributed to them by SIGAR. Many SIGAR interviewees highlighted Afghanistan's limited absorptive capacity for the financial resources channeled into the country since 2001. Despite being one of the world's poorest nations, Afghanistan struggled to effectively utilize the significant amount of aid, with an estimated capacity of $2 billion per year. The U.S. alone has contributed over $7 billion annually, raising questions about the reasons behind such high funding levels, including U.S. domestic politics. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) official highlighted how budget allocations for political, military, and development aid reflected commitment levels. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) proposed reductions due to unspent funds from previous years, but policymakers argued against it, citing negative impacts on messaging and reconstruction efforts. Some blamed Congress for wasteful spending. The USAID official faulted Congress for wasteful spending, stating that they gave more money than requested. Douglas Lute noted that Congress was driven by political pressures to push for higher budgets without evidence of effectiveness, leading to a cycle of spending to secure future funding. The reason for wasteful spending in Afghanistan was due to a lack of interagency coordination on resource allocation. Money was poured into unsustainable infrastructure projects to show spending ability, with no accountability for cost control. Contractors were not held accountable, leading to rising costs, as there was no guidance on measuring project impact other than dollar figures. The flow of money in Afghanistan led to wasteful spending due to a lack of accountability and guidance on project impact. Despite some improvements in health and education, gains were not sufficient or sustainable, leaving most gains fragile. The influx of money in Afghanistan led to problems such as corruption and delegitimization of the government, favoring specific communities at the expense of others. U.S. assistance had a structural bias that created perverse incentives for Afghans. The influx of money in Afghanistan created perverse incentives for Afghans, leading to corruption and favoritism. Development programs targeted insecure areas, rewarding bad behavior. The grant contracting system was blamed for wasting money, with few benefits reaching Afghans. The influx of money in Afghanistan led to corruption and favoritism, with development programs being criticized for wasting funds and benefiting few Afghans. Experts highlighted that a small percentage of aid actually reaches villages due to the involvement of multiple contractors and consultants, resulting in inflated costs and limited impact on the Afghan government. Interviewees argued that U.S. money influenced Afghan political culture, shaping perceptions through the Emergency and Constitutional Loya Jirgas. Religious leaders received packages from the U.S. in exchange for accepting certain measures, leading to a perception that voting for U.S.-favored positions required compensation. The U.S. engagement in Afghanistan lacked a clear goal, with money deeply embedded in the democratic experience from the beginning. The lack of clarity in U.S. policy towards Afghanistan was highlighted by various officials, with multiple objectives leading to a lack of a clear end state vision. This confusion extended to specific areas such as reconstruction and counternarcotics efforts. The lack of clear objectives in U.S. counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan led to conflicting goals and actions, with security interests often taking precedence over other priorities like counternarcotics and anti-corruption. The U.S. embassy chief of mission did not prioritize conveying messages about counternarcotics to the Afghan government, focusing instead on other issues. Senior U.S. officials were willing to pay off local leaders to avoid drug-related conflicts and overlooked corruption issues in favor of security objectives. The 2010 Kabul Bank collapse was not aggressively prosecuted due to the emphasis on security concerns over financial misconduct. The U.S. prioritized security objectives over counternarcotics and anti-corruption goals in Afghanistan, leading to partnerships with corrupt warlords and governors. This approach was criticized for undermining good governance and supporting political allies involved in opium cultivation. Some officials argued that these contradictions were unavoidable in pursuit of security interests. The U.S. prioritized security objectives in Afghanistan, partnering with corrupt warlords and governors despite concerns of corruption and human rights abuses. Interagency coordination was a consistent problem in U.S. policy formulation and execution in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Interagency Operation Group (AOIG) was generally well-received, while the State Department's Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (SCRS) and Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) faced criticism for being expensive, time-consuming, and ineffective. The SRAP set up created parallel structures for regional development, leading to competition and confusion among various agencies and actors. This lack of clear leadership allowed for opportunities for exploitation by Afghans. Former Afghan president Karzai was seen as trying to manipulate U.S. agencies against each other for leverage, causing a loss of mission coherence. To address interagency coordination issues, a more unified command structure was recommended, with a general in charge of both military and civilian elements in situations with high conflict. The current system of interagency coordination in Afghanistan has been criticized for lacking relevant expertise and language skills among U.S. officials. This has led to challenges in effective collaboration and mission coherence. Multiple interviewees highlighted the need for a more unified command structure to address these issues. The lack of language skills among U.S. officials in Afghanistan has hindered effective collaboration and trust-building with Afghan counterparts. Short-term deployments have resulted in a loss of expertise and trust, with few military or policy members proficient in Dari or Pashto. This has been a longstanding issue impacting mission coherence and interagency coordination. The loss of expertise and trust due to short-term deployments was highlighted as a major obstacle to U.S. policy success in Afghanistan. Interviewees emphasized the need for longer leadership tenures to ensure continuity and institutional memory. Rotation of personnel every year was identified as a significant factor contributing to failure. The turnover of personnel in Afghanistan led to a lack of institutional memory and expertise, hindering U.S. policy success. Suggestions to address this included offering higher pay to government employees, but this also brought in individuals with little understanding of the culture. Afghans took advantage of this lack of knowledge to shape U.S. policy. Afghans exploited the lack of institutional memory to influence U.S. policy. U.S. efforts in Afghanistan were supported by a multinational coalition, but challenges arose in coordinating international efforts. The \"lead nation\" system emerged, with different countries overseeing various policy areas. The lead nation system in Afghanistan had different countries overseeing specific policy areas, leading to disorganization and lack of progress according to former officials. The unnamed NSC staffer explained that the difference in pacing and approach in Afghanistan was due to tasks being conditioned by what countries were willing to do, creating tensions between the coalition and nation states. U.S. officials interviewed believed that the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 distracted attention and resources from Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to regroup. Former Ambassador Nicholas Burns described Iraq as a higher priority, leading to a desire for someone else to take a leading role in Afghanistan to prioritize Iraq. During the period from 2002 to 2011, Afghanistan was often overshadowed by the focus on Iraq. Resources were diverted to Iraq, leading to a secondary effort in Afghanistan. There was a brief window of relative peace in Afghanistan between 2002-2005, but the draw of Iraq took precedence from 2005-2007. The neglect of Afghanistan during the Iraq war led to a lack of development in the Afghan state's military and governing capabilities, allowing for the rise of a new Taliban insurgency. U.S. policymakers were distracted from dealing with Pakistan's role in facilitating the Taliban's comeback. The Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan was attributed to material support from Pakistan, leading to the failure of U.S. efforts in the region. The belief that Pakistan's interests aligned with the U.S. post-9/11 was deemed false by some officials. The positive role Pakistan played in combating Al Qaeda blinded U.S. policymakers to Pakistan's support for the Taliban. Despite warnings from Afghan leaders, Pakistan continued to support the Taliban to maintain influence in Afghanistan. Pakistani leaders were open about this strategy in private discussions. Pakistani leaders openly admitted to hedging their bets by supporting the Taliban to maintain influence in Afghanistan, as revealed in private discussions with U.S. ambassador Ryan Crocker. This strategy was driven by the belief that the U.S. would eventually withdraw, leaving Pakistan to deal with the aftermath. Issues impacting U.S. policymaking in Afghanistan include positivity bias, lack of interaction with the Taliban at the outset, and powers granted to Afghanistan's central government. Some officials praised gains made in Afghanistan since 2001, highlighting achievements and returns on investment. Others argue that the success of U.S. efforts should be viewed in the context of the country's state in 2002. In 2002, officials highlighted the progress in Afghanistan since 2001, emphasizing the development and gains made despite challenges. Some argue that the success of U.S. efforts should be considered in the context of the country's starting point in 2002. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's \"snowflakes\" provide insight into one senior policymaker's thinking during the early years of the U.S. effort in Afghanistan. While not representative of U.S. policy as a whole, these brief and informal notes offer an on-the-ground perspective that could be valuable in evaluating U.S. policy in Afghanistan. People in Afghanistan are grateful for the help they have received and continue to benefit from it, contradicting the assumption that they are not happy with the assistance provided for their improvement. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's \"snowflakes\" offer insight into his perspective on U.S. policy in Afghanistan. Rumsfeld questioned long-term financial support for Afghan security forces and urged against committing to pay for the Afghan army. He expressed concerns about the lack of a plan for Afghanistan. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld expressed eagerness to reduce U.S. commitments in Afghanistan and sought greater input over non-Department of Defense equities. He requested to interview any person proposed for Ambassador to Afghanistan before the selection is made. Former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld received a letter from Afghan Uzbek leader Dostum in 2003, expressing concerns about Taliban activity in Afghanistan. The \"Afghanistan Papers\" have sparked debate on their relevance to U.S. policy in Afghanistan. The \"Afghanistan Papers\" have sparked debate on U.S. policy in Afghanistan. Members of Congress called for the removal of U.S. troops, while defense officials defended the war conduct. The Pentagon spokesman and Secretary of Defense dismissed claims of lying in the Afghanistan Papers, stating that the information provided was accurate at the time and that retrospective views were being misinterpreted. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and SIGAR Special Inspector General John Sopko defended the transparency of the war in Afghanistan, refuting claims of a large-scale conspiracy and emphasizing that assessments were based on known facts at the time. On January 15, 2020, SIGAR Special Inspector General John Sopko testified about U.S. policy in Afghanistan, criticizing it for \"institutional hubris and mendacity\" and incentivizing lying to Congress. The Afghanistan Papers revealed officials' indictment of policies they were responsible for, exposing institutional deceit. The Afghanistan Papers revealed that officials in power attempted to manipulate information about the Afghanistan conflict to present a better picture of progress. Critics argue that the information was not new and had been publicly available for years. The Post was criticized for sensationalizing non-classified information. The Afghanistan Papers, criticized for sensationalizing non-classified information, raise questions for Congress to consider regarding the Trump Administration's Afghanistan policies and the tragic dilemma of the costs of withdrawal versus continued intervention in Afghanistan. Members of Congress evaluate the Trump Administration's Afghanistan policies, focusing on U.S. strategy, congressional oversight methods, and scrutiny of executive branch funding requests. Congressional oversight includes appointing a special inspector general, hearings, delegations to Afghanistan, letters to officials, and public statements. Congress questions the effectiveness of these oversight methods and examines differences between appropriated funding levels and executive branch requests. U.S. funding levels in Afghanistan have been scrutinized by Congress for discrepancies with executive branch requests. Questions have been raised about the impact of conditions imposed on U.S. aid, the effectiveness of oversight methods, and the need for changes in legislation to enhance development assistance. Congressional reporting requirements are also being evaluated for their influence on policy outcomes. Congress is evaluating the usefulness of reports on U.S. military and development efforts in Afghanistan, as well as the impact of personnel turnover on these efforts. They are also considering their role in shaping executive branch structure and the need for congressional action to improve federal agencies' capabilities in Afghanistan. Congress is evaluating the need for congressional action to improve federal agencies' capabilities in Afghanistan and ensure U.S. success."
