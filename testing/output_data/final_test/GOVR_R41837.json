    "content": "Around the world, over 3.3 billion people now have Internet access, up from 2 billion in 2013. Many use it for daily activities like accessing government services, banking, communicating, and political engagement. However, not all countries allow freedom of speech and political organizing online, putting activists at risk for accessing prohibited content or promoting dissent. Political activists face hurdles in accessing prohibited content or promoting dissent online. Despite monitoring and tracking, they use circumvention technologies to bypass government censors. This creates tension between U.S. policymakers and industry, balancing commercial needs with political interests. Technologies can be used both for and against Internet freedom, complicating the situation. Governments worldwide rely on the Internet for growth and development but also impose restrictions for control. Global tech companies face a dilemma when operating in such countries, balancing compliance with host laws and U.S. lawmakers' scrutiny. Some believe technology can offer better solutions to government censorship than company mandates. Hardware, software, and Internet services are seen as neutral elements in this debate. The implementation of hardware, software, and Internet services by various countries can lead to repressive actions, such as censorship and monitoring of Internet traffic. The Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors actively work to combat Internet censorship and promote a free and open Internet. The State Department's NetFreedom Task Force works to help individuals bypass censorship in over 40 countries. Efforts include developing tools, providing training, and promoting Internet freedom at the United Nations. New partnerships with industry, academia, and NGOs aim to enhance citizens' access to the Internet. Grants are available for innovative ideas that break down communication barriers. The State Department's NetFreedom Task Force supports grants for innovative ideas to break down communication barriers and promote Internet freedom. They work with U.S. media companies to challenge censorship and surveillance, and encourage the Global Network Initiative to respond to government requests for censorship. The International Strategy for Cyberspace aims to secure fundamental freedoms and privacy in cyberspace. The State Department supports individual use of digital media to express opinions, share information, monitor elections, expose corruption, and organize social and political movements. They collaborate with civil society and NGOs to establish safeguards protecting Internet activity from unlawful intrusions and promote cybersecurity among these organizations. The State Department promotes cybersecurity among civil society and NGOs to protect freedoms of speech and association in the digital age, especially for activists and journalists. They also support international cooperation for commercial data privacy protections. The United States is strengthening its commercial data privacy framework to keep up with technological changes and promote innovation. They aim to build mutual recognition of privacy laws and ensure data flows across borders seamlessly. Users should have confidence that their information will be received as intended worldwide. The United States promotes a global Internet to drive innovation and economic growth, opposing national intranets. The Task Force addresses Internet freedom issues with expertise in various fields. The Task Force on Internet Freedom, co-chaired by Under Secretaries of State, focuses on international communications, human rights, democratization, business advocacy, and corporate social responsibility in various countries. It supports Internet freedom by monitoring and reporting on it globally, advocating for it in bilateral and international forums, and expanding Internet access in developing nations. The Freedom Online Coalition, consisting of 29 governments including the United States, collaborates to advance Internet freedom. The coalition works with civil society and the private sector to support individuals' online human rights and freedoms. The Digital Defenders Partnership, a project of the coalition, provides emergency support for Internet users facing threats. The Digital Defenders Partnership, part of the Freedom Online Coalition, offers grants worldwide to support Internet users facing threats, including establishing new connections, developing tools for emergencies, and supporting digital activists. The BBG funds initiatives to help dissidents bypass censorship and surveillance. The FY2017 budget for the Office of Internet Freedom is $12.5 million. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) was formed in 2008 by U.S. information and communications technology companies, civil society organizations, investors, and academic entities to promote best practices in countries with poor Internet freedom records. The GNI adopts a self-regulatory approach to promote due diligence and awareness regarding human rights. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) aims to protect freedom of expression and privacy in the face of government pressures. Companies are assessed for compliance with GNI principles, which some criticize for being weak. Supporters argue that the initiative sets realistic goals and incentivizes companies to uphold these rights. In 2015, the GNI expressed concerns to the European Parliament about a resolution on radicalization and recruitment by terrorist organizations. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) expresses concerns about government laws and policies increasing restrictions on companies, potentially impacting freedom of expression and being ineffective against violent extremism. The Global Network Initiative (GNI) raises concerns about government laws restricting companies and impacting freedom of expression, particularly in combating violent extremism. The organization also addresses methods and technologies used for monitoring and censoring websites and web-based communications. Censorship of websites and web-based communications targets services, content, and activities using methods like keyword blocking, DNS manipulation, and IP blocking. IP blocking is a basic censorship method used by governments to prevent packets from targeted IP addresses. Bandwidth throttling limits internet traffic to facilitate monitoring and filtering. Traffic classification blocks specific file transfers through protocols like FTP. Shallow Packet Inspection (SPI) is a less sophisticated method compared to Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) used by repressive governments to limit bandwidth and throttle transfers through evaluating packet headers. SPI can handle a greater volume of traffic quickly but lacks the detailed assessments of DPI. Packet Fingerprinting is a more refined method of throttling packets than shallow packet inspection, considering packet length, frequency, and other characteristics. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is the most advanced method for blocking Internet traffic, examining both packet headers and payloads for content filtering. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) allows governments to monitor and filter keywords in emails, providing targeted traffic monitoring. DPI is more complex and labor-intensive than other traffic-shaping technologies. Circumvention methods like web-based systems act as anonymous proxy servers to bypass censorship. Web-based circumventors are special web pages that allow users to bypass censorship by submitting a URL for the circumventor to retrieve the requested web page. These services proxy the request, enabling users to access blocked websites seamlessly. Public circumventors are often blocked by Internet filtering applications and countries that filter at the national level. Examples include Proxify, StupidCensorhip, CGIProxy, psiphon, and Peacefire/Circumventor. Tunneling software encapsulates traffic within other forms of traffic, allowing users to access non-filtered content through encrypted connections. Tunneling software allows users to access non-filtered content through encrypted connections. Web tunneling software restricts tunneling to web traffic for secure browsing, while application tunneling software allows tunneling of multiple Internet applications. Examples of web tunneling software include UltraReach, FreeGate, Anonymizer, and Ghost Surf, while examples of application tunneling software include GPass, HTTP Tunnel, Relakks, and Guardster/SSH. Anonymous technologies conceal a user's IP address from visited websites and anonymizing services. Anonymous technologies like Tor, JAP ANON, and I2P encrypt user traffic and allow bypassing of Internet censorship, but can be easily blocked by authorities."
