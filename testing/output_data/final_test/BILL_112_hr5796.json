    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice for the American Diplomats Held Hostage in Tehran Act\". Congress finds that in 1979, agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran took American military and diplomatic personnel hostage at the United States Embassy in Tehran. The hostages were held for 444 days, subjected to abuse, and the United States was forced to negotiate their release under duress. The Algiers Accords, which the United States agreed to without consulting the hostages, barred them from suing Iran in U.S. courts. The United States Government intervened in courts to prevent hostages from suing Iran, citing national security interests. No process was proposed for hostages and their families to seek compensation. Congress has determined that compensation for hostages and their families, including funds obtained by liquidating property in which Iran claims an interest, is consistent with the Algiers Accords. Payment of compensation should precede the agreement to bar prosecution of claims in US courts, despite the duress faced by the US. Despite the duress faced by the United States during the negotiation of the agreement, compensation for hostages and their families, including funds obtained by liquidating property in which Iran claims an interest, is consistent with the Algiers Accords.
