    "content": "Adults may go missing for various reasons such as personal choice, abduction, disability, natural disasters, or high-risk behaviors. State and local laws govern how missing adult cases are handled, with some agencies hesitant to allocate resources due to competing priorities. Response to missing adult cases varies between law enforcement agencies and states, with some requiring a waiting period before filing a police report. The federal government has initiatives to prevent and recover missing adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease. The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert program and Kristen's Act provide funding and resources for locating missing individuals and establishing a national clearinghouse for missing adults. The federal government has initiatives to prevent and recover missing adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease. Funding was provided from FY2002 through FY2006 for a national clearinghouse for missing adults and databases to track missing adults and unidentified remains. The report discusses demographics, record-keeping, factors contributing to disappearances, federally funded databases, federal programs to locate missing adults, and issues regarding the federal role in missing adult cases. Adults may go missing due to various reasons such as abduction, foul play, disabilities like Alzheimer's disease, natural disasters, and high-risk lifestyles. Those with dementia are at a higher risk of wandering away, with about 60% of them doing so. Other vulnerable adults include those with drug abuse or gang involvement history. Adults may go missing due to various reasons such as abduction, foul play, disabilities like Alzheimer's disease, natural disasters, and high-risk lifestyles. Vulnerable individuals include those with a history of drug abuse or gang involvement, as well as victims of domestic violence. Data sources like the FBI's NCIC, NDIS, and NamUs provide insight into missing persons, but profiles entered into one database may not appear in others. The NCIC Unidentified Person File, NamUs, and NDIS databases contain information about unidentified decedents, but the true number of unidentified missing adult cases is unknown. In a 2004 census by the DOJ, medical examiners reported 13,486 unidentified human remains, with many offices lacking policies for retaining records that could identify missing individuals. The DOJ estimated that about 4,400 unidentified human decedents are reported annually, with 1,000 remaining unidentified after one year. Another study suggested that up to 10,300 records were for unidentified decedents from 1980 to 2004. The databases vary in the number of profiles and information collected. The NCIC, maintained by the FBI's CJIS Division, keeps records of missing adults and unidentified decedents. The Missing Person File was established in 1975 in response to a request from the NCIC Advisory Policy Board. The Missing Person File, managed by the FBI's CJIS Division, includes records of individuals who are missing under various circumstances indicating potential danger or involuntary disappearance. Records of missing children under 18 must be immediately entered into the file according to the National Child Search Assistance Act of 1990. The Missing Person File, managed by the FBI's CJIS Division, includes records of individuals who are missing under various circumstances indicating potential danger or involuntary disappearance. The Attorney General is required to publish an annual statistical summary of the Missing Person File. Suzanne's Law mandates law enforcement to immediately submit information about missing adults ages 18 through 20 to the NCIC. However, law enforcement agencies are not mandated to submit missing person records of adults over the age of 21. As of December 31, 2016, there were 88,040 individual records remaining in the Missing Person File, with 61.7% for missing adults ages 18 and older and 38.3% for children ages 17 and younger. In 2016, over 647,000 individuals were reported missing to the NCIC, with 28.1% being adults aged 18 and older. Nearly 585,000 missing person records were cleared or canceled that year. Most missing adults were male (59.1%) and white (66.0%). Since 1983, the NCIC has taken reports of unidentified missing persons, with missing white and Asian adults underrepresented and missing African American adults overrepresented. The NCIC does not report on the Hispanic origin of missing individuals, and some missing individuals may be deceased, with their remains being the only available clues concerning their identity and disappearance. The Missing Children Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-292) required the FBI to collect information to identify deceased individuals. The NCIC's Unidentified Remains File was established to report unidentified deceased persons, living individuals unable to determine their identity, and catastrophe victims. The total number of unidentified persons in the NCIC may not reflect the true number of missing remains. The Unidentified Remains File in NCIC contained 8,431 unidentified persons as of December 31, 2016. Nearly 900 unidentified person records were added in 2015, with 80% being deceased bodies, less than 1% for catastrophe victims, and 19% for living persons who couldn't identify themselves. The FBI's NDIS database stores DNA records for missing adults and unidentified remains, authorized under the DNA Identification Act of 1994. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2000 added a fourth category of records for relatives of missing persons to the DNA database. Authorized users enter DNA information into the Local DNA Index System (LDIS) before it populates the State DNA Index System (SDIS). Only SDIS laboratories can upload DNA profiles directly to the National DNA Index System (NDIS), which is searched by the FBI Laboratory for matches. NDIS contains approximately 15 million profiles. NDIS contains around 15 million DNA profiles from various databases, including offenders, forensic evidence, missing persons, and biological relatives. The missing person databases are part of the NMPDD program, which aims to identify missing and unidentified persons using available DNA profiles and other clues. The unidentified human remains database holds profiles of individuals who cannot be identified through traditional methods. The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) in NDIS compares DNA profiles from missing persons databases and alerts laboratories of any matches. The laboratories confirm the matches and inform the relevant authorities. The FBI is working on developing new technology for this process. The FBI is developing technology for kinship DNA analyses to assist in locating missing persons. The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) is an online repository overseen by DOJ's National Institute of Justice for unidentified remains cases. NamUs was established in 2005 in response to the need for a central reporting system. In 2005, a national strategy meeting called the \"Identifying the Missing Summit\" was convened by DOJ's National Institute of Justice to address challenges in investigating missing persons cases. The \"Identifying the Missing Summit\" addressed challenges in investigating missing person cases. DOJ appointed an expert panel to confirm the need for a central reporting system for unidentified human remains, leading to the establishment of NamUs in 2005. NamUs consists of three databases and is accessible online since 2009. Funding of $2.4 million was provided in FY2016 and FY2017 for NamUs operations. The missing person database, funded at $2.4 million in FY2016 and FY2017, serves as a repository for information on missing persons. It includes profiles with photographs, dental records, DNA, and other details. Users can search based on attributes and access state statutes and missing person clearinghouses. The unidentified remains database allows medical examiners and coroners to upload cases for law enforcement agencies to access. Users can view profiles of the remains, search based on characteristics, and access additional information not available to the public. The unclaimed remains database is for deceased individuals who have been identified but have no known family members. The NamUs database compares profiles of missing persons, unidentified remains, and unclaimed bodies. Records are submitted by law enforcement, medical examiners, and DNA labs. Access is restricted to government and law enforcement, with limited public access for NamUs. Federal government involvement in prevention has increased in recent years. The federal government has played a role in preventing missing adult incidents and recovering adults, including those who are deceased and only have remains as clues. Efforts include the DNA Initiative, National Missing Persons Task Force, and the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert program. The federal government has initiatives to prevent missing adult incidents and recover adults, including those with Alzheimer's disease. This includes the DNA Initiative, National Missing Persons Task Force, and activities funded under Kristen's Act. President George W. Bush announced the DNA Initiative in 2003 to use forensic DNA technology to solve crimes, protect individuals, and identify missing persons. Funding was provided from FY2004 through FY2008. The federal government has funded activities to assist in locating missing adults and unidentified remains through the DNA Initiative. This includes sample analysis, DNA collection kits, advanced DNA technologies, training on DNA identification, and the NamUs databases. In 2005, a national task force was established to improve efforts in identifying missing persons and unidentified remains. A national task force was established in 2005 to assess and improve the use of federal missing person databases and identify human remains. The task force, composed of criminal justice officials, forensic experts, and victim advocates, met to address issues related to information sharing tools and DNA technologies. They also created model state legislation to enhance law enforcement's ability to locate missing persons and identify remains. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorized the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert program to provide grants for locating missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Funding was set at $900,000 for each of FY1996, FY1997, and FY1998. The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert program, funded by Congress from FY1996 through FY2015, ranged from $750,000 to $2.0 million annually. Administered by DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance, grants were awarded to various entities like IACP and Alzheimer's Association to increase awareness among law enforcement agencies and the public in locating missing persons with Alzheimer's disease. The IACP provides resources and training on Alzheimer's and dementia for public safety administrators and law enforcement officers. BJA awarded funds to the Alzheimer's Association for the MedicAlert\u00ae + Alzheimer's Association Safe Return Program. Kristen's Act (P.L. 106-468) was passed by Congress in 2000. Kristen's Act (P.L. 106-468) was passed by Congress in 2000, named after Kristen Modafferi who went missing in 1997. The Act authorized funding for locating missing adults and maintaining a database for tracking endangered adults. Kristen's family initially couldn't access services for her disappearance due to age restrictions, but now NCMEC provides services for missing young adults aged 18 to 21. Suzanne's Law requires law enforcement to submit information about missing adults aged 18 through 20 to the NCIC. The National Center for Missing Adults, funded through Kristen's Act grants from FY2002 to FY2006, works to locate missing adults at risk due to age, mental capacity, and possible foul play. The organization merged with Let's Bring Them Home to expand efforts in recovering missing adults. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, part of the federally funded Missing and Exploited Children's Program, focuses on recovering missing children under 18. They also assist in cases of missing young adults aged 18-20 under Suzanne's Law, which requires law enforcement to submit information to the NCIC. NCMEC processes young adult cases differently, only accepting reports from law enforcement to verify concerns about the individual's whereabouts. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) assists in recovery efforts for missing adults with concerns about their whereabouts, including those with diminished mental capacity. A case manager is assigned to provide support to searching families and help locate abductors. Policymakers are focusing on coordinating databases and developing alert systems for missing older adults. Federal databases store information on missing persons and unidentified decedents but do not currently share data. The federal government is considering developing technology to coordinate databases for missing persons and unidentified decedents, although privacy and funding concerns need to be addressed. Alert systems like Silver or Senior Alerts have been established in multiple states to ensure the safety of seniors and at-risk adults prone to wandering. Some missing adult alert programs are modeled after the AMBER Alert system for abducted children. The alert systems for missing vulnerable adults vary by state and are not mandatory for law enforcement agencies. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the effectiveness of these alert systems for certain missing adults. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the effectiveness of alert systems for missing vulnerable adults, as broadcasting information about missing adults can infringe on their privacy rights. Policymakers may consider combining Silver Alerts with other policy approaches due to the desensitization of the public to missing adult cases and the fact that missing persons may not be found in well-trafficked areas. Unlike the AMBER Alert program for missing children, it is not a crime for adults to wander or go missing purposefully. Some stakeholders argue that states should have specific criteria for activating alerts for missing adults to preserve their privacy rights. Concerns have been raised about the limited criteria for issuing alerts, such as age being the primary factor, which may overlook other important factors indicating endangerment. Additionally, there are considerations about how much health information of a missing person can be disclosed to the public under HIPAA regulations. The federal rule limits disclosure of health information by health care providers. In 2011, DOJ published a guide for developing an Endangered Missing Advisory (EMA) for missing adults or children not meeting AMBER Alert criteria. The guide outlines steps for creating an EMA plan, including forming a task force with key stakeholders to oversee its operation. Adults may benefit from a different alert system than AMBER. The guide suggests that adults may benefit from a different type of alert system than AMBER Alert. States could face challenges coordinating with others that have different alert systems. The federal government could assist in coordinating efforts for missing individuals crossing state lines and developing formal agreements for interstate alerts based on the AMBER Alert program. The training and technical assistance provided to states on issues related to abducted children include coordination efforts across jurisdictions and the implementation of electronic monitoring services. Project Lifesaver International administers a program using personalized wristbands to track individuals at risk of going missing. Project Lifesaver is a Patient Alert program that uses personalized wristbands to track individuals prone to going missing. Law enforcement officers or volunteers replace wristband batteries monthly and provide referrals to clients and caregivers. When a client goes missing, a search and rescue team responds using a mobile locator tracking system. The program started with search and rescue efforts for missing persons with Alzheimer's and dementia but now includes children with special needs and others at risk. Project Lifesaver International provides tracking technology for individuals with special needs like autism and Down's syndrome, as well as those at risk of wandering for medical reasons. The program trains designated agencies to communicate with individuals with Alzheimer's and other disorders. The technology is used by law enforcement agencies nationwide, saving time and resources in locating missing persons. The Alzheimer's Association's Comfort Zone program also utilizes tracking technology with GPS for caregivers to monitor the individual's location. Tracking technology, such as GPS, is used by organizations like Project Lifesaver and the Alzheimer's Association's Comfort Zone program to monitor individuals with special needs or at risk of wandering. Caretakers can track the person's whereabouts online, receive alerts if they leave a specified area, and ensure consent and eligibility criteria are met. This technology raises concerns about privacy and autonomy rights. Individuals enrolled in Comfort Zone give consent, with caregivers sometimes providing consent as well. The program is designed for those in the early stages of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association."
