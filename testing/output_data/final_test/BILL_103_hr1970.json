Imported articles with tires are treated as the importer of the tires, and the sale of the article is considered the sale of the tires. Amounts received from these fees are deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury. The paragraph exempts the sale of automobile bus chassis or body from certain regulations. Amounts appropriated are transferred monthly from the General Fund to the Trust Fund based on estimates.
