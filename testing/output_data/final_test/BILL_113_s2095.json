    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veterans Health Care Access Received Closer to Home Act of 2014\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of providing healthcare access to veterans. The sense of Congress is that veterans receiving health care in the community must maintain high quality, safety, and care coordination similar to the VA system. Lack of coordination between VA and community providers can lead to poor health outcomes and inefficient use of resources. Veteran-centric care coordination improves patient outcomes through collaboration between healthcare teams. The Secretary must ensure cost-effective care for veterans from the private sector that complements the VA health care system. SEC. 3.
