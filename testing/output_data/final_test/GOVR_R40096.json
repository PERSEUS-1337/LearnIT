    "content": "Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA is required to set national air quality standards for pollutants that may endanger public health. The EPA reviews scientific studies every five years to update these standards for six criteria pollutants: particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, and lead. EPA revised NAAQS for particulate matter (PM) to protect against health effects from short- and long-term exposure. The 2006 update tightened the standard for PM 2.5 but not for PM 10. NAAQS sets pollution levels for public health protection, not emission limits. States and EPA identify nonattainment areas based on monitoring data. The EPA published final designations for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS on November 13, 2009, with a delayed effective date of December 14, 2009, due to review by the incoming Administration. This process involves states submitting nonattainment area State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to bring areas failing to meet the NAAQS into compliance with specific regulations and emission control requirements. The 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS was subject to national interest, debate, and oversight in Congress. Various groups challenged EPA's 2006 revisions in court, leading to a partial grant of petitions and remand of standards for further consideration. The decision did not vacate the standards, but prompted renewed interest in PM NAAQS among Members of Congress. EPA also began its periodic review of the standards alongside implementation of the 2006 PM NAAQS. EPA revised the PM NAAQS in January 2013, lowering the allowable average concentration of PM 2.5 in the air from 15 \u00b5g/m3 to 12 \u00b5g/m3. The existing daily standard for PM 2.5 was retained at 35 \u00b5g/m3. The standard for PM 10 particles was also maintained. The proposed rule for PM NAAQS in 2012 included options for a 24-hour PM 2.5 standard to improve visibility, which were not adopted in the final rule. The focus is on the NAAQS implementation process for designating geographical nonattainment areas under the 2006 particulates NAAQS, with comparisons to the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. EPA did not require new nonattainment designations for PM 10 based on the 2006 revisions. The EPA did not require new nonattainment designations for PM 10 based on the 2006 revisions to the standard. States have subsequent obligations for developing and submitting SIPs for compliance with the NAAQS. Appendices provide timelines for implementing the 2006 and 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, breakdowns of nonattainment areas, and information on tribes included in nonattainment designations. The Clean Air Act establishes primary standards to protect public health. The EPA sets primary standards to protect public health by limiting PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations on a daily and annual basis. Compliance is measured by monitoring stations not exceeding set limits. The EPA sets primary standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations to protect public health. The daily standard for PM 2.5 was tightened to 35 \u00b5g/m3, while the daily standard for PM 10 remained at 150 \u00b5g/m3 with no more than one exceedance per year on average over three years. The EPA's decision to strengthen the daily standard for PM 2.5 had implications for designated nonattainment areas, but not for PM 10. Designating areas based on air quality data is a critical step in NAAQS implementation. The NAAQS designation process involves identifying areas as attainment or nonattainment based on air quality standards. States and tribes provide recommendations to the EPA for consideration. Areas are designated as nonattainment if they violate NAAQS, while attainment/uncertified areas meet the standards or have insufficient data. Governors submit lists of nonattainment areas to the EPA as part of the process. The EPA Administrator has discretion to modify area boundaries after state and tribal submissions for NAAQS compliance. States and tribes are notified of any modifications and can provide input, but the final decision rests with the EPA. Monitoring air quality is crucial for determining NAAQS compliance, with designations based on three years of monitoring data. The network of monitors for PM 2.5 was established in 1999-2000. The EPA modified the network of monitors for PM 2.5 from 1999 through 2000. In 2006, monitoring requirements were amended to improve technology. Final designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS were based on data from 2006 to 2008. Factors like population density and urbanization are considered in determining air quality. Factors influencing air quality designations include population density, urbanization, growth rates, traffic patterns, weather, and geography. Nonattainment areas are identified based on pollutant concentrations exceeding standards, with entire metropolitan areas often designated nonattainment. States and tribes can provide additional relevant information for EPA consideration. EPA published guidelines on November 13, 2009, regarding air quality designations. On November 13, 2009, EPA designated 31 areas in 18 states as nonattainment for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard, comprising 120 counties. The map in Figure 1 shows the counties designated as nonattainment. EPA also published final designations for three areas in the February 3, 2011, Federal Register. EPA deferred designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS to evaluate high fine particle concentrations. Pinal County, AZ, was designated as nonattainment, while surrounding counties were labeled unclassifiable/attainment. Designations for Indian communities and counties in California were also deferred. EPA's final designations in November 2009 were based on air quality data from 2006-2008 and did not include counties violating the annual standard. The EPA's final designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard differed from the initial ones based on air quality monitoring data from 2005 through 2007. The revised designations included 58 areas in 25 states, comprising 211 counties, for nonattainment of the standard. This included portions of tribal lands and counties from multiple states. The EPA delayed the publication of the final designation rule for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS due to a review by the current Administration. The delay resulted in a change in designations based on more recent monitoring data from 2006-2008, pushing back the expected effective date from April 2009. The final designation rule for the 2006 PM NAAQS was delayed to December 14, 2009. Most U.S. counties were designated as attainment/unclassifiable. Nonattainment counties have larger populations, with over 70 million people living in them. The CAA does not require combining neighboring counties in nonattainment areas. The 2006 PM 2.5 standards did not use Metropolitan Statistical Areas as boundaries for nonattainment areas. Instead, EPA instructed states to evaluate areas case-by-case, including counties with monitors violating the standard and nearby counties contributing to the violation. States were advised to consider common boundaries for both annual and 24-hour PM 2.5 standards. EPA recommended using air emission and quality data, along with other relevant factors, for designation. States used quality data and other relevant factors recommended by EPA to determine boundaries for designated areas for the 2006 revised particulates NAAQS. By December 2007, 20 states provided EPA with recommended nonattainment boundaries based on monitoring data from 2004 to 2006. The states identified 46 areas comprising 116 counties. EPA responded with modifications to the area designation recommendations in August 2008. The EPA identified 57 areas in 26 states for designation as nonattainment for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard. States had 120 days to respond to EPA's recommendations, and a 30-day public comment period was also issued. EPA used discretion to expand nonattainment areas and combine counties across state lines if part of the same metropolitan area. The EPA issued a notice for a 30-day public comment period regarding the proposed nonattainment areas for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. Some states challenged the agency's recommendations and maintained their original suggestions. The final designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS resulted in fewer nonattainment areas/counties than initially proposed. EPA's final designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS published in November 2009 included fewer nonattainment counties and areas than identified in December 2008. The final nonattainment designation areas included fewer states and counties compared to the initial proposals and recommendations by the states. EPA's final designations for nonattainment of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS included 204 counties in 20 areas. The designated nonattainment areas for the 1997 24-hour and annual PM 2.5 NAAQS are primarily concentrated in central, mid-Atlantic, and southeastern states east of the Mississippi River, as well as in California. More than 2,900 counties in 30 states were designated attainment/unclassifiable for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Table 1 illustrates the comparative geographic distribution of counties designated nonattainment for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. Based on the final designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS, 38 counties would be designated nonattainment for PM 2.5 for the first time. The majority of counties identified for nonattainment for PM 2.5 overlap with EPA's final designations for the 1997 NAAQS. Tightening the 24-hour standard led to 82 counties being designated nonattainment for exceeding both the 24-hour and annual standards. The overlap of nonattainment areas may impact current control measures. The impacts of current control measures on areas designated for nonattainment of PM 2.5 standards vary depending on factors like emission sources, topography, and weather. Designations play a crucial role in guiding regulatory actions to reduce fine particle pollution at the state, local, and tribal levels. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), states must implement new regulations to control pollution and issue revised air permits. The EPA sets nationwide standards for criteria pollutants, with states responsible for limiting emissions and regulating polluting entities. States must submit plans within three years of new air quality standards to show they can meet requirements. Areas designated as attainment/unclassifiable must prevent air quality deterioration, while nonattainment areas require detailed control plans from state, local, and tribal governments. State, local, and tribal governments must submit detailed plans to meet the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS to the EPA by December 2012. If states fail to develop an adequate plan, EPA can impose one. States are required to meet the standard within five years, by December 2014, unless an extension is granted. Within three years of a new NAAQS, states must submit revised SIPs for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement. States must submit SIPs for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS, addressing elements such as air quality monitoring, enforcement programs, resources, and interstate pollution transport prohibition. SIPs must demonstrate the ability to prohibit emissions that contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment of the NAAQS. States and local governments must develop and implement new or revised plans (SIPs) to address emissions in nonattainment areas that do not meet the NAAQS. These plans include pollution control measures implemented by federal, state, and local governments to demonstrate attainment of air quality standards. SIPs must identify specific regulations and emissions limitations. SIPs in nonattainment areas must identify regulations, emissions limitations, and monitoring provisions to achieve compliance with air quality standards. Some areas designated nonattainment for PM 2.5 NAAQS in 2006 overlapped with those designated in 1997 but failed to meet the revised 24-hour standard. This could require significant modifications to existing SIPs in some areas. In February 2006, EPA suggested states consider control strategies for achieving compliance with both the 1997 and 2006 PM 2.5 standards. The implementation rule for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, published in April 2007, provides guidance for meeting the 2006 standards, outlining requirements for states and tribes to achieve and maintain attainment through control strategies in their SIPs. The implementation rule provides guidance for submitting a SIP when reaching attainment within the five-year requirement is impractical, considering federal regulations controlling pollutants. EPA outlined implementation guidance for demonstrating attainment with the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS in a 2012 memorandum. EPA found multiple states had failed to submit SIPs addressing requirements for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. In August 2011, EPA issued FIPs through CSAPR to address emissions from 28 states affecting downwind states' compliance with air quality standards. The FIPs regulated emissions from electric generating units. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated and remanded CSAPR in August 2012, leading to a petition for rehearing filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in October 2012. The D.C. Circuit denied requests for en banc rehearing of the CSAPR decision on January 24, 2013. EPA notified several states and territories of incomplete infrastructure SIPs for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. Some submissions lacked required elements, particularly related to interstate requirements. EPA had approved portions of submissions from some states, anticipating emission reductions from national regulations to help achieve PM 2.5 attainment. National actions such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), and various emissions standards aim to help states achieve compliance with the PM 2.5 NAAQS. Stakeholders and some Members of Congress have expressed skepticism about these strategies. The EPA's Final Rule Amendments have faced skepticism from stakeholders and Members of Congress regarding corollary benefits and delays in regulations. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) was vacated in 2008, leading to the development of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was initially set to go into effect in 2012 but was delayed and eventually vacated in 2012 by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. Department of Justice sought a rehearing of the decision, which was denied in 2013. The EPA has also delayed the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) and other rules, causing disruptions in implementation. The 2006 revised PM 2.5 NAAQS implementation has been disrupted by new source review (NSR) requirements, which aim to prevent violations of air quality standards from newly constructed or modified facilities. NSR rules vary for sources subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) or nonattainment provisions. EPA's May 2008 rule outlined NSR program requirements for sources emitting PM 2.5 and its precursors. The EPA published a final rule in 2010 amending requirements under the Clean Air Act PSD program for PM 2.5, establishing components for air quality modeling and monitoring provisions. This rule includes maximum allowable increases in ambient pollutant concentrations, screening tools like SILs and SMC for PM 2.5 to assess impact on air quality, and mechanisms to estimate significant deterioration of ambient air quality. The EPA repealed the grandfathering provision in the NSR permitting program for PM 2.5 in response to petitions. The PM 10 Surrogate Policy remains in place, allowing sources to demonstrate compliance with PSD requirements for PM 10 as a surrogate for PM 2.5 requirements. The EPA repealed the grandfathering provision in the NSR permitting program for PM 2.5. States with EPA-approved PSD programs could use the PM 10 Surrogate Policy until May 2011 or until EPA approved the revised State Implementation Plan for PM 2.5. Transportation conformity is required to ensure federal funding for highway and transit projects align with air quality goals established by a SIP. The EPA published a final rule amending the transportation conformity regulation to incorporate changes in PM 2.5 and PM 10 air quality standards. The rule addresses hot-spot analyses for various pollutants and restructuring of conformity rule sections to apply to new or revised NAAQS. The EPA amended the transportation conformity regulation in response to changes in PM 2.5 and PM 10 air quality standards in July 2012. The designation of areas unable to meet the NAAQS is a critical step in implementation, with concerns raised by various stakeholders and a court decision in 2009. Compliance with the 2006 revised PM 2.5 standards poses challenges for states. The EPA recently completed a review of the particulates NAAQS and revised the PM 2.5 standards in January 2013. Final designations of areas as nonattainment for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS were published in November 2009, with a delayed effective date of December 2009. The designations were based on more current monitoring data from calendar years 2006-2008. The EPA had disagreements with states and stakeholders regarding final nonattainment designations for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS. States were required to demonstrate infrastructure capacity to implement the standards within three years. By December 19, 2012, detailed control requirements had to be submitted in plans to meet the standards. The EPA had disagreements with states and stakeholders over nonattainment designations for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Areas previously designated nonattainment for the 1997 standard now face challenges meeting the 24-hour standard. Concerns arise from court decisions vacating key regulations aimed at controlling air pollution emissions. Recent air quality trends show improvements in PM 2.5 concentrations nationally, with decreases in SO2 and NOx levels between 2001 and 2010. EPA expects air quality to continue to improve with the implementation of new regulations and states' efforts to meet current standards. Key regulations include rules for locomotive engines, marine compression-ignition engines, vehicles, and gasoline sulfur. The implementation of national regulations for various engines and vehicles, including the Tier 2 Vehicle and Gasoline Sulfur Rule, is expected to improve air quality and help nonattainment areas comply with the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Recent court decisions and EPA revisions have increased interest in these regulations, with potential implications varying by geographical area. The implementation milestones and attainment deadlines for the 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS are a concern for stakeholders, interest groups, and Congress. The timeline for implementing the 1997 and 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS is outlined in Table A-1, driven by statutory requirements. EPA's final and interim nonattainment designation areas are compared in the appendix. On December 22, 2008, EPA identified 58 areas in 25 states, comprising 211 counties, for nonattainment for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 standard based on air quality monitoring data from 2005 to 2007."
