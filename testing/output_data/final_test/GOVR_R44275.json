    "content": "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Puerto Rico's resident population was approximately 3.55 million in 2014, slightly smaller than Connecticut and Oklahoma but larger than Iowa and Mississippi. Population estimates for 2010-2014 show a steady decline. The population of Puerto Rico has been steadily declining from 2010-2014, with factors such as a decreasing birth rate, increasing death rate, and primarily out-migration contributing to this trend. Out-migrants are typically younger and less educated, leading to an aging demographic in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's GDP was $103.7 billion in FY2014, with a significant portion accruing to nonresidents due to the presence of U.S. multinational firms. Manufacturing accounted for 47.6% of GDP in 2014, followed by finance, insurance, and real estate (19.7%) and services (12.5%). The island has been in an economic downturn since 2006, with negative growth from 2006-2013, closely linked to the U.S. economy's recession from 2007-2009. Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2007 to 2009, with the expiration of certain tax benefits for U.S. businesses in 2006 contributing significantly. The territory faces serious fiscal challenges and is deeply in debt, with $72.8 billion in outstanding public debt in March 2014. Median household income was $18,928 in 2014, with a majority of households reporting incomes under $50,000. A potentially significant informal economy in Puerto Rico impacts household-income statistics. If households underreport income from informal-sector work, income statistics may not fully capture all market sources. In 2014, median household income in Puerto Rico was lower than any U.S. state. Mississippi had the lowest median household income at $39,680 in 2014. Assessing income differences requires information on local prices to determine true purchasing power. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis measures spatial price differences within the United States, revealing considerable variation across states. In 2013, price levels in DC were 17.7% higher than the national average, while Mississippi's prices were 13.2% below. Puerto Rico was not included in the BEA analysis but was found to have the lowest prices in exploratory research. In 2014, 46.2% of Puerto Rico's population lived below the poverty line, with children having the highest poverty rate. The informal economy in Puerto Rico affects poverty statistics. In 2014, the poverty rate in Puerto Rico was 46.2%, higher than the U.S. national rate and any U.S. state. Poverty statistics may be affected by omitting informal-sector earnings, leading to an overestimation of families below the poverty threshold. Comparing family income to a dollar threshold determines poverty status, with relative price differences between Puerto Rico and the 50 states being important for comparisons. The federal poverty threshold in Puerto Rico is not adjusted for local prices, leading to potential differences in purchasing power compared to the states. In April 2016, over 1 million individuals were employed and nearly 133,000 were unemployed in Puerto Rico. The number of employed workers decreased by 200,000 while the number of unemployed workers increased by more than 10,000 from January 2005 to April 2016. The unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 11.8% in March 2016, with a decrease of nearly 200,000 employed workers and an increase of over 10,000 unemployed workers. Informal sector employment in Puerto Rico may impact official statistics, as shown in a pilot study by Enchautegui and Freeman in 2004. Medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as disabled individuals under 65. It consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance), Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (prescription drug coverage). In FY2014, Medicare covered nearly 54 million seniors and disabled individuals at a cost of $606 billion to the federal government. Medicare Part A provides premium-free coverage to individuals who have paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters or receive cash disability benefits for 24 months from Social Security or Railroad Retirement system. The waiting period is waived for those with ALS, and individuals under 65 with ESRD who receive dialysis or a kidney transplant are also eligible for Part A. Medicare Part A provides coverage for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice benefits through specific payment methods like prospective payment systems. Providers are reimbursed under different PPSs for various services, excluding acute-care hospital care. Medicare Part A providers in Puerto Rico are reimbursed under the IPPS for inpatient hospital care, with base rates previously based on a combination of local and national costs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 aligned Puerto Rico's IPPS with the 50 states and DC, standardizing payment methods. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and subsequent legislation increased the national average costs proportion for hospitals in Puerto Rico under the IPPS. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 aligned Puerto Rican hospitals' IPPS base rates with those in the 50 states and DC, allowing them to receive the same reimbursements and add-on payments as other IPPS hospitals. Puerto Rican hospitals face limitations in receiving certain special adjustments and quality-related programs available to other IPPS hospitals in the U.S. However, a provision in the CAA 16 made acute-care hospitals in Puerto Rico eligible for Medicare EHR incentive payments. Only acute-care hospitals in the 50 states and DC were eligible for Medicare EHR incentive payments. Hospitals had to become meaningful users of certified EHR technology to receive payments for up to four years. FY2016 was the last year for hospitals in the 50 states and DC to receive these payments, based on a formula considering Medicare patient share and charity care. The CAA 16 extended deadlines for Puerto Rican hospitals to qualify for Medicare EHR incentive payments, allowing them to receive payments from FY2016 to FY2020. Eligible hospitals not demonstrating meaningful EHR use face payment adjustments starting in FY2015. The CAA 16 extended deadlines for Puerto Rican hospitals to qualify for Medicare EHR incentive payments until FY2020. Hospitals not demonstrating meaningful EHR use will face payment adjustments starting in FY2022. Eligible IPPS hospitals can receive additional DSH payments to offset the financial effects of treating low-income patients. The DSH payment adjustments are based on the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (DPP) exceeding a threshold. The ACA modified DSH funding to distribute payments based on traditional DPP but reduced payment adjustments by 75%. The ACA modified DSH funding to distribute payments based on traditional DPP but reduced payment adjustments by 75%. The remaining 75% of DSH payments would be distributed as uncompensated-care payments, which are calculated as an aggregate dollar amount and distributed to each hospital through the IPPS payment. Uncompensated-care payments are based on each hospital's share of uncompensated care and are reduced over time by changes in the rate of individuals without health insurance in the United States. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is transitioning from using Medicare SSI and Medicaid inpatient days as a proxy for uncompensated care to using hospital-submitted cost reports. This transition is set to be complete by FY2020. Advocates argue that the current DSH payment-adjustment formula disadvantages hospitals in Puerto Rico, as they are ineligible for SSI benefits. Beginning in FY2017, the Secretary proposed using 14% of a Puerto Rican DSH hospital's Medicaid days as a proxy for SSI days in calculating uncompensated care. This proxy will determine each hospital's share of uncompensated care payments, based on Medicaid inpatient days plus an additional 14% in FY2017. The transition to using hospital-submitted cost reports for uncompensated care calculations is set to be complete by FY2020. Using 14% of Medicaid days as a proxy for SSI days, Puerto Rican DSH hospitals will receive increased uncompensated care payments. CMS estimates a rise of 11.2% in FY2017. However, future payments may decline if the rate of uninsured individuals in the US decreases. Medicare Part A beneficiaries can opt for Part B for additional coverage. Beneficiaries have the option to enroll in Medicare Part B for coverage of various medical services. Automatic enrollment applies to residents of the 50 states and DC, but not Puerto Rico. Those receiving Social Security benefits are automatically enrolled in Parts A and B when they turn 65. Disabled individuals receiving cash payments are also enrolled in Part B unless they decline. Beneficiaries not automatically enrolled in Medicare must apply for Part B during their initial enrollment period, which lasts seven months starting three months before turning 65. Failure to sign up may result in a late-enrollment penalty. Premium assistance through Medicaid's Medicare Savings Program is available for low-income beneficiaries. Residents of Puerto Rico who receive Social Security benefits are automatically enrolled in Part A when they turn 65, but they must sign up for Part B during their initial enrollment period to avoid penalties. This exclusion from automatic enrollment in Part B is due to most residents being eligible for Puerto Rico's state Medicaid program, which covers similar benefits. The lack of automatic Part B enrollment in Puerto Rico has led to a disproportionate number of beneficiaries paying late-enrollment penalties, with 4.2% in 2010 compared to 1.4% nationally. Without an MSP program, low-income beneficiaries may struggle to afford these penalties on top of their premiums. Medicare payments for physician and non-physician services are based on a fee schedule in the 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. The Medicare physician fee schedule assigns relative value units to service codes reflecting physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice costs. Geographic practice cost indexes adjust for regional input cost variations. The Medicare physician fee schedule assigns relative value units to service codes reflecting physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice costs. Geographic practice cost indexes adjust for regional input cost variations. Medicare Advantage (Part C, or MA) is an alternative way for Medicare beneficiaries to receive covered benefits through private health plans paid a monthly amount per person. Puerto Rico has its own locality with GPCIs for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice insurance. In Puerto Rico, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are popular, with 75% of beneficiaries enrolled compared to 32% in the 50 states and DC. Over half of Puerto Rican enrollees are in Special Needs Plans (SNPs), which cater to those who are institutionalized, dual-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, or have severe chronic conditions. Nearly half of Puerto Rican SNP enrollees are dual-eligible individuals. Enrollees in Puerto Rico's popular Medicare Advantage plans, with a high percentage in Special Needs Plans for dual-eligible individuals, have their capitated monthly payments determined by comparing bids to benchmarks. Plans with bids below the benchmark receive a rebate for additional benefits or reduced costs, while plans with bids equal to or above the benchmark require enrollees to pay an additional premium. Payments are risk-adjusted for fairness. The benchmark methodology for determining payments in Medicare Advantage plans has evolved over time, shifting from encouraging private plan participation to payment neutrality with original Medicare. Prior to 1997, private plans were paid based on Medicare per capita fee-for-service spending in each county. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Medicare+Choice program and a new payment formula. Plans with bids below the benchmark receive rebates, while those equal to or above require additional premiums from enrollees. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 introduced the Medicare+Choice program with a payment formula designed to control spending by slowing payment growth in high-expenditure areas and raising payments in low-expenditure areas. It also aimed to blend local rates towards a national average over time. The formula included a floor rate to encourage participation in underserved areas. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 created a second floor rate for counties within metropolitan statistical areas with a population of over 250,000. Private plan participation initially expanded but then retracted through 2003. The Medicare+Choice program introduced in 1997 aimed to control spending by slowing payment growth and raising payments in low-expenditure areas. Private plan participation initially expanded but retracted through 2003. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 replaced the M+C program with the Medicare Advantage program and added an optional outpatient prescription drug benefit. The Medicare Advantage program used rates from the M+C program as benchmarks, increasing yearly by overall Medicare spending growth. In certain years designated as rebasing years, benchmarks were set at the greater of the previous year's benchmark or projected per capita FFS spending. This methodology led to increased benchmarks, plan participation, and enrollment. However, benchmarks set above per capita spending in original Medicare resulted in higher spending to provide benefits to MA enrollees. In 2010, benchmarks for all MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 17%. The ACA changed the benchmark calculation for Medicare Advantage plans to establish neutrality between payments to plans and expenditures under original Medicare. County benchmarks are now set at a percentage of FFS spending, ranging from 95% to 115%, with higher percentages for counties with lower FFS spending. The 25% of counties with the lowest FFS spending will receive the highest percentage (115%) of per capita FFS as their MA benchmark. The ACA changed the benchmark calculation for Medicare Advantage plans to establish neutrality between payments to plans and expenditures under original Medicare. County benchmarks are now set at a percentage of FFS spending, ranging from 95% to 115%, with higher percentages for counties with lower FFS spending. The transition to the new methodology will take place over two, four, or six years, with a longer transition period for counties expected to have larger benchmark decreases. 27% of counties are still transitioning to the ACA benchmark calculation methodology as of 2015. Benchmarks for all MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 7%, and payments to MA plans exceeded estimated FFS spending by 2%. Since 1997, three provisions have set or calculated the payment (or benchmark) for Puerto Rico differently relative to the 50 states and DC. The payment rates in Puerto Rico for 1998 reflected the change specified by BBA97 and ranged from $223 to $367 per person per month, with an enrollee-weighted average payment of $302 per person per month. The new payments for Puerto Rico were often less than payments in the 50 states and DC due to low per capita FFS spending. The BIPA payment provision also differed for Puerto Rico and the other territories, establishing a second minimum payment rate. The urban floor rate for qualifying counties in the 50 states and DC was set at $525 for 2001, while Puerto Rico had payment rates ranging from $243 to $401 per person per month in 2000. The urban floor calculation for Puerto Rico under BIPA was lower than the $525 level specified for the 50 states and DC. Until the ACA, all other payment provisions applied to Puerto Rico in the same manner as in the 50 states. In Puerto Rico, benchmarks for county-level payments rose above per capita FFS spending levels, reaching 180% of estimated FFS spending in 2009. The ACA introduced a different payment provision for Puerto Rico, where benchmarks are not included in the original calculation of county quartiles like in the 50 states and DC. The ACA methodology in Puerto Rico results in a decrease in MA benchmarks, transitioning from 180% to 115% of FFS spending. Part D of the MMA established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, effective January 1, 2006. Medicare provides subsidies for prescription drug coverage through Medicare Advantage plans, with enhanced coverage for low-income individuals. States make annual payments to help cover costs for low-income enrollees. The MMA shifted drug benefits for dual-eligible individuals from Medicaid to Part D. The MMA shifted prescription drug coverage for dual-eligible individuals to Part D, with states contributing $8.8 billion in 2013. Dual-eligible beneficiaries automatically qualify for Part D low-income subsidies based on income and assets. Eligibility is also extended to those receiving assistance from Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income. The Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) program provides assistance to individuals with limited incomes and resources for their Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. Eligibility is determined based on income and assets, with cost sharing varying accordingly. Beneficiaries eligible for the full subsidy have no annual deductible and minimal cost sharing, and may not pay monthly premiums if they enroll in lower-cost plans. The Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) program provides assistance for Medicare Part D coverage based on income and assets. Low-income Part D enrollees have higher cost sharing and premium assistance. Residents of territories are not eligible for LIS but receive Medicaid funding for prescription drug coverage through the enhanced allotment program (EAP). Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances medical services for low-income populations. In FY2014, it provided healthcare to 63 million individuals at a cost of $494 billion, with the federal government covering 61% of the total. Residents of territories are excluded from the Low-Income Subsidy (LIS) program but receive Medicaid funding for prescription drug coverage through the enhanced allotment program (EAP). Medicaid is a federal-state program that finances medical services for low-income populations. The federal government pays $299 billion (about 61% of the total cost) and allows states to cover optional populations and services. The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of FPL. Puerto Rico operates a voluntary Medicaid program with 1.4 million enrollees in July 2014. Puerto Rico's Medicaid program had 1.4 million enrollees with total expenditures of $1.8 billion in FY2014, with the federal government covering $1.1 billion. Territories operate Medicaid programs under different rules compared to states and DC, with major differences in eligibility and benefits. American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands operate under Section 1902(j) authority, allowing waivers or modifications to Medicaid requirements. The five territories have the same federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) rate of 55%, while states and DC vary from 50% to 83%. Territories Medicaid programs have annual federal spending caps, totaling $378.3 million in FY2015. Since January 1, 2014, Puerto Rico has had an approved Medicaid state plan to provide coverage to residents with income up to at least 133% of the Puerto Rican poverty line. Puerto Rico's Medicaid income-eligibility levels are lower than federal mandatory levels for children and pregnant women, but slightly higher for parents. Puerto Rico provides Medicaid coverage to individuals with disabilities, the elderly, and other adults. While eligibility for parents is slightly higher than the mandatory level, the state does not provide coverage to able-bodied, non-elderly adults. However, 30 states and DC offer coverage to this population through the ACA Medicaid expansion. In 2012, 46% of Puerto Rican residents had Medicaid coverage, compared to 18% in the 50 states and DC. Puerto Rico does not provide all mandatory Medicaid benefits, such as nursing facility and home health services. Children covered by Puerto Rico's Medicaid program receive limited benefits from EPSDT services. Managed care is exclusively used to provide Medicaid coverage in Puerto Rico. In Medicaid, benefits are provided through fee-for-service or managed care delivery systems. Managed care has become more prevalent since the 1990s, with about 72% of enrollees covered by it in FY2011. Puerto Rico uses a managed-care model called Mi Salud for Medicaid coverage. Puerto Rico offers Medicaid coverage through a managed-care model called Mi Salud. Dual-eligible individuals can also participate in Medicare Platino, which provides Medicare and Medicaid services. Puerto Rico has a 55% FMAP rate for most Medicaid expenditures, with an additional 2.2 percentage point increase for certain individuals. The expansion state FMAP rate for Puerto Rico was 78% in 2014, receiving almost $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid funding through various sources. Puerto Rico's Medicaid allotment in FY2014 was $321 million, fully utilized, followed by $803 million from ACA Medicaid funding after exhausting the allotment funds. Puerto Rico has access to additional federal Medicaid funds for specific activities, including Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Program payments and funding for the Medicaid Management Information System. Additionally, Puerto Rico receives 1935(e) funding instead of low-income subsidies under Medicare Part D. The territory also received an extra $6.4 billion in funding through the ACA. The ACA provides additional Medicaid funding to Puerto Rico and other territories, with Puerto Rico receiving $5.5 billion in ACA Medicaid funding. In FY2014, Puerto Rico used $803 million of this funding, comprising 71% of federal Medicaid funding. Puerto Rico has almost $3.2 billion of the funding remaining for FY2015 through FY2019. Additionally, territories without a health insurance exchange are entitled to increased Medicaid funds under Section 1323 of the ACA. The ACA provides increased Medicaid funds to territories like Puerto Rico, which receives $0.9 billion. Territories can access federal Section 1935(e) funding for Medicaid instead of low-income subsidies under Medicare Part D. Approved plans for prescription drug coverage for low-income Medicare beneficiaries result in additional federal funds through Medicaid. Puerto Rico is eligible for federal Section 1935(e) funding since 2006, matching funds at a 55% rate. In FY2014, Puerto Rico received a $42 million allotment but only used $17 million. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to low-income children and pregnant women. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides coverage to low-income children and pregnant women in families with income above Medicaid-eligibility levels but no health insurance. Federal rules for CHIP in territories are the same as for states. States have flexibility to design their own CHIP programs within federal guidelines, with significant variation. Federal government reimburses states for a portion of CHIP expenses up to state-specific annual limits. States can design CHIP programs as a Medicaid expansion, separate program, or combination. Benefit coverage and cost-sharing rules vary based on program design. Puerto Rico's CHIP program provides coverage to children with family incomes up to 266% of the Puerto Rican poverty line. It operates as a CHIP Medicaid expansion, with 99,340 enrollees in July 2014. Total expenditures in FY2014 were $214.9 million, with the federal government paying $149.5 million. Puerto Rico's federal CHIP expenditures exceeded its FY2014 allotment due to eligibility for redistribution funds. Puerto Rico received CHIP redistribution funds in FY2012 and FY2013, being the only state or territory to receive them since FY2009. Private insurance in Puerto Rico is not as common as in the 50 states and DC, with approximately 38.3% of individuals having private insurance in 2014. The ACA provisions affecting private health insurance market apply to Puerto Rico, but their application varies and is not explicitly stated in statute. In Puerto Rico, private insurance coverage is less common compared to the 50 states and DC. Approximately 38.3% of individuals had private insurance in 2014. The ACA includes market reforms that apply to group and non-group health insurance plans, imposing requirements on sponsors of coverage and establishing federal standards for access to coverage, premiums, benefits, and consumer protections. For example, dependent coverage must be extended to children under 26, and essential health benefits must be covered by some private health insurance plans. HHS determined in 2014 that market reforms under the ACA do not apply to health insurance issuers in Puerto Rico. However, the reforms could still apply to group health plans. The market reforms under the ACA do not apply to health insurance issuers in Puerto Rico, but they could still apply to group health plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code. Group health plans in territories must comply with the Affordable Care Act amendments to the Public Health Service (PHS) Act. The Affordable Care Act market reforms do not apply to health insurance issuers in Puerto Rico, but they may still apply to group health plans under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. Puerto Rico has not established an ACA health insurance exchange, but could have done so by October 1, 2013. Territories like Puerto Rico had until October 1, 2013, to establish exchanges and receive federal funding for premium and cost-sharing assistance. Section 1323 of the ACA allocated $1 billion for this purpose from 2014 to 2019. Puerto Rico did not establish an exchange, so it is entitled to increased Medicaid funds instead. Under the ACA, individuals purchasing coverage through an exchange may qualify for premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies aimed at lower-income individuals. Puerto Rico, not having established an exchange, does not have access to these benefits. Small businesses using a SHOP exchange may be eligible for a small business health insurance tax credit to make coverage more affordable. The small business tax credits are not available in Puerto Rico as they have not established an exchange. Puerto Rican businesses are treated as foreign businesses for U.S. tax purposes and may claim the general business credit. Under the ACA, large employers may face penalties for not providing affordable health insurance to their full-time employees and dependents. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most individuals to have health insurance or pay a penalty, but exemptions exist. Puerto Rico, as a non-mirror territory, is not required to implement provisions like the employer mandate or individual mandate under its tax laws. Residents of Puerto Rico are considered to have coverage that complies with the individual mandate."
