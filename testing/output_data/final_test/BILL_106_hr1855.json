Television is a pervasive presence in American homes, with the average household having 2.5 televisions and a TV being on for 7 hours a day. Children spend an average of 21 hours a week watching TV, which can influence their perceptions and behaviors. Research shows a strong link between children's exposure to TV violence and behavioral issues. Numerous studies confirm that kids who regularly watch violent programs are more likely to display aggressive behavior and become desensitized to real-life violence. Sexual content on TV also has a significant impact on children. Research suggests that heavy exposure to TV programming with strong sexual content can lead to early sexual activity among teenagers. The National Association of Broadcasters adhered to a code of conduct emphasizing the careful selection of program subjects to responsibly use television's influence. The National Association of Broadcasters emphasizes responsible program selection to avoid sensationalism or exploitation. Broadcasters have a special responsibility towards children, ensuring programs cater to a range of interests for their balanced development. Violence, whether physical or psychological, is cautioned against in programming. The National Association of Broadcasters emphasizes responsible program selection to avoid sensationalism or exploitation, especially towards children. Violence should only be portrayed in responsible contexts, with a focus on the consequences for victims and perpetrators. Marriage, family, and sexual content should be treated sensitively, considering the family atmosphere in which programs are viewed. Graphic portrayal of sexual acts is prohibited. The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned its code of conduct in 1983 after legal challenges regarding advertising restrictions, but its programming standards were never found to violate antitrust laws. The code emphasized responsible program selection to avoid sensationalism or exploitation, especially towards children, and prohibited graphic portrayal of sexual acts. In 1983, the National Association of Broadcasters abandoned its code of conduct, leading to a decline in programming standards on broadcast and cable television. Public concern over the graphic nature of content has increased, with over 80% of Americans worried about the portrayal of sex, violence, and criminal behavior on TV. Congress has urged the television industry to address these concerns by improving programming standards and content. In 1992, the broadcast television industry agreed to guidelines to limit violence portrayal. In 1996, a rating system for harmful content was implemented. Despite efforts, many Americans, especially parents, are still unhappy with TV standards. The Department of Justice ruled in 1993 that voluntary programming guidelines by the television industry would not violate antitrust laws. These guidelines could provide valuable information on program content to advertisers and viewers, potentially increasing demand and output. The Children's Television Act of 1990 mandates that US television broadcasters must cater to the educational needs of children. However, analyses show that broadcasters have not met this obligation or increased educational programming since the Act's enactment. The popularity of educational and harmless video and PC games among children is on the rise. Violent video games, despite being popular among teenagers and even elementary school children, often glamorize violence with players rewarded for \"kills\". The graphic and extreme nature of these games can negatively influence impressionable children. Music is a popular form of entertainment among American children and teenagers, with teens listening to an average of 10,500 hours of rock or rap music between 7th and 12th grades. Teens are heavy purchasers of music, often favoring genres that depict violence. Music has the power to influence perceptions, attitudes, and emotional states, with potential benefits for emotional, psychological, and physical health. The section \"SEC. 3. PURPOSES; CONSTRUCTION\" outlines the objectives and interpretation of the following content. The Act aims to allow the entertainment industry to address concerns about the negative impact of television programming, movies, video games, Internet content, and music lyrics on children. It seeks to create voluntary guidelines similar to the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters and implement them to promote educational and informational programming for children in the United States. This Act does not give the Federal Government new authority to restrict television programming, movies, video games, Internet content, or music lyrics beyond what is already allowed by law. It also does not endorse any additional government actions to restrict such content beyond what is already in place. SEC. 4. Exemption of voluntary agreements on guidelines for certain entertainment material from applicability of antitrust laws. Exemption from antitrust laws for joint discussions in the entertainment industry to create voluntary guidelines for appropriate content and educational material for children, with limitations on boycotts and advertising transactions. The section discusses regulations on advertising in the entertainment industry, including restrictions on product advertisement, commercial interruptions, and consecutive commercials. Definitions for \"antitrust laws\" and \"Internet\" are also provided. The curr_chunk discusses the use of TCP/IP or any successor protocol for transmitting information, defines \"movies\" as theatrical motion pictures, and outlines the term \"person in the entertainment industry\" including various entities involved in television, film, video games, and music production and distribution. The curr_chunk defines \"telecast\" as any program broadcast by a television station or transmitted by a cable system, and includes entities involved in music production and distribution."
