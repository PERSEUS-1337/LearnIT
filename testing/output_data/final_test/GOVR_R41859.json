    "content": "Many states have made changes to their Unemployment Compensation (UC) programs in response to financial stress and concerns about program integrity. These changes aim to reduce costs by cutting the duration and weekly benefit amount of UC benefits. The UC program provides up to 26 weeks of income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs. The EB program can extend benefits by 13 or 20 weeks in certain economic situations. The EUC08 program, which expired in 2014, offered additional weeks of benefits to workers who had exhausted their UC rights. The UC program offers up to 26 weeks of benefits for eligible workers who lose their jobs, while the EB program can extend benefits in certain economic situations. The EUC08 program, which expired in 2014, provided additional weeks of benefits to workers who had exhausted their UC rights. UC benefits are determined by each state, resulting in 53 different programs. Eligibility is based on qualified wages and employment in a 12-month base period. States vary in methods used to determine monetary eligibility, with most replacing half of a claimant's average weekly wage. UC programs typically pay benefits for up to 26 weeks, funded by state taxes on UC-covered wages. States have the discretion to offer fewer than 26 weeks as the maximum UC benefit duration. Prior to recent state law changes, most states provided up to 26 weeks of UC benefits, with exceptions in Montana (up to 28 weeks) and Massachusetts (up to 30 weeks). Federal law does not mandate a 26-week maximum for UC benefits. In 2008, the EUC08 program was created under the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008. The EUC08 program was a federally financed unemployment insurance program created to extend the number of potential weeks of UC available to eligible individuals during an economic slowdown. It was administered by state UC agencies and expired on January 1, 2014. No EUC08 benefits are currently available. The benefit amount was equal to the individual's weekly regular UC benefits, with four tiers available. Tier I was available in all states (except North Carolina) for up to 14 weeks. The EB program provides extended unemployment benefits in states meeting economic criteria based on TUR or IUR levels. Tier I to Tier IV offer varying weeks of benefits, with Tier IV available in states with a TUR of at least 9%. The program was established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The EB program imposes federal restrictions on eligibility for benefits, requiring 20 weeks of full-time employment in the base period and a work search. States must now pay EUC08 benefits before EB benefits. EB benefits are funded equally by the federal government and states, with temporary 100% federal financing under P.L. 111-5. The EB program, under P.L. 111-5, temporarily had 100% federal funding for EB benefits from February 2009 to December 2013. The EB benefit amount is based on the individual's weekly UC benefits. States can pay EB benefits through an EB Unemployment Period or an EB High Unemployment Period, providing up to 13 additional weeks of benefits for eligible individuals. The EB program provides up to 20 additional weeks of benefits to eligible individuals during an EB High Unemployment Period. The UC system aims to counter economic fluctuations, with revenue increasing during economic growth and creating a surplus for use during recessions. During a recession, UC tax revenue falls and program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits, injecting additional funds into the economy. States paid out large amounts of UC benefits during the 2007-2009 recession, leading to outstanding federal loans in many states. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 36 states depleted their state unemployment tax act revenues and took out federal loans to continue paying UC benefits. During the 2007-2009 recession, states faced financial stress due to increased UC expenditures and outstanding federal loans. To address this, states can reduce UC benefits, raise SUTA taxes, or use a combination of both. State legislative actions were influenced by the recession, leading to reductions in UC benefits and program integrity concerns. During the 2011-2015 period, there was a significant increase in state and federal expenditures on unemployment benefits, including EB and EUC08 programs. States faced administrative pressure to maintain program integrity as improper UC payments peaked at $17.5 billion in FY2010. Congress has been actively involved in reducing UC program errors. During 2011-2015, Congress focused on reducing UC improper payments through new laws and hearings. DOL also prioritized program integrity efforts during this time. During 2011-2015, Congress and DOL prioritized program integrity efforts to reduce UC improper payments. States may have reduced UC benefits through changes in state laws, such as maximum duration or weekly benefit amount adjustments. States have historically decreased UC benefits during financial stress, but were temporarily restricted from doing so before the expiration of EUC08. States responded to financial crises by reducing UC benefit duration as an alternative to decreasing benefit amounts. This led to reductions in EB and EUC08 benefits in states with decreased maximum UC durations. For example, Arkansas reduced its state UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to 25 weeks in 2011, and further to 20 weeks in 2015. Arkansas reduced its UC maximum duration to 20 weeks in 2015 and to 16 weeks in 2018. Florida's maximum UC duration varies based on state unemployment rate, ranging from 12 to 23 weeks. Georgia's UC maximum duration ranges from 14 to 20 weeks depending on state unemployment rate. Idaho and Kansas have variable maximum UC durations based on state unemployment rates. Idaho offers up to 26 weeks of benefits, starting at 20 weeks for a 2.9% or lower unemployment rate. Kansas provides up to 16 weeks initially, with a maximum of 26 weeks if the unemployment rate is at least 8.0%. Michigan, Missouri, and Idaho have implemented changes to their Unemployment Compensation (UC) maximum duration based on state unemployment rates. Michigan reduced its UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to 20 weeks, effective January 15, 2012. Missouri also decreased its UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to 20 weeks, with a further reduction to a variable duration based on state unemployment rate in 2015. Idaho offers up to 26 weeks of benefits, starting at 20 weeks for a 2.9% or lower unemployment rate. The Missouri Supreme Court found a 2015 law reducing UC maximum duration unconstitutional, keeping it at 26 weeks. North Carolina now has a variable maximum duration based on state unemployment rate, ranging from 12 to 20 weeks. South Carolina also decreased its UC maximum duration. Illinois decreased UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to 25 weeks for calendar year 2012. States that reduced regular UC benefits also saw a decrease in EUC08 benefits. Formulas for EUC08 duration were based on state UC benefit duration. Adjusted EUC08 benefit durations are based on a weekly benefit amount of $300 and a new maximum UC duration of 20 weeks. Tier I of EUC08 lasts up to 10.8 weeks, with 10 weeks at $300 and the last week prorated at $240. Tier II of EUC08 also lasts up to 10.8 weeks, with up to 10 weeks at $300. Adjusted EUC08 benefit durations are calculated based on a weekly benefit amount of $300 and a maximum UC duration of 20 weeks. Tier III of EUC08 lasts up to 7 weeks at $300, while Tier IV lasts up to 7.8 weeks with the last week prorated at $240. EUC08 tier duration calculations for states with reduced regular UC benefit duration are provided in Table 2. The duration of Extended Benefits (EB) is calculated based on the individual's total regular Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits in a benefit year. State reductions in UC benefit durations lead to proportional reductions in EB payable periods. The formula for EB Unemployment Period Duration is 50% of the total regular UC benefits, while for EB High Unemployment Period Duration, it is 80%. An illustration with a weekly benefit amount of $300 and a maximum UC duration of 20 weeks shows adjusted EB durations. Table 2 displays EB payable period duration calculations for states with reduced UC benefit durations. P.L. 110-252 included a \"nonreduction\" rule to maintain UC benefit amounts to continue receiving EUC08 benefits. States were required to pay at least the same average weekly UC benefit amount as before June 2, 2010, to qualify for EUC08 benefits. As of June 2, 2010, states could reduce weekly benefits if required by state law before P.L. 111-5. Reduction in UC benefit amount also affects EUC08 and EB benefits. Some states automatically adjust UC benefits based on average weekly wage, leading to potential reductions in benefits. For example, in 2011, New Jersey and Oklahoma saw reductions, and in 2012, Hawaii also experienced similar conditions. In 2013, North Carolina violated the \"nonreduction\" rule by actively reducing UC weekly benefit amounts, leading to the termination of the EUC08 agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor. This resulted in the end of all tiers of EUC08 in North Carolina by June 29, 2013. The \"nonreduction\" rule was no longer effective on January 1, 2014, leading to reductions in UC, EUC08, and EB benefits for individuals filing new state UC claims after that date."
