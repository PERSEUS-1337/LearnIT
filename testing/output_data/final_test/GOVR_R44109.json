    "content": "The President appoints individuals to federal government positions, some with Senate confirmation. This report covers nominations to full-time positions in various organizations during the 113th Congress. During the 113th Congress, President Obama submitted 69 nominations for full-time positions in various agencies. 34 nominations were confirmed, 34 were returned, and 1 was pending. Information was compiled from various sources including the Senate nominations database, Congressional Record, agency websites, and the 2012 Plum Book. During the 113th Congress, President Obama submitted 69 nominations for full-time positions in various agencies. 34 nominations were confirmed, 34 were returned, and 1 was withdrawn. The average number of days elapsed between nomination and confirmation was 123.9, with a median of 104.0 days. Nominations not acted on by the Senate are returned to the President at the end of a session or before a 30-day recess. The report measures the \"days to confirm\" from the date of receipt of the resubmitted nomination. Agency profiles include tables listing full-time PAS positions and appointment actions during the 113th Congress. Data was collected from authoritative sources, with some agencies having no nomination activity. The tables identify each full-time PAS position and its pay level, falling under the Executive Schedule. The appointment action table provides information on nominations, including nominee names, positions, dates, and confirmation details. It also includes statistics on the time taken for confirmation, using mean and median days. The median is less influenced by outliers compared to the mean. Appendix A provides two tables: Table A-1 lists appointment actions alphabetically by appointee's last name, including agency, position title, nomination date, confirmation date, and duration count. It also shows mean and median values for \"days to confirm.\" Table A-2 summarizes appointments by agency type. The table in Appendix B summarizes the number of positions, nominations, confirmations, and withdrawals for agencies in the legislative branch, along with mean and median confirmation times. It also includes a list of department abbreviations."
