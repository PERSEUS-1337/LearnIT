In 2004, national average gasoline prices reached a record of $2.05 per gallon in mid-May, breaking the previous summer 2003 record. Crude oil prices also rose sharply, briefly exceeding $55 per barrel. By mid-May, the crude oil price increase to almost $42 per barrel accounted for as much as 20 cents per gallon of a total increase at the pump of 43 cents since the end of 2003. Pump prices are determined by the supply and demand for gasoline, with the cost of crude also factoring in. The high gasoline prices in 2004 were influenced by various supply-side factors, including the reliance on imports due to no new domestic refineries built in 25 years. Meeting U.S. clean air standards made foreign fuel availability challenging, with long transit times and vessel availability issues contributing to the price increase. Despite the rise in crude oil costs, gasoline prices exceeded the observed increase in 2004. Gasoline prices in the United States have surpassed previous records, with fluctuations of up to 55 cents per gallon since 2003. California's prices, which are higher than the national average, peaked at $2.45 per gallon in October 2004. The Daily Fuel Gauge Report online, sponsored by the American Automobile Association, provides information on spot oil prices and crude oil prices for the benchmark NYMEX traded crude oil, West Texas Intermediate. Gasoline prices peaked in May with crude oil averaging more than $40 per barrel on the NYMEX. Gasoline prices closely track crude oil prices, but peaks in gasoline prices in spring and late summer 2003, and May 2004, exceeded the increase in crude costs. While crude oil price increases are usually reflected at the pump, the divergence between gasoline and crude prices suggests changes in refining and marketing margins due to supply and demand imbalances. The recent spike in gasoline prices in fall 2004 coincided with an increase in crude prices, suggesting a cost push rather than demand pull. Gasoline prices are not regulated by the federal government, with past price controls leading to shortages and long lines at gas pumps. It is unclear if price controls effectively impacted retail prices. The concept of government-mandated price controls during periods of rapid price increases has seen little support as a policy option since the 1970s. U.S. gasoline inventories are shown in Figure 2, with the normal operating range highlighted. The Department of Energy places the lower operational inventory at 185 million barrels, which is the level at which sporadic physical shortages begin to appear nationwide. Gasoline inventories have fluctuated between normal ranges in 2004, with a difference of 15-30 million barrels from the DOE's minimum operating level. This represents about two to three days of supply from refiners' stocks. Gasoline prices in 2004 were influenced by fluctuations in crude oil stocks and gasoline inventories. The balance between inventories, seasonal driving demand, and refinery capacity impacted price volatility. Approximately 11% of gasoline was imported to meet demand. Monitoring both EIA's \"products supplied\" series and \"new gasoline supply\" is crucial for understanding gasoline supply dynamics. The \"productssupplied\" series and \"new gasoline supply\" data, compiled by EIA, show the flow of gasoline to consumers from inventory and the amount of newly available gasoline, including imports and refinery production. Gasoline production and imports have been monitored since 2002 to 2004, with a significant amount of blending components being imported as well. The EIA includes imported blending components in its series on refinery production to avoid double counting, as they are added to gasoline supplies at refineries and terminals. These components, although not produced in U.S. refineries, become part of U.S. gasoline supply once blended and meet marketability standards. Imports of gasoline and components peaked at 1.1 mbd in April 2003, with Venezuela historically being a supplier to the U.S. However, labor unrest has hindered refining operations, leading to sporadic supplies since late 2002. U.S. refineries have faced challenges in receiving reformulated gasoline supplies from Venezuela. U.S. refineries maintained gasoline production around 8.4 mbd in 2003, with capacity utilization between 92% and 96%. Refinery utilization typically drops in January for maintenance, but rose to 96% in April and May. This led to rising pump prices, with gasoline production peaking in August 2003 and declining through the winter. Gasoline production peaked in August 2003 and declined through the winter. Refinery production and imports increased as the 2004 driving season approached, with over 9.1 mbd available in early May. Gasoline supplied, including inventory withdrawals, peaked at 9.4 mbd in August 2003, stabilizing inventories above 200 million barrels. This increase in inventory levels and gasoline availability helped stabilize pump prices from their all-time highs in late 2004. Maintaining this inventory expansion would require domestic refiners to produce sufficient gasoline and increase imports. The softening in retail gasoline prices seen in late 2004 may be temporary as U.S. refiners need enough crude for expanded operations. Crude oil imports will be crucial to maintain gasoline supplies and avoid price spikes, with domestic production at its maximum. Crude stocks fell below minimum levels in early 2003-2004 but recovered, reflecting lower refinery runs. Domestic refiners must produce enough gasoline and increase imports to maintain inventory levels and stabilize pump prices. Oil imports peaked at 10.3 mbd in September 2003, dropped to 9.3 mbd in early 2004, and then rose again to 10.3 mbd by the end of 2004. This supply allowed crude stocks to reach 300 million barrels by early May, equivalent to two days of refinery operations above minimum levels. Refiners may hesitate to process expensive crude if inventories are insufficient, impacting gasoline supply. The global crude situation is influenced by OPEC production policies and increasing demand, particularly from Asia. OPEC's supply and price policy has led to oil prices exceeding $50 per barrel, well above the target band of $22 to $28. Asian demand is growing rapidly, with China and other non-OECD Asian economies driving global oil demand growth. OPEC has pricing power due to increasing demand, even in the U.S. where demand grew by 500,000 barrels per day between 2003 and 2004. U.S. gasoline quality regulations pose challenges for foreign refiners due to unique fuel requirements. Meeting U.S. product specifications for imports can be a barrier to supplying market demand. Low sulfur requirements and the ban on MTBE have increased the need for low-volatility gasoline. Ethanol in the gasoline blend raises vapor pressure, requiring removal of high vapor pressure components from the gasoline pool. The need to remove pressure components like butane and pentanes from the RFG pool poses challenges for refiners. Gasoline base stock suitable for blending with ethanol to achieve acceptable RVP is costly and not readily available. There is a volumetric loss with ethanol blended gasoline, requiring replacement with high-octane blend components with low vapor pressure. Availability of quality blending components like alkylate and iso-octane is limited, along with manufacturing challenges at U.S. refineries. Economic factors have raised the cost of importing gasoline due to a shortage of clean tankers, leading to high tanker rates passed on to consumers. The high cost of importing gasoline due to a shortage of clean tankers has led to high tanker rates passed on to consumers. Another economic factor is the structure of gasoline price futures known as \"backwardation,\" where near months have higher prices than out-months, discouraging immediate purchase for future sale. The recent increase in crude oil and gasoline prices has led to calls for the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). There is debate over whether to stop the current fill program, which critics argue has worsened the tight oil supply situation and contributed to high gasoline prices. The President ordered the fill of the SPR to its current capacity of 700 million barrels through royalty-in-kind acquisitions. Deliveries of RIK oil were scheduled to continue through October 2004, averaging between 65,000 and 200,000 barrels per day. The debate surrounds the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) fill program, with some calling for its suspension to offer RIK oil in markets, while others argue for continued fill for national security interests. The Senate proposed a suspension of deliveries and a sale of 53 million barrels of RIK oil for deficit reduction and homeland security funding. Some House members support deferring fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The Administration argues that the added RIK volumes are too small to impact oil prices significantly. Suggestions include deferring oil deliveries and allowing oil to enter markets. Supporters also propose a swap or exchange of SPR oil, similar to one in 2000. In a swap, parties bid to borrow crude from the SPR, to be returned later at a higher amount. The bidding and award process for a swap of SPR oil was completed in two weeks in 2000, with oil picked up soon thereafter and returned by early 2004. This added oil to the SPR when Congress was not authorizing funds for outright purchase. The impact of using the SPR on crude prices has been unique in each situation, making it difficult to isolate its effect. The availability of SPR crude may not necessarily affect gasoline prices. The availability of SPR crude may impact gasoline prices, especially in regions with constrained refining capacity. While a release of SPR oil could lower crude prices, it may not significantly affect local gasoline prices if demand remains high. Additionally, the impact on gasoline stock levels depends on demand, refining capacity, and imports. The Administration's current fill policy is causing divided opinions on its effect on crude prices and product supply. The nation experienced its third gasoline price spike in little more than one year, reaching a nationwide record average price of $2.05 in mid-May 2004. Refinery capacity shortages and challenging fuel specifications have contributed to the volatile supply-demand-price situation. Gasoline demand has steadily increased, rising from 8.4 mbd to 9.0 mbd in 2004, accounting for most of the nation's oil consumption. Gasoline inventories were low, with less than two days of supply available in early April 2004. Crude oil stocks were below normal levels for much of 2004, impacting refining capacity. OPEC's control over crude supply and prices has increased, with members reducing oil exports by 400,000 barrels per day in April 2004. Members reduced oil exports by 400,000 barrels per day in April 2004, leading to a rise in prices over $41. Despite a steady flow from OPEC in the last half of 2004, crude prices surged over $50. OPEC's output in November was the highest since 1979, causing crude prices to decline to around $45. California experienced a severe gasoline price surge, reaching a peak of $2.45/gal, due to unique state requirements for clean gasoline and limited availability from refineries abroad. Gasoline supply shortages in California have led to consistently high prices above national averages. The state's dependency on imports and limited refinery capacity contribute to price spikes from small operational issues. Utilizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to stabilize the market has been proposed as a potential solution, considering the complex nature of oil markets. The use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address gasoline supply shortages in California must consider the complex nature of oil markets. The SPR is meant to offset supply shortages causing high prices, but adding crude without additional refining capacity may not immediately increase supply or lower prices."
