    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes that wireless telephones are crucial for domestic violence victims to access community resources and support networks without needing to enter a safe house. Victims can continue with their daily lives, seek counseling, and obtain legal assistance using their phones to communicate with advocates. Allowing domestic violence victims to keep their existing wireless telephone number and access to contacts is crucial for their safety and emotional support. This can be challenging if the victim is not the accountholder. In 2011, 71% of households had a landline, while cellular telephone ownership among adults was at 89%. A 2014 survey of 72 shelters found that 85% worked with victims whose abusers tracked them using GPS, and 75% worked with victims whose abusers eavesdropped on their conversations. A new law allows domestic violence victims to keep their wireless number and transfer billing rights to them if they are not the accountholder. The order transferring billing responsibility and rights to a wireless telephone number to a requesting party must be a separate order directed to the service provider. It should include the accountholder's name and contact information, the recipient's information, and each telephone number to be transferred. The court must ensure the recipient's contact information is not disclosed to the accountholder. The order must be served on the service provider's agent for service of process. The wireless service provider must notify the requesting party within 72 hours if they cannot fulfill an order due to circumstances like terminated accounts, network technology differences, or geographic limitations. The requesting party assumes financial responsibility for transferred phone numbers and associated costs. The wireless service provider may require routine account establishment requirements for transferring billing responsibility for a wireless telephone number. This section does not affect court's ability to divide assets and debts or determine temporary possession of personal property. No legal action can be taken against the service provider for actions taken in compliance with a court order. The Judicial Council must develop necessary forms or rules by July 1, 2016. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to changes in crimes or penalties."
