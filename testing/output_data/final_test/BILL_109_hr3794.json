    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hurricane Katrina Victims Emergency Shelter Act of 2005\". Availability of HUD inventory properties. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must make covered properties available for eligible families to occupy for a 6-month period. During this time, the Secretary cannot dispose of these properties under any other law and must offer them only to eligible families who request to occupy them. During an 18-month period following the initial 6-month period, the Secretary must continue offering covered properties to eligible families for occupancy. However, the Secretary may dispose of these properties under other laws and enter into agreements for their disposition if no eligible family requests occupancy. The Secretary must offer covered properties to eligible families for occupancy within specific criteria, giving preference to families with incomes below the median for the area. The eligible family referred to in subsection (g)(2) may reside in a covered property rent-free for 5 years with an option to purchase the property at fair market value during that time. Eligible families residing in covered properties may purchase the property at fair market value, less the cost of repairs, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will inform eligible families of the property's availability for purchase. The Secretary will also conduct outreach to inform eligible families about covered properties. Covered properties are dwellings designed for occupancy by one to four families. Eligible families affected by Hurricane Katrina can purchase their damaged primary residence from the Secretary at fair market value. The Secretary will notify eligible families about the availability of these properties, which are designed for occupancy by up to four families. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development."
