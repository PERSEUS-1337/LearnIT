    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14005.7 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to state that medically needy individuals are entitled to health care services if eligibility criteria are met. No medically needy individuals shall receive services if their share of cost has not been met. In cases of medically needy individuals, monthly income exceeding maintenance costs, excluding exempt income, minus health insurance premiums, is the share of cost to be met. In the case of a medically needy person, income exceeding maintenance costs, minus health insurance premiums, is the share of cost to be met. Income for a medically needy person in a licensed care facility is determined according to federal regulations. The SSI recipient retention amount is the difference between the SSI maximum payment amount for an individual in a licensed community care facility and the maximum amount that the state allows the facility to charge. The personal and incidental needs deduction for an individual in a licensed community care facility is determined based on the SSI recipient retention amount. The deduction amount should not exceed the difference between the SSI recipient retention amount and certain expenses paid by the individual to the facility. The countable income of a medically needy individual in a licensed community care facility is determined by deducting specific amounts from their income. The department must seek approval for these deductions from the federal medicaid administrator within one month of implementation. The deduction under paragraph (3) of subdivision (f) must be applied within four months of receiving federal financial participation approval. Amendments to certain clauses in subdivision (f) will only be implemented if federal financial participation is available and necessary approvals are obtained. Reimbursement for costs mandated by the state in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts as per the Government Code."
