Congress acknowledges the importance of economic prosperity and environmental quality being linked to energy supply and production. With the expected increase in population, economic development, energy consumption, and environmental stress, pursuing long-term energy options like fusion energy is crucial for a balanced national energy plan. Fusion energy is seen as an attractive source due to its virtually inexhaustible fuel supply and potential as a large base-load electric and hydrogen energy source. The National Research Council, President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, and Secretary of Energy Advisory Board strongly support the Fusion Energy Sciences Program for its progress towards practical fusion energy, emphasizing the need for a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment. The United States supports involvement in the international fusion project ITER, with a backup plan for a domestic burning plasma experiment called FIRE if ITER fails. The success of fusion power will require efforts in fundamental science, technology development, and configuration optimization. The Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is insufficient to support necessary science and innovation for current experiments and cannot cover the cost of participating in a burning plasma experiment. The Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is insufficient to support necessary science and innovation for current experiments and cannot cover the cost of participating in a burning plasma experiment. Plan for fusion experiment. The Secretary of Energy is authorized to cooperate in the international burning plasma project known as ITER. If the ITER project is not feasible, a plan for the domestic burning plasma experiment known as FIRE will be presented to Congress. The United States aims to develop fusion energy infrastructure to compete globally and provide fusion energy for domestic and international needs. The Secretary of Energy must submit a plan to Congress within 6 months to achieve this goal. The Secretary of Energy must submit a plan to Congress within 6 months to carry out the policy for developing fusion energy infrastructure. The plan includes cost estimates, proposed budgets, potential international partners, and specific programs. It also ensures the utilization of existing fusion research facilities, strengthens fusion science and technology, and selects new research facilities based on scientific innovation and cost effectiveness. The plan for developing fusion energy infrastructure includes funding facilities cost-effectively, improving communication within the scientific community, utilizing inertial confinement fusion facilities for research, and exploring alternative fusion energy approaches. The plan for developing fusion energy infrastructure includes addressing the status, costs, and schedules for international or national facilities for testing fusion materials and key fusion technologies. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\nThe term ``ITER'' refers to the international fusion research project with design complete and negotiations ongoing between multiple countries. The term ``FIRE'' refers to the Fusion Ignition Research Experiment, supported by the Department of Energy as a backup to ITER.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the ITER and FIRE projects as well as the Fusion Energy Sciences Program are as follows: \n- $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 for ITER/FIRE\n- $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 for ITER/FIRE\n- $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 for ITER/FIRE\n- $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 for ITER/FIRE\n- $115,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 for ITER/FIRE\n- $335,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 for Fusion Energy Sciences Program\n- $349,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 for Fusion Energy Sciences Program\n- $362,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 for Fusion Energy Sciences Program\n- $377,000,000 for fiscal year 2007 for Fusion Energy Sciences Program\n- $393,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 for Fusion Energy Sciences Program."
