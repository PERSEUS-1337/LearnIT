    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Guarding American Trade Enterprises Act\" or the \"GATE Act\". It aims to ensure the resumption of cargo flow through US ports after a transportation security incident. The GATE Act, also known as the \"Guarding American Trade Enterprises Act,\" amends Section 70103(a)(2)(J) of title 46, United States Code, to include a plan for efficiently reestablishing cargo flow through US ports after a transportation security incident or attempted terrorism transport. This plan involves the Secretary executing necessary actions and developing a comprehensive rerouting plan for vessels and maritime cargo. The GATE Act amends Section 70103(a)(2)(J) of title 46, US Code to include provisions for the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with industry representatives on a plan for reestablishing cargo flow after a security incident. This plan allows the Captain of the Port to close a port only if necessary to secure vessels or facilities from damage. The Captain of the Port can close a port based on the threat to safety or security, considering the impact on maritime commerce. Requirement to develop and implement a long-range automated vessel tracking system. The Congress finds that a cargo rerouting plan will benefit from the long-range automated vessel tracking system and automatic identification system. Section 70115 of title 46, United States Code, is amended to require the Secretary to develop and report on a system for tracking vessels equipped with the Global Maritime Distress. The Secretary is required to develop a plan for tracking vessels with satellite technology by December 31, 2004, including costs, timeline, data monitoring system, and agency responsibilities. The Maritime Information Services of North America system may be used as a pilot program. Marine Exchanges must provide regional vessel information. The section authorizes funding for a secure long-range automated vessel tracking system to provide vessel information to authorities. $12,000,000 is allocated for the first fiscal year, and $10,000,000 for subsequent years for system development and operation. The Marine Exchanges around the United States receive funding for their operations, including a central coordinating secure automated vessel tracking system command center and satellite transmission fees to track vessel positions. The Marine Exchanges receive funding for operations, including software and display fees for the Secure Asset Reporting Service, software modifications, and recapitalization of computers and servers. Amounts appropriated will be managed by the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Homeland Security when the Coast Guard is operating within the Department."
