    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1205 of the Penal Code in California is amended. Section 1205 of the Penal Code in California is amended to include provisions for imprisonment until fines are satisfied, with credit given for each day in custody. The defendant may be directed to pay a fine within a limited time or in installments, with the possibility of imprisonment if the fine is not paid as stipulated. If the base fine is not satisfied, penalties and assessments will be reduced by the percentage of the base fine that was satisfied. As a condition of probation, the defendant must pay the fine to the court clerk or judge. If the fine is not paid, the court may order the defendant's arrest and imprisonment until the fine is satisfied in full. If the fine or installment is not paid immediately, the court will commit the defendant to custody until the payment is made in full. (c) This section applies to violations of state codes or statutes punishable by fine or imprisonment. (d) The court clerk or judge can transfer accounts to another department or agency for collection. The defendant must pay a fee for processing installment accounts, determined by the board of supervisors or the court. The fee for accounts not paid in installments should not exceed $30. This section does not apply to restitution fines and orders. Section 2900.5 of the Penal Code is also amended. In felony and misdemeanor convictions, days of custody, including time in various facilities, are credited towards imprisonment or fines at a rate set by the court. If days in custody exceed the term of imprisonment, the entire term is considered served. In cases where both a prison term and a fine are imposed, days credited to the defendant are first applied to the term of imprisonment, then to the base fine. If the base fine is not fully satisfied by jail credits or community service, penalties and assessments on the base fine are reduced accordingly. For the purposes of this section, credit for custody is only given for proceedings related to the same conduct as the conviction. The term of imprisonment includes any period of imprisonment imposed as a condition of probation or ordered by a court, prior to discharge. The court determines dates of admission and release from custody, credits days in the abstract of judgment. Agencies must apply credit between sentencing and delivery. Time in specified facilities qualifies as mandatory jail time. This section does not allow convicted offenders to be sentenced to certain facilities or programs mentioned herein."
