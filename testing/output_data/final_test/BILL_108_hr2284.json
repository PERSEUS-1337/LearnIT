This section of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 focuses on promoting school readiness and integrating systems for mental health services for students. Congress acknowledges the shortage of resources for school-based counseling professionals, leading to insufficient support for children with mental health issues. Despite the prevalence of mental illness among children, many do not receive the necessary treatment, resulting in long-term consequences. School counselors, social workers, and psychologists play a crucial role in providing support services to these children. The average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary and secondary schools is 561 to 1. The recommended ratios are 250 to 1 for school counselors, 1,000 to 1 for school psychologists, and 800 to 1 for school social workers. In some states, one school counselor may serve over 1,000 students, with similarly high ratios for school psychologists and social workers. The school-based mental health and student service provider is available to assist students in times of crisis or at any other time. The number of students is expected to grow significantly over the next few years, leading to the retirement of many school-based mental health professionals. Model programs using these providers have shown reductions in school suspensions, referrals to the principal's office, use of weapons, force, and threats, while increasing students' feelings of safety. SEC. 5546. PURPOSES. The chapter aims to help States and local educational agencies hire more school-based mental health providers to meet recommended student-to-provider ratios. This includes school counselors, psychologists, and social workers. The goal is to reduce these ratios to specific levels outlined by the Institute of Medicine. The chapter aims to provide school-based mental health and student services to enhance classroom preparedness and remove barriers to learning. It also aims to support school staff in improving classroom management, conducting behavioral interventions, and identifying early warning signs of violence. Additionally, it seeks to involve parents in improving their children's behavior and academic success. SEC. 5547. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter, the definitions include a child as an individual aged 5 to 17, a child in poverty from a family below the poverty line, a mental health and student service provider as qualified individuals offering mental health services, and mental health and student services encompassing direct services to students, parents, and school personnel. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of \"poverty line\" and \"school counselor\" in the context of mental health and student services in schools or community-based programs. The poverty line is defined by the Office of Management and Budget, while a school counselor is an individual with counseling competence in a school setting. The curr_chunk defines the qualifications for a school counselor, including national certification or a master's degree in school counseling from an accredited program. It also defines a school psychologist as someone with 60 graduate semester hours in school psychology and 1,200 clock hours in a supervised internship. The curr_chunk defines the qualifications for a school social worker, including a master's degree in social work from an accredited program and state licensure or national certification. The curr_chunk defines the term 'State' as each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The curr_chunk introduces the School-Based Mental Health and Student Service Provider Grant Program under SEC. 5548. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible States to hire school-based mental health and student service providers. Funds will be allocated to the Secretary of the Interior and outlying areas, as well as to each eligible State based on the number of children in poverty. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible States to hire school-based mental health and student service providers. The funds allocated are based on the number of children in poverty in each State, with a minimum grant amount of $1,000,000. Any funds not used by a State will be reallocated to States with approved applications. To receive a grant under this chapter, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with a reasonable plan to fund additional school counselors, psychologists, and social workers. The Secretary will only approve applications that meet these criteria. The State must provide a matching amount under subsection (g) and can use the funds to make grants to local educational agencies for hiring school-based mental health providers. Additionally, up to 5% of the assistance can be used for administrative costs. The State allocates funds to local educational agencies based on the number of children in poverty and enrolled in schools. The State allocates funds to local educational agencies based on the number of children in poverty enrolled in schools, with a minimum grant amount of $50,000. Data used for this allocation is from the most recent fiscal year, but can be adjusted if necessary to accurately reflect child poverty rates. The State may require local educational agencies to submit an application for grants, and matching funds from non-Federal sources are necessary to receive a grant under this section. The state may require a local educational agency to match a portion of the grant in cash or in kind. Funds must supplement, not supplant, federal, state, or local funds for school-based mental health services. States must collect data on grant usage and report within one year of receiving assistance. The State must report data on the number of school counselors, psychologists, and social workers employed by each local educational agency that received a grant under this chapter. The report should include student to staff ratios for each of these positions. States can use some administrative funds for these reporting responsibilities. The Secretary will publish the data received. The Secretary will publicly release data received annually under this subsection. Authorization of appropriations for grants to improve the mental health of children under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 is set at $100,000,000 annually. Amendments are made to the table of contents to include details on grants for school integration and mental health systems, as well as promoting school readiness through early childhood development. Sec. 5545-5549 outlines the findings, purposes, definitions, and grant program for school-based mental health and student services. Authorization of appropriations is also included."
