    "content": "In the 110th Congress, numerous bills have been introduced to address climate change directly or indirectly. This report focuses on legislative actions that explicitly address climate change issues, falling into six major categories: research on causes and effects, deployment of emission-reducing technologies, and requirements for U.S. participation in international climate efforts. In the 110th Congress, there has been significant interest in climate change issues. Over 100 bills have been introduced to directly address climate change, with six legislation proposals enacted to some degree. One of these proposals is the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to indirectly address greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to expand carbon capture research and development, conduct a national assessment of geologic storage capacity for CO2, and demonstrate technologies for large-scale CO2 capture. It also establishes an Office of Climate Change and the Environment within the Department of Transportation to address transportation issues related to climate change. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 directs the EPA to regulate mandatory reporting of GHG emissions across all sectors of the economy. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expands carbon capture research and development, conducts a national assessment of geologic storage capacity for CO2, and establishes an Office of Climate Change and the Environment within the Department of Transportation. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directs the Department of Defense to assess the risks of projected climate change to its facilities, capabilities, and missions. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 requires the Secretary of Energy to review research and development activities for possible inclusion in steel research. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 directed the Department of Agriculture to establish guidelines for measuring environmental benefits from conservation activities, with a focus on carbon markets. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 included a tax credit for geologic carbon sequestration. The legislation provides a tax credit for geologic carbon sequestration activities and directs the Department of Treasury to review the tax code's impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Numerous bills on climate change have been passed by the House and Senate, addressing various topics. Global climate change is a complex issue with uncertainties surrounding its causes and effects. Research is ongoing on technologies to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon capture and storage. Legislative proposals aim to promote technology deployment through methods like tax incentives for investment in these technologies. In the 110th Congress, bills focused on technology deployment through tax incentives for lower-carbon technology, grants for carbon capture and sequestration, and federal government requirements for lower emissions. The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992 and signed but did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and withdrew the United States from subsequent negotiations. The U.S. has since participated in the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, focusing on voluntary actions for cleaner technology. Debate surrounds the limited U.S. involvement in binding agreements on greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation, with some arguing for adaptation strategies due to inevitable climate effects from past emissions. The United States supports adaptation initiatives alongside mitigation efforts for greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA reports GHG emissions data using various techniques, with electricity generation, transportation, and industry being the main sources. While there is no federal GHG reduction requirement, some states gather data through voluntary registries or mandatory reporting mechanisms. Proposals for GHG reduction include \"command and control\" regulations. Proposals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions include market-based techniques like cap-and-trade systems, which set strict limits on specific emissions from sources. This allows for flexibility in reducing emissions and can lead to lower costs by allowing entities to trade emission credits. In an efficient market, entities with lower emission-reduction costs may sell extra reductions to those with higher costs. This system also allows entities facing higher costs to purchase allowances to emit more than their initial emissions. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to control emissions from the electric utility sector through market-based options like cap-and-trade systems or a carbon tax. This allows for flexibility in reducing emissions and sets an upper limit on control program costs. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to control emissions from the electric utility sector through market-based options like cap-and-trade systems or a carbon tax. The rationale for this policy is that electricity generation emits the highest percentage of GHGs by sector, and power plants have experience with reporting their CO2 emissions. Sector-specific bills can focus on controlling only GHGs or both GHGs and other pollutants like mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Some bills in the 110th Congress aimed to apply to most or all U.S. GHG emissions, known as an \"economy-wide\" GHG reduction approach. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to control emissions from the electric utility sector through market-based options like cap-and-trade systems or a carbon tax. Some bills aimed to apply to most or all U.S. GHG emissions, known as an \"economy-wide\" GHG reduction approach. These bills vary in coverage, with some focusing on high-emitting sectors like electricity generation, industry, and transportation. Other bills grant EPA broad authority to establish regulations to reduce emissions at the lowest cost."
