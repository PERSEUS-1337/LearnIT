    "content": "The Act titled \"Homeland Infrastructure Power Security and Assurance Incentives Act of 2003\" is referred to as such. It includes findings related to homeland security. Congress finds that in order to protect critical infrastructure systems like military installations, banks, utilities, and information technology systems from terrorist threats, advanced technologies must be encouraged by U.S. electricity providers. Additionally, reducing dependence on foreign oil is crucial for national security, and supporting energy efficiency and renewable resources will help ensure a diverse energy portfolio. Power outages and voltage disturbances cost the U.S. industry up to $150 billion annually, causing significant disruption to the nation's economy. The Advanced Technology Incentives Program aims to accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies like fuel cells and turbines to ensure reliable power generation and distribution, protected from potential terrorist threats. Funding provided under this program will be used for payments to eligible owners or operators. The Advanced Technology Incentives Program provides payments to eligible owners or operators to support efforts in reducing system costs and improving the performance of distributed power generation and energy storage systems. Payments are based on demonstrating new technologies' capability to increase power generation through enhanced operational, economic, and environmental performance. Eligibility for incentive payments is determined by being a qualifying advanced technology facility or a qualifying security and assured power facility. Payments are based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity generated. The Advanced Technology Incentives Program provides payments to eligible owners or operators of qualifying advanced technology facilities based on the number of kilowatt hours generated. Payments include 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour for advanced technology facilities and an additional 0.7 cents per kilowatt-hour for qualifying security and assured power facilities. Incentive payments are capped at the first 10 million kilowatt-hours produced in any fiscal year. Adjustments for inflation are made annually by the Secretary. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, must measure, evaluate, and rate security and assurance performance improvement for facilities generating or storing electric energy. They will define the types of locations needing these improvements and report back to the Committee on Energy and Commerce within six months of enactment. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of advanced technology and qualifying facilities for generating electric energy. It also mentions the requirement for incentive payments to accelerate the introduction of technologies for maximum public benefit. The term \"qualifying security and assurance power facility\" refers to a facility that generates, stores, and distributes electric energy to improve the security and reliability of the nation's electricity infrastructure in critical locations. It must reduce vulnerabilities by providing secure, reliable, and high-quality power to governmental, commercial, and industrial facilities. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the purposes of this section. Authorization of appropriations for qualifying security and assurance power facilities:\n(1) FY 2004: $25,000,000\n(2) FY 2005: $50,000,000\n(3) FY 2006: $75,000,000\n(4) FY 2007: $100,000,000"
