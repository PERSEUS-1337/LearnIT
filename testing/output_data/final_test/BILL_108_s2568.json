Benjamin Franklin made significant contributions to various fields, signed all of the nation's organizational documents, printed official currency for several colonies, proposed methods to fix exchange rates, designed the first American coin, and popularized the phrase \"A Penny Saved is A Penny Earned.\" Benjamin Franklin popularized the phrase \"A Penny Saved is A Penny Earned\" to represent American virtues of hard work and economical living. He played a major role in designing the Great Seal of the United States and other American symbols. Franklin's image appeared on circulating coin and paper currency before 1979, and his portrait was featured on the official United States half dollar from 1948-1963. His work \"Way to Wealth\" symbolizes America's commitment to free enterprise. The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia showcases an interactive approach to science and technology. The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia is dedicated to Benjamin Franklin and houses the first steam printing machine for coinage used by the United States Mint.
