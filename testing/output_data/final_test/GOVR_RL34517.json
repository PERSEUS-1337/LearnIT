    "content": "In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to the combination of biomass, dry conditions, and an ignition source like lightning. Fire is a self-sustaining chemical reaction that requires fuel, heat, and oxygen. Fire control focuses on removing one of these elements. There are two principal kinds of wildfires: surface fires that burn small biomass close to the ground and are relatively easy to control, and other types that may contain areas of both kinds. Wildfires can be controlled by removing fuel, cooling with water or dirt. Crown fires burn biomass from surface to tree crowns, needing wind to sustain. Green fuels in crown require more energy to burn. Crown fires can create their own wind. Crown fires are difficult to control as they can create spot fires and spread rapidly. Firelines may not be effective, but water or fire retardant dropped from aircraft can help. Crown fires typically burn until they run out of fuel or the weather changes. Wildfires in the wildland-urban interface can burn down homes and structures through direct contact, radiation, or firebrands. Research has identified three key elements to protect structures: the roof, adjacent burnable materials, and landscaping. Treating these elements addresses all three ignition methods. The roof is critical in protecting structures from wildfires, as firebrands landing on a flammable roof can ignite it. Untreated red cedar shakes and shingles are a major cause of home loss in wildland areas. Fire retardant treatments for wood shakes degrade over time, so alternatives like tile, slate, metals, and non-flammable materials are recommended. Walls, doors, windows, vents, and adjacent burnable materials can also contribute to the protection or destruction of a structure. The importance of maintaining gutters, decks, porches, sheds, and woodpiles near structures to prevent wildfires was highlighted in the aftermath of the Cerro Grande fire in Los Alamos, NM. Recommendations include considering attachments as part of the structure and creating a defensible space of at least 30 feet around homes. Landscaping plays a crucial role in preventing direct burning and ignition by radiation. Maintaining a defensible space of at least 30 feet around homes is crucial to prevent wildfires. Recommendations suggest clearing to 40 meters for ideal protection, with older fire case studies showing 95% survival with 10-18 meter clearance. Ignition time for untreated wood walls was calculated to be more than 10 minutes at a distance of 40 meters. The importance of maintaining a defensible space around homes to prevent wildfires is highlighted. Clearing to 40 meters is considered ideal for protection, with evidence from past fires showing that non-flammable vegetation can provide comparable protection. The 2002 Hayman fire in Colorado demonstrated that homes with proper clearance survived relatively unscathed, while those without were destroyed. The nature of the structure, rather than the nature of the fire, primarily determines whether a structure survives a wildfire. Owners, insurance companies, state agencies, and local governmental agencies all play a role in ensuring structural protection through regulations, materials, and actions. States can also implement safe-structure requirements. The California Building Standards Commission enforces wildland-urban interface building standards in high hazard zones. Structure owners are responsible for defensible space around their structures. Local fire departments control structural fires, with state agencies providing support, especially in the wildland-urban interface. The federal government does not have a clear responsibility for structural fire control in the wildland-urban interface, but the Forest Service offers assistance to states and volunteer fire departments. Federal disaster assistance may be provided after a catastrophic wildfire at the request of a governor. Federal disaster assistance could be avoided by taking action to protect homes in advance. FIREWISE is a program supported by federal agencies to educate homeowners on making structures safe from wildfires. Assistance to homeowners, such as technical support and low-cost loans, could be a cost-saving federal investment. Federal assistance for local firefighters and research on wildland-urban interface fire protection can also reduce losses. Federal wildfire insurance could be implemented for those living in wildfire-prone zones, with premiums varying by eco-region. Wildfire damages vary depending on ecosystems burned and site-specific conditions. Fuel reduction activities on federal lands can be affected by delays and modifications related to endangered species concerns. Ecosystem fire regimes can be classified into surface fire, stand-replacement fire, and mixed fire ecosystems. Damages to lands and resources depend on the nature of these ecosystems. Surface fire ecosystems burn relatively frequently, consuming vegetation like leaves, grasses, and small trees while sparing larger trees. Examples include western Ponderosa pine and southern yellow pines. These ecosystems make up 34% of U.S. wildlands and have been impacted by grazing, logging, and fire protection practices. Logging practices in many areas have favored large pines over true firs and Douglas firs, leading to an unnatural accumulation of small burnable materials and trees susceptible to crown fires. Fire protection measures have also contributed to the survival of more firs and Douglas firs, creating fuel ladders that increase the risk of crown fires in ecosystems where they were once rare. This could result in significant ecological damage. Research has shown that fuel reduction treatments can be effective in reducing wildfire severity in surface fire ecosystems like Ponderosa pine. Stand-replacement fire ecosystems, where crown fires are normal, require periodic fires for regeneration. The interval for these fires varies depending on the ecosystem. Stand-replacement fire ecosystems, like lodgepole pine and jack pine, rely on periodic crown fires for regeneration. These ecosystems account for 42% of U.S. wildlands and are unlikely to suffer significant ecological damage from severe wildfires. Excluding crown fires in these ecosystems could alter their natural regeneration processes. The exclusion of crown fires in stand-replacement fire ecosystems could lead to ecological changes, as seen in grass ecosystems encroached upon by trees due to fire suppression. Fuel reduction activities have not consistently shown to reduce wildfire severity, especially noted in southern California chaparral. Research has not documented instances where crown fires were halted by treated areas. Mixed-fire-intensity ecosystems like whitebark pine have sporadic fires that kill competing trees but allow some pines to survive. Burned sites attract Clark's nutcrackers for tree regeneration. Mixed-fire-intensity ecosystems, like Ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine, can vary in fire intensity based on conditions and tree species mix. These ecosystems cover about 24% of U.S. wildlands, but there is uncertainty about fuel levels, potential ecological damage from crown fires, and the impact of fuel reduction activities. The effects of wildfires on natural resources are commonly overstated due to the appearance of burned areas, but many plants and animals can recover or survive. Reported burned areas often include unburned or lightly burned patches, leading to an overestimation of wildfire impact. Severely burned acreage in wildfires is often overestimated, with unburned and lightly burned areas included in reported figures. Crown fires can kill plants and lead to erosion, while soil glassification may occur but requires further research. Landslides can also be a risk in areas with unstable soils. Wildfires in coastal southern California can lead to landslides in areas with unstable soils. Timber can be damaged, but burned trees can be salvaged for lumber. Post-fire salvage harvesting may have additional impacts on soils and resource values. Crown fires can have significant economic effects on tourism, timber supply, water quality, and aesthetics. Federal wildfire suppression efforts involve substantial expenditures and create fire-fighting jobs. The federal government is responsible for protecting federal lands from wildfires. The responsibility of protecting federal lands and their natural resources from wildfires falls on the states, with assistance from the FS. The main goal is to reduce wildfire damages by decreasing burnable biomass and eliminating fuel ladders that facilitate the spread of fires. Fuel treatments can also reduce crown bulk density, making it harder for crown fires to occur. Prescribed burning and mechanical treatments are methods used to reduce burnable biomass in tree crowns, making wildfires more controllable. However, fuel reduction alone does not eliminate wildfires as it does not directly affect the dryness of biomass or the probability of ignition. Prescribed burning involves intentionally setting fires in specific areas under certain conditions, while mechanical treatments involve physical removal of biomass. Each method has its own benefits, costs, and limitations. Prescribed burning is used for reducing biomass fuels by converting vegetation to smoke and ashes, critical for wildfire protection. Fine fuels are necessary for wildfires to spread. However, prescribed burning has limitations such as smoke contributing to human health problems. Prescribed burning is a risky and expensive method for reducing tree density and fuel ladders. It is not controlled burning and can lead to human health problems in areas with stagnant airsheds. Costs range from $12 to $174 per acre depending on fuel type and treatment. Costs for prescribed fire treatments can range from $12 to $174 per acre, depending on various factors. Fire managers tend to prioritize excessive personnel and costs to prevent wildfires like the Cerro Grande fire in Los Alamos. Mechanical fuel treatments involve activities like pruning and releasing trees to reduce biomass and crown density. Thinning involves removing a portion of standing trees to concentrate wood growth on desirable trees, reducing crown density. Thinning approaches include low thinning, crown thinning, selection thinning, and mechanical thinning. Salvage harvesting involves removing standing trees that have been killed or are in imminent danger, including presalvage and sanitation harvesting. It reduces crown bulk density and can eliminate fuel ladders. Mechanical fuel treatment requires choices on biomass removal and method used for treatment. Mechanical fuel treatment involves choices such as commercially usable wood exchange, stewardship contracts, service contracts, end-results contracts, or treatment by agency personnel. The primary benefit is the high degree of control over results, with the ability to create targeted stand structure and reduce vertical fuel continuity. Thinning small trees and shrubs can effectively reduce crown fire risk, while also targeting ladder fuels and specific fuel components more precisely than prescribed fire. However, there are limitations to mechanical fuel treatment. Thinning and prescribed fires can modify understory microclimate previously buffered by overstory vegetation. Thinned stands allow solar radiation to penetrate, increasing surface temperatures and fire intensity. Thinning can impact crown fire potential by affecting crown bulk density, surface fuel, and crown base height. Different thinning methods have varying effects on reducing the risk of crown fire behavior, with some approaches being more effective than others. However, if surface fuels created by thinning are not treated, intense surface wildfires may still occur, potentially offsetting the positive effects of reducing crown fire potential. Thinning and pruning can reduce crown fire risk but may increase wildfire risk until slash degrades or is removed. Thinning is costly, ranging from $35 to over $1000 per acre, with commercial operations suggested to offset costs. Commercial timber sales on federal lands often cost more to prepare and administer than they return to the Treasury. The proposal that commercial logging can reduce canopy fires is untested in scientific literature. Commercial logging focuses on large trees and neglects smaller logs that contribute to wildfire behavior. Thinning operations may result in a net cost as the market value for smaller logs may not cover harvesting expenses. Failure to remove small logs retains ladder fuels that support destructive crown fires in forests. The negative impacts of crown fires are underestimated, and government investments in fuel reductions have substantial benefits. Combining mechanical treatments and prescribed burning is a logical choice, but empirical evidence on their effectiveness is limited. The cost of combined operations is higher than individual treatments, and the areas that could benefit from these treatments are not entirely clear. Treating lands in high-risk condition classes could reduce crown fires in ecosystems. Table 1 shows 28.8 million acres of national forest land, 6.5 million acres of Interior land, and 42.2 million acres of other federal, state, and private land at risk. Costs for mechanical treatment vary from $35 to $1,000 per acre. The cost of mechanical treatment for fuel reduction varies widely, ranging from $35 to $1,000 per acre depending on factors such as terrain, tree size, and stand density. Federal appropriations for fuel treatment averaged around $170 per acre, with the Forest Service spending $165 per acre and the BLM spending $174 per acre. The General Accounting Office estimated a cost of $300 per acre for fuel treatment on additional western lands. The cost of treating Class 3 surface fire regime lands would be $8.6 billion for the Forest Service and $1.9 billion for the Department of the Interior. Other low severity fire regime lands may also need treatment, but with lower priority. Research questions the effectiveness of mechanical treatment and prescribed fire for reducing crown fire damages in stand-replacement fire ecosystems. Evidence is lacking on the ecological damage caused by crown fires in these ecosystems. The effectiveness of mechanical treatments and prescribed burning on mixed-intensity fire ecosystems is uncertain. Concerns about delays in fuel treatments leading to catastrophic crown fires are linked to consultations under the Endangered Species Act and public involvement under NEPA and ARA. Delays in fuel treatments due to consultations and public involvement may impact proposed actions, potentially allowing for actions that provide little wildfire protection. However, the effect of delays on wildfire threats is questioned, as fuel treatments may not significantly protect structures. Delaying fuel treatments may have little consequence for structure protection in surface fire ecosystems with unnatural fuel accumulations. The likelihood of severe wildfires in surface fire ecosystems with unnatural fuel accumulations is low. Wildfires have burned an average of 7.3 million acres annually in the past decade. The total wildlands in the United States are 1.45 billion acres, with a likelihood of any particular acre burning in any given year being less than 0.66%. The likelihood of severe wildfires in surface fire ecosystems with unnatural fuel accumulations is low. Wildfires have burned an average of 7.3 million acres annually in the past decade. In 2002, 0.2% of Idaho's wildlands burned, while 0.04% of Colorado wildlands burned in 2007. Wildfire risk is higher in western states, but still less than 1% per year. The Forest Service and BLM treated 2.7 million acres of their lands annually from FY2003 through FY2007, less than 8% of their Class 3 surface fire ecosystem lands. The probability of treating a particular acre to prevent a crown fire diminishes when treatments are spread to different fire regime lands. Lengthy delays can increase risks as annual probabilities of wildfires burning an area and being treated are cumulative. Over 10 years, the likelihood of an area burning is over 6%, while treating moderate- or high-risk surface fire ecosystems rises to 15% with concentrated treatments. Delays of a decade or more could significantly impact the likelihood of an area being burned in an unnatural crown fire. The ESA established a consultation process for federal agencies with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The ESA established a process for federal agencies to consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) on actions that may harm endangered species or their habitats. Consultation involves reviewing proposed actions and suggesting alternatives to avoid harm. Most agency activities do not pose a jeopardy risk, and those that do usually have alternative solutions. Fuel treatments that reduce crown fires in ecosystems historically rare are unlikely to harm endangered species. Many species in North America thrive with wildfires, benefiting rare plants and animals. ESA consultations may delay treatments but are crucial for protecting species. ESA consultations can cause delays in fuel treatments, especially when combined with other activities like commercial timber harvesting. The method and nature of the treatment determine the length of delays and possible modifications. NEPA requires federal agencies to review environmental effects of major actions, informing the public of their decision-making process. President Nixon's executive order on NEPA implementation is also mentioned. President Richard Nixon's executive order on NEPA implementation directed agencies to involve the public in decision-making processes. Fuel reduction treatments for wildfires are considered major federal actions under NEPA. Agencies must analyze environmental consequences and determine if significant impacts warrant an environmental impact statement (EIS), categorically exclude activities with insignificant impacts, or conduct an environmental assessment (EA) for uncertain impacts. The agency prepares an environmental assessment (EA) to determine impacts, leading to a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) or an EIS. Advocates of expedited fuel treatment are concerned about the time needed for EIS or EA preparation, which can take from days to months depending on complexity. An EIS involves steps like scoping, draft EIS, public comments, and a final EIS and record of decision (ROD), taking a year or more for large projects. Proponents of expeditious fuel reduction projects advocate various approaches to accelerate the process, including categorically excluded actions that do not require an environmental assessment or impact statement. Categorical exclusions are typically used for routine actions with insignificant environmental impacts. The Forest Service can use categorical exclusions for projects with insignificant environmental impacts, without public comment. Extraordinary circumstances may prevent the use of categorical exclusions for controversial issues or protected resources. In 2002, the Forest Service allowed officials to decide if extraordinary circumstances warrant further assessment. Various categories of actions, including wildfire protection, can qualify for categorical exclusions.

Extraordinary circumstances may prevent the use of categorical exclusions for controversial issues or protected resources. In 2002, the Forest Service allowed officials to decide if extraordinary circumstances warrant further assessment. Various categories of actions, including wildfire protection, can qualify for categorical exclusions. A CE may be used for timber stand and wildlife habitat improvement activities, prescribed burning, and hazardous fuel reduction activities in specific conditions. Forest Service use of the latter CE was halted after a certain point. The Forest Service's use of categorical exclusions for fuel reduction projects has been challenged, leading to questions about their availability. Public involvement is required under NEPA, and the Forest Service must also inform the public of its decisions and provide an opportunity for administrative review under the ARA. This includes providing notice and an opportunity for public comment on proposed actions, as well as an administrative appeals process for those who object to the decision. The Forest Service's use of categorical exclusions for fuel reduction projects has raised concerns about public involvement and administrative appeals. Data shows that a significant percentage of fuel reduction projects were appealed, with most appeals being resolved within 90 days. Appeals were more likely for projects affecting larger areas. The Forest Service's use of categorical exclusions for fuel reduction projects has raised concerns about public involvement and administrative appeals. Appeals for fuel reduction projects were more likely for larger projects with specific activities, commercial timber harvest, and endangered mammals nearby. Projects with Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) were more appealed compared to those with Environmental Assessments (EAs). Projects implemented by Forest Service personnel or in the wildland-urban interface were less likely to be appealed. Administrative appeals are not as prevalent as fuel treatment advocates suggest, with only about a quarter of proposed projects appealed and minimal delays in implementation. Proponents of aggressive fuel treatment are concerned about delays from review processes like ESA, NEPA, and ARA, pressing for ways to accelerate reviews. Some procedures are feasible under existing regulations, others enacted by Congress, and more proposed. During emergencies, agencies can consult informally for rapid action, with formal consultations later. Lengthy delays in fuel reduction projects are a concern. The agencies have developed counterpart regulations as an alternative approach to ESA consultations to accelerate the review process for fuel reduction actions. These regulations allow for assessments of potential harm to threatened or endangered species without the need for formal consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. Despite some successful challenges to ESA counterpart regulations, those related to wildfire management remain in place. Additionally, the NEPA regulations allow for alternative arrangements in certain circumstances. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) allows for alternative arrangements in emergencies to fulfill NEPA requirements for immediate impacts control. An example in 1998 involved the Forest Service requesting alternative arrangements for rapid restoration actions after a windstorm damaged national forest land in Texas. CEQ agreed to alternative arrangements including subsequent preparation of an EA, limits on tree removal, public involvement, emergency consultation under ESA, and more. NEPA alternative arrangements are unlikely to accelerate fuel treatment actions. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 expedited review processes for fuel reduction projects by modifying NEPA environmental analysis and public involvement processes. Alternative arrangements under NEPA are rarely used for emergencies, with only 42 requests made from 1980 through 2010. Fuel conditions in a delineated area may occasionally be considered an emergency, but generally do not require immediate action. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 made changes to accelerate fuel reduction projects, including a new administrative review process for the Forest Service and restrictions on judicial review. The law emphasizes collaboration with tribes, state, and local governments, but the distinction between collaboration and participation is not clearly defined. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 accelerates fuel reduction projects through new administrative review processes and limits judicial review. It allows for timber harvesting and vegetative treatments for research purposes, with restrictions on acreage and peer review requirements. Congress has established alternative review processes to accelerate decision-making for fuel reduction treatments, exempting certain federal activities from NEPA compliance and directing that no EIS or EA be prepared in specific instances. This includes deeming authorized activities as not major federal actions affecting the environment and pronouncing certain analyses or substitute processes as sufficient under NEPA. Additionally, Congress has created resource advisory committees (RACs) under Section 403 for broader, organized review early in the decision-making process. Public acceptance of options to accelerate fuel treatments depends on various factors, including early discourse among stakeholders, willingness to accept limitations on appeal rights, and the need for greater specificity in approved treatments. Public acceptance of fuel treatment options is influenced by factors such as early stakeholder discourse, limitations on appeal rights, and specificity in approved treatments. For instance, treatments specifying thinning from below with 20-foot spacing of Ponderosa pine trees are more acceptable than general density reduction methods. Authors emphasize the importance of collective action to minimize conflict, highlighting the need for developing collaborative capacity, framing issues in mutually understood terms, and building mutual trust among groups. These social factors, although time-consuming, cannot be directly legislated but can be influenced by Congress through authorizing agency actions for wildfire protection. With the increasing threat of wildfires to structures and communities, Congress faces growing pressure to prioritize wildfire protection efforts. Congress is under pressure to protect structures and resources from wildfires. Options include creating new programs for non-flammable roofing and defensible spaces around buildings. Different challenges exist for protecting resources, with fuel reduction programs potentially mitigating fire damages. Existing programs for federal lands involve prescribed burning. Prescribed burning and mechanical treatments are used on federal lands to reduce fuel levels, but they come with risks and expenses. Some advocate for faster environmental analysis and public review to lower costs and speed up action, while others warn of unintended damages. Congress may need to adjust review processes to balance quick action with thorough analysis. Crown fires cannot be stopped completely, and the Forest Service handbook provides information on NEPA categorical exclusions. The Forest Service handbook on NEPA categorical exclusions outlines resource conditions that warrant further analysis, including federally listed species, flood plains, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and cultural sites. The Forest Service handbook on NEPA categorical exclusions outlines resource conditions that warrant further analysis, including federally listed species, flood plains, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and cultural sites. Research natural areas, American Indian or Alaska Native religious or cultural sites, archaeological sites, or historic properties are categories of actions that require a project or case file and decision memo. Timber stand and wildlife habitat improvement activities, prescribed burning for fire hazard reduction, and hazardous fuels reduction activities are examples of actions that may be required. Activities such as crushing, piling, thinning, pruning, cutting, chipping, mulching, and mowing are limited to 1,000 acres in specific areas to reduce wildland fire risks. These activities must be identified collaboratively, follow agency procedures, and not be conducted in wilderness areas or wilderness study areas. Herbicides, pesticides, and new permanent roads are prohibited.

Herbicides, pesticides, and new permanent roads are prohibited. Harvest of live trees not to exceed 70 acres, requiring no more than \u00bd mile of temporary road construction. Do not use this category for even-aged regeneration harvest or vegetation type conversion. The proposed action may include incidental removal of trees for landings, skid trails, and road clearing. Salvage of dead and/or dying trees not to exceed 250 acres, requiring no more than \u00bd mile of temporary road construction. The proposed action may include incidental removal of live or dead trees for various purposes. The proposed action involves road construction and removal of trees for various purposes, such as harvesting damaged trees, controlling insects or disease, and salvaging dead trees. This may include the construction of temporary roads and removal of live or dead trees for landings, skid trails, and road clearing. Examples include harvesting fire-damaged trees and trees infested with southern pine beetles to control spread of infestations. The proposed action involves removing infested trees affected by exotic insects or diseases like emerald ash borer, Asian long horned beetle, and sudden oak death pathogen to control spread of infestations."
