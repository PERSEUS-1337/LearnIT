In 2011-2012, 32% of U.S. children and adolescents were overweight, with more than half of them considered obese. While obesity rates are stabilizing, the prevalence remains high and is a significant public health issue. Obesity increases mortality risk and is linked to chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma, and heart disease in children. Obese children are at a greater risk for obesity and other health issues in adulthood, leading some researchers to believe that today's children may have shorter lifespans than their parents due to obesity. Childhood obesity is a major concern with implications for healthcare and military readiness. The government plays a significant role in addressing this issue through schools, healthcare, and programs for low-income families. The Obama Administration has prioritized policies to combat childhood obesity, with initiatives led by First Lady Michelle Obama, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Agriculture. The Obama Administration, along with HHS and USDA, has focused on improving children's health, particularly in terms of weight status. The President's Task Force on Childhood Obesity aims to reduce childhood obesity to 5% by 2030. Congress has considered various approaches, including increased funding for school lunch programs and updating nutrition standards. The Obama Administration, HHS, and USDA have focused on improving children's health by addressing childhood obesity. Initiatives include updating school meal nutrition standards, promoting \"farm-to-school\" activities, and supporting school wellness programs. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allocated funding for programs like the Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration project to reduce childhood obesity through targeted support and preventive measures. Some approaches to address childhood obesity include collecting data on student fitness levels and nutrition behavior, implementing higher physical education standards in schools, and coordinating activities with the private sector. Suggestions have been made for local education agencies to integrate fitness into the school environment and disseminate information on physical activity to families. Programs like Communities Putting Prevention to Work focus on environmental factors contributing to obesity by increasing healthy food availability and supporting infrastructure for physical activity. This report presents data on obesity among children and adolescents, including trends in obesity rates and differences across gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity and overweight as weight ranges higher than considered healthy for a given height, with BMI used to measure childhood overweight and obesity. Congress has required participant data collection to evaluate programs and compare to national benchmarks. BMI is commonly used to measure childhood overweight and obesity in population-based data and clinical screenings. It is regarded as an efficient and recommended measure by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. BMI is a reliable screening tool for weight problems in individuals over age two, used in research, surveillance, and clinical settings. It correlates with body fat but may not always indicate overweight or obesity, as some children may have higher BMI due to muscle mass. CDC recommends health provider evaluation for children with high BMI to determine weight concerns. BMI percentiles are based on CDC growth charts from 1963-1994, showing age- and sex-specific data. When using BMI as an indicator of overweight and obesity, it refers to individuals' BMI levels based on age, sex, weight, and height compared to reference populations. In children, obesity is defined as at or above the 95th percentile of age- and sex-specific BMI, while overweight is between the 85th and 94th percentiles. A BMI at or above the 95th percentile indicates elevated body fat and related chronic disease risk. Children in higher BMI percentile groups are at greater risk for metabolic complications like type 2 diabetes. Children in higher BMI percentile groups are at greater risk for metabolic complications like type 2 diabetes and obesity as adults. The CDC growth chart data is limited to the 97th percentile, making it unable to characterize severely obese children. Various sources provide child health data, including NHANES, YRBSS, and NSCH. The PedNSS monitored low-income children's nutritional status but was discontinued in 2012. All data in this report are collected by HHS. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a continuous national survey that collects data on the nation's health. It includes in-person interviews, physical examinations, diagnostic tests, and nutritional assessments on a sample of about 5,000 people annually. BMI is calculated from direct measures of height and weight. State-level data for children and adolescents are not available from NHANES due to the relatively small sample size. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is another data source for monitoring health at national, state, and local levels. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is a national survey of students in grades 9 through 12, monitoring health-risk behaviors like physical activity and dietary habits. Approximately 13,500 students participated in 2013, with data collected every two years to be nationally representative. BMI is calculated based on age, gender, height, and weight responses. State-level data is available, and the survey is conducted by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) is conducted every four years by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) to collect information on children's health and well-being, including the family environment. Data is collected in English and Spanish for valid state and national comparisons. In 2011-2012, surveys were completed for 95,677 children and adolescents. BMI calculations are based on parent-reported gender, age, weight, and height for children ages two and up. Different data sources provide unique views of childhood obesity with varying strengths and weaknesses for policymakers to consider. When interpreting data, policymakers should consider key points such as the source of data (self-reported or measured directly), reliability at state or national level, and additional contextual information. NHANES is the most reliable national estimate due to direct measurements, while YRBSS and NSCH rely on self-reporting for height and weight, leading to BMI underestimation. NSCH provides data on family characteristics, while YRBSS collects risk behavior information for analyzing at the state level. The report uses NHANES for national data and NSCH for state-level estimates to analyze childhood overweight and obesity trends. Between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012, there was no significant change in obesity prevalence overall, but a decrease among children aged two to five. Almost 32% of U.S. children aged 2-19 are overweight, with over half being obese. Obesity prevalence varies by age group. Obesity prevalence among children and adolescents in the US varies by age group, with 8% of children aged 2-5 being obese, compared to almost 18% of children aged 6-11 and 21% of children aged 12-19. There has been a stabilization in obesity rates in recent years, with a significant decrease in obesity prevalence among children aged 2-5. Since 1999, male children have generally been more likely to be obese than females. The overall prevalence of obesity has leveled off since 2003-2004, but there was a shift towards higher percentiles among obese children between 1999-2008, with males more likely to be at or above the 97th percentile. In 2009-2010, 14% of male children and 11% of female children aged 2 to 19 had a BMI at or above the 97th percentile. The increase in overweight and obese children since 1971 is evident across all age, race, and ethnic groups, with African American and Hispanic children disproportionately affected. In 2011-2012, obesity prevalence was higher among Hispanic and non-Hispanic black youth compared to non-Hispanic white and Asian youth. Socioeconomic disparities and geographic location, particularly in southeastern states, play a role in overweight and obesity among children and adolescents. The prevalence of obesity in children from low-income households increased significantly between 2003 and 2007, with a 25% increase compared to less than 10% in high-income households. In 2007, children from low-income and low-education households had three times higher obesity rates than those from higher socioeconomic status households. Data from 2011-2012 also shows higher obesity rates in children from low-income households compared to higher-income households. Studies indicate consistent disparities in obesity prevalence between low-income and high-income children. The study found varying obesity rates across different racial and ethnic groups, with a significant relationship between income and obesity for non-Hispanic whites. There was an inverse relationship between parents' education and obesity prevalence among children, particularly among non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. Louisiana and Mississippi had the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was highest in Louisiana (39.8%) and Mississippi (39.7%), and lowest in Utah (22.1%). Four of the five states with higher than average rates are in the southeastern US. Data shows a variation in rates among children based on health insurance status. Publicly insured children had a higher prevalence compared to privately insured children. Over the years, there has been a slight decrease in overweight and obesity among publicly insured children, while an increase was seen among the uninsured. The prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 32.4% in 2007 to 37.6% in 2011-2012. Health insurance coverage is linked to better health outcomes, with publicly insured children showing a higher likelihood of overweight or obesity. Obesity is influenced by genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors, including energy intake and physical activity. Poor diet quality, especially among lower socioeconomic groups, contributes to the problem. Sugary drinks are a major source of added sugar in the diet. Children from lower socioeconomic status often consume sugary drinks, which are a significant source of added sugar and calories. Their diets often lack essential nutrients like calcium, dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin D, as well as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Research shows that food availability at home influences youth's food consumption, including fruit and vegetable intake. Lack of physical activity and excessive screen time are linked to a higher risk of obesity in children. Environmental factors such as schools, communities, portion sizes, and advertising influence children's eating habits and risk of obesity. Lack of physical education and safe places to exercise limit physical activity. Children in neighborhoods with unfavorable social conditions have higher odds of obesity. Limited access to healthy food options in these communities exacerbates the issue. Childhood obesity has long-term consequences, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease risk, asthma, fatty liver, sleep apnea, Type 2 diabetes, and disability. Increasing rates of childhood chronic conditions may lead to higher health burdens and costs in adulthood. Obese children have a 50% greater chance of becoming obese adults. Obesity in adults is linked to various health risks such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and certain cancers. Poor diet and lack of physical activity are major contributors to these conditions. Studies have shown that elevated BMI in childhood can increase the risk of premature death. Overweight children and adolescents may also face social issues. Children and adolescents who are overweight may face social issues such as discrimination, impacting their self-esteem. Healthy People 2010 aimed to reduce the proportion of overweight youth, but obesity prevalence increased. Healthy People 2020 set a goal to decrease child and adolescent obesity by 10%, showing some progress in younger age groups. The decrease in obesity prevalence among young children shows progress towards Healthy People 2020 goals. The proportion of obese 2-5 year olds dropped from 10.4% to 8.4%, below the target of 9.4%. However, obesity remains high among black, Hispanic, and lower-income youth. Comprehensive policies are needed to address childhood overweight and obesity. The CDC has funded interventions for childhood nutrition programs, with reports and recommendations from various organizations. The USDA and HHS are developing the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, while the FDA has proposed new rules for Nutrition Facts labels. The impact of updated nutrition standards, community initiatives, and labeling requirements on child obesity rates remains to be seen. Childhood overweight and obesity are complex issues addressed by various policies at state and community levels, including education, health communication, research, and nutrition programs. Data sources in the report can aid decision-making, implementation, and evaluation of these policies. Appendices provide information on overweight and obesity by age, sex, and race/ethnicity."
