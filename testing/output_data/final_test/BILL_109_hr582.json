    "content": "The Employee Changing Room Privacy Act prohibits employers from video or audio monitoring employees in certain locations where they change clothing. Enforcement actions can be taken by the Secretary. Any employer violating the Employee Changing Room Privacy Act may face civil money penalties up to $10,000 per violation, or up to $25,000 for knowing violations. The Secretary of Labor will assess penalties after a hearing, with the authority to issue subpoenas for evidence. Penalties are determined based on the nature and gravity of the violation. The Secretary may adjust civil money penalties based on violation severity, violator's ability to pay, impact on business, prior violations, and culpability. Penalties can be compromised, modified, or remitted, and deducted from sums owed to the government. Employers can request a hearing for penalty assessment under judicial review. Employers who are subject to a civil money penalty can file a petition for judicial review within 60 days of the penalty order. The Attorney General can take legal action to recover unpaid penalties from employers who do not pay after the order becomes final or after a court ruling. After a court enters a final judgment in favor of the Secretary in an action under subsection (e), the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the civil money penalty cannot be reviewed. The Secretary can seek injunctive relief in court to prevent violations of section 2. SEC. 4. CIVIL CAUSE OF ACTION BY AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEE. An aggrieved employee can file a civil action against their employer for violating section 2, seeking relief such as an injunction, damages up to $25,000 for knowing violations, or both.

The prevailing party in a civil action for violating section 2 may receive relief, including costs, attorney's fees, and expert witness fees. SEC. 5.
