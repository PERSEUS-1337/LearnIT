    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Veteran Care Agreements Rule Enhancement Act\" or the \"Veteran CARE Act\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. The \"Veteran Care Agreements Rule Enhancement Act\" aims to maintain veterans' access to high-quality healthcare services, including hospital care and medical services, when not available directly from the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also allows the Department to use agreements similar to those under Medicare Parts A and B if contracting for care is not feasible. Additionally, the Act addresses the issue of healthcare providers, especially in rural areas, being reluctant to accept veterans as patients. The \"Veteran Care Agreements Rule Enhancement Act\" aims to ensure that healthcare providers are willing to accept veterans as patients, even when it involves significant administrative requirements. It addresses deficiencies in current law regarding agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs and includes robust terms to ensure quality healthcare, oversight, and taxpayer protections. The \"Veteran Care Agreements Rule Enhancement Act\" aims to authorize agreements between the Department of Veterans Affairs and non-department healthcare providers. The \"Veterans Care Agreements with certain health care providers\" section allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter agreements with eligible providers to furnish hospital care, medical services, or extended care if unable to do so feasibly. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can authorize care from non-Department facilities if deemed necessary due to the veteran's medical condition or travel constraints. Eligibility for care is determined as if provided by the Department, and applicable provisions apply. Eligible providers must have enrolled under section 1866(a) of the Social Security Act. Providers eligible for authorization to provide care to veterans must have enrolled under section 1866(a) of the Social Security Act. Additionally, eligible providers include those who have entered into participation agreements under section 1842(h) of the Act, receive payment under a State plan under title XIX, or are designated as Aging and Disability Resource Centers, area agencies on aging, State agencies, or centers for independent living. The Secretary will establish a certification process for eligible healthcare providers under this section, including procedures for application submission, approval and denial standards, duration of certification, and assessment for fraud, waste, and abuse. The Secretary will deny or revoke certification for eligible healthcare providers if they are excluded from federal health care programs or identified as excluded sources. Terms of agreements with providers will be specified. Each agreement with an eligible provider must include terms such as accepting payment at rates set by the Secretary, treating the payment as full, and providing only the specified care. The eligible provider must adhere to specific terms when furnishing care and services authorized by the Department, including billing according to the Secretary's methodology and not seeking payment from other sources. Additionally, they must provide medical records to the Department as specified. The eligible provider must adhere to specific terms and conditions set by the Secretary for providing care and services. They may terminate the agreement with the Secretary or vice versa if there is a substantial failure to comply with the agreement or regulations. The eligible provider must comply with specific terms and conditions set by the Secretary, including being excluded from federal health care programs, identified as an excluded source, or convicted of a felony. The Secretary periodically reviews Veterans Care Agreements to assess the feasibility of providing care through Department facilities or other contracts. Agreements of material size are determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may adjust the material size threshold for Veterans Care Agreements for extended care services exceeding $1,000,000 annually. Agreements can be entered into without competitive procedures, and eligible providers can enter agreements as specified in regulations. An eligible provider entering into an agreement under this section is not subject to certain Medicare program laws but must comply with integrity, ethics, fraud, and employment discrimination laws. The Secretary will establish a system to monitor the quality of care provided. State survey agencies are required to monitor and assess the quality of care and services provided to veterans under this section. The Secretary will establish administrative procedures for eligible providers to resolve disputes related to their agreements. Eligible providers must exhaust these procedures before using any other dispute resolution mechanism. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish administrative procedures for providers to resolve disputes related to their agreements. An interim final rule must be prescribed within one year of the enactment of this Act to carry out section 1703A. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections in chapter 17 of the title. SEC. 4. Modification of authority to enter into agreements with state homes for nursing home care. Modification of authority to enter into agreements with state homes for nursing home care. The use of agreements under section 1745(a) of title 38, United States Code, is amended to exclude certain federal contracting provisions, allowing agreements to be entered into without competitive procedures. The amendments to section 1745 of title 38, United States Code, allow State homes to enter agreements without being subject to certain Medicare program laws. Eligible providers must still adhere to laws on integrity, ethics, fraud, penalties, employment discrimination, and equal opportunities. These amendments apply to agreements entered into on or after the specified date. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will publish the date when regulations implementing amendments to section 1745 of title 38, United States Code, take effect in the Federal Register at least 30 days before such date."
