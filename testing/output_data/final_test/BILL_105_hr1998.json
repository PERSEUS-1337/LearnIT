    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Yates Firearm Registration and Crime Prevention Act of 1997\". The Congress finds that crimes committed with guns threaten the peace, security, and welfare of the nation, increase firearm-related crimes due to unregulated circulation, create a burden on commerce, and discourage travel between states. Individual state regulations are ineffective due to lax regulations in other states. The need for national legislation to establish minimum standards for firearm registration and regulation is crucial to enable effective state action. Gun crimes have disrupted national political processes and pose a threat to the republican form of government. Firearm-related deaths and injuries are disproportionately high among younger age groups and minorities, with firearm homicide being the second leading cause of death for 15- to 19-year-olds. The Second Amendment protects states' rights to organize militias in emergencies. Firearm ownership is a privilege like driving, and the government must regulate to protect the public. Government officials, including Presidents, have been assassinated with firearms, highlighting the threat posed by unregulated gun circulation. SEC. 3.
