During World War II, US military personnel fought bravely against Japanese forces in the Pacific, preventing Japan from achieving strategic objectives. American troops in the Philippines were ordered to surrender in 1942 and endured a 65-mile march to prison camps. During World War II, more than 10,000 Americans died during the \"Bataan Death March\" and subsequent imprisonment due to starvation, disease, and executions. The treatment of prisoners of war in the Pacific Theater was so severe that over 40 percent died while imprisoned. Japanese military transported US prisoners to perform slave labor in Japan, Taiwan, Manchuria, and Korea on \"Hell Ships\", some of which were attacked by American forces. Following World War II, the US Government agreed to compensate ex-prisoners of war at $2.50 per day of imprisonment from frozen Japanese assets. However, this compensation could not fully make up for their sacrifices. Other Allied nations like Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands have also authorized gratuities for their surviving veterans captured by the Japanese during the war. The purpose of this section is to recognize and compensate members of the US Armed Forces and civilian employees who were captured by the Japanese military during World War II and forced to perform slave labor for Japanese corporations. The term \"selected veteran or civilian internee\" refers to individuals who served in or with US combat forces during World War II. During World War II, individuals captured by Japan and forced into slave labor for Japanese corporations are eligible for compensation. The term \"slave labor\" refers to forced servitude under subjugation. The Secretary of Defense will pay approved applicants compensation, and contributions for compensation are accepted during a specified period. The Secretary of Defense can accept gifts of money to provide compensation to selected veterans or civilian internees until December 31, 2007. Contributions will be deposited in the Department of Defense General Gift Fund and cannot be designated for a specific individual. The Secretary of Defense can accept gifts of money until December 31, 2007, to compensate selected veterans or civilian internees. Contributions are voluntary and cannot be used as proof in civil litigation. The acceptance of gifts may be declined if it reflects unfavorably on the Department of Defense's ability to carry out responsibilities fairly or compromises program integrity. The Secretary of Defense can accept contributions until December 31, 2007, to compensate selected veterans or civilian internees. The amount of compensation paid to each approved applicant is determined by funds appropriated and contributions received, not exceeding $20,000 per individual. An application for compensation creates a rebuttable presumption of eligibility for recognition as a selected veteran or civilian internee. Any compensation paid to selected veterans or civilian internees is additional to any other payments received under different laws for slave labor during World War II. Amounts paid under this section cannot be used for attorney fees in class action suits seeking compensation for those captured by Japan during the war. During World War II, Japanese corporations that used captured members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the United States as slave labor should make contributions for compensation to living veterans or civilian internees. Listed companies include Asano Dockyard, Electric-Chemical Company, Fujinagara Shipbuilding, Kobe, and Furukawa Mining, Omine Machi.
