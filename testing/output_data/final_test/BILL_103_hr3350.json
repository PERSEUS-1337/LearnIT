Section 3621 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to provide substance abuse treatment for eligible prisoners, with priority based on proximity to release date. The Bureau of Prisons aims to offer treatment to at least 50% of eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1995, increasing to 75% thereafter. The Bureau of Prisons aims to provide substance abuse treatment for eligible prisoners, with priority based on proximity to release date. Treatment is targeted for 75% of eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1996 and all eligible prisoners by the end of fiscal year 1997. Successful completion of the treatment program allows prisoners to remain in custody. Prisoners who successfully complete a treatment program will remain in custody for a period not exceeding their original prison term, but not less than that term minus one year. The Bureau of Prisons will periodically test these prisoners for substance abuse and discontinue any special conditions if abuse recurs. The Bureau of Prisons must provide annual reports to Congress detailing substance abuse treatment programs, eligibility criteria, and compliance with program requirements. Authorization of appropriations is granted for residential substance abuse treatment programs in each fiscal year to address the substance abuse problems of prisoners and develop their skills to solve related issues. The term 'eligible prisoner' refers to a prisoner identified by the Bureau of Prisons as having a substance abuse problem and willing to participate in a residential treatment program. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 3, 1993."
