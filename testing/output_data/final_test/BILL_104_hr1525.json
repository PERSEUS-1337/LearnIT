The Congress acknowledges the alarming growth of solid and hazardous waste in the United States, with each person discarding 3.6 pounds of garbage daily. Economic incentives alone are not effective in promoting waste minimization and responsible environmental behavior. Implementing a system of economic incentives and regulations targeted at waste reduction and recycling can decrease the amount and toxicity of materials entering the environment. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency requires additional statutory authority to address situations where economic incentives for waste reduction are inadequate, especially in encouraging greater recycling of used oils to prevent environmental damage and depletion of oil resources. Over 400 million gallons of used oil are improperly disposed of annually in ways that harm the environment and increase reliance on foreign oil. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include new recycling requirements for used oil under section 3015. The Oil Recycling Incentives Act mandates that lubricating oil producers or importers must recycle a certain amount of used oil annually for a specified period using approved methods. Compliance can be achieved by reintroducing used oil into refinery production. The Oil Recycling Incentives Act requires lubricating oil producers or importers to recycle used oil annually through approved methods, such as reintroducing it into refinery production, purchasing re-refined oil, or obtaining recycling credits. Producers must submit yearly reports on the amount of oil recycled, with possible interim reports as needed. The Oil Recycling Incentives Act mandates lubricating oil producers or importers to recycle used oil annually by re-refining it, purchasing re-refined oil, or obtaining recycling credits. Producers can also enter agreements with subsidiaries or divisions to meet recycling requirements or obtain recycling credits. The amount of used oil recycled is determined based on records of oil received. The Administrator annually determines the recycling percentage. The Administrator establishes a recycling percentage each year, starting 2 percentage points higher than the current rate for lubricating oil. The percentage increases by 2 points annually for 10 years. A credit system for recycling used oil must be implemented within 18 months of the Oil Recycling Incentives Act enactment. The Administrator will promulgate regulations for a credit system allowing recyclers to create credits for used oil recycling, which producers or importers can purchase to comply with regulations. The regulations will facilitate the simple and rapid generation and exchange of credits without individual approval. Minimum requirements for the regulations include specific criteria. Recyclers must keep records of used oil quantities received, prices paid, recycled oil quantities sold, destinations, re-refined oil sales, and recycling credit sales for at least 3 years. Recyclers must maintain records of recycled oil sales, including details of producers and importers, prices charged, and quantities sold. They must also sell recycled oil as specified types and keep records of testing to ensure compliance with standards. Producers and importers of lubricating oil must keep records of oil production, recycling activities, and sales of re-refined oil or lubricant. The regulations require recyclers to keep records of recycled oil sales, including details of producers and importers, prices charged, and quantities sold. They must also sell recycled oil as specified types and maintain testing records for compliance. The Administrator may include additional requirements for qualifications, auditing compliance, and enforcement in the regulations for the recycling credit system. The Administrator will establish a procedure for interested parties to petition for credits under the recycling credit system for used oil with new technology. A report on the implementation of the Oil Recycling Incentives Act must be submitted to Congress within 6 years, evaluating its impact on the lubricating oil industry, used oil recycling industry, and the environment. The Administrator will submit a final report to Congress 10 years after the implementation of the Oil Recycling Incentives Act, evaluating the recycling percentage and making recommendations for future increases. Definitions for \"producer\" in relation to lubricating oil production are also provided. The term 'importer' refers to a person who imports lubricant base stock, while 'lubricant base stock' is the oil used to make lubricating oil with additives. A 'used oil collection center' includes facilities that collect or generate used oil, excluding individuals removing oil from light duty vehicles or households. The term 'recycler' refers to an owner or operator of a used oil recycling facility, while a 'recycling credit' is a legal record of recycling activity. A 'used oil recycling facility' is a facility that re-refines or reprocesses used oil. This section applies to individuals who produce or import over 100,000 gallons of lubricating oil annually, and the Administrator will establish regulations. The Administrator will promulgate regulations to implement the Oil Recycling Incentives Act within 18 months of enactment. If regulations are not in place by then, the recycling percentage will be 40 percent. Amendments are made to the table of contents for subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. \"Recycling requirements for used oil under Sec. 3015.\""
