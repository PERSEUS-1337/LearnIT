    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Materials Corridor and United States-Mexico Border Technology Partnership Act of 2000\". Congress finds that the United States-Mexico border region has experienced rapid economic growth, leading to environmental issues that threaten health and long-term economic growth. Major institutions in border States are researching technologies to address these problems, offering significant opportunities for improvement. The United States-Mexico border region offers opportunities to minimize industrial wastes, reduce pollution, use recycled resources, and improve energy efficiency. This benefits both sides of the border by promoting environmentally sound economic development. In August 1998, experts from the US and Mexico reached a consensus on hazardous waste management during a binational forum organized by the Department of Energy's Carlsbad Area Office. The Department of Energy's science and technology can address environmental issues in the US-Mexico border region, with the Carlsbad Area Office well-suited to lead a multiagency program. Promoting clean, energy-efficient industries in the border region is a high priority according to the United States-Mexico Foundation for Science Cooperation. Mexico proposed joint funding for a Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative at the 1998 discussions of the United States-Mexico Binational Commission. The Materials Corridor Council was established in 1998 to implement a cooperative program of materials research and development, education, and sustainable industrial development with strong endorsement from the Government of Mexico. Successful implementation of this initiative would advance collaboration between the two nations. The successful implementation of the Act would advance important US energy, environmental, and economic goals in the US-Mexico border region and could serve as a model for similar initiatives worldwide. The Act aims to establish a multiagency program to address economic development issues along the US-Mexico border, support the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative, and promote environmentally friendly economic development through new technologies. The program will be implemented by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will establish a multiagency program to address economic development issues along the US-Mexico border, support the Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative, and promote environmentally friendly economic development through new technologies, particularly hazardous waste and materials technologies. The program will consider proposals from the United States-Mexico Binational Commission. The Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative program will be managed by the Department's Carlsbad Area Office with support from the Albuquerque Operations Office. The Secretary will collaborate with various federal agencies and commissions, as well as involve the private sector when appropriate. The program under this act aims to promote energy efficient technologies in the US-Mexico border region with the support of private sector organizations. The Secretary will encourage Mexican entities to contribute resources and emphasize technology transfer from national laboratories. The Secretary will emphasize technology transfer from national laboratories in the program. The Secretary will focus on technology transfer from national laboratories in the program. SEC. 6. ACTIVITIES AND MAJOR PROGRAM ELEMENTS. Activities under this Act focus on technology deployment, research, and training related to hazardous waste and materials technologies along the US-Mexico border. The program emphasizes minimizing industrial wastes, reducing atmospheric pollutants, using recycled resources, and improving energy efficiency. The program focuses on technology deployment, research, and training in energy efficient and environmentally sound technologies. Projects involve private sector participation. Private sector organizations are involved in projects focusing on technology deployment, research, and training in energy efficient and environmentally sound technologies. They would use or sell such technology. SEC. 7. Participation of departments, agencies, and commissions other than the Department of Energy. The Secretary must enter into an agreement with other departments, agencies, and commissions for program coordination. Actions taken under the agreement are the responsibility of the respective entity. Funds can be used for technology deployment, research, and training by various organizations. The Secretary may transfer funds to departments, agencies, and commissions to carry out their responsibilities under this Act. Funds can be provided to organizations in the United States and Mexico, with the condition that Mexican entities contribute significantly to the project. SEC. 8. PROGRAM ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The Secretary will establish an advisory committee with representatives from various sectors, considering existing organizations like the Materials Corridor Council and the Business Council for Sustainable Development-Gulf Mexico. Departments receiving funds under this Act must consult and coordinate with the advisory committee on project identification and implementation. Federal departments, agencies, and commissions can offer financial and technical assistance to other organizations for program purposes. They should use cooperative agreements for funding technology deployment and research activities, with exceptions for national laboratories. The Federal Government will pay up to 50% of technology deployment or research costs, with no credit for funds spent outside the project scope. Federal departments should use grants for training activities by non-government organizations. The Federal Government may fund training activities by organizations outside the government, including national laboratories. Funding methods other than grants can be used for national laboratories if more convenient. The government can fund 100% of training activity costs. Projects funded under contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements should be selected through an open, competitive process. The program allows for waivers of government accounting standards to facilitate participation. Generally accepted accounting principles are sufficient for projects. Program funds cannot be used for construction. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004."
