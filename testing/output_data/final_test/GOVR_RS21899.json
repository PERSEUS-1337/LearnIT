    "content": "CBP was formed by combining various border law enforcement agencies. Its mission includes preventing terrorists and illegal weapons from entering the country, securing borders and ports, apprehending illegal immigrants, combating illegal drug trafficking, and protecting American interests. CBP faces the challenge of balancing security with facilitating trade and travel. In FY2010, CBP had a budget of $10.13 billion and approximately 58,105 employees. The U.S. Border Patrol, a component of CBP, enforces immigration and federal laws between official ports of entry. The U.S. Border Patrol (USBP), a component of CBP, enforces U.S. immigration and federal laws along the border to prevent entry of terrorists, weapons, unauthorized aliens, and drug smugglers. They patrol over 8,000 miles of borders and coastal waters. CBP officers at ports of entry conduct immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections, streamlining the process through cross-training. CBP inspectors enforce immigration and customs laws at ports of entry, ensuring travelers have legal documents and inspecting imports and exports for compliance with U.S. regulations. They also conduct agricultural inspections to enforce animal and plant protection laws. CBP inspectors have broad powers to inspect persons, vehicles, merchandise, and baggage entering the United States. ICE is the principal investigative arm for DHS, focusing on detecting and preventing terrorist and criminal acts by targeting individuals, money, and materials supporting these networks. In FY2010, ICE had a budget of $5.44 billion and around 20,134 employees. Unlike CBP, ICE special agents investigate immigration and customs violations within the United States, including uncovering national security threats. ICE's mandate includes uncovering national security threats, identifying criminal aliens for removal, probing immigration-related fraud, investigating work-site violations, interdicting narcotics shipments, and detaining illegal immigrants for removal from the United States. ICE is also responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence data related to homeland security and the illegal movement of people, money, and cargo within the country. The Coast Guard, a standalone agency under DHS, aims to protect the public, environment, and U.S. economic interests in maritime regions. The Coast Guard is the nation's principal maritime law enforcement authority, responsible for port security and evaluating commercial ships approaching U.S. waters. In FY2010, its budget was $10.14 billion with around 49,954 military and civilian employees. Each port area has a high-ranking Coast Guard officer serving as the Captain of the Port, responsible for security and safety. The Coast Guard plays a crucial role in homeland security, protecting ports, coastline, and maritime borders from various threats. They are involved in preventing terrorism, illegal activities, environmental hazards, and coordinating with other agencies. The TSA was created after September 11 to protect transportation systems. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act established TSA, required baggage screening, and expanded FAMS. TSA was transferred to DHS in 2002, then back in 2006. In FY2010, TSA had $5.26 billion in appropriations and around 51,949 employees. TSA is responsible for securing aviation by screening passengers, baggage, and air cargo. They oversee security measures at airports, conduct background checks for airport personnel, and manage the Federal Air Marshals program. Airports can opt out of federal screeners for private ones. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated agencies like CBP, ICE, U.S. Coast Guard, and TSA for border security. Other federal agencies, such as U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Department of State, and Department of Agriculture, also play roles in securing borders. The Department of Agriculture establishes agricultural policies executed by CBP Inspectors. The Department of Justice coordinates with CBP and ICE agents for law enforcement. Other agencies involved in border security include the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Treasury Department, and Central Intelligence Agency. State and local responders along the Canadian and Mexican borders also play a significant role. Local responders from jurisdictions along the Canadian and Mexican borders play a significant role in securing the nation's borders."
