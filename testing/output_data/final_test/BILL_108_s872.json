    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Northern Ireland Peace and Reconciliation Support Act of 2003\". Congress finds that the United States has been actively involved in the Northern Ireland peace process by participating in negotiations and supporting economic development in the region. The Government of Ireland, the Irish people, the Government of the United Kingdom, and the British people are all close allies of the United States. In 1986, the United States established the International Fund for Ireland to aid in economic development in support of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The International Fund aims to support economic development and peace in Northern Ireland and border areas of the Republic of Ireland. The United States has donated over $386 million to the Fund, creating jobs and business opportunities for Catholics and Protestants to work together. More than 80% of investments target disadvantaged areas, providing job training and work experience for youth. The International Fund supports economic development and peace in Northern Ireland and border areas of the Republic of Ireland. It promotes reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants, develops new leaders, and aims for a peaceful and prosperous future in the region. The United States contributes to the Fund to support reconciliation and the establishment of a society free from discrimination and terrorism. The United States assistance to the International Fund has greatly contributed to economic development and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, aligning with the objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 established the Northern Ireland Executive Assembly and Executive Committee, promoting inclusivity and democracy in the region. The Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland called for police reform and the establishment of a new policing system based on human rights principles. The Independent Commission on Policing made recommendations for reform, some of which have been implemented. In 2002, the Department of State issued a report on policing reform and human rights in Northern Ireland, concluding that a new police training facility and increased funding for training programs were critically needed. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress is that the United States should continue to support economic development and reconciliation projects in Northern Ireland through the International Fund to promote peace and stability. Policing reform and community relations are also highlighted as important aspects of achieving public confidence in the new government. The curr_chunk discusses programs to improve relations between communities and police officers, promote human rights training for officers, and enhance peaceful mediation in conflict-ridden neighborhoods. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 outlines its purposes. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-415; 100 Stat. 947) is amended to provide United States contributions for economic support fund assistance and other aid to promote reconciliation and economic development in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The curr_chunk emphasizes the establishment of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland, free from discrimination and terrorism, with equal participation in government structures. The curr_chunk focuses on United States contributions to the International Fund under the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to authorize $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for United States contributions to the International Fund. These funds can be used for programs to enhance police-community relations. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to authorize $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for United States contributions to the International Fund. This funding is intended for programs to enhance police-community relations, promote human rights training for police officers, peaceful mediation in conflict neighborhoods, and training programs for new district partnership police boards in Northern Ireland. Congress recommends allocating at least 20 percent of the authorized amount for these programs in each fiscal year. The Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 is amended to include improving local community relations and relations between police officers and the people they serve in the annual report."
