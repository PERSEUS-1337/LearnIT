    "content": "The United States' natural gas supply is growing due to technological advancements like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, increasing the extraction of shale gas. Shale gas is expected to be the main source of U.S. natural gas by 2040, requiring the expansion of pipeline infrastructure at local and national levels. Currently, over 300,000 miles of interstate transmission pipelines transport natural gas across the country, but the projected growth in shale gas production may necessitate substantial new pipelines. For instance, the INGAA Foundation estimates the total cost of new gas gathering and transmission pipelines. The total cost of new gas gathering and transmission pipelines could exceed $200 billion through 2035. Congressional interest in federal certification of interstate natural gas pipelines has increased. The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act aims to expedite the review process. The report provides an overview of the federal certification process and discusses key provisions in H.R. 161. Issues related to Presidential Permits for gas pipelines crossing borders are also addressed. Under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC is authorized to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for interstate natural gas pipelines. Companies must obtain these certificates before building pipelines. FERC's regulatory process for certification includes several steps, which may vary depending on whether a developer opts for a voluntary pre-filing process. Issues related to Presidential Permits for gas pipelines crossing borders are also discussed. The developer may choose to engage in a voluntary pre-filing process with FERC before applying for a pipeline certificate. This process involves notifying stakeholders, including government agencies and property owners, about the proposed project to gather input and incorporate environmental mitigation measures. The goal is to improve the project proposal and prevent issues during the review process. The pre-filing process involves specific activities by the developer, such as studying project sites, engaging stakeholders, and conducting field surveys. FERC participates in open houses, publishes notices for environmental assessments, and consults with stakeholders and government agencies during the scoping period. The pre-filing process for a pipeline project involves engaging stakeholders, conducting field surveys, and submitting a written request to FERC's Office of Energy Projects. Developers must start this process seven to eight months before filing a certificate application. If approved, FERC issues a pre-filing docket number for the project. The application for a new pipeline project must include route maps, construction plans, environmental reports, and other regulatory requirements. FERC issues a Notice of Application for public review and considers factors like public interest and environmental impact when deciding on granting a pipeline certificate. FERC considers factors such as overbuilding, subsidization, environmental impacts, eminent domain, and safety concerns in pipeline certificate applications. Environmental review, mandated by NEPA and CEQ regulations, is a key aspect of FERC's review process. FERC, designated as the lead agency for NEPA compliance, reviews pipeline certificate applications. The environmental review process begins with a Notice of Intent for an Environmental Assessment or Impact Statement. The commission typically prepares an Environmental Assessment to determine if there are significant impacts. When FERC reviews pipeline certificate applications, they may issue a finding of no significant impact or require a more detailed environmental impact statement if impacts are significant. Projects falling under categorical exclusions are exempt from EIS or EA requirements. EIS preparation involves a draft and final stage, including a statement of purpose, reasonable alternatives, and other requirements. For a proposed project, FERC must consider alternatives, environmental impacts, and effects, including cumulative impacts. FERC collaborates with agencies like the EPA, DOT, DOI, and Army Corps of Engineers for input. After conducting environmental analysis and consulting with cooperating agencies for a certificate application, FERC issues a draft EIS with initial recommendations for pipeline approval or denial. A 45-day public comment period follows, with public meetings held in the project area. Only intervenors in the proceeding have the right to file briefs, attend hearings, and appeal FERC's decision. After the public comment period for the draft EIS, FERC revises the document based on received comments before issuing a final environmental statement with recommendations for approval or denial of the certificate. A final agency decision, like a FERC order, can only be issued at least 30 days after the notice of availability of the final EIS, with no further opportunity for public comment. After the final EIS is issued, FERC may approve or deny the pipeline certificate application. If approved, the order will specify the authorized pipeline route, construction requirements, and environmental mitigation measures. A FERC certificate grants eminent domain authority to the developer, preempting any conflicting state or local laws. This authority allows the developer to secure property rights for the pipeline if negotiations with landowners fail, although eminent domain is typically a last resort. In practice, eminent domain authority is rarely used by developers, as it is considered a last resort. A FERC certificate authorizes a pipeline under the Natural Gas Act but does not preempt other federal laws like the Endangered Species Act or the Clean Water Act. Developers must obtain additional federal approvals for water crossings, crossing federal lands, and other requirements before proceeding with pipeline construction. Parties can request a rehearing if they object to FERC's order granting or denying a pipeline certificate. After a FERC certificate is approved, the pipeline project can proceed even if challenges are filed in federal court. Once the developer meets the certificate's terms, FERC can issue a Notice to Proceed with Construction Activities. Weekly status reports must be filed until construction is completed, with no statutory time limits for FERC to finish. FERC has the authority to establish a schedule for all federal authorizations under EPAct, allowing for judicial petition if agencies fail to comply. This addresses concerns of delays in interstate gas pipeline approvals due to lack of coordination among agencies. Final decisions from federal or state agencies must be made within 90 days of FERC's final environmental document, unless another schedule is established by law. The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act (H.R. 161) aims to impose a 12-month deadline on FERC certificate reviews for projects using pre-filing procedures. It also codifies a 90-day regulatory deadline for agency decisions related to certificates, with default approval if the deadline is not met. The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act (H.R. 161) sets a 90-day deadline for agencies to approve or deny licenses, permits, or approvals for prefiled projects seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the Act. The deadline can be extended by 30 days if needed, with the Commission providing technical assistance to help complete the review process. The Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act (H.R. 161) establishes a 90-day deadline for agencies to approve or deny licenses, permits, or approvals for prefiled projects seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity. If the agency does not make a decision within the specified time period, the license, permit, or approval will automatically take effect after 30 days. The Commission will include any conditions proposed by the agency that are not deemed inconsistent with the final environmental document. This legislation addresses concerns about delays in FERC review of gas pipeline certificate applications due to agencies not meeting deadlines, with potential judicial action as the only consequence for non-compliance. The INGAA Foundation study found that nearly 20% of FERC certifications for gas pipelines were delayed 90 days or longer beyond FERC's deadline. Few developers have sought court intervention due to the costly and time-consuming nature of litigation. There is debate on whether FERC's current pipeline certification process adequately meets the market's needs for new infrastructure. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) study in February 2013 reported that the average time for FERC pipeline certificate reviews was 558 days (18.6 months). The pre-filing process typically takes place 210 days before filing a certificate application. The average time for FERC pipeline certificate reviews is 558 days, with a pre-filing process of 210 days. FERC commissioners have been supportive of legislative proposals for stronger certificate review authorities. Gas transmission capacity has increased rapidly since the shale gas expansion in 2006-2008. FERC has issued permits for nearly 10,000 miles of new pipeline construction in the last decade. Commissioners acknowledge delays in pipeline application reviews due to approvals needed from cooperating agencies after FERC's environmental reviews. They support greater FERC authority to enforce certificate review deadlines. Outgoing FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff is not opposed to legislation increasing FERC's deadline authority. H.R. 161 would impose a 12-month deadline for FERC's pipeline certification process, aiming to expedite reviews without changing the current review criteria or relationships with other agencies. Similar deadline provisions exist for energy project permit applications. The provisions in H.R. 161 impose a 12-month deadline for FERC's pipeline certification process, aiming to expedite reviews without changing current criteria or relationships with other agencies. This deadline could potentially impact lengthy or complex pipeline projects, especially those routed through heavily populated or environmentally sensitive areas. The certificate review for pipeline projects lasted 676 days, with a 210-day pre-filing period. It is unclear how FERC could shorten the review process for complex NEPA evaluations. Imposing a 12-month deadline under H.R. 161 may lead to denials due to insufficient review time, as seen in the case of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2012. TransCanada applied for a Presidential Permit to build the Keystone XL pipeline, citing time constraints imposed by Congress. FERC officials expressed concerns about the limited timeframe for permit approval. The Mineral Leasing Act sets deadlines based on meeting review requirements. FERC Commissioner Moeller mentioned FERC's ability to meet deadlines in testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce in July 2013. Commissioner Moeller from the Committee on Energy and Commerce mentioned that FERC could meet the 12-month deadline proposed in H.R. 161 for gas pipeline certificate applications if they are complete at the start. However, a strict 12-month deadline for all FERC certificate reviews could lead to rejection or delays for worthy proposals if unexpected issues arise. This may result in developers breaking up larger projects into smaller ones for quicker review, potentially causing inefficiencies in the certification process and infrastructure design. Congress should consider making the deadline more flexible. Congress may consider making the 12-month deadline for FERC certificate reviews more flexible to accommodate projects that require additional review time due to size and complexity. H.R. 161 codifies FERC's 90-day deadline for other agencies to make final decisions after FERC issues its environmental document, with the only change being the mandated time period. The optimal length of the deadline is uncertain, but FERC has examined this question through its rulemaking process. This deadline only applies after FERC completes its environmental review. H.R. 161 affirms FERC's 90-day deadline for other agencies to make final decisions after FERC's environmental review. This provision may limit FERC's flexibility in adjusting the deadline in the future. Some see it as necessary to ensure timely reviews, while others view it as overly prescriptive. Congress may need to consider the balance between FERC's enforcement authority and its ability to manage review deadlines. H.R. 161 would automatically approve any license, permit, or approval requested from a cooperating agency if the decision is not made within FERC's 90-day deadline. This provision is uncommon in energy project approvals, with few precedents found. FERC has limited enforcement authority in this area. Opponents of H.R. 161 have raised concerns about the 90-day deadline for permit reviews by cooperating agencies, fearing it may lead to denials due to insufficient time for review and permit conditions development. The Obama Administration in the 113th Congress opposed such deadlines, citing potential conflicts with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The bill H.R. 161 may cause conflicts with existing statutory and regulatory requirements, leading to delays in projects and more denials. Congress could consider maintaining FERC's authority to set review schedules while finding alternative ways to enforce them. The main impact of H.R. 161 would be imposing strict time limits on FERC's certification process for new natural gas pipelines. The bill H.R. 161 imposes strict time limits on FERC's certification process for new natural gas pipelines, which may strain agency resources and impact the ability to meet deadlines. Availability and allocation of resources within agencies are crucial for meeting these deadlines. Federal, state, and local agencies face varying funding constraints for regulatory review. Similar requirements to H.R. 161 have been imposed on agencies for energy project approvals. Various statutes in the last decade have set explicit deadlines for federal energy permits, such as drilling permits and LNG terminals. The Mineral Leasing Act mandates a 30-day deadline for drilling permit approvals. The Maritime Administration has a 330-day time limit for granting or denying a deepwater port license, with a 45-day deadline for specific agency reviews. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to approve or disapprove oil and gas exploration plans within 30 days, and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act mandates the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a final decision on a nuclear waste repository project proposal within 3 years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) sets time limits for FERC to approve electric transmission siting applications and for the Secretary of Energy to approve tribal energy agreements. The Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-78) requires the Secretary of State to issue a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline within 60 days. Recent legislative proposals have aimed to impose statutory deadlines on energy project permit decisions. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2003 would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve or deny permits for an Alaska natural gas pipeline project within 60 days of the final environmental impact statement. The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 would have required timely review of permit decisions for electric transmission projects in the Western Interconnection. The Energy Exploration and Production to Achieve National Demand Act (H.R. 4301, 112th Congress) proposed deadlines for approving new oil refinery permits, while the North American Energy Access Act (H.R. 3548, 112th Congress) aimed to transfer permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline project to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with a 30-day deadline for issuing a permit. The bill required the commission to issue a permit for the project within 30 days of enactment, deeming a permit to have been issued if no action was taken on the application within 30 days."
