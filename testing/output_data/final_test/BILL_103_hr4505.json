    "content": "The \"Patent Term Amendment Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. It addresses patent term issues. Section 154 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to grant patentees the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling their invention in the United States for a term of twenty years from the filing date of the patent application. The term of a patent can be extended up to five years in cases of delays due to certain proceedings. Priority under specific sections shall not affect the patent term. A copy of the specification and drawings must be included in the patent. Establishment of a domestic priority system. Section 119 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to allow for the benefit of an earlier filing date for patent applications filed in the US by individuals who previously filed in a foreign country with similar privileges. The US application must be filed within twelve months of the foreign application, and no patent will be granted if the invention was patented or published more than a year prior. The US patent law allows for priority to be claimed for patent applications filed in foreign countries, provided that the application is filed within twelve months of the foreign application. Certification and documentation from the foreign patent office are required for this process. The US patent law allows for priority to be claimed for patent applications filed in foreign countries within twelve months. The Commissioner may require a translation of non-English papers and additional information. The right under subsection (a) can be based on a subsequent foreign application if the first one has been withdrawn or abandoned. Applications for inventor's certificates in foreign countries can be filed for either a patent or an inventor's certificate. An application for a patent or inventor's certificate in the US will be treated the same for priority purposes as applications for patents, as long as the applicants are entitled to benefits of the Paris Convention. Additionally, an application for a patent filed after a provisional application by the same inventor will have the same effect as if filed on the date of the provisional application. Section 111(b) allows for a provisional application to be filed, with the condition that a regular patent application is filed within twelve months referencing the provisional application. A fee of $150 is required for each provisional application. Section 111 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to require patent applications to be made in writing by the inventor, including a specification, drawing, and oath. Failure to submit the fee and oath within the prescribed period will result in the application being regarded as abandoned. The filing date of a patent application is determined by the receipt of the specification and drawing. A provisional patent application must include a specification and drawing, with no claim required initially. The fee for the application can be submitted after the specification and drawing are filed. The fee for a provisional patent application must be submitted within a prescribed period, or the application will be considered abandoned. The filing date of a provisional application is determined by the receipt of the specification and drawing, and it will be abandoned twelve months after filing with no option for revival. An application filed under section 111(a) may be treated as a provisional application under certain conditions. A provisional patent application does not have the right of priority or benefit of an earlier filing date in the United States. The usual patent application rules apply to provisional applications, with some exceptions. SEC. 4. CONFORMING CHANGES. In chapter 11 of title 35, United States Code, amendments are made to sections 111, 119, 156, 172, 173, and 365 regarding patents and priority rights. Amendments are made to sections 119 and 365 of title 35, United States Code, changing references to subsections 119(a) through 119(d) and subsection 365(b). Subsection 373 is also amended to reflect these changes. The effective date for Sections 2 through 4 is six months from enactment and applies to applications filed in the United States on or after that date. The term of a patent granted on a plant or utility application filed after the effective date with a reference to an earlier filed application shall be measured from the filing date of the earliest application referenced."
