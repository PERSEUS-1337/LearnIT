    "content": "Title XI of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called \"Rural Community Service\" with the purpose of providing findings and establishing a program for rural community service. The Congress finds that rural centers are facing pressing problems in various areas and there are people with underutilized skills who can help address these issues. Their skills, if applied systematically, can make a significant contribution to solving these problems. The purpose of this part is to provide incentives to rural academic institutions to collaborate with private and civic organizations in devising and implementing solutions to pressing problems in their communities. The Secretary is authorized to carry out a program providing assistance to eligible institutions for rural community service grants. Each eligible institution seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing the activities and services for which assistance is needed. The application must also include assurances that the institution will collaborate with a consortium that may consist of a community college or a rural local educational agency. The Secretary may waive consortium requirements for applicants with an integrated plan. Priority is given to joint projects with other programs. Selection procedures will be developed and announced in the Federal Register. The Secretary will announce selection procedures and funding availability in the Federal Register for this part. The Secretary will announce selection procedures and funding availability in the Federal Register for authorized activities under SEC. 1174. Grant funds under this part are used for planning, research, training, and services to assist rural communities with issues like workforce preparation, poverty alleviation, healthcare, education, elderly and disabled challenges, family issues, and crime prevention. The curr_chunk discusses enhanced security measures, coordinated programs addressing crime root causes, rural housing, infrastructure, economic development, farming, environmental concerns, accessibility for individuals with disabilities, and inclusion barriers. The Secretary will appoint a peer review panel to evaluate applications for funding under this part. The panel will be geographically diverse and include experts from various sectors such as education, labor, business, and government. Additionally, funds will be disbursed according to the recommendations of the peer review panel. ``SEC. 1176. DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS.\n\nGrants under this part may be awarded on a multiyear basis, with a maximum of 5 years per institution. The Secretary will ensure grants are distributed fairly across different regions. Applicants must match a quarter of the grant amount with non-Federal funds.\n\n``SEC. 1177. DESIGNATION OF RURAL GRANT INSTITUTIONS. The Secretary will designate eligible institutions as 'Rural Grant Institutions' to establish a national network for sharing project results across the country. The term 'rural area' refers to areas outside urbanized areas with populations of 75,000 or more. An 'eligible institution' is a higher education institution located in a rural area that enrolls a significant number of students from rural or neighboring areas. The eligible institution in a rural area must have the capacity to provide educational opportunities, offer a variety of programs, and demonstrate a commitment to the rural community and its residents. Authorization of appropriations is granted for necessary funds each fiscal year to implement the provisions of this part. If the allocated amount is less than 50% of the funds for part A, the Secretary will provide the difference from part A funds."
