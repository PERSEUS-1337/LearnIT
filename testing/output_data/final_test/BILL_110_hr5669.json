Congress finds that poison centers are crucial in the United States for diagnosing and treating poisoning victims, handling over 4 million calls in 2007. Poisoning is a significant cause of unintentional deaths, with 3-5 million exposures annually, primarily affecting children. In 2005, poisoning accounted for 285,000 hospitalizations, 1.2 million days of acute hospital care, and over 26,000 fatalities, with 60% of exposures involving children under 6. Fatalities from accidental or unknown poisonings have been increasing in the United States, with 26,858 deaths in 2005, representing a significant increase since 1990. The funding of programs to address this trend is crucial. The Institute of Medicine recommended increasing funding for poison control centers to support a national network, estimating over $100 million annually. This funding would promote the utilization of poison control centers, reducing inappropriate use of emergency medical services. The report to Congress highlighted that investing in the Nation's poison centers results in significant cost savings for health care programs. In 2005, over $525 million in direct Federal health care program savings were attributed to poison center public health services. Despite this, Federal funding support for poison centers is less than 11% of their annual expenditures. Real-time data from poison centers is crucial for detecting and responding to contamination events. Poison centers play a crucial role in detecting and responding to contamination events in the air, water, pharmaceuticals, and food supply. They are relied upon for accurate medical information and public health emergency response in the event of a terrorist attack involving chemical, radiological, or biological agents. The Public Health Service Act is amended to reauthorize the national toll-free number for poison centers. The Secretary will provide coordination and assistance for the establishment and maintenance of the toll-free phone number. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2000 through 2014. Additionally, there is a reauthorization of a nationwide media campaign to promote poison center utilization. The Public Health Service Act is amended to reauthorize the national toll-free number for poison centers and a nationwide media campaign to promote poison center utilization. Section 1272 is amended to focus on the media campaign. The Secretary will conduct a national media campaign to educate the public and healthcare providers about poison prevention and the availability of poison center resources. This may include contracts with a recognized organization for the development and implementation of awareness campaigns through various media channels. Evaluation of the campaign's effectiveness is also required. The Secretary will establish measures to evaluate the impact of the nationwide media campaign and submit annual evaluations to Congress. Funding of $600,000 for 2000-2005, necessary sums for 2006-2009, and $1,500,000 for 2010-2014 are authorized. The effective date is upon enactment and applies to contracts from January 1, 2009 onwards. SEC. 5. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE POISON CENTER GRANT PROGRAM. Amends Section 1273 of the Public Health Service Act to maintain the Poison Center Grant Program. The Secretary will award grants to poison centers and professional organizations for preventing poisonings, providing treatment recommendations, and meeting operational requirements. Grant funds can also be used for establishing best practices in poison prevention, outreach, and emergency programs, as well as for research and development. The Secretary will award grants to poison centers and professional organizations for various purposes, including developing patient management guidelines, enhancing toxic exposure surveillance, improving technology capabilities, fostering public health utilization of poison data, and expanding toxicologic expertise within poison centers. The Secretary awards grants to poison centers to support toxicologic expertise, improve capacity to handle high call volumes during crises, and require certification by professional organizations or state governments with approved standards for public health protection. The Secretary may grant a waiver of certification requirements for noncertified poison centers applying for a grant if they can demonstrate they will obtain certification within a reasonable period, not exceeding 5 years. The Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008 allows for a waiver of certification requirements for noncertified poison centers applying for a grant, with a limit of 5 years to obtain certification. Amounts granted to poison centers should supplement, not replace, other funds. Centers must maintain their expenditures at or above the previous fiscal year's level. Authorization of appropriations is set at $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004. The Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008 authorizes appropriations of $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004, $27,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009, and $35,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014, with $1,500,000 allocated for grants. The effective date of this amendment is the date of enactment. The Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008 authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2014, with $1,500,000 allocated for grants. The Act applies to grants made on or after January 1, 2009."
