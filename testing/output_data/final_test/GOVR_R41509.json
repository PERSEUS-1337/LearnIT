    "content": "A land exchange, also known as a swap or trade, is a real estate transaction combining the sale and purchase of land. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is authorized to exchange land under various acts, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. These exchanges, often discretionary, are governed by BLM regulations and guidelines outlined in the Land Exchange Handbook. From FY2006 to FY2015, the Bureau of Land Management completed 218 land exchanges totaling 159,130 acres with a value of $86.7 million. In FY2015, the lowest number of exchanges occurred, with only two deeds issued for 95 acres valued at $17,200. In FY2015, the Bureau of Land Management received a cash equalization payment of $17,200 for 95 acres of exchanged land, as they did not acquire any deeds for exchanged lands that year. The number of BLM exchanges has been declining over the past 25 years, with FY2015 being the only year in the decade where no lands were acquired by exchange. The Bureau of Land Management completed 309 exchange transactions from FY2006 to FY2015, with an average of 31 transactions annually. The decline in exchanges is due to various factors such as staffing and funding reductions, changing priorities, and preferences for land sales. Exchanges help consolidate scattered lands, increase land management efficiency, and decrease costs. BLM land exchanges can be valuable for facilitating transactions with private landowners and reconfiguring state lands, but they can be difficult due to the need to find willing trade partners. Federal audits have criticized some exchanges for short-changing the public. BLM land exchanges have faced criticism for not demonstrating equal public value in acquired and disposed lands. Audits by GAO, DOI OIG, and TAF highlighted political pressures to manipulate market values. Reforms were implemented, including consolidating appraisal functions in a new office in 2003. The process for conducting administrative land exchanges is briefly outlined. FLPMA requires federal and nonfederal lands in an exchange to be in the same state and in the public interest. The Secretary of the Interior must consider factors like federal land management and local needs when determining the public interest. BLM often trades land to improve federal land management, such as consolidating ownership and disposing of isolated or difficult-to-manage land. Considerations include protecting fish and wildlife habitat and cultural resources. Under BLM regulations, considerations include protection of fish and wildlife habitat, cultural resources, watersheds, wilderness, and aesthetic values; enhancement of recreational opportunities and public access; consolidation of lands to improve development; and expansion of communities. The Secretary must ensure that the resource values and public benefits of the federal lands to be conveyed are not less than those of the nonfederal lands being acquired. BLM must reserve any rights needed to protect the public interest and may impose restrictions on the use of lands conveyed. Values of lands exchanged under FLPMA should be equal or equalized by payment of money up to 25% of the value of federal lands conveyed. The parties in a land exchange may equalize values by payment of money up to 25% of the federal lands' value. The Secretary of the Interior can exchange lands of \"approximately\" equal value under certain conditions. Appraisal can be done by DOI appraisers or contracted appraisers. BLM and other parties typically share administrative costs equally, including land appraisal and surveys. An assembled land exchange involves consolidating multiple parcels of federal or nonfederal land for exchange transactions. Third parties may secure lands for the BLM to acquire from multiple owners. For-profit and nonprofit organizations often act as brokers in these exchanges. Lands acquired by BLM become public lands managed under existing laws and regulations. BLM manages acquired lands under existing laws and regulations. Exchanges can be proposed by various entities but must align with land-use plans. The Secretary of the Interior can restrict mining laws on federal lands under exchange consideration. The exchange process involves five phases, with BLM field offices leading negotiations and processing. BLM field offices lead negotiations and processing of land exchanges, with headquarters approval required. Exchanges can take 18 months to 24 months, but completion times vary. GAO review showed completion times ranging from two months to 12 years, with BLM averaging about four years. Initial phase involves discussions and title checks for land acceptability. During the second phase of land exchanges, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) prepares a feasibility report that includes details such as public benefits, costs, land uses, value analysis, and completion schedule. The documentation at this stage requires review and concurrence at various levels before proceeding with the exchange proposal. During the land exchange process, various levels of approval are required, including the DOI Office of the Solicitor, state director, BLM's National Land Exchange Team, BLM assistant director, and BLM director. Parties may sign a nonbinding agreement outlining roles, responsibilities, and time frames, addressing 17 items per BLM regulations. For exchanges involving third-party facilitators, full disclosure is necessary. A binding exchange agreement may be developed later in the process. BLM is restricted from completing exchanges over $1 million without Appropriations Committee approval. The land exchange process requires approval from various levels, including the DOI Office of the Solicitor, state director, BLM's National Land Exchange Team, BLM assistant director, and BLM director. Exchanges over $1 million need approval from the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The third phase involves evaluating properties, conducting title reviews, public notices, environmental assessments, consultations, and appraisals. BLM issues a Notice of Exchange Proposal (NOEP) and publishes it in local newspapers for public notice. BLM issues a Notice of Exchange Proposal (NOEP) in local newspapers to notify stakeholders and invite public comments on land exchanges. The environmental analysis under NEPA and appraisals are crucial and time-consuming, assessing the impact on the environment and resources of federal and nonfederal lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) conducts appraisals for land exchanges based on market value and guided by various laws and regulations. Appraisers consider factors like historic, wildlife, recreation, wilderness, scenic, cultural, and other resource values when determining the highest and best use of the property. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) conducts appraisals for land exchanges based on market value and various factors. Appraisers consider interests in land, such as minerals or water rights, and may use other methods to estimate market value. Disputes over appraised values can be resolved through arbitration or bargaining. Appraisals are conducted by federal employees or contractors, and each appraisal report is reviewed by a DOI appraiser. Proposed exchanges require review and concurrence at multiple levels before a decision is made by BLM. After BLM issues a decision on a land exchange, a decision record must be created with specific information. This includes determining the public interest value, legal descriptions of the lands, ensuring equal value, conformance with BLM land-use plans, and acknowledging implementation after a 45-day protest period. A Notice of Decision is then published and distributed. Parties may execute a binding exchange agreement after approval, committing them to conduct the exchange. At the final phase of a land exchange, a binding agreement is optional unless hazardous substances are involved. Legislation may be needed to authorize exchanges across state lines and exempt agencies from certain requirements. Recent Congresses have passed measures for exchanging BLM lands, with provisions affecting standard processing identified in a 2009 GAO report. Legislation may impact land exchanges by directing BLM to initiate exchanges, setting time frames, and altering appraisal requirements. Provisions for legislated exchanges can be controversial and vary case by case. BLM's Land Exchange Handbook advises staff to consult with regional solicitors on the applicability of statutory and regulatory requirements in legislated exchanges. The BLM Land Exchange Handbook discusses the application of typical actions in legislated exchanges, noting additional requirements like hazardous materials assessments. BLM conducted fewer legislated exchanges compared to administrative ones in recent years. From FY2006 to FY2015, 18% of exchange transactions were legislated. Other agencies like the Forest Service and Fish and Wildlife Service have also conducted legislated land exchanges. In 2009, BLM land exchanges faced scrutiny for not demonstrating public benefits and undervaluing federal land. Reports criticized BLM for not following requirements and valuing land below market value to make deals more appealing. Political pressures were also noted to change market value opinions for exchanges. BLM took steps to increase oversight of exchanges, ensure proper valuation of land, and comply with laws and regulations. In 2003, BLM formed the Appraisal and Exchange Workgroup to address issues raised in audits and implemented recommendations to strengthen exchange management and public confidence. In 2003, the Department of the Interior consolidated real estate appraisal functions into the Appraisal Services Directorate to improve objectivity. Despite improvements, some appraisals did not meet industry standards, raising concerns about accuracy in land exchanges conducted by the Bureau of Land Management. The Appraisal Services Directorate was established in 2003 to consolidate real estate appraisal functions within the Department of the Interior. Concerns about accuracy in land exchanges conducted by the Bureau of Land Management were raised due to some appraisals not meeting industry standards. Changes were made in 2010 to address appraisal services issues, including the development of a web-based system for DOI agencies to submit appraisal requests and the issuance of a consolidated handbook for appraisals. Auditors in 2009 continued to examine issues related to land exchanges, with a GAO report concluding that actions had been taken to address previous problems but the effectiveness of these changes was uncertain. The GAO found that agency reviews had somewhat improved land exchanges, ensuring compliance with authorities but lacking transparency in documenting and resolving problems. The BLM improved procedures for phased exchanges but had issues with ledger usage. New guidance required disclosure of third-party facilitator relationships but lacked clear definitions. The GAO made 13 recommendations to improve BLM's land exchanges, focusing on strengthening the review process, managing value imbalances, and defining disclosure guidelines for third parties. BLM had issues with delays in appraisals, lacked a national strategy for land transactions, and did not track individual exchange costs. The House Appropriations Committee and conferees noted improvements in land exchange and appraisal processes, but expressed concerns about communication barriers and acquisition of lands. The consolidation of appraisal services into the ASD was praised for improving objectivity and quality. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Department of the Interior (DOI) to address problems in land acquisition, including a loss of expertise, delays in appraisals, and lack of information sharing. They urged DOI to reconsider appraisal services consolidation, explore new organizational arrangements, and streamline the process to expedite land exchanges and acquisitions. DOI was also required to report progress within 90 days. The House Appropriations Committee directed DOI to improve land appraisals and expedite land exchanges. They emphasized the need for better documentation, training for staff, and cost tracking in the process. The House Appropriations Committee directed DOI to improve land appraisals and expedite land exchanges. They emphasized the need for better documentation, training for staff, and cost tracking in the process. The committee also recommended that BLM address GAO's recommendations regarding exchange documents retention policy, ledger management for land exchanges, and develop a national land exchange strategy. A 2009 DOI OIG evaluation found that the ASD appraisal office faced challenges in becoming a strong and independent organization due to lack of support from NBC, DOI agencies, and internal factors. The Department of the Interior (DOI) faced challenges in consolidating appraisal services and maintaining the independence of the Appraisal Services Directorate (ASD). The ASD lacked strong leadership, leading to dependence on others for addressing contracting and policy issues. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) recommended organizational independence for DOI appraisers and criticized the placement of the ASD within the National Business Center (NBC). The OIG made three recommendations to address these issues. The Department of the Interior (DOI) received recommendations to address problems with the Appraisal Services Directorate (ASD), including providing full control over contracting, selecting a competent chief appraiser for effective leadership, and considering making ASD an independent office within DOI's Office of Policy, Management, and Budget. DOI responded to congressional direction by acknowledging operational and organizational issues, proposing solutions to address delays in obtaining appraisals and improving the appraisal process. DOI proposed reforms to address issues with the Appraisal Services Directorate, including high costs, complex funding, communication problems, and difficulties in prioritization. The reforms involved moving ASD to an independent office reporting directly to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Technology, Information, and Business, aiming to improve timeliness, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and agency satisfaction with appraisals. The Office of Valuation Services (OVS) was proposed to address appraisal issues within DOI agencies. Reforms included restructuring to have appraisers dedicated to each agency, streamlining contracting processes, improving communication, and introducing new performance plan elements for timeliness and responsiveness. In 2010, actions were taken to address recommendations from GAO, Congress, and the OIG. The Secretarial Order signed in May 2010 restructured the Office of Valuation Services (OVS) within DOI agencies, giving it sole responsibility for contracting appraisal services. The OVS now reports to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Technology, Information, and Business Services, aiming to provide timelier and more consistent services. Additionally, BLM issued instruction memoranda on land exchanges in May 2010. In 2010, BLM issued instruction memoranda on land exchanges following GAO recommendations and congressional concerns. The memoranda provided guidance on reviewing and approving exchanges, managing exchange records, processing assembled land exchanges, using ledgers to manage imbalances, securing imbalances, minimizing cash equalization, defining facilitators' roles, and training agency staff. The fourth memorandum focused on training for agency staff involved in land exchanges. Congress oversees the reorganization of the appraisal function and other reforms to improve land transactions. Questions remain about amending FLPMA exchange authority or discontinuing exchanges due to perceived difficulties. Critics suggest changes to requirements for exchanges to facilitate transactions. Some suggest ending land exchanges in favor of cash sales under existing authorities like FLPMA. Critics believe cash sales remove appraisal subjectivity, secure the best price, and simplify transactions. Others propose renewing BLM's authority to sell or exchange land and keep the money for future acquisitions, similar to the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) allows for the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal under BLM's land-use plans, with proceeds used to acquire certain lands with exceptional resources. This authority is preferred by advocates as it allows for determining land values through the market and purchasing lands independently of annual appropriations. BLM supports exchanging land under FLPMA for various uses, as controversies over valuing properties are likely to occur regardless of the authority used. BLM asserts that land exchanges are not controversial and are necessary due to limited funding for land purchases. By equalizing land value through parcel adjustments, BLM avoids spending money on exchanges. Proponents believe past reforms have addressed concerns with exchanges and appraisals."
