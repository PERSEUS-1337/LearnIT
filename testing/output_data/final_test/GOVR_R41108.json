Washington also aims to address trade imbalances, cyber intrusions, and promote a level playing field for U.S. firms operating in China. The United States seeks cooperation with China on global economic issues, nuclear non-proliferation, and regional stability in the Asia-Pacific. Additionally, Washington aims to address trade imbalances, cyber intrusions, and promote a level playing field for U.S. firms operating in China. The relationship also involves promoting human rights and the rule of law in China, including in ethnic minority regions. The larger question is whether the U.S. and China can manage their relationship to avoid rivalry and conflict as China grows in economic and military power. In February 2012, Xi Jinping reached a consensus with President Obama and Vice President Biden to establish a \"new path of cooperative partnership\" between the U.S. and China. The Obama Administration welcomes a strong China, while China welcomes the U.S. as an Asia-Pacific nation contributing to peace and stability. However, deep mistrust remains on both sides, and building a relationship without rivalry and conflict is still a work in progress. Xi Jinping and his Chinese leadership colleagues assumed their Communist Party posts in November 2012 and added other posts, such as the state presidency, in March 2013. Xi is expected to serve as president until 2023 and has shown a strong desire to strengthen the U.S.-China relationship. China's new leaders, under Xi Jinping, have shown a willingness to improve the U.S.-China relationship by accepting invitations for summits with President Obama, pressuring North Korea over its nuclear program, negotiating a bilateral investment treaty, establishing a cybersecurity working group, and increasing military exchanges with the United States. China has agreed to cooperate with the United States military to combat global climate change by reducing HFC consumption. Despite this, the U.S.-China relationship is hindered by mutual mistrust due to differences in political systems. The U.S. is uncomfortable with China's authoritarian government and suppression of dissent, while some in China believe U.S. pressure aims to destabilize the Communist Party. The United States aims to destabilize China and remove the Communist Party from power, despite the interdependent economies. Differences in economic models contribute to mistrust, with China heavily reliant on exports and investment for growth. Points of contention include cyberespionage, intellectual property violations, discrimination against foreign firms, and currency policy. The United States and China have mutual mistrust due to differences in economic models and various points of contention. The U.S. government is concerned about China's military modernization and use of coercion in territorial disputes, while China sees U.S. policies as emboldening its rivals. The United States and China have mutual mistrust due to differences in economic models and various points of contention. China is concerned about U.S. policies rebalancing toward Asia, emboldening its rivals in territorial disputes, and seeking to constrain the activities of the Chinese military. President Obama and China's President Xi met for an informal summit in 2013 to discuss bilateral issues, including U.S. policy toward Taiwan. During an informal summit in 2013, President Obama and China's President Xi had eight hours of discussions over two days, covering topics such as North Korea's nuclear program, cyber-enabled economic theft, and reducing production of greenhouse gases. Edward Snowden claimed responsibility for leaking classified information about U.S. intelligence programs to the Guardian newspaper. Edward Snowden leaked classified information about U.S. intelligence programs to the Guardian newspaper while in Hong Kong. Despite the U.S. government's request for his arrest, Hong Kong allowed Snowden to board a flight to Moscow after revoking his passport. The White House believed China was involved in allowing Snowden to leave Hong Kong, leading to disappointment in U.S.-China relations. Chinese officials defended Hong Kong's handling of the case as lawful. The fifth round of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) between the US and China took place in Washington, DC in July 2013. China expressed interest in negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with the US. The 18th session of the bilateral human rights dialogue between the US and China took place in Kunming in July 2013. President Obama has expressed support for China's \"peaceful rise\" despite concerns about economic and military challenges. The Obama Administration has sought to expand cooperation with China on various issues to ensure its peaceful rise and encourage adherence to international norms through engagement in multilateral fora. The Obama Administration has increased engagement in Asia as part of its strategic rebalancing policy to address concerns about China's rise. Human rights advocacy is a priority, but some believe it has been overshadowed by efforts to shape Chinese behavior in economic, security, and environmental areas. The Administration has expanded public diplomacy and visa processing services to engage directly with the Chinese public. The Obama Administration has increased engagement in Asia as part of its strategic rebalancing policy to address concerns about China's rise. This includes overhauling visa processing services to facilitate more travel to the United States by Chinese officials and the public. The rebalancing is motivated by economic opportunities in Asia, the need to shape norms in the region, and the desire to tap into the growing consumer base in Asia. The Obama Administration's rebalancing policy in Asia aims to shape norms in the region and influence China's choices as a rising power. The military component involves strengthening alliances with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia, as well as expanding cooperation with emerging partners to ensure collective security interests. This includes investing in a strategic partnership with India to support its role as a regional economic anchor and security provider. The United States pledges to work with allies to promote a rules-based international order in the Indian Ocean region. The rebalancing policy includes new troop rotations, naval deployments, and military engagements in the region, as well as expanded relations with emerging powers like India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The United States has expanded relations with emerging powers like India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and pursued free trade through the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The rebalancing policy aims for a peaceful rise of new powers in Asia, promoting shared values and human rights. Critics argue it may antagonize China and create tensions with U.S. allies like the Philippines, Japan, and Vietnam. Critics of the U.S. rebalancing policy in Asia believe it may be over-focused on military elements, leading to regional instability and eroding trust with China. Some suggest that the military aspect of the policy is not strong enough, resulting in a perception of limited U.S. support for allies in disputes with China. President Xi Jinping of China is pushing for a \"new model\" of U.S.-China relationship to avoid strategic rivalry or conflict. This reflects his concerns about China's economic challenges and the need to avoid debilitating rivalry with the United States. The concept of the \"new model\" relationship is prominent in Chinese discourse, with reassurance derived from reported high-level U.S. agreement on the idea. The \"new model\" language is less prominent in U.S. discourse about the relationship with China, with senior U.S. officials sometimes portraying the concept as a Chinese proposal about which the United States still has questions. Xi Jinping emphasized the importance of cooperative partnership between major countries during his visit to the United States in 2012 and summit meeting with President Obama in 2013. The concept aims to find a new path of harmonious coexistence and win-win cooperation between China and the United States. President Obama and Xi Jinping have emphasized the need for a new model of major country relationship based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation. Both leaders reached an important agreement at a summit to work towards this new model, which aims to avoid conflict and chart the course for the future relationship between the two countries. U.S. officials have offered general principles as a guide for forging this relationship. The Obama Administration officials emphasized the importance of having the ability to work well in some areas despite strong differences in others to establish a new model of relationship with China. This would involve bilateral mechanisms to address sources of instability and competition, aiming to prevent the relationship from turning into rivalry. China's new model of relationship with the U.S. involves specific commitments, including seeking no conflicts or confrontation, respecting each other, and cooperating for mutual benefit. This would require a significant shift in U.S. policy to accommodate China's demands for respect of its social system and development path. China demands respect for its \"core interests,\" including Communist Party rule, sovereignty over Taiwan and disputed territories, challenging U.S. commitments to Taiwan and Japan. The U.S. security treaty commitment to ally Japan over disputed islets in the East China Sea, support for the Philippines in territorial disputes with China, and the U.S. interest in peace, stability, and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. China seeks respect for its core interests, including national unity in Tibetan and Xinjiang regions, hoping the U.S. refrains from involvement in these areas. The pace of U.S.-China bilateral interaction at the most senior level has increased dramatically in recent years. In the 30 years from 1979, the year the United States and China established diplomatic relations, until the Obama Administration took office in January 2009, the top leaders of the United States and China met 24 times. In the first term of the Obama Administration alone, President Obama and his then-counterpart, Chinese President Hu Jintao, met 12 times. The greater frequency of meetings is related in large part to expanded opportunities to meet on the sidelines of multilateral meetings. The increased frequency of U.S.-China bilateral meetings is due to expanded opportunities at multilateral gatherings. Leaders now meet at various summits such as G-20, nuclear security, and East Asia Summits. Visits between the two countries have also become more frequent, with President Obama visiting China in 2009 and President Hu visiting the U.S. in 2011. Vice Presidents Biden and Xi Jinping exchanged visits in 2011 and 2012. The first meeting between President Obama and Xi Jinping as China's President took place in 2013. The U.S.-China relationship under the Obama Administration has seen an increase in bilateral dialogue mechanisms, with over 90 dialogues and consultations between the two countries. While these dialogues aim to improve understanding and find common interests, dialogue on strategic issues remains limited. U.S. officials have expressed concerns about the lack of consultation on strategic issues compared to the U.S.-Soviet Union relationship during the Cold War. The U.S.-China relationship has numerous dialogues and consultations, but strategic issues are not extensively discussed. The annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) is a key dialogue, with the U.S. Secretary of State leading the strategic track and the Secretary of the Treasury leading the economic track. Another important dialogue is the Strategic Security Dialogue (SSD), co-chaired by high-ranking officials from both countries. Other dialogues include the U.S.-China Consultation on People-to-People Exchange (CPE). The U.S. and China have established various dialogues and forums to enhance cooperation at different levels, including the U.S.-China Governors Forum and Initiative on City-Level Economic Cooperation. These initiatives aim to strengthen relationships between officials from both countries and promote best practices in eco-city development. The Obama Administration has actively engaged with China in multilateral settings, emphasizing the need for China to assume responsibilities in line with its global impact. The U.S. and China have collaborated in the U.N. Security Council on issues like North Korea and Iran, although China has at times blocked actions on Syria. The G-20 grouping was elevated to facilitate discussions with China on economic matters, and trade disputes have been addressed through the World Trade Organization. The Obama Administration has engaged with China in multilateral settings, emphasizing the need for China to follow global norms. This includes discussions on trade through the World Trade Organization and climate change through the U.N. Framework Convention. The U.S. has urged China to adhere to OECD aid and investment guidelines and UNCLOS principles on navigation. In Asia, the U.S. prioritizes attending regional multilateral meetings to engage with China. In 2011, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of responsible behavior in regional institutions. The U.S. Department of State uses Chinese-language blogs and microblogs on Chinese platforms to reach the Chinese public with messages about U.S. policy, bypassing Chinese censorship. The Embassy's flagship microblogs have nearly 700,000 followers, allowing the U.S. government to reach millions of Chinese directly. Despite broader expression on Chinese social media, the U.S. government aims to hold accountable those who disrupt peace, stability, and prosperity. Despite the broader range of expression on Chinese social media, China-based microblog accounts are still subject to censorship. In 2012, a popular microblog operated by the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai was disabled by a Chinese microblog service, likely due to government discomfort with the posted material. The U.S. State Department also uses Chinese-language accounts on Twitter to share sensitive information censored on Chinese social media, such as speeches on human rights and Internet freedom. The Chinese government's blocking of Twitter within the country limits its reach, but tech-savvy Chinese can bypass these restrictions using virtual private networks. Tech-savvy Chinese use virtual private networks to bypass Chinese government censorship on Twitter. U.S. State Department operates Chinese-language Twitter accounts with limited followers. U.S. government also reaches out to Chinese public through Radio Free Asia and Voice of America programming. The Chinese government restricts access to free press, blocking RFA and VOA programming. VOA has a permanent office in China but faces restrictions on the number of journalists. Congress supports BBG's efforts to provide uncensored news to Chinese audiences. The BBG broadcasters aim to help Chinese audiences bypass censorship by using proxy servers. President Obama's Executive Order in 2012 focused on streamlining visa processing to boost economic growth while ensuring national security. In 2012, the U.S. mission in China focused on increasing visa issuance by 40% and reducing wait times for visa interviews to under 10 days. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing and consulates in other Chinese cities issued 1.2 million non-immigrant visas, a 36% increase from the previous year. China, Brazil, and Mexico are the only missions processing over 1 million visas annually. The Commerce Department predicts a 198% increase in Chinese visitors by 2016. The U.S. Agency for International Development engages China as a development partner with a focus on promoting rule of law, strengthening the judiciary, improving health, and assisting Tibetan communities. Funding for assistance to China decreased from $46.9 million in FY2010 to $28.3 million in FY2012. Most grants are given to U.S.-based NGOs and universities. The 113th Congress passed two laws related to China, directing the Secretary of State to develop programs. The 113th Congress passed legislation related to China, including a resolution on North Korea and reaffirming support for peaceful resolution of disputes in the Asia-Pacific region. Congress faces challenges in overseeing the growing economic, military, and geopolitical power of China. Appendices in the report provide summaries of all legislation on China enacted in the 112th and 113th Congresses. The 113th Congress passed legislation related to China, including a resolution on North Korea and reaffirming support for peaceful resolution of disputes in the Asia-Pacific region. Congress faces challenges in overseeing China's growing economic, military, and geopolitical power. Selected policy issues for Congress related to the bilateral relationship are summarized in the sections below, starting with security issues and Taiwan, followed by economic issues, climate change and renewable energy cooperation, and human rights issues. The Obama Administration has called for a stronger military-to-military relationship with China. Vice President Joe Biden argued for expanded dialogue, exchanges, and cooperation between the two militaries to reduce unnecessary risks. The 2009 U.S.-China joint statement pledged to advance military-to-military relations. Progress in strengthening this relationship began after the 2011 joint statement, with Xi Jinping's visit to the Pentagon in 2012 seen as a key factor in increasing exchanges. Xi's strong ties with the Chinese military have facilitated this progress. Operational cooperation between the US and Chinese militaries remains limited, but dialogue is steadily improving. Positive developments include Xi Jinping's Pentagon visit in 2012, visits by US officials to China, China's participation in joint military exercises, and joint anti-piracy exercises in the Gulf of Aden. In 2013, the US invited China to participate in military exercises, co-hosted a Pacific Army Chiefs Conference, and expanded the agenda of the Strategic Security Dialogue to include missile defense and nuclear policy. The Strategic Security Dialogue has added new topics: missile defense and nuclear policy. An agreement was reached to explore a notification mechanism for major military activities and discuss rules of the road for air and maritime activities. Restrictions imposed by Congress limit further development of the military-to-military relationship with China. The National Defense Authorization Act prohibits exchanges on sensitive subjects, causing tension in the bilateral relationship. China is cautious of closer ties exposing vulnerabilities in its military and suspicious of the U.S. rebalancing policy in the Asia-Pacific. China's military modernization has been fueled by steadily increasing military spending, with the DOD reporting an average annual increase of 9.7% from 2003 to 2012. China's officially announced budget for 2013 is $114 billion, a 10.7% increase from 2012. The Pentagon estimates China's actual military spending for 2012 was between $135 billion to $215 billion, raising concerns about China's military intentions. China's military modernization has been fueled by increasing military spending, with China's officially announced budget for 2013 at $114 billion. Despite concerns about China's military intentions, Chinese officials have repeatedly assured their commitment to peace and working within the international system. President Xi Jinping pledged China's dedication to peaceful development and acceptance of the United States' presence in Asia. China's military modernization is focused on improving its armed forces' capacity for regional conflicts, particularly regarding Taiwan. The Department of Defense believes China's military investment is geared towards winning short-duration, high-intensity conflicts. China's military modernization in China is increasingly focused on extended-range power projection, cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as anti-piracy missions and regional military operations. Of concern to the U.S. are Chinese capabilities aimed at deterring American intervention in the Western Pacific, including the \"carrier killer\" anti-ship ballistic missile DF-21D. The Pentagon report highlighted China's military advancements, including the DF-21D missile capable of targeting large ships like aircraft carriers. China has also developed stealth fighter aircraft like the J-20 and J-31 to enhance its ability to strike regional airbases, including U.S. military bases in Asia. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, acquired from Ukraine in 1998, symbolizes its military progress, with the DOD predicting operational effectiveness in the near future. The Pentagon report on China's military advancements highlighted the country's development of the DF-21D missile and stealth fighter aircraft. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is expected to reach operational effectiveness in the near future. Additionally, the report accused China of cyber-intrusions targeting U.S. government and other computer systems, attributing them to the Chinese government and military. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denies hacking allegations and expresses willingness to engage in dialogue with the U.S. on cybersecurity issues. The U.S. Department of Defense has raised concerns about cyber intrusions from China, linking them to potential network attacks. Cybersecurity is a growing concern in U.S.-China relations, amidst the U.S. strategic rebalance towards the Asia-Pacific region. China is concerned about the U.S. strategic rebalance towards the Asia-Pacific region. President Xi Jinping welcomed a constructive role by the U.S. but also expressed hope for respect of China's interests. Chinese officials question if the U.S. rebalancing is truly promoting peace and stability or if it aims to contain China. China's Ambassador to the United States co-authored an article questioning the U.S.'s true motives in rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific. They demanded reassurance about U.S. intentions, particularly concerning the U.S. alliance system, ballistic missile defense, the \"air-sea battle concept,\" and alleged intervention in disputes with China's neighbors. Many in China still feel unsettled. Many in China remain unsettled by the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, as they perceive it as an attempt to contain China's rising influence and military capabilities. Despite U.S. officials clarifying that the rebalance is not against China, there is still skepticism. Chinese critics argue that the U.S.'s increased presence in Asia, engagement with ASEAN, and military alliances are causing tensions in the relationship. China is concerned about the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, viewing it as an effort to contain its influence. Chinese critics believe the U.S. is destabilizing the region by strengthening military alliances and promoting initiatives like the TPP that exclude China. However, there are signs that Chinese views on the TPP may be softening. China agreed to move into the \"substantive\" phase of negotiations over a bilateral investment treaty at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue meeting in July. This reflects China's long-standing priority on sovereignty and territorial integrity, seen in its disputes over maritime territory in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Beijing's increasing maritime power and economic clout in territorial disputes raise concerns in Asia and the US. China's disputes with Japan and the Philippines involve US treaty allies. The US Senate passed a resolution supporting peaceful resolutions in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains, which China criticized. The Foreign Ministry denounced the resolution blaming China, tensions in the South China Sea are a major U.S. security concern due to territorial disputes. China claims parts of the SCS rich in resources and controls certain islands. For more details, refer to the provided reports. The South China Sea (SCS) is a region with territorial disputes involving China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan. The U.S. has declared a national interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the SCS to uphold peace, stability, and international law. The U.S. does not take sides in sovereignty claims but encourages diplomatic resolutions. China's Foreign Minister criticized Secretary Clinton's comments as an attack on China regarding territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Tensions have escalated since 2005-2006, with incidents at sea involving claimants asserting sovereignty and exploiting resources. A significant confrontation occurred in 2012 at Scarborough Shoal between Chinese and Philippine vessels, resulting in China gaining control of the area. The August 2012 State Department statement opposed coercion, threats, and the use of force in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines have been facing off over the Second Thomas Shoal since May 2013. The United States supported efforts to address tensions in the region, while China resisted internationalizing the disputes. The US urged ASEAN and China to negotiate a binding code of conduct for the South China Sea. ASEAN and China announced they would begin negotiations on June 30, 2013. China and ASEAN started consultations on a code of conduct for dispute resolution in the East China Sea, particularly regarding the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. The US has a strong interest in the issue due to its security treaty with Japan. tensions escalated in 2012 when Japan purchased three of the islands from private owners. China accused Japan of \"nationalizing\" the islands, leading to increased tensions. China has maintained a continuous presence near the islets, deploying civilian and military vessels. Japan responded with heightened coast guard patrols and Self Defense Force missions. China aims to force Japan to acknowledge the sovereignty dispute over the islands. Some believe China's actions may deter potential U.S. intervention in the conflict. The U.S. intervened in the conflict over the disputed islands by reaffirming its commitment to Japan under the security treaty, despite China's presence near the islets. This stance was supported by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, while China criticized Clinton's statement. After the Obama-Xi summit in June 2013, President Obama advised China to de-escalate the dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands through diplomatic channels. The conflict previously escalated in 2010 after a collision between Japanese and Chinese vessels. The dispute between the United States and China over the interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) regarding foreign military activities in maritime exclusive economic zones (EEZs) has been a long-standing issue. China believes it has the right to regulate such activities in its EEZ, while the U.S. and most other nations disagree. The United States and China have a dispute over foreign military activities in maritime exclusive economic zones (EEZs). China believes it can regulate activities in its EEZ, while the U.S. and most other nations disagree. This disagreement has led to incidents between Chinese and U.S. ships and aircraft in international waters and airspace. China's opposition to foreign military activities in its EEZ was highlighted by an incident in 2001 involving a U.S. Navy aircraft. In 2010, China reiterated its stance following joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. However, revelations in 2013 suggested a potential shift in China's position, with instances of Chinese naval activities observed in the EEZ around Guam and Hawaii. The U.S. considers these activities lawful but notes they may undermine China's stance. China's opposition to foreign military activities in its EEZ was highlighted by an incident in 2001 involving a U.S. Navy aircraft. In 2010, China reiterated its stance following joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. However, in June 2013, a PLA officer publicly acknowledged that China has sent vessels into the United States' EEZ \"a few times.\" The United States and China share a common interest in peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in verifiable denuclearization. Washington continues to call on China to leverage its relationship with North Korea to avoid provocations and denuclearize. Since the death of Kim Jong-il in 2011, Chinese-North Korean relations have been strained. North Korea ignored China's warnings and stirred anger by boarding a Chinese fishing boat. China supported U.N. Resolution 2087 in January 2013 to persuade North Korea to denuclearize and avoid provocations. After China's new leaders supported U.N. Resolutions 2087 and 2094 condemning North Korea's actions, President Xi Jinping warned against causing chaos for selfish gain. China closed North Korea's primary foreign-exchange bank's account and hosted South Korean President Park Geun-hye, snubbing North Korea. President Xi Jinping issued a tough warning to North Korea during a meeting with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, emphasizing China's firm stance on achieving peninsula denuclearization. The importance of denuclearization was also discussed during summits between President Obama and President Xi in 2013. The State Department announced the agreement on the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula after the Fifth Round of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue. China is committed to supporting North Korea due to fears of regime collapse leading to military hostilities and refugee influx. Scholars question if China's new leaders see the status quo as destabilizing. In February 2013, the House passed a resolution urging China to pressure North Korea economically. China's economic leverage is used to pressure North Korea's leaders, and China is urged to prevent the transshipment of illicit technology. Concerns about China's treatment of North Korean refugees persist, as China considers them economic migrants and continues to repatriate them to North Korea. Despite this, North Korean refugees still escape to neighboring countries in Asia. Refugees continue to live underground in China. China has been an important player in efforts to rein in Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has participated in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program as part of the P5+1 grouping. It has supported limited U.N. sanctions against Iran but prefers dialogue over sanctions. China's policy towards Iran is crucial for U.S. efforts to pressure Iran due to their significant trade relationship. China, the largest customer for oil and a major investor in Iranian energy sectors, has declined to impose bilateral sanctions on Iran despite U.S. and EU efforts. The U.S. granted China sanctions exemptions in 2012 and 2013, but has also sanctioned Chinese businesses for their involvement with Iran. The Administration sanctioned the Xinjiang-based Bank of Kunlun for facilitating transactions for designated Iranian banks. China defended its business ties with Iran, stating it does not violate international norms. U.S. officials acknowledged China's restraint in not taking over contracts from other countries, a behavior known as \"backfilling.\" The United States has implicated Chinese firms in sales to Iran of missile technology. Chinese entities continue to supply missile-related items to multiple customers, including Iran and Pakistan. The US has looked to China to play a constructive role in helping to resolve proliferation issues. China has opposed military intervention in Syria and has blocked U.S.-backed Security Council resolutions on the crisis. They support a Syrian-led political transition and call for a ceasefire and political dialogue to end the violence in Syria. The U.S.-China relationship with Taiwan is a sensitive issue. Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China, has been claimed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) for decades. The PRC aims for unification with Taiwan, even by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by law to defend Taiwan against coercion. The U.S. and China have a sensitive relationship with Taiwan, which the PRC claims as part of China. The U.S. is obligated to defend Taiwan against coercion, as stated in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China in 1979 required finding language on Taiwan acceptable to both countries. The U.S. acknowledged in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqu\u00e9 that Taiwan is part of China and agreed to have only unofficial relations with Taiwan in the 1979 communiqu\u00e9. In a 1982 communiqu\u00e9, the U.S. expressed intent to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act to protect Taiwan's interests. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 declared U.S. policy to maintain Taiwan's security and sell defense items to Taiwan for self-defense. Despite reduced tensions since 2008, China deploys over 1,100 missiles near Taiwan. Washington and Beijing prepare for potential military confrontation over Taiwan's fate. China has deployed short-range ballistic missiles near Taiwan's coast as part of its military modernization program. The United States has maintained ambiguity about defending Taiwan in a conflict with China to deter both countries from taking aggressive actions. President Clinton also stated in 1998 that the U.S. does not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations requiring statehood. Taiwan's security is supported by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which allows for the sale of defense items for self-defense. The United States has sometimes urged restraint in Taiwan's efforts to expand its international space, leading to accusations of prioritizing relations with Beijing over Taiwan's aspirations. Supporters of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party criticized the U.S. for allegedly supporting President Ma's re-election in 2012 to avoid tensions with Beijing. President Ma's second term is set to end in May 2016. President Ma is in his second term, set to end in May 2016. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei have eased since he took office in 2008, leading to agreements on various issues with China. In April 2009, Taiwan was invited by the World Health Organization (WHO) to attend the 2009 World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer under the name \"Chinese Taipei,\" marking the first time since 1971 that Taiwan participated in a U.N. specialized agency activity. However, Taiwan's interactions with the WHO are subject to approval by China, and Taiwan is referred to as \"Taiwan Province of China\" in WHO documents. Taiwan is now seeking observer status in another U.N. specialized agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization. In September 2012, China's then-President Hu Jintao pledged to allow Taiwan to participate in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) events. Beijing has not blocked Taiwan's bid for observer status in ICAO but expects to be involved in negotiations. A law was passed in July 2013 to develop a strategy for Taiwan's observer status at the ICAO Assembly in September 2013. In June 2010, Canada, Beijing, and Taipei signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), removing trade barriers and increasing cross-strait economic integration. Some fear Taiwan's autonomy may erode, while others believe closer ties could deter conflict. The U.S. supports the ECFA and new communication lines between Taiwan and China. U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are a contentious issue in U.S.-China relations. The U.S. supports arms sales to Taiwan to help them resist coercion from China, citing obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act. China views these sales as destabilizing and a betrayal of past agreements. In 2011, the Obama Administration notified Congress of a $5.85 billion arms sale to Taiwan. In October 2011, the Obama Administration notified Congress of a $5.85 billion arms package for Taiwan, including upgrades to F-16A/B fighter jets and spare parts for aircraft. China did not suspend military-to-military relations with the U.S. in protest, possibly because more advanced F-16C/D fighters were not included in the sale. China opposes the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan, arguing they are offensive and violate past agreements. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act called for addressing Taiwan's fighter aircraft shortfall through the sale of F-16 C/D aircraft or similar. The U.S. and Chinese economies are heavily interdependent, with bilateral economic issues including cyber espionage, currency policies, and intellectual property rights enforcement. President Obama has emphasized \"healthy economic competition\" between the two nations. The U.S. and Chinese economies are heavily interdependent, with bilateral economic issues including cyber espionage, currency policies, and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Both countries have welcomed Chinese foreign direct investment in the U.S., but China has complained about U.S. scrutiny on national security grounds. Key bilateral economic forums are the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) and the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT). According to official data, the U.S. nominal GDP was nearly twice the size of China's, with a trade deficit of $315 billion. China is the second largest trading partner of the United States, with two-way trade in 2012 totaling $536 billion. The U.S. goods trade deficit with China was $315 billion, while Chinese exports to the U.S. were $352 billion. China is the second largest trading partner of the United States, with imports from China making up 19% of all U.S. imports. China is also the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, holding $1.32 trillion as of May 2013. U.S. businesses had invested $60.5 billion in China by the end of 2010, while Chinese foreign direct investment in the U.S. reached $3.8 billion in 2011. Chinese FDI in the United States reached $3.8 billion in 2011, a six-fold increase over 2007. By 2013, it had reached $20 billion according to Chinese data. World leaders call for restructuring the global economy, with focus on the US and China due to trade imbalances. US needs to save more and consume less, while China needs to reduce export dependence and consume more. China's 12th Five-Year Plan aims to reduce export dependence, boost domestic consumption, increase wages, improve social welfare, and prioritize urbanization. China's 12th Five-Year Plan aims to increase China's urbanization rate to 51.5%, develop seven \"emerging strategic industries,\" meet energy and environmental targets, and address cyber-enabled theft of commercial information in the U.S.-China relationship. The report identified Chinese actors as active perpetrators of economic espionage, along with the Russian government. U.S. businesses reported a surge in cyber intrusions from China, with difficulty in attribution. In 2013, a Shanghai-based unit of China's People's Liberation Army was accused of cyber espionage by Mandiant. Advisor Tom Donilon criticized China for cyber intrusions targeting confidential business information but did not directly accuse the Chinese government. The U.S. government previously attributed cyber intrusions to official Chinese actors in 2013. Chinese officials have dismissed allegations of involvement in cyber theft, citing difficulties in attribution. The Chinese government denies supporting hacker activity, citing laws against such actions. They claim to be victims of cyber attacks, with many originating from the United States. In 2013, the U.S. and China established a Cyber Working Group to address cyber security issues. The Cyber Working Group (CWG) was established on July 8, 2013, to enhance dialogue on international norms in cyberspace. The U.S. and China agreed to strengthen cooperation between US-CERT and CNCERT/CC. Edward Snowden's allegations complicated U.S. efforts to hold China accountable for cyber theft. China used Snowden's information to accuse the U.S. of hypocrisy on cybersecurity. China's denials of state-sponsored hacking were bolstered by a Xinhua commentary citing Edward Snowden's allegations. The commentary accused the U.S. of being the biggest cyber villain. A senior administration official emphasized the distinction between intelligence-gathering activities and intellectual property theft. Trade between the U.S. and China has expanded. Trade between the United States and China has grown significantly since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. The U.S. trade deficit with China has increased as well. Economists argue that the global trade balance is a better indicator of economic health than bilateral balances. China's current account surplus has decreased from 10.1% in 2007 to 2.3% in 2012. Many U.S. analysts point to the bilateral goods trade imbalance with China to criticize China's trade practices and undervalued currency. Chinese officials blame the U.S. for the trade deficit, citing different figures for the bilateral trade deficit. China is criticized for the trade deficit with the United States, with blame placed on U.S. controls on exports and the shifting of production to China. The issue of China's currency management, the renminbi, remains a major concern in trade disputes. China's currency, the renminbi, has appreciated gradually, with Chinese leaders acknowledging its value in combating inflation. The U.S. Treasury Department notes a 10% nominal appreciation against the U.S. dollar from June 2010 to April 2013, and a 16.2% real appreciation. Additionally, China's \"real effective exchange rate\" appreciated 33.8% in real terms from July 2005 to April 2013. The Treasury Department sees a commitment to greater exchange rate flexibility and reduced foreign reserve accumulation. The U.S. Treasury Department notes that China's real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated 33.8% in real terms, indicating significant undervaluation. This undervaluation makes China's exports cheaper and imports more expensive for Chinese consumers. China holds $3.3 trillion in foreign currency reserves and is a major financer of the U.S. federal budget deficit through Treasury securities sales. For more information on China's currency policy, refer to CRS Report RS21625. China is one of the largest foreign financers of the U.S. federal budget deficit, holding $1.32 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities as of March 2013. Concerns have been raised about China destabilizing the U.S. economy by reducing its holdings. However, China's financial system does not allow foreign currency to be spent domestically, forcing China to invest its surplus overseas. The U.S. is the only economy capable of absorbing China's large volume of exports and debt purchases. China's large exports to the United States and purchase of U.S. debt give China a major stake in the U.S. economy. Analysts argue that China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries have shifted financial power, allowing China to criticize U.S. economic management. Beijing has expressed concerns about U.S. monetary policy, fearing inflation and devaluation of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. government has raised concerns about China's implementation of policies since 2006. The U.S. government has raised concerns about China's alleged backsliding in implementing commitments made during its 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization. The U.S. Trade Representative highlighted China's shift towards emphasizing the state's role in the economy, using new industrial policies to limit market access for foreign goods and services. Discussions between the United States and China address these concerns in detail. The United States and China discuss U.S. concerns in bilateral dialogues like the JCCT and S&ED. China makes new commitments to review policies, but disputes may be taken to the WTO. The U.S. has brought 15 cases against China, while China has brought 8 cases against the U.S., challenging legislation passed by Congress. In September 2010, a WTO panel found that Section 727 of P.L. 111-8 was inconsistent with the United States' WTO obligations, but did not recommend further action as the provision had expired. A pending Chinese case challenges P.L. 112-99 at the WTO. China has not joined the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement despite its growth in the government procurement market. China has not joined the WTO's Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), making its procurement policies exempt from most WTO rules. The United States is eager for China to join to ensure access for U.S. firms. China has submitted four offers to join the GPA, but none have been accepted. In July 2013, China committed to submitting a revised offer by the end of the year and to start technical discussions with the U.S. to address obstacles to its GPA accession. China and the United States have agreed to re-start negotiations on a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) to address issues like market access and intellectual property protections. China has agreed that the BIT will cover all phases of investment, except for limited negotiated exceptions. This decision was influenced by China's growing direct investment in the U.S. and substantial holdings of U.S. Treasuries. China and the United States have agreed to re-start negotiations on a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) to address market access and intellectual property protections. The BIT negotiations are led by the State Department and the U.S. Trade Representative, with participation from the Treasury Department. Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in the U.S. has been growing steadily, with both governments officially supporting greater Chinese investment. The proposed BIT would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate. Chinese investments in the United States have raised concerns about national security. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported $3.8 billion in Chinese investment by the end of 2011, while China claims it is now $20 billion. The Rhodium Group tracked 670 deals totaling $27.9 billion. The largest proposed acquisition is Shuanghui International Holdings' bid for Smithfield Foods at $4.7 billion. Shuanghui International Holdings made a $7.1 billion bid for Smithfield Foods, which is under review by CFIUS. Concerns have been raised by Members of Congress about the deal's impact on American food safety and technology. The United States Trade Representative continues to place China on its Priority Watch List for intellectual property rights violations. The report highlighted concerns about trade secret misappropriation and unfair policies in China that disadvantage U.S. rights holders. Chinese theft of trade secrets can occur through various means, and obtaining remedies under Chinese law is challenging. The report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimated annual U.S. losses due to international theft of U.S. intellectual property to be over $300 billion, with China responsible for \"between 50% and 80%\" of the problem. Chinese national industrial goals encourage IP theft, and obtaining remedies under Chinese law is difficult. China, the world's largest emitter of CO2, relies heavily on coal for its economy. In 2012, China's CO2 emissions grew by 300 million tonnes, while the US saw a decrease of 200 Mt. Despite this, China's emissions growth rate was one of its lowest in a decade, attributed to a shift towards renewable energy sources and a decline in energy intensity. China and the US, responsible for nearly half of global CO2 emissions, play crucial roles in addressing climate change. The Obama Administration has aimed to cooperate with China on climate change. Differences in perspectives on climate negotiations have caused friction, particularly regarding the responsibilities of developed and developing nations. China argues that developed nations should bear the main responsibility for reducing emissions due to their historical contributions and higher per capita emissions. Developing nations should have voluntary emission reductions. The U.S. and China have cooperated on climate change, with the Obama Administration supporting non-legally binding commitments. Secretary of State Kerry and China issued a joint statement committing to action on climate change and established a U.S.-China Climate Change Working Group for cooperation. The U.S. and China have established a group to advance cooperation on climate change. Led by key officials, the group proposed new pragmatic cooperation in areas such as vehicles, smart grids, carbon capture, greenhouse gas data, and energy efficiency. China has ambitious national targets for reducing carbon emissions, including a joint commitment with the U.S. to reduce hydrofluorocarbons. In the 12th Five-Year Plan, China aimed to increase non-fossil fuel share in energy mix, reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP, and cut carbon dioxide emissions. China exceeded its target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP in 2013. The U.S. and China established a $150 million Clean Energy Research Center to collaborate on energy research. The Clean Energy Research Center (CERC) was established by the U.S. and China to jointly develop energy efficient buildings, electric vehicles, and clean coal technologies over five years. Bilateral collaboration includes initiatives on renewable energy deployment, increasing efficiency of power plants, promoting cleaner coal use, and assessing China's shale gas resources. China leads in some renewable energy technologies and carbon capture, but lags behind the U.S. in research and development. The United States imposed anti-dumping tariffs on solar-energy cells imported from China to protect its domestic solar industry. China's support for its wind turbine industry was challenged by the U.S. through the World Trade Organization. China's plans to double its hydropower capacity by 2020 led to disputes with neighboring countries and criticism from overseas groups. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) since 1949. The CCP is intolerant of dissent and controls speech, assembly, religion, and association. Chinese citizens have more freedom today but the CCP remains suspicious of any threats to its power. For more information on China's policies and green energy programs, refer to CRS reports. The rapid growth of social media has expanded public debate in China, despite Communist Party censorship. President Obama has criticized China's political system, stating that democracy is essential for economic growth. President Obama has criticized China's political system, stating that democracy is essential for economic growth. He described communism and rule by committee as \"failed\" models of governance, emphasizing that \"prosperity without freedom is just another form of poverty.\" This rhetoric has led to strategic mistrust between the United States and China's ruling Communist Party. The Obama Administration prioritizes stability in the U.S.-China relationship over democracy promotion. They urge China to improve human rights, including freedom of speech, internet freedom, and labor rights. Various tools are used to address China's human rights record. The United States highlights concerns about human rights in China through various means, including the State Department's annual report. China has criticized these reports and emphasizes rights to subsistence and development in their defense of their human rights record. The State Department's report on human rights in China in 2012 raised U.S. concerns about \"repression and coercion\" aimed at rights advocates, with tight restrictions on freedom of assembly, religion, and travel. Efforts to silence political activists and public interest lawyers increased, and China was identified as a country with a shrinking space for civil society. The report also highlighted severe official repression of freedoms of speech, religion, and association, as well as harsh restrictions on ethnic movement. The U.S. has concerns about repression and coercion in China, with restrictions on freedoms of speech, religion, and movement of ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans. Human rights discussions are held through the bilateral Human Rights Dialogue, but critics argue it isolates human rights from core U.S.-China relations. Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. government to push China for clear benchmarks in the human rights dialogue to avoid it being merely a diplomatic exercise. The Legal Experts Dialogue (LED) resumed in 2011 after a hiatus and aims to discuss the implementation of a rule of law system. The State Department's 2012 report on human rights practices in China highlighted ongoing official campaigns. The 2012 report on human rights practices in China focused on the ongoing official campaign in Xinjiang against religious extremism, ethnic separatism, and terrorism, primarily targeting the Uighur minority. The report noted that security measures in Xinjiang were extreme, with the threat of violence used to justify crackdowns on individuals peacefully expressing political or religious views. This included the government's decision to restrict access to the Internet. The government closed Internet access in Xinjiang for ten months after ethnic riots in 2009. Regulations were passed banning speech detrimental to ethnic unity. Tibet remains a sensitive issue in U.S.-China relations, with resistance to Chinese rule and self-immolations among Tibetans protesting policies. China fears Tibet's split from China. The exile community and foreign governments aim to \"split\" Tibet from China, which China considers a core interest. US policy towards Tibet is guided by the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, promoting dialogue with the Dalai Lama, protecting Tibet's heritage, and supporting development projects. The act requires the State Department to maintain a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 promotes dialogue with the Dalai Lama, supports development projects, and calls for the establishment of a U.S. consular office in Lhasa. Envoys of the Dalai Lama proposed \"genuine autonomy\" for Tibetan districts within the framework of the PRC during talks with Chinese officials. After the ninth round of talks in January 2010, senior Chinese officials dismissed the proposal for \"half independence\" by the Tibetan exile government. Lobsang Sangay, the political leader, has called for a resumption of dialogue with China and international pressure for human rights in Tibet. No progress has been made in scheduling a tenth round of talks, while the U.S. government and human rights groups criticize Chinese controls on religious practices in Tibetan areas. In the wake of anti-Chinese protests in Tibetan areas in 2008, there have been arbitrary detentions, disappearances, heightened Chinese security in monasteries, \"patriotic education\" campaigns, media controls, and policies weakening Tibetan-language education. Tibet advocacy groups reported Chinese police firing on a crowd celebrating the Dalai Lama's birthday in 2013, with two Tibetan monks shot. Since 2009, 121 Tibetans in China have self-immolated to protest PRC policies. The Obama Administration expressed deep concern over the violence in Tibet in 2012. The Obama Administration expressed deep concern over the continuing violence in Tibetan areas of China and the increasing frequency of self-immolations by Tibetans. China is accused of directing or encouraging the self-immolations, which have drawn international attention and criticized China's policies. President Obama has met with the Dalai Lama twice despite China's objections. Upcoming events in the U.S.-China relationship include a visit by China's Minister of National Defense, ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting, Energy Policy Dialogue in China, G-20 Leaders' Summit in Russia, and the opening of the UN General Assembly in New York City. In September and October 2013, key events in the U.S.-China relationship included visits by Admiral Wu Shengli, Commander of the Chinese Navy, and meetings such as the U.S.-China Maritime Safety Dialogue. Additionally, leaders from both countries participated in international summits like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Week and the East Asia Summit. The Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund also took place during this time. In November 2013, key events in the U.S.-China relationship included a meeting in Washington, DC involving senior finance officials, the U.S.-China Legal Experts Dialogue, the UNFCCC Conference in Warsaw, and the 10th Meeting of the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement. Additionally, there were consultations between U.S. and Chinese officials on various issues. The 11th Plenary Session of the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement Cooperation, 24th Session of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, and 14th Round of Defense Consultative Talks took place in the United States with high-level officials from both countries."
