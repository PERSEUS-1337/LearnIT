    "content": "Congress is considering changes to the patent system in response to concerns about abusive patent litigation tactics. Legislative proposals like the Innovation Act and the PATENT Act aim to address these issues. The current legislative activity aims to address issues in the patent system by clarifying patent eligibility criteria and setting limits on what can be patented. The USPTO issues patents to inventors after examining their applications for new inventions. The USPTO examines patent applications to approve new inventions. A patent application includes a specification and claims that define the scope of the invention. Examiners must ensure the invention meets statutory requirements like novelty and not being anticipated by prior art. The Patent Act requires inventions to be nonobvious, useful, and provide a benefit to the public. Patent holders have exclusive rights to their invention in the United States. The Patent Act grants exclusive rights to patent holders for their inventions. Infringement of a patent can lead to civil action, including injunctions and damages. Patents have a usual term of 20 years, after which others can use the invention. Patent holders can sell their patent rights through an assignment. Patent holders can sell their patent rights through an assignment or grant a license for others to use the invention in exchange for royalty payments. License agreements may include restrictions on the use of the invention, and violating these terms can lead to consequences. Patent holders can enforce their rights through legal action in federal courts or by seeking relief from the U.S. International Trade Commission to prevent the importation of infringing foreign goods. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles patent cases with exclusive appellate jurisdiction, and parties can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if dissatisfied with the rulings. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) investigates complaints of violations of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which prohibits unfair competition and infringement of U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and design rights. The ITC can order injunctive relief, such as exclusion orders or cease and desist orders, to stop infringing imports. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) can issue injunctive relief to stop infringing imports, but lacks authority to award monetary damages for patent infringement. Accused infringers can challenge a patent's validity in court through various means, including declaratory judgment actions. The \"case or controversy\" requirement limits public challenges to patent grants unless there is an ongoing dispute with the patent holder. Congress established administrative procedures through the USPTO's PTAB for challenging the validity of issued patents. Three proceedings - IPR, PGR, and CBM - have different rules and may result in confirmation of patentability, amended patents, or declaration of invalidity. Dissatisfied parties can appeal PTAB's decisions. Patent assertion entities (PAEs) are entities that do not develop, manufacture, or sell products covered by their patents. They focus on buying and asserting patents against companies. PAEs often settle lawsuits as litigation is costly and disruptive for defendants. PAEs, also known as \"patent trolls,\" offer to settle for amounts below litigation costs, making settlement an obvious choice for defendants. The term \"troll\" is controversial and often used imprecisely. PAEs describe themselves as critical intermediaries, offering one-stop shopping for patent licensing and purchase. They enable inventors to earn returns without the resources to enforce patents themselves. PAEs, also known as \"patent trolls,\" speculate on patents and focus on high-risk high-yield acquisitions. They transfer only a legal right not to be sued for technology already developed by the licensee. Unlike other NPEs, PAEs acquire patents outright and assert them on their own behalf, rather than providing services or collecting fees. Critics argue that PAEs extort through patent assertion. Critics argue that PAEs extort the patent system through litigation by extracting licensing fees or damage awards from companies that cannot afford the cost of litigation, deterring innovation and discouraging companies from seeking patents. PAEs target small and inventor-driven companies, as well as end users of products, including small businesses. Defenders claim that PAEs promote invention by managing investment risk and compensating small inventors through a secondary market for patents. PAEs provide an exit option and extra revenue stream for patentees by managing high risk through large patent portfolios. They help small inventors and NPEs recoup costs by buying low-value patents and sharing future royalties. Legislative proposals in the 114th Congress aim to address patent litigation abuse. The U.S. Supreme Court abolished Form 18 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for patent infringement complaints, which required specific statements. Plaintiffs relied on Form 18 to structure their complaints, but the Federal Circuit applied a notice pleading standard for patent infringement pleadings. This standard required sufficient particularity to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The Federal Circuit held that the information required by Form 18 is sufficient for pleading a patent infringement claim, providing a plausible claim and placing the alleged infringer on notice. Specific details can be determined through discovery, and patent plaintiffs may now need to comply with a higher pleading standard under Ashcroft v. Iqbal and Bell Atlantic Corp. The Supreme Court established in Twombly and Iqbal that federal courts must assess the \"plausibility of claims\" at the pleading stage. Prior to recent changes, Iqbal and Twombly were not applied to patent litigation pleadings due to Form 18's notice pleading standard. However, the Federal Circuit ruled in In re Bill of Lading Transmission and Processing System Patent Litigation that following Form 18 requirements is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court ruled that without Form 18, patent plaintiffs may need to adhere to the higher Twombly/Iqbal standard for pleading. The Innovation Act proposes stricter initial pleading requirements for infringement claims compared to Form 18 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This includes providing specific details on each patent infringed and the accused instrumentality. The Innovation Act and the Senate's PATENT Act propose heightened pleading requirements for patent infringement claims, including specific details on each patent infringed, the accused instrumentality, and the acts of indirect infringement. The court ruling without Form 18 may require adherence to a higher pleading standard. The PATENT Act proposes detailed requirements for patent infringement claims, including identifying the infringed patent, the accused instrumentality, and acts of indirect infringement. This bill would require disclosure of specific information within 14 days of filing the pleading, such as the patent assignee(s) and other key details. The PATENT Act and Innovation Act propose detailed disclosure requirements for patent infringement claims, including identifying patent assignees, right to enforce the patent, and entities with financial interest. They would eliminate Form 18 and allow general descriptions if information is not readily accessible. Certain civil actions under Section 271(e)(2) are exempt. Critics connect \"patent trolls\" to current pleading requirements for patent infringement claims. Heightened pleading requirements for patent infringement claims are being debated. Proponents argue that it would discourage frivolous lawsuits by forcing plaintiffs to carefully consider infringement before filing. They believe that providing necessary information early on would streamline litigation and not burden the plaintiff. Some commentators argue that heightened pleading requirements for patent infringement claims could make enforcement impractical. They believe that necessary information is typically revealed during the discovery process, which can lead to costly litigation. During discovery, a \"Markman hearing\" may be held to resolve disputes over patent claim language. The Innovation Act proposes to postpone discovery in patent infringement cases under certain circumstances, such as severing a claim or transferring the action to another venue. This aims to streamline the claim construction process and reduce litigation costs. The Senate's PATENT Act proposes limitations on discovery in patent infringement cases, allowing courts to stay discovery pending resolution of preliminary motions. This includes motions to sever, drop a party, dismiss, or transfer the action. The provision does not apply to actions seeking preliminary injunctions or drug claims under 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(2). Parties may consent to voluntary exclusion from these limitations. The PATENT Act proposes limitations on discovery in patent infringement cases, allowing courts to stay discovery for motions to sever, dismiss, or transfer the action. Limited discovery may be allowed for preliminary injunctions or to prevent specific prejudice. Supporters argue that the technical nature of patent litigation leads to extensive discovery and settlements, while critics raise concerns about the impact on discovery. The PATENT Act proposes limitations on discovery in patent infringement cases, allowing courts to stay discovery for motions to sever, dismiss, or transfer the action. Critics have raised concerns about potential delays and increased expenses for all parties, as well as the possibility of abuse in invoking a stay of discovery. Within a month of filing a civil action involving a patent, the clerks of federal courts must notify the USPTO director with relevant details. Section 4 of the Innovation Act proposes specific disclosure requirements for plaintiffs in patent infringement cases. Plaintiffs must disclose information about entities that own or have a financial interest in the patent upon filing an initial complaint. This includes details about assignees, entities with sublicense rights, and other relevant entities. Section 4 of the Innovation Act proposes disclosure requirements for plaintiffs in patent infringement cases, including details about entities with rights to sublicense or enforce the patent, financial interests in the patent, and the ultimate parent entity. Plaintiffs must also provide a description of their principal business, list of complaints filed, and information on licensing requirements for the patents. Failure to notify the USPTO of any changes in assignee or relevant entities within 90 days is required. The Innovation Act imposes disclosure requirements for plaintiffs in patent infringement cases, including details about entities with rights to the patent, financial interests, and the parent entity. Failure to disclose changes in assignee or entities within 90 days may result in the plaintiff being barred from recovering damages or fees. The USPTO director is granted the power to establish a registration fee to cover the cost of administering the disclosure requirement. The Innovation Act and the PATENT Act both impose disclosure requirements for plaintiffs in patent infringement cases to ensure timely public disclosure of information. Critics argue that the disclosure could reveal confidential financial agreements, which are already discoverable under current rules with protective orders. The Innovation Act requires patentees in infringement lawsuits to disclose key information within 14 days of filing, including details on assignees, entities with sublicense rights, and financial interests. This aims to promote transparency in patent cases. The PATENT Act proposes disclosure requirements for patentees, including information on licensing requirements and assignment of patent rights. Unlike the Innovation Act, the PATENT Act does not impose an ongoing duty of disclosure to the USPTO. The PATENT Act requires disclosure of patent rights and assignee information to be recorded with the USPTO within specific timeframes. Failure to comply may result in denial of enhanced damages or fees in infringement lawsuits. The PATENT Act, like the Innovation Act, mandates disclosure of patent rights and assignee information to the USPTO within set timeframes. Failure to comply could lead to denial of enhanced damages or fees in infringement lawsuits. The Act also allows for the award of attorney fees to prevailing accused infringers and grants the USPTO Director authority to establish fees for collecting assignment information. Anyone who infringes on a patent by making, using, offering to sell, or selling a patented invention without authorization may be liable for infringement, including manufacturers, sellers, and customers. The use of certain technologies in products has led to an increase in patent infringement charges against businesses and individuals. Patent litigation tactics include suing assemblers, distributors, or retailers instead of the original manufacturer, threatening disruption to their businesses. The \"customer suit exception\" doctrine prioritizes litigation against manufacturers over lawsuits by patent owners against customers for efficiency. This allows courts to stay actions against customers pending outcomes of actions by manufacturers. The \"customer suit exception\" doctrine prioritizes litigation against manufacturers over lawsuits by patent owners against customers for efficiency. The doctrine recognizes that manufacturers must protect their customers and has been relatively underused. The Innovation Act proposes to codify a modified version of this exception, requiring courts to suspend litigation against customers if certain conditions are met. The Innovation Act proposes conditions for a customer suit exception in patent infringement cases, allowing customers to request a stay in litigation if certain requirements are met. The Innovation Act proposes conditions for a customer suit exception in patent infringement cases, allowing customers to request a stay in litigation if certain requirements are met. The Act exempts actions involving manufacturers that do not resolve major issues in the suit against the customer or unreasonably prejudice the party seeking to lift the stay. It also exempts actions including a cause of action for patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(2) from the customer suit stay provision. The stay provision would only postpone, not terminate, a cause of action against the customer. The PATENT Act includes a customer stay provision for \"covered customers,\" \"retailers,\" and \"end users\" accused of patent infringement. Covered customers are retailers or end users accused of infringement, end users are users of the infringing product, and retailers generate revenue through sales. The provision is similar to that of the Innovation Act. The PATENT Act includes a customer stay provision similar to the Innovation Act, requiring manufacturer consent for a stay of action against a customer. The provision also outlines conditions for lifting the stay and exempts actions involving patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(2). In 1947, Congress enacted a fee-shifting provision allowing district courts to award attorney fees to the prevailing party in patent suits, codified in 35 U.S.C. Section 285. The provision allows courts to award \"reasonable\" attorney fees in \"exceptional cases,\" as defined by the Federal Circuit in Brooks Furniture Manufacturing, Inc. v. Dutailier International, Inc. in 2005. The Supreme Court in Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness overturned the strict Brooks Furniture standard for awarding attorney fees in patent cases. The new standard defines an \"exceptional\" case as one that stands out in terms of the party's litigating position or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated. This change allows district courts more discretion in awarding attorney fees. The Supreme Court in Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness overturned the strict Brooks Furniture standard for awarding attorney fees in patent cases. The Court emphasized considering the \"totality of the circumstances\" for the Section 285 determination and adopted a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. In a related case, Highmark v. Allcare Health Management, the Court rejected the Federal Circuit's approach to reviewing \"exceptional case\" determinations, opting for an abuse-of-discretion standard on appeal. These decisions give district courts more discretion in awarding fees. The recent Supreme Court decisions in Octane Fitness and Highmark give district courts more discretion in awarding attorney fees in patent cases, potentially increasing the number of cases where fees are shifted. Supporters of patent litigation reform hope that this could deter patent assertion entities from filing infringement lawsuits due to the prospect of paying the other party's litigation expenses. However, some observers believe that fee-shifting will remain limited and may not significantly impact patent assertion entities. Recent Supreme Court cases clarify that a case is exceptional only if it is unusually weak. District courts now have discretion to decide on fee awards, leading courts signaling reluctance to shift fees to attract more patent lawsuits. Abusive litigants with shell-corporation structures make it difficult for defendants to recover fees. The Innovation Act's Section 3(b) proposes amending Section 285 to require courts to award attorney fees in patent cases unless the nonprevailing party's position is justified. The Innovation Act's fee-shifting provision aims to reduce nuisance settlements and allow more challenges to invalid patents. Supporters believe it would benefit defendants, while critics fear it may disadvantage individual inventors. The nonprevailing party must demonstrate special circumstances to avoid attorney fee awards. The Support Technology and Research for Our Nation's Growth (STRONG) Patents Act of 2015 (S. 632) does not include a fee-shifting provision, as it argues that recent Supreme Court rulings have already made it easier for alleged infringers to recover attorney fees from patent owners. Critics argue that a \"loser pays\" provision would protect institutional defendants with resources and force inventors into unfair settlements. The PATENT Act's fee-shifting provision states that attorney fees should be paid by a nonprevailing party if their position or conduct is not objectively reasonable. The prevailing party must make a motion for fees, and the court will determine if the nonprevailing party's position and conduct meet the standards. If not, reasonable attorney fees will be awarded to the prevailing party, unless special circumstances make an award unjust. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved additions to this provision on June 4, 2015. The prevailing party must demonstrate entitlement to an award, with examples of special circumstances that could make an award unjust. The PATENT Act exempts actions involving patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e)(2) from fee-shifting provisions. Under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a person must join as a party in litigation if their absence would prevent complete relief among existing parties or if they are unable to protect an interest. Rule 20 allows for joining as a plaintiff if all plaintiffs could claim relief for injuries from the same occurrence. The Patent Act specifies additional requirements for joining a patent civil action. The Innovation Act proposes mandatory joinder rules in patent cases when the nonprevailing party alleging infringement cannot pay the fee award. This provision would require the court to grant a defendant's motion to join an \"interested party\" if the plaintiff has no substantial interest in the patent other than asserting the claim. The Innovation Act proposes mandatory joinder rules in patent cases, requiring the court to join an \"interested party\" if the plaintiff has no substantial interest in the patent other than asserting the claim. An \"interested party\" includes a patent assignee, someone with the right to enforce or sublicense the patent, or with a direct financial interest in the patent. Excluded from this definition are the plaintiff's employees, legal counsel on a contingency fee basis, or individuals with a sole financial interest in the patent through ownership of an equity interest in the party alleging infringement. The Innovation Act proposes mandatory joinder rules in patent cases, requiring the court to join an \"interested party\" if the plaintiff has no substantial interest in the patent other than asserting the claim. A statutory exception is created for technology transfer organizations facilitating technology commercialization from higher education institutions, allowing them to allege infringement on behalf of exempted entities. The defendant must file an initial statement expressing belief in the plaintiff's lack of substantial interest, with the plaintiff required to certify within 45 days. The Innovation Act proposes mandatory joinder rules in patent cases, requiring the court to join an \"interested party\" if the plaintiff has no substantial interest in the patent other than asserting the claim. The court would have discretion to deny joinder if the interested party cannot be served, would affect jurisdiction, or if timely notice was not given. The Innovation Act proposes mandatory joinder rules in patent cases, requiring the court to join an \"interested party\" identified in the plaintiff's initial disclosure regarding financial interests in the patent. The court may deny joinder if the interested party renounces ownership within 30 days. The court has discretionary authority to hold joined parties liable for attorney fees if the nonprevailing party cannot pay. These provisions aim to address transparency issues with Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs). The proposed provision in the Innovation Act aims to address transparency issues with Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) by mandating joinder of interested parties in patent cases. Proponents argue that this would provide defendants with more information and allow for greater financial recovery, while opponents raise concerns about restricting patent owners' enforcement abilities. The Innovation Act proposes joinder provisions in patent cases to address transparency issues with PAEs. Opponents argue that this may harm business relationships and raise constitutional concerns about fee-shifting. The PATENT Act also includes a similar mechanism for recovering fee awards from interested parties. The PATENT Act proposes a process where the defendant can file a statement regarding the plaintiff's primary business being patent assertion. The plaintiff must then certify their ability to pay attorney fees, confirm their primary business is not patent assertion, disclose any interested parties, or state they have none. The Act defines \"interested party\" as someone with a financial interest in settlement, license, or damages proceeds. The PATENT Act defines an \"interested party\" as someone with a financial interest in settlement, license, or damages proceeds from patent enforcement. This does not include attorneys, individuals who have assigned patent rights, those with financial interests based on equity or security, or insured parties. The PATENT Act requires plaintiffs to update their certification within 30 days of any material changes. Plaintiffs must provide written notice to identified interested parties before filing certification to establish jurisdiction for enforcing attorney fees. The notice must include details of the action, parties, patents, and the party's interest. The PATENT Act requires plaintiffs to notify interested parties before filing certification for attorney fees enforcement. Recipients may be liable for attorney fees if plaintiff cannot pay, unless they renounce interest within 120 days. Interested parties can avoid liability by certifying sufficient funds or non-enforcement of patents. The PATENT Act allows interested parties to contest liability for attorney fees and exempts certain entities like higher education institutions from award recovery provisions. A patent demand letter is sent by a patent-holder accusing the recipient of infringement, demanding specific actions. Demand letters can be used to prove willfulness in infringement lawsuits, following a two-pronged test established by the Federal Circuit in the 2007 case In re Seagate Technology. The Innovation Act emphasizes the importance of detailed demand letters in establishing knowledge of patent infringement. It also prohibits relying on vague demand letters for claims of willful infringement, requiring specific information on the asserted patent, accused product, and claimant entity. The \"Demand Letter Transparency Act of 2015,\" H.R. 1896, requires entities sending 20 or more demand letters to disclose patent information to the USPTO, including ownership, licensing rights, financial terms, and litigation history. H.R. 1896, the Demand Letter Transparency Act of 2015, mandates disclosure of patent information by entities sending 20 or more demand letters, including ownership, licensing rights, financial terms, and litigation history. The bill allows courts to sanction entities that do not meet USPTO disclosure requirements in patent infringement cases. Original inventors, higher education institutions, and technology transfer organizations are exempt from these requirements. The Demand Letter Transparency Act of 2015 requires disclosure of patent information by entities sending 20 or more demand letters, including ownership, licensing rights, financial terms, and litigation history. The bill allows courts to sanction entities that do not meet USPTO disclosure requirements in patent infringement cases. Original inventors, higher education institutions, and technology transfer organizations are exempt from these requirements. Additionally, under the House's TROL Act and the Senate's STRONG Patents Act, a demand letter would qualify as an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" under the Federal Trade Commission Act if certain criteria are met. The TROL Act and the STRONG Patents Act would consider demand letters as unfair practices if the sender falsely represents their rights to a patent, threatens legal action, or seeks compensation for an unenforceable patent. Activities taken by the recipient after expiration of a patent, or authorized by a person with the right to license the patent, would be considered unfair practices under the TROL Act and the STRONG Patents Act. Demand letters must include specific information such as the identity of the sender, patent infringed, product or service infringing the patent, and contact information for the recipient to address the claims. The Federal Trade Commission would enforce violations of these provisions, preempting any state laws. The Senate's PATENT Act addresses abusive demand letters and pre-suit notifications, imposing civil penalties for deceptive practices. Abusive demand letter practices include false representations of judicial relief, threats of litigation, and assertions lacking a reasonable basis in law or fact. Enforcement would be carried out by the Federal Trade Commission. The Senate's PATENT Act addresses abusive demand letters and pre-suit notifications, imposing civil penalties for deceptive practices. The Federal Trade Commission would enforce violations of this provision, requiring detailed information in pre-suit notice letters accusing infringement. Amendments were approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 4, 2015, including a prohibition on certain demand letter practices. The PATENT Act aims to regulate demand letters, prohibiting specific monetary demands in pre-suit notices to resolve patent infringement allegations. Vague demand letters are seen as tools for extracting financial concessions, hindering innovation and burdening small businesses with litigation costs. Placing stricter requirements on demand letters is supported to address these issues. The PATENT Act aims to regulate demand letters by prohibiting specific monetary demands in pre-suit notices for patent infringement. Supporters believe this will lead to more targeted infringement claims and clearer communication between patent owners and alleged infringers. Critics argue that additional requirements may hinder communication between patent owners and potential licensees. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act established a new administrative proceeding called a \"post grant review\" for challenging patent validity. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act established a new administrative proceeding called a \"post grant review\" (PGR) for challenging patent validity. A petition to initiate a PGR must be filed within nine months of the date of patent grant. The Act also created an \"inter partes review\" (IPR) where a person who is not the patent owner may challenge the validity of an issued patent based on prior art. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) allows challenges to patent validity based on prior art like patents or publications. To start an IPR, the petitioner must show a \"reasonable likelihood\" of success on at least one claim. If an accused infringer has already filed a court challenge or more than a year has passed since being served with an infringement complaint, they cannot petition for an IPR. The process must be completed within a year, with a possible six-month extension for good cause. The USPTO patent revocation proceedings allow challenges to patents within specific timeframes. Patent holders may benefit from reforms favoring challenges in IPR or PGR proceedings, particularly those reliant on patents for revenue like pharmaceutical companies. The changes to patent laws may benefit patent assertion entities, despite criticism for potentially hindering patent invalidation in IPR or PGR proceedings. Lawmakers compromise to secure legislation support, reflecting conflicting reforms in the patent system. The AIA does not specify claim construction standards for PTAB proceedings, leading to the USPTO's regulation in 2012 for broad claim interpretation in IPRs. In a case from February 2015, the Federal Circuit upheld the PTAB's use of the \"broadest reasonable interpretation\" standard in claim construction, noting that the USPTO has long applied this standard in various proceedings to prevent overly broad patent claims. The Innovation Act and PATENT Act aim to legislatively overrule the Federal Circuit's decision on the claim construction standard in patent revocation proceedings. They propose using the same claim construction standard as federal courts, requiring the PTAB to interpret patent claims based on their ordinary meaning to one skilled in the art and the patent's prosecution history. Additionally, the PTAB must consider prior claim constructions. The PATENT Act, like the STRONG Patents Act, addresses claim construction standards in post-grant proceedings. Former USPTO Director David Kappos notes the potential for conflicting decisions due to different standards between courts and the USPTO. The BRI standard in post-grant proceedings requires patentees to define their claims clearly over the prior art before the USPTO. Some argue that changing the claim construction standard from BRI to \"ordinary and customary meaning\" would benefit patent owners. However, some groups oppose these changes, stating that they will undermine the effectiveness of post-grant review procedures in weeding out weak patents. Technology companies oppose the amendments to the claim construction standard in IPR proceedings. The proposed changes to the claim construction standard in IPR proceedings would eliminate a key difference between court and USPTO standards. The purpose of IPR is to ensure correct patent issuance, while district court determines patent infringement liability. These changes risk undermining progress in reducing invalid patents' burden on the industry, making the process more costly and complex. Individuals initiating a PGR proceeding are barred from raising the same issues in later civil actions. The Innovation Act and PATENT Act propose narrowing the estoppel effect of a PGR, allowing parties to assert in a civil action that a patent claim is invalid on any ground raised during the PGR. The STRONG Patents Act would amend existing law to provide a presumption of validity to a previously issued claim. The PATENT Act would amend existing law to provide a presumption of validity to a previously issued claim challenged during an IPR or PGR proceeding, with a higher evidentiary standard of \"clear and convincing evidence\" required to prove unpatentability. The Innovation Act amendments approved by the House Judiciary Committee would prohibit certain actions related to patents. The House Judiciary Committee approved amendments to the Innovation Act to restrict the filing of IPR or PGR petitions by parties with financial interests in the patent owner's equity securities. This is in response to concerns about \"reverse trolling\" abuses in PTAB proceedings. The STRONG Patents Act aims to tighten standing requirements for initiating PGR or IPR proceedings, requiring a reasonable possibility of being sued for patent infringement. The legislation also addresses concerns about strategic use of IPR to influence stock prices of drug companies. The PATENT Act allows the USPTO Director to refuse to institute an IPR or PGR proceeding if it would not serve the interest of justice. Factors considered include previous decisions on unpatentability and pending matters involving the same patent. Regulations would ensure panels consist of no more than one individual who participated in the decision to institute the proceeding. The USPTO is funded by fees from patent and trademark applicants, but Congress must appropriate the funds. Over $1 billion in fees have been withheld since 1999. The America Invents Act made changes to fee handling, subjecting it to the appropriations process. The America Invents Act created a \"Patent and Trademark Fee Reserve Fund\" to address fee withholding issues at the USPTO. The STRONG Patents Act aims to end fee diversion and establish a revolving fund for patent fees. S. 632 would establish a revolving fund called the \"United States Patent and Trademark Office Innovation Promotion Fund\" within the U.S. Treasury. Fees collected by the USPTO would be deposited into this Fund for the Director's use. The Fund would cover all expenses of the USPTO without fiscal year limitation. Title 28 of the U.S. Code includes a venue statute for patent cases, allowing civil actions for patent infringement to be brought where the defendant resides or has committed acts of infringement. VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co. expanded venue in patent infringement cases beyond what is permitted by Section 1400(b), allowing lawsuits to be filed in any district where there would be personal jurisdiction over the corporate defendant at the time the action is commenced. The Federal Circuit's liberalization of venue in patent cases has led to forum shopping, with plaintiffs seeking favorable districts. The Innovation Act aims to limit where patent infringement lawsuits can be filed, restoring Congress's intent for suits to be brought in districts connected to the dispute. The Innovation Act aims to limit where patent infringement lawsuits can be filed, ensuring they are brought in districts connected to the dispute. It would exempt the special venue statute for patent actions from the general venue statute and allow actions relating to patents to be brought in specific judicial districts. The Innovation Act aims to limit patent infringement lawsuits to specific judicial districts, exempting the general venue statute for patent actions. It would allow actions related to patents to be brought in districts connected to the dispute, even for cases involving foreign defendants without physical facilities in the United States. The patent reform legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aims to help small businesses involved in the patent system by providing educational resources on patent infringement concerns. This includes creating user-friendly sections on the USPTO website for information on abusive patent litigation practices. The patent reform legislation in the 114th Congress aims to assist small businesses by providing educational resources on patent infringement concerns. This includes a user-friendly section on the USPTO website for information on patent cases filed in federal court and disclosures on patent ownership mandated by the Innovation Act and PATENT Act. The initiatives will be implemented using existing agency resources, without additional appropriations. The Innovation Act requires a study on its economic impact on individuals and small businesses owned by women, veterans, and minorities, while the STRONG Patents Act mandates a report on the impact of patent ownership by small businesses. The STRONG Patents Act requires a report analyzing the impact of patent ownership by small businesses and patent infringement actions against them. It also designates specific U.S. district courts to expedite cases involving patent infringement accusations against individuals or small businesses."
