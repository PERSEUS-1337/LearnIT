The program has seen an increase in allocation authority to $61 billion and has been extended through 2019. Community Development Entities (CDEs) apply for tax credit allocations from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and then seek investors to make equity investments in low-income areas. The NMTC program offers tax credits to private equity investors through CDEs, with a credit value of 39% of the investment cost claimed over seven years. The credit is distributed at 5% for the first three years and 6% for the remaining four years. The program was extended through 2019 at $3.5 billion per year by the 114th Congress. Multiple agents and steps are involved in the NMTC process. The NMTC program involves multiple steps and agents to encourage investment in low-income communities. The Treasury Department's CDFI reviews and approves NMTC applicants, while CDEs serve as intermediary vehicles for providing funding in LICs. CDEs must meet specific criteria to become certified by the CDFI. CDEs play a critical role in the NMTC process by attracting investors using the credits and serving as intermediaries between low-income community investments and the CDFI. They must meet specific criteria, including having representatives from low-income communities on their advisory or governing boards. Only for-profit CDEs can pass on NMTCs to investors, while nonprofit CDEs must transfer their allocations to for-profit subsidiaries before offering NMTCs. Under the tax code's NMTC provisions, eligible investments in qualifying low-income communities are eligible for the NMTC. About 39% of the nation's census tracts covering nearly 36% of the U.S. population meet the criteria for NMTC eligibility. Designated targeted populations may also be treated as low-income communities. The definition of a low-income community for NMTC eligibility includes census tracts with low populations and those within high migration rural counties. Virtually all census tracts in the country are potentially eligible for NMTC. Taxable investors can claim the NMTC over seven years, with a total of 39% in credits. Recapture of the credit can occur if the CDE ceases to be a CDE, fails to use proceeds for eligible purposes, or redeems the investment principal. Qualified equity investments in low-income communities or serving low-income populations are eligible for NMTC. Qualified low-income community investments (QLICIs) are eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program. QLICIs can be loans or investments to qualified active low-income community businesses (QALICB), financial counseling, investments in other Community Development Entities (CDEs), or purchasing loans from other CDEs. All QLICIs, including QALICBs, are restricted from investing in residential rental properties and certain businesses like golf courses and casinos. To receive an allocation, a CDE must apply to the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and provide details on their track record, requested NMTC allocation authority, and plans for the allocation. The application focuses on the CDE's business strategy for investing in low-income communities and capitalization. The NMTC program evaluates CDEs based on their business strategy, capitalization, management capacity, and expected impact on low-income communities. Priority points are given for investing in unrelated entities and serving disadvantaged businesses or communities. Applications are scored to determine community development impact and ranked accordingly for tax credit allocations. In past rounds, more CDEs applied than received allocations, showing high demand for NMTC funding. In the most recent NMTC allocation round (2014), 29% of applicants received $19.9 billion in allocation authority, while only $3.5 billion was available. CDEs must sign an allocation agreement before offering tax credits, outlining terms, service areas, authorized uses, and reporting requirements. Failure to comply may result in revocation of allocation authority. IRS monitors compliance with tax consequences, focusing on the \"substantially all\" requirement. CDEs must issue tax credits to investors within five years of signing. Investors receive NMTC allocation authority from CDEs, who must invest in QLICIs within 12 months. Failure to comply results in loss of allocation authority. Investors can claim NMTCs on their investment in CDEs, totaling $42.2 billion to date. Investors have invested roughly $42.2 billion in CDEs. Modifications to the NMTC program have been made in each Congress since its creation, including provisions expanding the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury and providing tax relief to businesses and individuals affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 created the GO Zone and provided an additional $1 billion in allocation authority to CDEs involved in low-income community recovery and redevelopment. During the 109th and 110th Congress, the NMTC program was extended with additional allocations and attention focused on program authorization. Various bills proposed extensions through 2009 and 2013 with allocated funds indexed for inflation. The NMTC program was extended through various acts in different Congress sessions, with allocated funds indexed for inflation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 increased the NMTC allocation for 2008 and 2009. Subsequent acts extended the NMTC authorization through 2013 at $3.5 billion per year. The New Markets Tax Credit Program was extended through various acts in different Congress sessions, with allocated funds indexed for inflation. The program is set to expire at the end of 2019, and Congress is debating reauthorization. Policy considerations include the impact of the investment funds on achieving the program's objective of encouraging private capital investment in eligible low-income communities. The impact of the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program is assessed in terms of whether it funds new investment or represents a shift in investment location. A study found that corporate investment was a shift in location, while a portion of individual NMTC investment was new. Understanding the source of NMTC investments alone is not enough to determine effectiveness, as a comprehensive review would require accounting for social and economic costs and benefits, which may be challenging. The economic costs and benefits of the NMTC program are being evaluated, including efficiency, opportunity costs, and spillover effects on neighboring businesses and communities. The Urban Institute conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the NMTC, finding project level activity consistent with program goals but unable to generalize findings due to evaluation design limitations. Recommendations have been made to simplify the NMTC by converting it into a grant program. Converting the NMTC into a grant program could potentially reduce government costs while still providing incentives to investors. However, this may lead to less investor interest in NMTC projects, making it harder to improve access to capital in low-income communities. Grant programs could also complicate existing mechanisms meant to ensure the NMTC is used as intended. The distribution of NMTC activity is concentrated in a few states, with the top 10 states accounting for over 50% of all activity. This may raise questions about equity and whether it reflects the distribution of low-income populations. The NMTC is a program aimed at improving conditions in low-income communities, with its goal overlapping with other tax credits and programs. Despite the concentration of NMTC activity in a few states, no comparative study has been done to assess its performance relative to similar programs."
