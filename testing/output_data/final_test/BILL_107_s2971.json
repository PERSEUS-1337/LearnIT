INDIAN RESERVATION RURAL TRANSIT PROGRAM. The Indian Reservation Rural Transit Program under Section 5311 of title 49, United States Code, allows the Secretary of Transportation to provide competitive grants to Indian tribes for establishing rural transit programs on reservations or tribal lands. Grants are based on the tribes' needs. The Secretary of Transportation determines the funding based on the Indian tribe's needs, allocating $20,000,000 annually for the program under section 5338. The Sense of Congress regarding Indian Reservation Roads is outlined in Section 4. Congress finds that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for maintaining roads on Indian reservations, but current funding only covers 30% of the needed amount. It is crucial to provide sufficient funding for road maintenance to prevent waste on construction projects."
