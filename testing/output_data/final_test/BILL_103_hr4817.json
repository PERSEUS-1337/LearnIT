    "content": "The \"Vegetable Oil Use Promotion Act\" promotes increased demand for and use of vegetable oils derived from certain oilseeds. The Vegetable Oil Industrial Products Fund was established within the Commodity Credit Corporation to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. It consists of specific amounts deposited annually from 1995 to 2000 for carrying out designated activities. The Vegetable Oil Industrial Products Fund, totaling $46,700,000 for fiscal year 2000, is available to the Secretary for promoting industrial products containing vegetable oils. Grants are made to encourage the commercial use of these products, with applications solicited from US manufacturing operations seeking financial assistance for production expansion. The Secretary selects grant recipients based on applications from manufacturing operations using vegetable oils from eligible oilseeds. A person cannot receive more than 10% of total assistance in a fiscal year. The Secretary provides estimates of vegetable oil production and consumption in the US twice a year. If the October 1 estimate of end-of-year stocks of vegetable oil exceeds a certain threshold, the Secretary will promote an increase in demand to prevent excessive stocks. Adjustments will be made based on April 1 estimates to maintain a balance between production and consumption. The Secretary may adjust vegetable oil demand expansion activities to increase domestic and export demand. This can be done through purchasing for donation to meet dietary needs in developing countries, donation to emerging democracies with proceeds for economic development, or discounted sale to industrial product producers using vegetable oils. Definitions for this section are provided. Definitions for this section include the Vegetable Oil Industrial Products Fund, oilseeds such as soybeans and corn, and the Secretary of Agriculture."
