The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2015 aims to address the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers, particularly nurses and nursing assistants, caused by patient lifting and transferring. These injuries lead to chronic back pain and contribute to nurses leaving the profession. Many nurses suffer from chronic back pain, with 38% needing to take leave from work. Patient safety is compromised during manual lifting, transferring, or repositioning. The use of mechanical lifts can reduce injuries to patients and prevent accidents. Assistive patient handling technology has significantly improved patient care. The use of patient handling technology has reduced injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers, leading to a decline in lost work days and staff turnover. States have implemented standards for safe patient handling and injury prevention, resulting in positive outcomes. Establishing safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards for healthcare workers is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The success of these programs at the facility and State level demonstrates the feasibility of such standards. Sec. 2 introduces the Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard. The Secretary of Labor must establish an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within one year of the Act's enactment. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, requiring the use of engineering and safety controls for patient handling. The interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention aims to reduce injuries from manual handling of patients by healthcare workers through the use of mechanical technology and devices where feasible. If not feasible, alternative controls and measures must be used to minimize the risk of injury. This standard applies to all healthcare employers and aligns with national safe patient handling standards. The interim final standard requires healthcare employers to implement a safe patient handling program and purchase appropriate equipment within specified timeframes. Input from healthcare workers, including registered nurses, is also mandated. The healthcare employers must involve workers, including registered nurses, in developing and implementing a safe patient handling program. They must also establish a data tracking and review program to analyze the implementation of the program. Each health care employer must maintain data from their review for at least 5 years and consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into facility design. Employers are also required to train workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies and technology. The health care employer must provide training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices annually. Training should cover general and specific musculoskeletal hazards, be conducted by knowledgeable individuals, and include interactive simulated point-of-care training. Additionally, employers must post a notice explaining safe patient handling rights. The annual evaluation requirement for health care employers includes assessing the implementation of safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention programs, procedures for reporting injuries, and workers' rights under the Act. The evaluation of injuries and new safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention technology and devices developed involve nurses, healthcare workers, and their representatives. Health care employers must take corrective action based on the evaluation. Additionally, health care workers have the right to refuse unsafe assignments if they believe it violates safety standards. The Secretary of Labor conducts unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards. Health care workers must report safety concerns to their employer if violations are not corrected. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard applies to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is being amended in the Social Security Act to include specific requirements for health care facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments will take effect one year after issuance. The final safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard will apply to health care facilities one year after issuance. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. Effect on Other Laws: This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. States can still enforce laws that provide equal or greater protections for employees. The rights of people with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act are not limited in accessing healthcare. The Act ensures that healthcare workers prioritize the needs of people with disabilities and does not limit funding for equipment specified in the Internal Revenue Code. It also clarifies that the rights of healthcare workers under federal or state laws are not affected. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" \"employment,\" and \"handling\" in relation to healthcare workers and services. The term \"health care worker\" refers to individuals assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling, which includes direct patient care actions presenting a risk of musculoskeletal injury. A health care employer encompasses various facilities employing direct-care registered nurses or other health care workers. The term \"health care worker\" includes individuals assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling, such as direct-care registered nurses or independent contractors."
