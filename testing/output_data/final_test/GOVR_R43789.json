    "content": "Under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), the federal government grants funds to states for adult education services, including literacy, basic skills, and English language training. These services are provided locally to adults seeking to improve skills or obtain a secondary credential. AEFLA programs are overseen by the U.S. Department of Education through its Office of Vocational and Adult Education. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) was originally enacted as Title II of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. It was reauthorized in 2014 as Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, authorizing appropriations through FY2020. The implementation of WIOA provisions is ongoing, with both federal and state adult education programs currently operating under WIA provisions. The AEFLA provisions of WIOA maintained the program structure established by WIA in 1998, with funding primarily going to state agencies for subgranting to local agencies. WIOA emphasized transitions from adult education to employment and postsecondary education. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) emphasizes coordination and alignment of workforce programs, including adult education, through a unified state plan. WIOA establishes common performance indicators across programs, focusing on employment outcomes and credential attainment. AEFLA appropriations are authorized from FY2015 to FY2020, with increasing levels each year. In FY2020, the authorization level is $678,640,000. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) emphasizes coordination of workforce programs, including adult education. AEFLA authorizations range from 2.1% to 2.4%, with FY2020 level at $678,640,000. Legislation aims to assist adults in literacy, employment skills, parenting education, and postsecondary transition. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) expands the purpose of adult education programs to include career pathways, assisting English language learners in improving language and math skills, and understanding American government and citizenship responsibilities. WIOA also emphasizes transitions to postsecondary education and training, with a focus on the relationship between AEFLA-funded services and subsequent transitions to postsecondary education and employment. The definition of education under WIOA includes academic instruction below postsecondary level to improve language, math skills, and transition to postsecondary education or employment. AEFLA provisions of WIOA reserve funds for specific purposes like English literacy and civics education state grants. Total appropriation includes reservation for national leadership activities and unreserved funds for various programs. Under WIOA, AEFLA provisions reserve funds for English literacy and civics education state grants, adult education state grant funds, subgrants to local providers, state leadership activities, and administrative costs. The repeal of two reservations under WIOA increases the portion of the AEFLA appropriation allotted to states. 98% of the annual AEFLA appropriation not reserved for National Leadership Activities is granted to states through two formula grants. 12% of the formula grant funds are reserved for EL-Civics and allocated to states via formula, while the remaining 88% is allocated to adult education state grants using a second formula. State grant funds are distributed in two steps, with an initial allotment of $250,000 to each state and $100,000 to each eligible outlying area, followed by the distribution of the remainder based on each state's share of qualifying adults. Qualifying adults are individuals at least 16 years old and beyond compulsory school age. Adults eligible for adult education grants must meet specific criteria, including being at least 16 years old, lacking a high school diploma, and not enrolled in secondary school. States must provide a 25% match for federal grants, with non-federal sources contributing cash or in-kind. Hold harmless provisions ensure states receive at least 90% of previous grants, and maintenance of effort provisions require states to spend at least 90% of prior year funds on adult education. WIOA maintains the same formula and provisions as AEFLA under WIA. States can allocate up to 12.5% of grants for specific purposes. The AEFLA provisions of WIOA allow states to allocate up to 12.5% of their grants for state leadership activities and 5% for administrative expenses. The remaining 82.5% must be subgranted to local providers of adult education services. Required state leadership activities include aligning adult education activities with other WIOA core programs, professional development programs for local providers, and technical assistance. The AEFLA provisions of WIOA allow states to allocate a portion of their grants for state leadership activities and administrative expenses. The majority of the grant must be subgranted to local providers for adult education services. States must provide equitable access to eligible providers and consider various factors when selecting subgrantees. The AEFLA provisions of WIOA allow states to allocate grants for state leadership activities and administrative expenses. Eligible providers must demonstrate effectiveness in providing adult education and literacy activities. Providers may include various organizations like educational agencies, community-based organizations, and institutions of higher education. Local subgrantees are required to establish or operate programs for eligible individuals. Local subgrantees must provide adult education and literacy activities as defined by AEFLA, including workplace education, family literacy, English language acquisition, and workforce preparation. WIOA allows states to subgrant funds for educational activities in correctional institutions and reserves 12% of AEFLA formula grant funds for EL-Civics State Grants. No more than 20% of subgrants can support activities for institutionalized individuals. EL-Civics State Grants under AEFLA provisions of WIOA provide services to adult English language learners, including literacy and English language instruction, citizenship education, and workforce training. Grant funds are allocated to states based on their share of recent legal permanent residents. The codification of EL-Civics State Grants under WIOA aligns AEFLA-funded programs at the state level and coordinates them with other WIOA-authorized programs through a unified state plan and common performance measures. Each state must have an approved state plan to be eligible for AEFLA grant funds. Under WIOA, each state must submit a unified state plan (USP) that establishes a four-year strategy for the core WIOA-authorized programs, including adult education. The plan assesses the state's labor needs, workforce development system, and how programs will be aligned to meet these needs. The State Workforce Development Board (WDB) develops the unified state plan, which includes representatives from business, workforce, and government. The state Workforce Development Board (WDB) includes representatives from business, workforce, and government, with government representatives addressing specific issues related to activities under adult education. These issues include aligning content standards, awarding subgrants, carrying out state leadership and EL-Civics activities, and assessing provider quality. WIOA developed common performance accountability measures across all core programs, focusing on employment and credential attainment. Section 116 specifies six performance measures, including participant employment rates and earnings. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) established performance measures for core programs, including participant employment rates, credential attainment, and skill gains. States must set expected performance levels for each indicator, with a focus on serving employers effectively. Under WIOA, data limited to AEFLA grantees will be reported on six performance metrics. Expected performance levels are negotiated between the state and the Secretary of Labor. 2% of AEFLA appropriations are reserved for National Leadership Activities (NLA) to enhance the quality and outcomes of adult education nationwide. NLA includes providing assistance to states and local providers in meeting performance accountability requirements, conducting research, and evaluation of adult education activities. The National Leadership Activities (NLA) under AEFLA involve research, evaluation, and coordination of adult education activities. NLA funds are used for technical assistance, supporting best practices, and evaluating program effectiveness. An independent evaluation of AEFLA programs is conducted every four years."
