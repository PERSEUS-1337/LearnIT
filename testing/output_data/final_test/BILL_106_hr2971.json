    "content": "The \"Academic Emergency Act\" authorizes the Secretary to provide funds to states with schools designated as academic emergency schools to offer education alternatives to parents. Grants awarded under this Act will be for a maximum of 5 years. SEC. 3. ACADEMIC EMERGENCY DESIGNATION.\n\nGovernors can designate schools with poor performance and high poverty rates as academic emergency schools to receive grants. Each State with schools designated as academic emergency schools must submit an application to the Secretary, ensuring funds supplement rather than replace existing funds. Parents must be notified of the voluntary program and available qualified schools in their area. The State must provide easily accessible information on education alternatives and limit administrative expenses to 4 percent of the funds. Information on academic emergency schools, including student attendance and performance, must be disclosed in the application. State selection for funding is based on appropriations in any fiscal year. The Secretary will award grants to States based on section 14 authority in a fiscal year. Priority is given to States completing applications to provide education alternatives to at least 1 academic school. Grant amounts consider the number of academic emergency schools and eligible students. States applying for funds must establish a plan to distribute funds to academic emergency schools. The Secretary will distribute funds to academic emergency schools to ensure eligible students have access to relief funds and continue to receive payments if they switch to a qualified school. A simple procedure will be developed for parents and schools to redeem the funds. SEC. 5. AWARDS TO ACADEMIC EMERGENCY SCHOOLS. From funds allocated to a State under this Act, academic emergency schools are selected to receive subgrants based on student numbers, proximity to qualified schools, and academic performance. The funds must be used solely for reducing class sizes in these schools. If funds are insufficient, not all eligible students may receive academic emergency relief. The State will use a random selection process to offer eligible students in academic emergency schools the chance to participate in education alternatives with relief funds. Each participating student's parents can receive up to $3,500, and the school will also receive $3,500 per student. The funds are to be used for academic emergency relief. The academic emergency relief funds awarded to parents and schools will be given for each school year during the grant period, which ends when a participating student is no longer in the State or after 5 years. States will continue to receive funds for distribution according to the Act. SEC. 6. QUALIFIED SCHOOLS. Qualifications for a school to participate as a qualified school under this Act include complying with section 10, certifying that tuition fees do not exceed those charged to non-relief fund parents, and reporting student performance to the State annually. Personal identifiers are not allowed in the reporting. The school must report student performance annually to the State, without using personal identifiers except for verification purposes. SEC. 7. ACADEMIC EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS. Parents can use funds for tuition at qualified schools. Funds are for students, not schools. SEC. 8. EVALUATION. The Comptroller General of the United States will contract an evaluating agency to conduct an annual evaluation of the education alternative program established under this Act. The evaluating agency must transmit the findings of each annual evaluation to the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish criteria for evaluating the education alternative program under this Act. Criteria will include the effects on student participation, parental satisfaction, and educational performance of eligible students receiving academic emergency relief funds. The Comptroller General and the Secretary will establish criteria for evaluating the education alternative program, including effects on student participation, parental satisfaction, and academic performance of eligible students at emergency schools under this Act. The Comptroller General will submit interim and final reports to Congress on the findings of annual evaluations for the education alternative program established under the Act. The reports will summarize the effects on student participation, parental satisfaction, and academic performance of eligible students at emergency schools. SEC. 10. CIVIL RIGHTS. A qualified school under this Act cannot discriminate based on race, color, national origin, or sex. Applicability to discrimination on the basis of sex is limited for schools controlled by religious organizations. Single-sex schools, classes, or activities are allowed. SEC. 11. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 11. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act allows religious schools to employ, admit, or give preference to individuals of the same religion. It also permits the use of funds for sectarian educational purposes and allows schools to maintain religious symbols.
