It amends the Social Security Act to include requirements related to qualified prescription drug monitoring programs and prescribing certain controlled substances. Beginning October 1, 2021, States must require covered providers to check a covered individual's prescription drug history through a qualified prescription drug monitoring program before prescribing controlled substances. The program must provide real-time access to certain information for the provider. Beginning October 1, 2021, States must mandate covered providers to check a covered individual's prescription drug history through a qualified prescription drug monitoring program before prescribing controlled substances. The program must offer real-time access to specific information, including the number and type of controlled substances prescribed, and details of the providers who prescribed them. The qualified prescription drug monitoring program integrates information into the workflow of covered providers, including electronic systems for prescribing controlled substances. It may have a data sharing agreement with the State Medicaid program to access information electronically. The State Medicaid program can provide limited access to qualified individuals with documented beneficiary protections. The qualified prescription drug monitoring program allows access to the medical or pharmacy directors of managed care entities contracted with the State Medicaid program. State and Federal privacy laws apply to directors accessing the program. The Secretary will clarify privacy requirements for accessing the program. Regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act clarify privacy requirements for data sharing. The Secretary can waive requirements for States during natural disasters or emergency services. States must include information in annual reports starting in 2023. Starting in 2023, annual reports must include information on the percentage of providers checking prescription drug history before prescribing controlled substances and aggregate trends in prescribing, such as daily morphine milligram equivalents. Starting in 2023, annual reports will include data on the daily morphine milligram equivalents prescribed for controlled substances per covered individual, types of controlled substances prescribed, and populations receiving these prescriptions. Additionally, reports will detail whether the State mandates prescription drug history checks before prescribing controlled substances. The State may require pharmacists to check prescription drug history before dispensing controlled substances to covered individuals. By October 1, 2023, CMS will provide guidance to increase provider usage of monitoring programs and share best practices for States and covered entities. The Secretary will increase the Federal matching rate for State expenditures on prescription drug management programs that meet specific criteria from October 1, 2018, to September 30, 2021. The Federal matching rate for State prescription drug management programs will increase if certain criteria are met, with a maximum rate of 100 percent.

The curr_chunk describes strategies for utilizing data sharing agreements under the Social Security Act to monitor fraud, improve healthcare for Medicaid enrollees, and for other purposes specified by the Secretary. The model practices under the Social Security Act include strategies for data access by medical and pharmacy directors, beneficiary protections, and privacy guidelines, with consultation from the National. The Secretary will consult various stakeholders for input on prescription drug monitoring programs and electronic health records. The Comptroller General will issue a report on the operation of state-administered monitoring programs by October 1, 2020, focusing on data security and access standards.
