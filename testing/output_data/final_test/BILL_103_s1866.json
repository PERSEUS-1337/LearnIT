    "content": "The \"Personnel Security Act of 1994\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the National Security Act of 1947 introduces a new title regarding eligibility for access to top secret information. The \"Personnel Security Act of 1994\" introduces a new title granting access to Top Secret information to certain government officials and employees based on their positions, citizenship, and trustworthiness. Access to Top Secret information is restricted to individuals who have undergone background investigations and met the requirements outlined in the Personnel Security Act of 1994. Other individuals can only access Top Secret information in accordance with regulations issued by the President. Implementing regulations are necessary for individuals to access Top Secret information in accordance with the Personnel Security Act of 1994. The President must issue regulations within 180 days to implement the Personnel Security Act of 1994, ensuring that no government employee can access Top Secret information without a background investigation and consent. The President must issue regulations within 180 days to implement the Personnel Security Act of 1994, ensuring background investigations are conducted for access to financial records, consumer reports, and travel records for individuals with access to Top Secret information. The Personnel Security Act of 1994 requires background investigations for individuals with access to Top Secret information. Information obtained by an investigative agency must not be used for purposes other than security determinations unless there are reasonable grounds to believe the person may pose a security threat. The Personnel Security Act of 1994 mandates background checks for those with Top Secret access. Information gathered must only be used for security purposes, and individuals must report unauthorized foreign travel. Employees with Top Secret access must report any unauthorized contacts with foreign nationals seeking classified information. Failure to comply can result in denial or termination of access. Employees with Top Secret access must undergo additional background investigations every 5 years and may be investigated at any time to ensure they meet access requirements. The President or designated officials may permit access for individuals not meeting requirements if essential for national security. A designated office will monitor and report on the implementation of this title within the Executive branch. Regulations will be provided to relevant congressional committees. The Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives must be informed thirty days before the effective date of certain actions. In extraordinary circumstances, the President may waive provisions for individual cases involving US citizens or permanent residents to protect national security interests. Waivers must be recorded and available for review by designated committees. Sec. 804 defines terms related to national security, classified information, and Top Secret information, including the criteria for each classification. The term 'employee' under Sec. 804 includes individuals receiving compensation from the US Government, contractors, unpaid consultants, or those acting on behalf of the government. It excludes the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and certain judicial officials. Additionally, 'authorized investigative agency' refers to an agency authorized to conduct investigations on individuals seeking access to Top Secret information to determine their eligibility. The title will take effect 180 days after enactment."
