    "content": "The Agricultural Act of 2014 (the \"2014 farm bill\") was enacted on February 7, 2014, reauthorizing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The new law changed how the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) impacts SNAP benefits, now only affecting households receiving more than $20 a year. The farm bill conference agreement aligns with changes in the Senate- and House-passed bills, setting thresholds at $10 and $20 respectively for SNAP benefits. The LIHEAP-related change in the 2014 farm bill is estimated to reduce SNAP spending by $8.6 billion over 10 years. Reauthorization proposals focused on deficit reduction and agricultural program reforms, with debates on reducing SNAP program. The 2014 farm bill included a provision to align SNAP benefits with LIHEAP thresholds, aiming to reduce program spending and improve integrity. Supporters argue for uniform treatment across states, while detractors claim it reduces benefits for those in need. The complexity of the policy change makes it challenging to predict its impact on households and states' administration of SNAP. SNAP benefits are determined by a household's size, net income, and maximum benefit levels. Eligibility is based on deductions from gross income, with benefits calculated accordingly. For more information on SNAP and the farm bill, refer to CRS reports. The calculation for SNAP benefits is based on a household's size, net income, and maximum benefit levels. A hypothetical three-person household with a net income of $400 would receive a monthly allotment of $377 in FY2014 after deductions. LIHEAP payments can be used as proof of heating and cooling costs for SNAP households. The 2014 farm bill limited the use of LIHEAP payments to document heating and cooling costs for SNAP benefits to payments over $20. This change means that LIHEAP assistance must exceed $20 to impact SNAP benefits. LIHEAP can result in a larger monthly SNAP benefit, but the amount received is based on various deductions and calculations. The amount of SNAP benefits for eligible households is determined by the maximum benefit and net income. Net income is calculated by deducting certain expenses from gross income, such as a standard deduction and earned income deduction. These deductions help account for non-food expenses. The deductions for SNAP benefits include 20% of earned income, child support, dependent care expenses related to work, and excess shelter expenses exceeding 50% of net income. The 2014 FARM BILL changed the qualification criteria for higher shelter expense deductions for households receiving LIHEAP. The 2014 FARM BILL changed the qualification criteria for higher shelter expense deductions for households receiving LIHEAP. For households with an elderly or disabled member, net monthly income equals gross monthly income minus standard deductions, child support, earned income, dependent care deductions, out-of-pocket medical expenses, and an uncapped excess shelter deduction. This change has the potential to make a larger difference for these households. LIHEAP is a formula grant program that provides annual grants to states to assist low-income households with home energy costs. A standard utility allowance (SUA) is used by states to determine eligibility for benefits, with varying amounts based on heating/cooling costs. SUA can help households qualify for excess shelter deductions, increasing their monthly benefits. States can use LIHEAP funds for heating/cooling costs, crisis assistance, and weatherization. Eligible households can receive assistance for heating and cooling costs, crisis aid, and home weatherization through LIHEAP. Both renters and homeowners qualify for the program, with states having the authority to set eligibility guidelines and benefit levels. States may establish maximum income limits for eligibility, with options to include households receiving certain benefits like TANF, SSI, SNAP, or veterans' programs. States also determine the types of assistance provided to households. In FY2008, LIHEAP provided varying amounts of heating assistance, with an average benefit of $293. Unlike SNAP, LIHEAP is not an open-ended entitlement and does not have sufficient funding to assist all eligible households. In FY2009, 7.4 million households received heating and/or winter crisis assistance, while 900,000 received cooling assistance. Total funding for LIHEAP in FY2009 was $5.1 billion. In FY2009, states received $5.1 billion for LIHEAP, compared to $3.4 billion in FY2014. \"Heat and Eat\" is a strategy to increase SNAP benefits using nominal LIHEAP payments. USDA found 16 states implementing \"Heat and Eat\" in 2012. LIHEAP is not an entitlement, so benefits are limited. The \"Heat and Eat\" policy allows states to increase SNAP benefits by using nominal LIHEAP payments, benefiting households with high energy costs. LIHEAP eligibility is based on income or enrollment in other means-tested programs like SNAP, with no separate criteria for nominal benefits recipients. The LIHEAP program provides assistance to households based on income or categorical eligibility, with no separate criteria for nominal benefits recipients. States can use LIHEAP funds to help with home energy costs, energy crisis situations, weatherization, and services to reduce the need for energy assistance. It is unclear how states with nominal LIHEAP payments determine if households have a need for LIHEAP for statutory purposes. The LIHEAP program assists households based on income or categorical eligibility. States can use funds for home energy costs, crisis situations, weatherization, and reducing the need for energy assistance. Changes in SNAP benefit calculation rules may impact some households, but eligibility for benefits will not be affected. States and households may have options to mitigate the impact of these changes. The changes in SNAP benefit calculation rules may impact households' eligibility for benefits, specifically regarding the LIHEAP payment. The amendments take effect 30 days after enactment and apply to certification periods after the effective date. This could result in a reduction of benefits for households when they reapply. The new law impacts SNAP benefit calculation rules, with changes for households applying for benefits and recertifying. States have the option to delay implementation for current recipients for up to five months after the law takes effect. The new law allows states to delay implementing changes to SNAP benefits for current recipients for up to five months after the law takes effect. States also have the option to issue LIHEAP payments greater than $20 to households. The higher SUA can still be included in the household's excess shelter deduction even if they do not receive more than $20 of LIHEAP assistance. Applicants must provide utility bills or documentation. CBO did not estimate the number of SNAP-recipient households affected by the Agricultural Act of 2014. A policy change may reduce benefits for households receiving the excess shelter deduction. Modifying the treatment of LIHEAP in SNAP could impact households receiving excess shelter deductions. \"Heat and Eat\" states may no longer issue LIHEAP payments below $20 to SNAP participants. Advocates argue that requiring LIHEAP documentation simplifies the process and ensures eligible households receive all benefits. Administrative simplification ensures eligible households receive all deductions, especially in \"Heat and Eat\" states where LIHEAP payment may be communicated to SNAP systems. States can implement other systems to ensure households receive all qualifying deductions."
