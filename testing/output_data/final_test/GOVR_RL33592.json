    "content": "On July 19, 2006, Illinois Special State's Attorney Edward J. Egan and Chief Deputy Special State's Attorney Robert Boyle released a report on police brutality by the Chicago Police Department. The 4-year investigation found potential criminal charges in three cases, but they were barred by the Illinois statute of limitations. Chief Deputy Special State's Attorney Boyle suggested that federal RICO and Hobbs Act statutes might allow prosecution with less severe limitations. The federal criminal statutes implicated by the Report involve cases of aggravated battery, perjury, and obstruction of justice by Chicago Police Department officers. However, prosecution is barred by the Illinois statute of limitations in all three cases mentioned in the Report. The officers who interrogated Pinex were accused of committing aggravated battery, perjury, and obstruction of justice in violation of Illinois law. Despite the brutal treatment Wilson endured during his arrest in connection with the murder investigation of two police officers, prosecution is barred by the Illinois statute of limitations. Dr. Korn noted 15 injuries on Wilson's head, chest, and right leg, including cuts, bruises, and burns. Wilson was convicted of murdering two officers but the conviction was overturned due to a coerced confession. Wilson's confession was deemed coerced, leading to a retrial where he was convicted again and sentenced to life imprisonment. He sued the officers and the city for mistreatment under 42 U.S.C. 1983, settling with the city after being awarded damages. The commanding officer was suspended and later dismissed for brutality allegations. Despite denying mistreatment, the Police Board found that Wilson had been tortured. Adkins was arrested in 1984 for armed robbery, where he was beaten by police officers on the way to the station. He was hospitalized and later sued the officers and the City, settling for $25,000 in federal court. The Chicago Office of Professional Standards investigated officers beating Adkins, who was later arrested for a murder charge. Pinex's statement in custody was suppressed for Miranda rule violations. Charges against Pinex were dismissed, and he sued alleging officers beat him for a confession. The City settled for $5,000. Other detainees also complained of beatings by Detective Area 2 officers, with the report citing a lack of credible evidence. The Report from Detective Area 2 concludes there is a lack of evidence to convict officers and no evidence of obstruction of justice. One prosecutor from the State's Attorney's Office is singled out for potential wrongdoing related to a confession. The report from Detective Area 2 found a lack of evidence to convict officers and no obstruction of justice. One prosecutor from the State's Attorney's Office is implicated for potential wrongdoing related to a confession by Andrew Wilson, which could undermine his claim of abuse before confessing. Wilson's false testimony could support his claims. The prosecutor's credibility is questioned for denying knowledge of Wilson's torture allegations. The Report suggests the Superintendent of Police was guilty of a dereliction of duty in investigating Andrew Wilson's claim. It hints at possible violations of federal criminal laws such as the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The Fifth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, binding state and local officials. Police are prohibited from torturing or brutalizing those in custody to elicit confessions, which is a federal crime. Other federal crimes include using force to prevent providing information on federal offenses, providing false statements to federal agencies, lying under oath in federal proceedings, and extortion under color of official right obstructing commerce. Federal racketeering laws (RICO) target enterprises affecting interstate commerce through patterned commission of crimes. Aiding, abetting, or conspiring in federal offenses makes one equally liable and punishable. Conspiracy is a separate crime upon agreement and overt act. Liability under federal law for conspiracy extends to acts in furtherance of the scheme, regardless of whether the crime is actually committed. Federal crimes generally have a 5-year statute of limitations, starting from the last act of the criminal enterprise. Evidence of police officers committing battery could support a civil rights violation under 18 U.S.C. 242. Federal perjury charges cannot be based on false statements in Illinois proceedings, but the same false statements may have been made in federal civil rights suits. False statements to police or state investigators could lead to federal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 or 18 U.S.C. 1512. The Supreme Court's decision in Scheidler v. NOW clarified that Hobbs Act extortion does not include the use of violence to coerce prisoners to relinquish their rights. This ruling also applies to RICO prosecutions involving police misconduct cases. The cases arising from the \"Ramparts Scandal\" involved various officers committing serious crimes, focusing on the injuries for which a civil RICO plaintiff can seek damages. Civil rights violations and certain other offenses are not considered RICO predicate offenses, but violations of 18 U.S.C. 1512 are. The government would need to prove that the commander and officers of Area 2 conducted activities affecting interstate commerce through violations of 18 U.S.C. 1512(b)(3) to establish a RICO violation. The retroactive application of Section 1512, enacted in 1982, is prohibited by the Constitution's ex post facto clauses. Section 1512 became a RICO predicate offense on November 10, 1986, and cannot be applied to misconduct prior to that date. The denials of mistreatment under section 1512 begin in 1982 and possibly end with denials during interviews by the Report's authors. The date section 1512 was added as a RICO predicate, November 10, 1986, sets the starting point for violations to be used as a RICO predicate. The addition of section 1512 as a RICO predicate offense in 1986 sets the starting point for violations. It is unclear if section 1512(b)(3) covers situations where deceit is used to prevent disclosure of information to federal authorities concerning expired federal crimes. Alleged civil rights violations followed by denials may constitute violations of federal perjury and false statement statutes. The end line for violations may be marked at five years after the penultimate instance of perjury or false statement. In the context of the Wilson case, section 1512 may allow prosecution for denials made within five years of false statements regarding a 1982 civil rights violation. A RICO prosecution requires proving a pattern of related predicate offenses, showing continuity and relationship between the crimes. The curr_chunk discusses RICO continuity and the criteria for establishing a pattern of related predicate offenses. It explains that predicate acts are related if they share similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission. RICO continuity can be closed-ended or open-ended, with the government needing to demonstrate a series of conduct that either implies a threat of future harm or shows signs of continuing into the future. The chunk also mentions three cases involving different sets of officers but exhibiting similar patterns of behavior. The curr_chunk discusses alleged instances of officers in Area 2 brutalizing detainees, denying wrongdoing, and offering explanations deemed not credible. The RICO predicates involve denials and fabrications to investigators, state proceedings, and federal depositions. These instances, while involving different officers, share a common environment, means, and purpose. The question of continuity in these cases may pose challenges. The curr_chunk discusses potential obstacles in proving a continuous enterprise based on various depositions and testimonies from civil cases and hearings spanning from 1987 to 1993. The limited instances over time may raise doubts about the evidence. The 5-year statute of limitations for federal crimes and the timing of civil rights violations in 1982, 1984, and 1985 are also mentioned. The Report from 1985 suggests that criminal charges based on denials and fabrications would be time-barred by the Illinois statute of limitations. However, there is a possibility of future federal prosecution under RICO due to a potential conspiracy to conceal the civil rights violations committed by officers in the 1980s. The statute of limitations for conspiracies in violation of a statute starts with the most recent overt act. In cases like RICO where no overt act is required, the scheme continues until all objectives are met or abandoned. In Grunewald v. United States, the issue was whether the statute of limitations could be extended if conspirators conceal past actions. Defendants in Grunewald fixed tax prosecutions and altered records to hide their actions. The Grunewald case involved conspirators trying to conceal their misconduct by denying wrongdoing and urging witnesses not to cooperate, even after the statute of limitations had passed. The prosecution argued that the conspiracy continued through acts of concealment, but the Court found that the case fell within the ban of prior opinions on criminal conspiracies carried out in secrecy. The Court acknowledged the significance of acts of concealment in furthering a conspiracy. Acts of concealment can have significance in furthering a criminal conspiracy, especially if done in furtherance of the main criminal objectives. Overt acts of concealment can toll the statute of limitations or evidence the conspiracy's continued existence. Two federal appellate court cases, United States v. Masters and United States v. Maloney, illustrate this point. Masters involved an attorney and a chief of police taking kickbacks for client referrals. The chief of police and a sheriff's department lieutenant were convicted under federal RICO charges for corruption offenses, including accepting bribes and participating in a plot to murder the attorney's wife. The chief was charged with conspiracy due to the statute of limitations on corruption charges expiring. The appellate court rejected the chief's statute of limitations challenge, noting the conspirators' efforts to prevent discovery of the crime. The defendants, including two policemen, were convicted under federal RICO charges for corruption offenses, such as accepting bribes and plotting to murder the attorney's wife. The judge in a similar case accepted bribes to influence criminal cases and obstructed justice to conceal the conspiracy. The statute of limitations had expired on the bribery charges, but the judge was convicted of RICO conspiracy based on obstruction of justice predicates. The defendants, including two policemen, were convicted under federal RICO charges for corruption offenses. The judge in a similar case accepted bribes to influence criminal cases and obstructed justice to conceal the conspiracy. Despite the statute of limitations expiring on the bribery charges, the judge was convicted of a RICO conspiracy based on obstruction of justice predicates. The appellate court argued that the conspiracy's main criminal objective was never 'finally attained' as long as the judge remained on the bench, making concealment an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy's main objectives. The statute of limitations does not bar extension for acts of concealment within a conspiracy. If concealment was an initial object of the plot or a RICO violation, the statute of limitations would not apply. The investigation began in 2001 and ended in 2006, with events dating back to December 16, 1993. The investigation began in 2001 and ended in July 2006. The Report interviewed commanding officers and indicted individual officers, with consistent statements. The Report suggests challenges in dispelling statute of limitation issues for federal prosecution. The Police Violence group submitted information on torture incidents by detectives at Detective Area 2 to the United States Attorney, but prosecution was declined due to statute of limitations. Assistant Public Defender Joseph M. Grump identified over 25 cases of abuse, but prosecution was again declined for the same reason. The Department of Justice reopened the matter, but prosecution was declined once more. Persons seeking prosecution of police officers met with the Attorney General. The investigation by the Civil Rights Section of the Justice Department into torture incidents by detectives at Detective Area 2 was closed in December 2001 due to the statute of limitations."
