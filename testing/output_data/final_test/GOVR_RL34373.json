The order emphasizes transparency in earmark origin and purpose, requiring them to be included in bills voted on by Congress. Executive agencies are directed not to use funds based on earmarks from non-statutory sources unless required by law. The executive order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 aims to reduce wasteful government spending on earmarks by emphasizing transparency and restricting the use of funds from non-statutory sources by executive agencies unless required by law. An \"agency\" is defined as an executive agency under title 5 of the United States Code, excluding the Government Accountability Office. An \"earmark\" in the order refers to funds provided by Congress for projects, programs, or grants that bypass merit-based decision-making. The executive order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 aims to reduce wasteful government spending on earmarks by emphasizing transparency and restricting the use of funds from non-statutory sources by executive agencies unless required by law. The order identifies four duties of agency heads relating to earmarks, directing them to ensure that funds allocation decisions are based on the text of laws and not on non-statutory statements or views of Congress. The executive order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 aims to reduce wasteful government spending on earmarks by emphasizing transparency and restricting the use of funds from non-statutory sources by executive agencies unless required by law. It directs agencies to base funding decisions on authorized, transparent statutory criteria and merit-based decision-making, and not to consider the views of Congress unless in writing to ensure compliance with the order. The executive order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 emphasizes transparency and restricts the use of funds on earmarks. Written communications recommending earmark spending must be made public within 30 days, unless directed otherwise by the agency head. Agency heads must implement the policy outlined in the executive order and provide information about earmarks to the OMB Director. The executive order signed by President George W. Bush in 2008 emphasizes transparency and restricts the use of funds on earmarks. Agency heads must provide information about earmarks to the OMB Director as requested. The order is to be implemented in a manner consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not create any enforceable rights against the United States or its agencies. In his 2008 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush announced an executive order to address congressional earmarks, which he described as special interest projects inserted into bills without debate. He called on Congress to reduce the number and cost of earmarks, threatening to veto any appropriations bill that did not comply. The executive order directed federal agencies to disregard any earmarks not voted on by Congress, emphasizing the need for transparency and public debate on funding decisions. The President's authority to control executive branch activity via executive order, as outlined in Executive Order 13,457, could significantly impact congressional inclusion of spending directives. This raises questions about the President's power to issue executive orders, derived from constitutional and statutory authority. The President has the authority to issue executive orders and proclamations, which have been used by every President since the beginning of the Republic. These instruments, if issued under valid authority and published, can have the force of law. However, the validity of an executive order must be analyzed to ensure it aligns with constitutional and statutory provisions. The Supreme Court's framework for analyzing the validity of an executive order was established in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. The Court invalidated President Truman's executive order to seize steel mills during the Korean War, stating that the President's power to execute laws does not make him a lawmaker. Justice Black emphasized that presidential authority must come from Congress or the Constitution, and as neither authorized the seizure, it was deemed a legislative act. The Supreme Court in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer ruled that President Truman's executive order to seize steel mills was unconstitutional, as Congress had rejected seizure as a means to settle labor disputes. The Court emphasized the separation of powers doctrine and the exclusive lawmaking power of Congress. Justice Jackson's concurrence established a tri-partite scheme for analyzing presidential actions in relation to constitutional and congressional authority. Justice Jackson's tri-partite scheme analyzes the validity of presidential actions in relation to constitutional and congressional authority. The first category focuses on presidential actions in line with congressional authority, granting maximum authority. The second category deals with situations where Congress has not granted or denied authority, leading to a zone of uncertainty. The third category addresses instances where presidential action conflicts with congressional authority. In cases where presidential action conflicts with Congress, the President's power is limited to their own constitutional powers. Justice Jackson found that President Truman's seizure of steel mills lacked authorization from Congress, making it invalid under all categories of analysis. Justice Jackson concluded that President Truman's actions in seizing steel mills lacked authorization from Congress, endangering the constitutional equilibrium. Executive Order 13,457 appears to fall within accepted presidential authority, despite potential policy issues regarding agency control over non-statutory earmarks. President Reagan's Executive Order 12,291 centralized control over agency rulemaking through cost-benefit analyses and a review procedure delegated to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. This move sparked immediate controversy and criticism for being anti-regulatory and unconstitutional. The Reagan Administration's Executive Order 12,291 centralized control over agency rulemaking, sparking controversy for being anti-regulatory and unconstitutional. Despite concerns, subsequent Administrations have continued and modified this review scheme, leading to widespread acceptance of presidential authority in agency rulemaking. The implicit acquiescence of Congress and the courts regarding the constitutionality of Executive Order 12,291 and its successors indicates that a President may utilize executive orders to exert centralized control over executive branch activity. Executive Order 13,457 directs agencies to base spending decisions on laws rather than legislative history documents or other congressional language. The Supreme Court in Lincoln v. Vigil acknowledged that language in legislative history documents does not legally bind agencies unless enacted in the text of a statute. Appropriations law states that when Congress appropriates lump sum amounts without restrictions, it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions. Indications in committee reports and legislative history do not establish legal requirements on agencies. The Supreme Court has ruled that language in legislative history documents does not legally bind agencies unless enacted in the text of a statute. Appropriations law states that lump sum appropriations without restrictions do not impose legally binding restrictions on agencies. Committee reports and legislative history do not establish legal requirements on agencies. Agencies must have flexibility to shift funds within appropriation accounts for unforeseen developments and changing requirements. Congress can limit agency discretion by including restrictions in operative statutes. The Supreme Court has emphasized that legislative history does not legally bind agencies unless included in the text of a statute. Courts cannot enforce principles solely from legislative history without a statutory reference point. The Comptroller General distinguishes between statutory restrictions and conditions that are legally binding in appropriations. Congress recognizes the importance of maintaining executive flexibility in shifting funds within lump sums for agencies to make necessary adjustments. While funds are expected to be spent according to budget estimates and committee reports, Congress may choose not to impose specific restrictions as a matter of law to preserve spending flexibility. Agencies are expected to comply with congressional expectations for spending. The Comptroller General explains that Congress uses explicit statutory language to impose legally binding restrictions on agency funds. There is a developed accommodation between Congress and the executive branch regarding appropriation process flexibility, with funds typically appropriated in lump sums based on mutual understandings. These understandings are not usually made part of the appropriation provisions enacted. The Supreme Court and the Comptroller General have warned agencies about disregarding directives in legislative history documents, as it may lead to political consequences. Congress sometimes includes restrictions in legislative history documents instead of statutory text to allow agencies flexibility in allocating funds. Ignoring congressional expectations can have serious implications for agencies. The Comptroller General emphasized that agencies must not ignore legislative history directives, as it can strain relations with Congress. Executive Order 13,457 limits agency heads' discretion in funding earmarks mentioned in legislative history but not in statutory text. The executive order aims to restrict agency heads from funding earmarks mentioned in legislative history but not in statutory text, promoting transparency and merit-based decision-making. Congress has options to either comply with the order or challenge it by explicitly including earmarks in statutes. The executive order restricts agency funding for earmarks not in statutory text, promoting transparency. Congress can comply or challenge by explicitly including earmarks in statutes. The Technology Center was established by Public Law 109-115, requiring agencies to expend funds in accordance with the joint explanatory statement. The directive legally binds agencies to follow the statement. In Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of Congress's clear intent in statutory construction. The executive order on earmarks promotes transparency by restricting agency funding for earmarks not in statutory text. The executive order on earmarks restricts agency funding for non-statutory earmarks, with potential congressional options to countermand the order. Congress could enact language to nullify the order or deny funds for its enforcement, as seen in past instances of revoking executive orders. During President Clinton's term, Congress revoked an executive order related to a fetal tissue bank. The legitimacy of this revocation was clear due to the speculative basis of the President's authority. However, revoking the earmarks executive order could lead to a significant confrontation over presidential authority. The issuance of Executive Order 13,457 is based on the principle that agencies are not required to fund earmarks not in statutory text. It establishes a uniform policy in the executive branch and imposes duties on agency heads for implementation. The order may impact the traditional dynamic between executive and legislative practices regarding nonstatutory earmarks. The executive order on nonstatutory earmarks governs agency practice and falls within presidential authority. Courts recognize that earmarks without statutory basis have no legal effect. Congress can address the order by including earmarks in statutes or referencing them in legislative history. The impact of the order on agency practice remains uncertain. The executive order on nonstatutory earmarks may have more political than legal significance for agency practice."
