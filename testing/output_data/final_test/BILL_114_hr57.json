    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equal Rights and Access for the Women of South Sudan Act\". Despite the 2011 referendum for secession that established the independent state of South Sudan, South Sudanese women continue to face human rights violations. US support is crucial for sustaining the progress made by South Sudanese women since gaining independence in 2011. The US has provided significant emergency relief and humanitarian aid to South Sudan, but long-term investments in development and reconstruction are needed. Inadequate healthcare has led to high maternal and infant mortality rates in the country. South Sudan has one of the highest maternal mortality rates globally, with 80% of women and girls being illiterate. Efforts are being made to integrate women's equality into the nation-building process through internal aid and local women's organizations. Additional support, such as inclusion in the legislative assembly, is helping to incorporate women into the new regime. Women in South Sudan are actively promoting peace across conflict lines. Adequate security is crucial for women and girls to exercise their rights and participate in development programs. United States support reinforces these efforts. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO UNITED STATES ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH SUDAN. Activities carried out by the United States in South Sudan must comply with specific requirements related to the governance of the country. These requirements include incorporating perspectives from South Sudanese women's organizations, promoting the inclusion of women in legislative bodies, and upholding women's rights during the government's transition. The United States must ensure women's rights and representation in South Sudan's government transition. Post-conflict activities should prioritize funding and support for local organizations, especially women's groups, to ensure effectiveness and sustainability. Encourage US organizations receiving funds to partner with South Sudanese-led organizations, provide financial resources and assistance. Support Ministry of Women's Affairs, promote women-centered economic programs, increase women's access to assets, and provide long-term financial assistance. Provide long-term financial assistance for education and health infrastructure in South Sudan, integrate education and training for former combatants with economic development programs, assist in rehabilitating children affected by conflict, and support educational efforts to increase awareness and remove landmines. With respect to landmines and trafficking, programs in South Sudan include removal of landmines, services for disabled individuals, prevention of trafficking, victim assistance, and prosecution of traffickers. Training for military and police in South Sudan includes emphasis on women's rights, consultation with women's organizations, and addressing violations of women's rights. In South Sudan, efforts are made to provide relief, resettlement, and repatriation for refugees and internally displaced persons. Steps are taken to ensure women receive food aid, shelter, and healthcare services, and to protect women and children from sexual exploitation in refugee camps. Children in refugee camps are protected from sexual exploitation, and efforts are made to ensure refugees and internally displaced persons can return to their place of origin voluntarily and safely, without coercion. SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The President must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of the Act's enactment and annually thereafter, documenting progress in implementing section 3 requirements, with data disaggregated by sex."
