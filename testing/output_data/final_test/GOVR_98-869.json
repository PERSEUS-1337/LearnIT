    "content": "Hypoxia in a marine environment occurs seasonally when dissolved oxygen levels fall below 2-3 milligrams per liter. This low oxygen concentration can lead to respiratory difficulties for fish species and mortality for less tolerant marine animals. Essential habitat can be destroyed, leading to the development of a \"dead zone\" with little marine life. Recovery of marine ecosystems after a hypoxic event is not well studied. Decreased dissolved oxygen levels in marine environments can result from natural eutrophication, where nutrients and sunlight stimulate algal growth, depleting oxygen as organic matter decomposes. Hypoxia is more common in coastal waters with stratified layers due to temperature or salinity differences. Human activities can accelerate eutrophication, leading to marine dead zones with little life. Eutrophication, accelerated by human activities, leads to hypoxia in coastal areas. Upwelled ocean waters along the western coast of the Americas support massive algal blooms, causing hypoxic zones. Human-induced eutrophication results from non-point and point sources of nutrients, such as runoff from lawns, sewage plants, and industrial emissions. Hypoxic zones often occur where rivers rich in nutrients enter the ocean, leading to decreased oxygen levels in marine environments. Hypoxia in estuaries and coastal oceans is caused by the two-layer system created by the less dense fresh water flowing over the salt water. Algal growth peaks in surface waters a month after river discharge, with hypoxic bottom water following. Human activities increasing nutrient loading can intensify hypoxic events, but storms and tides can help dissipate hypoxia. The impact of hypoxic events on U.S. coastal ecosystems is still uncertain but is a growing concern. The impact of hypoxic events on U.S. coastal ecosystems is a growing concern. Federal agencies like USGS, NOAA, and EPA are involved in analyzing the issue. Legislation has been enacted to provide funding for research and monitoring. Dead zones with depleted oxygen levels have been recorded in various parts of the world. The frequency and intensity of coastal dead zones with depleted oxygen levels are increasing rapidly, affecting marine life. Hypoxia is becoming more common in shallow coastal areas and estuaries, as well as in open ocean oxygen minimum zones. In the United States, 21% to 43% of estuaries have experienced hypoxic events, with the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River plume being heavily impacted. In the Mid-Atlantic region, 13 out of 22 estuaries have also experienced hypoxic/anoxic events. In the United States, coastal dead zones with depleted oxygen levels are increasing rapidly, affecting marine life. Hypoxia is more common in shallow coastal areas and estuaries, as well as in open ocean oxygen minimum zones. The Gulf of Mexico region experiences the highest rate of hypoxic/anoxic events, with almost 85% of its 38 estuaries affected. The North Atlantic region is less prone to hypoxic/anoxic events due to low nutrient input and high tidal flushing, but areas near high population density do experience oxygen depletion. In the Pacific region, hypoxia occurs near population centers or in specific areas. The hypoxic zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico is the largest observed in the estuarine and coastal regions of the western hemisphere. It extends westward from the mouth of the Mississippi River to the upper Texas coast and is influenced by the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River plume. The size of the hypoxic zone is mainly predicted by the nitrate-nitrogen load in the two months before the mid-summer mapping cruise, occurring from May to September. The hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico varies in size annually, reaching its largest in 2002 at 22,000 square kilometers. In 2007, it covered about 20,500 square kilometers, with a second smaller zone of 4,500 square kilometers off Texas. During summer, calm seas maintain a stratified barrier between surface and bottom water layers in the Gulf. Vertical mixing occurs only during weather disturbances like frontal passages, tropical storms, and hurricanes. Increased winds and storms in autumn dissipate the hypoxia in the water column. The dead zone in 1998 extended from near shore to deeper waters off the Mississippi River delta. Nutrient enrichment from the Mississippi watershed is a major factor in hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Studies show that nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers have significantly increased since 1960, leading to algal growth and the creation of a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Fertilizer runoff from upriver agricultural sources is identified as the main contributor to nutrient loading in the rivers, with 56% coming from fertilizer runoff and 25% from animal manure. Sediment core analysis indicates that water productivity has increased and oxygen stress has worsened since the early 1900s, with the most significant changes occurring since the 1950s. The hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico has worsened since the early 1900s, especially since the 1950s due to increased use of commercial fertilizers in the watershed. Studies show a direct relationship between river-born nutrients, phytoplankton production, and Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. Questions remain about the sources of nitrogen, effects of floods on nutrient transport, and nitrogen contribution from coastal land loss. More than 70% of the total nitrogen transported to the Gulf of Mexico by the Mississippi River originates above the confluence of the Ohio. Some scientists suggest focusing on nitrogen runoff in the lower Mississippi basin for more efficient nutrient controls, despite it only contributing 23% of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico. Others argue that nitrogen removal is more effective in small streams than in large rivers. Some farmers dispute that agricultural practices are the main cause of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone, arguing they aim to retain nutrients on their land to avoid waste. However, around half of applied nutrients are lost to water and air, costing approximately $750. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone results in excess nitrogen entering the Mississippi River, impacting fisheries and causing declines in shrimp yields. Hypoxia reduces essential habitat, increases stress on aquatic ecosystems, and may decrease biological diversity. The Gulf of Mexico dead zone causes severe hypoxia, leading to crowding of marine life and potential delays in shrimp migration. This may force fishing vessels to change their fishing patterns, increasing expenses and possibly driving marginal operators out of business. Other impacts on Louisiana fisheries include localized overfishing, habitat damage, shellfish mortality, and decreased future production. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducted research projects in the northern Gulf of Mexico to understand the effects of hypoxia on fishery resources. A symposium and workshop in 2007 focused on evaluating the impact of hypoxia on commercially and recreationally important living resources. Hypoxic conditions in Chesapeake Bay were attributed to nutrient inputs from runoff, leading to algal blooms and low oxygen levels in the water. In 2006, hypoxic conditions in the bay were reduced due to lower spring rainfall, resulting in less nutrient input. Unlike estuarine dead zones caused by land runoff, the Oregon dead zone forms along the open coast where coastal winds drive nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor waters onto the continental shelf, fueling phytoplankton blooms. In 2006, the Oregon coastal dead zone was significantly larger, thicker, and lower in oxygen concentration than in previous years, extending along the ocean floor from Cape Perpetua in the south to Cascade Head in the north. The 2006 Oregon coastal dead zone saw a complete disappearance of fish and near-complete mortalities of benthic invertebrates due to changes in ocean conditions. Factors contributing to the severity of the dead zone included declines in offshore source-water oxygen content, shifts in coastal wind patterns enhancing upwelling currents, and the persistence of low-oxygen water and phytoplankton blooms. The extent of the developing hypoxic event in 2007 was unknown, with a potential dead zone also forming off the coast of Washington State. NOAA initiated the Nutrient Enhanced Coastal Ocean Productivity (NECOP) program in 1989 to study the effects of nutrient discharges on U.S. coastal waters, finding a link between nutrient input, enhanced primary production, and hypoxic events in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Better understanding and consistent monitoring of hypoxic phenomena are deemed necessary to manage the social and economic effects of ecosystem changes along the Oregon coast and beyond. In 1995, the Gulf of Mexico Program held a conference to address environmental issues raised in a petition by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. A \"principals group\" was formed to discuss policy actions and science needs, leading to the creation of a Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's Committee on Environment and Natural Resources conducted a Hypoxia Science Assessment to assist in developing policy recommendations. The Plan of Action for addressing hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico was released in January 2001, aiming to reduce the dead zone's area to 5,000 square kilometers by 2015. A 40% reduction in total nitrogen flux is necessary to improve dissolved oxygen concentrations in bottom waters. Strategies focus on voluntary and practical measures to achieve these goals. The action plan for addressing hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico focuses on reducing excess nutrients from watersheds through voluntary, practical, and cost-effective strategies. Progress reassessment began in 2005, with a key consideration being the level and duration of necessary nutrient reduction. While some believe the issue may take years to resolve, others suggest that improved agricultural practices could yield immediate benefits. Chemical fertilizers and soil erosion prevention can provide immediate benefits. A model suggests reducing fertilizer use by 12-14% in the Mississippi River basin could decrease nitrogen inputs by 30% without crop production loss. Policy options for modifying agriculture practices are being discussed, with the Clean Water Act seen as a framework for addressing nutrient inputs. Nonpoint-source control programs under \u00a7319 of the Clean Water Act have been initiated in Louisiana and other states to address pollution. Encouraging, funding, and implementing nonpoint-source programs are essential for effective pollution control. Nonpoint-source programs need to be encouraged, funded, and implemented in the Mississippi River watershed. States must identify water-quality-limited segments and establish total maximum daily loads for pollutants not meeting standards. Agricultural research and educational outreach can complement regulatory efforts. Congress addressed the hypoxia problem in 1997 and incorporated provisions into the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998. Title VI of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998, signed into law as P.L. 105-383, authorized appropriations for NOAA to conduct research on hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, and aquatic toxins. In 2004, P.L. 108-456 expanded this authority and reauthorized appropriations through FY2008. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to reauthorize and amend the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, with NOAA requesting $8.9 million for extramural research in FY2008. NOAA has requested $8.9 million for research grants related to harmful algal bloom and hypoxia. Iowa State University's Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture receives an annual research grant for farming practices to reduce water quality impacts. The Missouri Department of Agriculture also receives funding for the Hypoxia Education and Stewardship Project to educate producers about hypoxia and nitrogen reduction practices. The EPA funds research on Gulf of Mexico hypoxia through its Gulf Breeze Laboratory, encouraging practices to reduce nitrogen loss."
