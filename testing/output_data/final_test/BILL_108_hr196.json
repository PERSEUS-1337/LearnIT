    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Slave Memorial Act\". The Congress acknowledges the historical enslavement of Africans in the United States and the economic exploitation of slave labor. Africans were treated as property upon arrival and provided free labor for over 250 years, contributing to the nation's agricultural prosperity. Slavery in the United States caused African Americans to suffer enormous damages and losses, including the loss of human dignity, liberty, careers, income, and opportunity. It denied them the fruits of their labor and was an immoral deprivation of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Despite the achievements of African Americans in overcoming slavery, the nation failed to grant all Americans equal rights. Many African American slaves fought in wars for national freedoms, knowing they would never enjoy those freedoms. African American art, history, and culture reflect experiences of slavery and freedom, with struggles for recognition and dignity. There is a need for institutions and monuments to promote understanding of African American heritage and enhance racial harmony. On June 19, 1865, the last group of slaves were informed of their freedom, marking the historic abolition of slavery. Congress should recognize this day, express regret to African Americans, and support reconciliation efforts. SEC. 3. NATIONAL SLAVE MEMORIAL.
