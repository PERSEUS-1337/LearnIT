The management of cyber ranges and facilities within the Department of Defense is being amended to include a comprehensive list established by the Principal Cyber Advisor. This list will identify whether each range and facility is a 'cyber range' as defined by the legislation. The Principal Cyber Advisor will submit a list of cyber and information technology ranges and facilities to the congressional defense committees within one year of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The Advisor will determine whether each range and facility should be centrally managed on a case by case basis. The Secretary of Defense will establish a coordinating entity to manage cyber and information technology ranges and facilities designated by the Principal Cyber Advisor. The head of the entity established under the Secretary of Defense shall manage cyber and information technology ranges and facilities, coordinate scheduling, provide guidance on integration opportunities, and assist military departments and National Guard. The National Guard and the Department gain access to cyber and information technology ranges and facilities. The head of the entity must submit annual reports on cost reduction opportunities and improvements for integration and coordination. An initial report on the status and integration must be submitted within one year of the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The initial report focuses on the status, integration, and usage of cyber and information technology ranges and facilities for testing, training, and developing software and personnel within the Department of Defense. It includes defining terms and establishing a list of common terms. The Principal Cyber Advisor is tasked with establishing and maintaining a list of terms and definitions related to cyber matters to enhance coordination among military departments and federal agencies.
