    "content": "Widespread flooding in Pakistan in late July 2010 affected over 20 million people, with over 1.9 million households destroyed or damaged. The humanitarian impact was significant, with approximately 2,000 deaths and over 3,000 injuries. The flooding generated concern globally due to its security consequences and economic impact. The flooding in Pakistan in 2010 affected more people than the combined impact of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2005 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, and the 2005 South Asia earthquake. The death toll rose after the floodwaters receded, with various health issues reported. The government set up a Disaster Management Council to oversee relief efforts, but faced challenges in donations, access to victims, and security concerns. The flooding in Pakistan in 2010 caused difficulties in accessing victims, had a large geographical extent, and raised security concerns. Medium and long-term consequences included lost livelihoods for farmers, diminished food supply, increased food prices, and damaged infrastructure. Rebuilding housing and stabilizing the situation will test public confidence in government assistance efforts. The 2010 floods in Pakistan worsened existing U.S. concerns about regional terrorism, stability in Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation, and human rights. The impact on the Pakistani government's stability and ability to control militants is a key issue. Congressional interest includes humanitarian aid, reconstruction costs, aid composition to secure Pakistan's support in Afghanistan, and disabling Taliban in Pakistan. The 2010 floods in Pakistan exacerbated U.S. concerns about regional terrorism, stability in Afghanistan, and nuclear proliferation. Public opinion surveys show a decline in worries about extremist groups taking control of Pakistan, with a majority viewing the United States unfavorably. However, there is an opportunity for the U.S. to improve its perception through humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts post-floods. Efforts to address flooding in Pakistan include additional U.S. emergency relief funding, promoting contributions from other nations, supporting the Pakistan economy, debt relief, and promoting aid and investments. Heavy rains in July 2010 caused flash floods in Pakistan. The heavy rains in July 2010 caused downpours that continued into August, leading to flooding in Pakistan. The Indus River and its tributaries breached levees, affecting rural and urban populations. Floodwaters reached 40 times normal levels, causing new flooding in southern provinces like Sindh. Despite intentional levee breaks to protect urban centers, breaches still occurred in areas like Thatta city. The flooding covered a large geographical area and affected multiple provinces, with varying timing of effects. In northern regions, affected populations have begun rebuilding, while challenges persist in other areas. In November 2010, stagnant floodwaters in Sindh province are hindering recovery efforts, with nearly 7.0 million people affected. The government is coordinating disaster response at various levels, with concerns about food, shelter, water, sanitation, health, and livelihood persisting. The Pakistani government and international community, along with the NDMA, are working together to mobilize relief goods for flood-affected areas. The military has been the primary responder, evacuating people and distributing supplies, while the civilian government's response has been criticized for being weak and lacking coordination. The Pakistani government is facing criticism for its response to aid flood victims, with some defending the agency's lack of preparedness. Debit cards are being distributed to over 900,000 families to help them rebuild, with each head of household receiving $1,150 in three disbursements. Efforts are being made to include female-headed households in the process. The United States is the largest donor for relief efforts in Pakistan, with funds being redirected from civilian economic development assistance. The United States is providing $561.9 million for Pakistan relief and recovery, with additional support in the form of in-kind civilian and military aid. Prior to the flooding emergency, humanitarian aid was also provided for landslides, conflict-affected displaced people, and earthquake expenses. The United States is considering redirecting funds from economic development to flood relief efforts in Pakistan. USAID is leading humanitarian response efforts, with military helicopters and planes delivering supplies. Mobile medical teams are providing healthcare services due to the destruction of health facilities by the floods. The floods in Pakistan caused extensive damage, leading to the creation of a Pakistan Relief Fund by the Department of State. Private sector donations reached $8.39 million by early September 2010. Donations can be made through the Department of State or USAID websites, or by texting \"FLOOD\" to 27722 in the United States. Other countries, such as China and the European Union, have also provided significant aid for flood relief efforts in Pakistan. The European Union has provided about $450.9 million in cash and in-kind aid for flood relief efforts in Pakistan, with contributions from various countries like Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Australia, Canada, and India. The humanitarian implications of the flooding in Pakistan are significant. The United Nations, in coordination with the Government of Pakistan, released The Pakistan Initial Floods Emergency Response Plan (PIFERP) seeking $460 million for immediate relief needs. The plan covers 12 humanitarian clusters including water, health, shelter, agriculture, food, and education to address the flooding's impact on displaced populations. The United Nations and the Government of Pakistan released The Pakistan Initial Floods Emergency Response Plan (PIFERP) seeking $460 million for immediate relief needs. The plan covers 12 humanitarian clusters including water, health, shelter, agriculture, food, and education to address the flooding's impact on displaced populations. The revised U.N. plan seeks $1.9 billion for various sectors to be disbursed from August 2010 to August 2011, with coordinating entities listed for each cluster. Poverty and hunger were widespread in Pakistan before the recent flooding, particularly in rural areas where nearly two-thirds of the population and 80% of the country's poor reside. Women in Pakistan have the lowest socio-economic status in South Asia. The recent global food price and economic crises of 2008-2009 worsened poverty and food security issues in Pakistan, affecting women and children who are among the most vulnerable populations. FAO estimated that an additional 17 million people became food-insecure due to food price inflation, with the poorest households spending over 70% of their incomes on food. Before the flooding in 2010, about 60 million people were already food-insecure in Pakistan. The extent of damage from the flooding is likely to impact national crop production and food security for millions of people. The World Food Programme (WFP) is leading efforts to provide food assistance to flood victims in Pakistan, aiming to stabilize food consumption for six million people per month over the next year. They are working with over 30 NGOs to reach between 125,000 and 150,000 people daily, with a goal of reaching over six million people with food aid in the next 12 months. Many communities are inaccessible by land. WFP is providing food aid to six million people over the next 12 months, using mules and helicopters to reach inaccessible areas. They need $600 million for food from August 2010 to July 2011, with $255 million received so far. Health risks from flooding include water-borne and vector-borne diseases due to compromised clean water and mosquito breeding grounds. Children are at risk in flood-affected areas in Pakistan due to population displacement, overcrowding, and limited disease control. Health services and medicines are crucial, with 514 health facilities damaged. Women face challenges accessing reproductive health services, and poor hygiene and sanitation increase health risks. Approximately 3.5 million flood survivors have access to contaminated water. Over 6 million flood survivors in Pakistan received medical consultations for conditions like acute diarrhea, respiratory infections, skin diseases, and suspected malaria. Cholera poses a threat, with 99 confirmed cases reported. The WHO is treating cases of acute watery diarrhea as potential cholera. Without clean water and addressing environmental hazards, up to 1.5 million cases of diarrheal diseases and 140,000 cases of cholera could occur in the next three months. Concerns over various diseases like malaria, dengue fever, CCHF, measles, and polio, as well as malnutrition among children and pregnant women, are increasing. Displaced populations returning home face higher health risks due to limited healthcare facilities. Mental health care for trauma survivors is a priority. Displaced populations in Pakistan, affected by flooding and previous displacements, are facing additional challenges with infrastructure damage. The recent flooding in Afghanistan has caused extensive damage to infrastructure and households, displacing a large number of people. Nearly 90% of Afghan refugees are living in flood-affected areas, adding to the challenges of resettlement. The government is struggling to register internally displaced people, with obstacles hindering a comprehensive tally. Many have been forced to seek shelter in schools and makeshift sites, with a significant need for emergency shelter identified by the United Nations. Concerns have been raised about potential political unrest due to the displacement of thousands of people. The recent floods in Afghanistan have caused extensive damage and displacement, with concerns about political unrest. In Karachi, thousands of ethnic Sindhis displaced by the floods are arriving, adding a new element to the political dynamic. While some welcome them, others warn of potential violence. Comparisons to the earthquake disaster in Haiti are suggested, but differences in magnitude and affected populations make them tenuous. Pakistan and Haiti experienced megadisasters in 2010, with varying impacts on population displacement and casualties. Relief operations were implemented in both Pakistan and Haiti following natural disasters, with aid donations being slower to materialize for Pakistan compared to Haiti. Approximately $3.3 billion was raised for Haiti, while only $1.6 billion was raised for Pakistan. Donor response differed between the two disasters, with $157 dollars raised per affected Haitian compared to $15 dollars per affected Pakistani. The difference in donor response between the Haiti earthquake and the flooding in Pakistan can be attributed to various factors. The immediate and visible tragedy of the earthquake in Haiti, along with extensive media coverage, led to a higher number of deaths and injuries, prompting greater donations. In contrast, the slower onset of the flooding in Pakistan, limited media coverage, association with Islamic extremists, concerns over government corruption, and oversight of donations may have hindered donation efforts. The difference in U.S. donations between Haiti and Pakistan may be due to proximity to the United States and donor fatigue. Lessons learned from the Haiti earthquake response could be applied to the flooding in Pakistan despite differences in disasters. Aid delivery in Haiti was criticized for being slow due to weakened government capacity and logistical challenges. The influx of massive aid into a city largely destroyed by an earthquake led to delays and difficulties on the ground. The U.N. Inter-Agency Standing Committee noted a coordination deficit initially but highlighted improvements over time. The United States and other donors collaborated with various organizations through the U.N. cluster system to provide relief in Haiti. Relief activities were organized into twelve clusters, including emergency shelter, food, and health, to ensure effective coordination. Lessons learned from the earthquake response in Haiti include engaging more with civil society, local authorities, and displaced populations for better understanding of the operating context and sustainable assistance delivery; working with various actors outside the immediate humanitarian context, such as the private sector; better engagement with the government and civil society partners; providing cash for relief and buying locally when possible; creating transitional shelter for permanent dwellings; and starting recovery efforts promptly. Lessons learned from the earthquake response in Haiti emphasize the importance of engaging with civil society, local authorities, and displaced populations for better assistance delivery. It is crucial to work with various actors outside the immediate humanitarian context, such as the private sector, and to provide cash for relief and buy locally when possible. Transitional shelter should be created for permanent dwellings, and recovery efforts should start promptly. Concerns about bureaucratic red tape, the capacity of the Haitian government, the role of the United States, and coordination issues among the international community persist. These challenges also apply to Pakistan, where responding to disasters is complicated by a lack of viable infrastructure for transportation. The floods in Pakistan are expected to have a long-term negative impact on development, with significant damage to infrastructure and agriculture. The United Nations, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank are assessing the needs, estimating recovery and reconstruction costs at $9.7 billion. This section discusses potential implications of the flooding on various sectors in Pakistan. The flooding in Pakistan has caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including energy, roads, bridges, railways, schools, and health facilities. The estimated cost of reconstruction is $9.7 billion, with severe damage in northern regions like the Swat Valley. The rebuilding process is expected to be challenging in terms of difficulty, time, and expense. The flooding in Pakistan caused significant damage to infrastructure, with estimated losses of $5.1 billion to $7.1 billion in building and transportation infrastructure, and $2.12 billion in trade disruptions. Floods also impacted electricity, oil, and gas facilities, closing down 3 gigawatts of power generation capacity. Damage to generation facilities and transmission infrastructure led to output reductions at refining and natural gas facilities. The floods in Pakistan caused extensive damage to infrastructure, including electricity, oil, and gas facilities. While most energy production and transportation capacity has been restored, the country's pre-existing energy problems have been exacerbated. The cost of recovering from flood damage hinders efforts to improve electricity supply, despite previous pledges of financial aid. Challenges in rebuilding infrastructure include prioritizing reconstruction actions, availability of materials and expertise, and oversight of construction. Agriculture is a key sector in Pakistan, contributing 23% to GDP and employing 43% of the labor force. Arable crops, livestock, and fishing and forestry make up the agricultural GDP. Pakistan has two main growing seasons, Rabi and Kharif, with the majority of the cropped area being irrigated. Nearly 80% of Pakistan's cropped area is irrigated, producing 90% of the country's farm output. Severe losses were suffered in the agriculture sector due to flooding in July and August 2010, mainly affecting the Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Baluchistan provinces. Around 80% of the flood-affected population relies on agriculture for their livelihood, with significant crop, livestock, and grain stock losses. Damage assessments estimate that about 3.3 million hectares of standing crops were affected. Approximately 1.3 million hectares of standing crops, including rice, maize, cotton, sugarcane, fruit orchards, and vegetables, have been damaged or lost completely due to flooding in Pakistan. The cereal crops of the current Kharif season, planted in May/July, account for about 35% of the annual national cereal production. Reports suggest that up to 25% of the cotton crop has been affected, leading to a potential shift from being a net exporter to an importer of cotton in 2010. Losses in important export crops like cotton, sugarcane, and rice will negatively impact the country's trade balance and household incomes. The floods in Pakistan have severely impacted agricultural production, particularly in staple cereals like wheat. The damage will have long-term implications for food security in the country. Wheat, which is a main staple providing 35% of per capita calorie requirement, was affected despite a record production of 23.9 million tonnes in the previous season. The flood waters in Pakistan have caused serious losses of wheat stocks at the household level, impacting food security. Estimates suggest that 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of wheat may have been damaged. This could also affect the planting of the upcoming Rabi season, as seeds, agricultural inputs, and irrigation facilities have been lost. Additionally, Pakistan's ability to export agricultural commodities will be negatively impacted. The flood waters in Pakistan have caused serious losses of wheat stocks, impacting food security and potentially affecting the upcoming Rabi season planting. Requests to export excess wheat stockpiles generated outrage from aid agencies, leading to a ban on all wheat exports in September 2010. FAO is working with WFP and IFAD to provide technical assistance for agricultural rehabilitation and livestock support in flood-affected provinces and across Pakistan. FAO is providing agricultural inputs to farmers in Pakistan for the spring planting season, reaching over 532,000 families for the Rabi wheat season. Global agricultural assistance efforts for Pakistan post-flooding have been underfunded. USAID committed $16 million to FAO for agricultural inputs in Balochistan Province, benefiting about 680,000 family members with wheat seed, vegetable seed, and fertilizer packages. The floods in Pakistan have affected densely populated livestock areas, leading to the death of over 1.2 million livestock and 6 million poultry. FAO found that 67,000 livestock have died, and 600,000 are malnourished. Millions of surviving animals are facing feed shortages. The floods in Pakistan have caused severe feed shortages for millions of surviving animals, threatening generations of livestock. FAO is prioritizing the health of the surviving population by providing supplementary feed and veterinary support. Economic assessments estimate flood losses at $12-15 billion. The floods in Pakistan have caused significant economic damage, with estimates of flood losses at $9.7 billion. The flooding has led to soaring food prices, increased government expenditures on relief efforts, and predictions of zero real GDP growth and 25% inflation in the current fiscal year. Pakistan's consumer price index increased by 15.7% in September 2010, with forecasts of 2%-3% real GDP growth for the year. Pakistan's real GDP growth is expected to be 2%-3% this fiscal year, down from 4.1% last year. The country's agricultural sector is crucial for both domestic economy and exports, with rice, cotton, and cotton yarn being major contributors. A slow recovery in agricultural production could lead to a balance of payments crisis. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves were $17.1 billion as of October 15, 2010. The economic impact of the floods in Pakistan includes estimated costs of up to $15 billion for repairing infrastructure. The World Bank and ADB have reported $9.7 billion in damages. The pace of agricultural sector recovery, displaced population status, and international support will affect Pakistan's economic progress. The ADB and World Bank have offered loans totaling $3 billion for reconstruction. The Friends of Democratic Pakistan discussed ways to boost the economy post-flooding. The Friends of Democratic Pakistan proposed ways to strengthen the economy after the flooding, including trade concessions, opening EU markets, and expanding the tax base. Pakistan's Finance Minister met with the IMF for the fifth review of loans, totaling $7.65 billion approved in 2008 and $3.22 billion in 2009. These loans were to be paid in seven installments by November 2010. Pakistan's loan agreement with the IMF included fiscal and monetary policy changes to lower the fiscal deficit. Pakistan failed to meet several IMF conditionalities, leading to pressure from the IMF. The fiscal deficit increased to 6.2% of GDP, exceeding the IMF target of 5.1%. Pakistan requested relaxation of conditionalities and the release of the remaining IMF loans worth $2.6 billion. The IMF released $2.6 billion in loans to Pakistan but delayed the next tranche. An emergency loan of $451 million was provided for flood relief. Pakistan must implement economic reforms like the reformed general sales tax and reduce subsidies by December 13, 2010, to access the remaining $1.7 billion. Pakistan government has developed a $7.7 billion reconstruction plan in response to the economic impact of the floods and IMF demands. They plan to provide $3.8 billion, seek $3.4 billion in international assistance, and obtain $500 million from other sources. The fiscal deficit was exacerbated by a 25% increase in defense budget for military operations against the Taliban, with some funding cuts from other areas. Additionally, the government pledged to raise electricity rates by 2.2% per month until July 2011, totaling a 17.6% increase. The IMF denied a deal with Pakistan government on increasing electricity rates. Pakistan's outstanding debt is $55.5 billion, 56% of GDP, with concerns about servicing debts affecting economic recovery. The Obama Administration's strategy towards Pakistan may be hindered by a natural disaster. The Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 authorized $7.5 billion. The Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 authorized $7.5 billion in nonmilitary U.S. assistance to Pakistan for FY2010-FY2014 to bolster institutions and infrastructure. Future funds may be diverted to recovery efforts, impacting capacity-building programs. U.S. interests in countering Islamist militancy and strengthening democratic institutions in Pakistan are threatened by widespread flooding. The circumstances in Pakistan are allowing Taliban militants to regroup, while Islamist charities are aiding in disaster relief efforts to improve their standing. The U.S. government is actively countering this by providing ground response and demonstrating commitment to the Pakistani people. Senator John Kerry emphasized the importance of helping Pakistan, as the weak civilian government in Islamabad faces criticism. The weak civilian government in Islamabad is criticized for its slow response to the disaster, damaging its credibility. The Pakistani military, seen as more capable, has gained public approval for its relief efforts. There are concerns that this could hinder progress towards democracy. The U.S. is providing significant disaster relief assistance, aiming to improve relations with Pakistan. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke is working towards narrowing the trust gap between the two countries. Pakistan's Ambassador Richard Holbrooke is working to improve relations with Pakistan by providing significant disaster relief assistance. However, there is anecdotal evidence that Pakistanis are largely unaware of U.S. aid and do not see tangible benefits from it. Some extremist-run charities are filling gaps in government aid, potentially fueling resentment and distrust. Public opinion surveys show that about half of Pakistani respondents believe the United States gives little to no assistance to their country. Some extremist groups in Pakistan, like Falah-i-Insaniat and Jamaat-ud-Dawa, are providing relief to victims, potentially gaining support. Concerns arise about terrorist organizations like Lashkar-e-Taiba using charity and political wings for malicious activities. Secretary of State Clinton downplays the risk of extremist groups strengthening through relief efforts. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan denounces Western aid and threatens attacks on aid workers. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan denounces Western aid and threatens attacks on aid workers, but no such attacks have been reported. The U.S. military is taking precautions to ensure the safety of its personnel and aid workers in Pakistan. Analysts believe that Pakistan's current government may not survive due to various pressures, including poor government capacity and multiple armed insurgencies. The current national government in Pakistan is facing challenges and doubts about its survival until the end of its term in 2013. President Zardari received criticism for traveling to Europe during devastating floods in the country, leading to perceptions of detachment from the suffering. President Zardari faced criticism for traveling to Europe during devastating floods in Pakistan, causing anger among Pakistanis towards politicians. The response to the floods by the government is seen as a failure, with concerns about the distribution of relief resources to political allies. The political consequences of the floods are uncertain but could have serious implications for democratic forces in the country. The floods in Pakistan have exacerbated tensions between the central and provincial governments, leading to competition for resources. There are allegations of rich landowners in Sindh deliberately allowing levees to burst to protect their crops, causing negative impacts. The political implications of these actions remain unclear. Pakistan's military, historically influential in governance, faced a decline in public image under President-General Pervez Musharraf's rule. However, Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani has successfully restored the army's prestige and withdrawn it from governance, gaining influence through flood relief efforts. Kayani's influence has grown through flood relief efforts, raising concerns for democratic institutions in Pakistan. The U.S. government supports Pakistani democracy, with Prime Minister Gilani ruling out a military takeover. Fears of Islamist militant regrouping post-disaster are widespread. Islamist militant groups may regroup and recover from recent losses despite Pakistani military battles. Reports show militants exploiting the situation with attacks, posing a continued threat. 60,000 army troops diverted to relief efforts, but military claims no impact on fight against militants. President Zardari warns of increased recruitment by \"negative forces\" due to the catastrophe. Foreign Minister Qureshi expresses concerns about food rioting leading to further violence. Foreign Minister Qureshi expresses concerns about food rioting potentially leading to further violence, which some believe could be exploited by known individuals. U.S. officials have refrained from pressuring Pakistan for military operations in FATA, showing confidence in Pakistan's efforts against violent extremism. The focus of counterinsurgency operations remains unchanged despite setbacks caused by flooding, delaying both US and enemy timetables. Independent observers believe that efforts in Pakistan are facing major setbacks due to resource diversion to relief efforts and infrastructure damage. Military gains in Swat Valley are at risk of being lost as key infrastructure remains unusable. The flooding in Pakistan has rendered key infrastructure unusable, leading to delays in resettling displaced citizens and disrupting supply lines for US and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Additionally, the influx of internally displaced persons into Karachi has heightened interethnic tensions in the region. The flooding in Quetta and Islamabad has disrupted transportation routes, causing delays for trucks. While US/NATO operations in Afghanistan are minimally affected, Pentagon officials are concerned about potential long-term stability issues. The Afghan military has provided aid to Pakistani flood relief, improving relations between the two countries. Pakistan has faced severe flooding multiple times in the past, with the current flood affecting millions of people. Extreme precipitation is the main cause of the flooding. The current flooding in Pakistan, caused by extreme precipitation, is likely to be the worst in the country's history in terms of the number of affected citizens and economic damage. The Asian monsoon system plays a significant role in these weather extremes, posing flood risks to areas downstream. Efforts to rebuild and improve resilience to future extreme weather events are crucial, with international aid and experience playing a key role in informing resilient rebuilding strategies. The current flooding in Pakistan is expected to be the worst in the country's history in terms of the number of affected citizens and economic damage. It is unclear if the flooding exceeds previous episodes due to limited data. Studies may reveal if the flood fits within historical extreme events or is an outlier. Climate change may have contributed to the severity of the flooding, as scientists project more frequent and intense weather events due to global warming. Longer time ranges are needed to attribute single weather events to climate change. The IPCC report suggests that attributing single weather events, like the 2010 floods in Pakistan, to global warming requires a longer time range. It projects an increase in precipitation in the Asian monsoon due to man-made global warming, but the role of aerosols complicates this. Detecting a global-warming induced fingerprint in current flooding may be challenging until detailed scientific studies are completed. Even if global warming is identified as a factor, it may not be possible to directly link it to increased deaths, injuries, and economic losses due to other contributing factors. The flooding in Pakistan, exacerbated by existing problems like poverty and depleted infrastructure, is expected to have significant short-term and potential long-term effects on the country. Displaced people are returning to their homes as floodwaters recede, and government officials and aid workers are reporting issues from all affected areas. The direct causality of the floods to climate change impacts is difficult to attribute currently. The flooding in Pakistan is expected to have significant short-term and potential long-term effects. The long-term effects may present challenges to the country in terms of humanitarian toll and strategic concerns, impacting U.S. interests in the region."
