Changes in U.S. production can significantly impact both domestic and global commodity markets. In 2008, there were tight supplies and record high prices in agricultural markets, leading to increased costs for livestock feeders and processors. The past year has seen increased costs for livestock feeders and processors, concerns about food-price inflation, and a global debate on dedicating crops to biofuels production. New concerns arose in June about potential production losses due to weather and floods in the U.S. Corn Belt region. The Corn Belt region in the Midwest, including states like Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota, is a significant producer of corn and soybeans in the US. These states account for a large majority of the country's corn and soybean production. In 2008, the USDA forecasted a record corn crop of 12.3 billion bushels, the second-largest on record, and a soybean production forecast of nearly 3 billion bushels. The USDA's soybean production forecast for 2008 remains unchanged from July, with nearly 3 billion bushels expected, up 15% from 2007. Factors contributing to this include minimal flood-related acreage losses, ideal growing conditions in the Corn Belt boosting corn yield outlook, and a flat soybean production due to late planting and dry conditions in certain regions. The August crop production forecast has alleviated market concerns about flood-related crop losses, despite a significant portion of the corn and soybean crops being planted late. As of early August, a large portion of the 2008 corn and soybean crops were planted late and remain behind historical development rates. USDA estimates show that corn and soybean plants are significantly below the 5-year average in terms of development stages. Market analysts warn of potential weather problems like an early freeze that could further impact yield and production prospects, especially in northern regions where crop development is delayed. USDA's August crop production forecasts incorporate survey data from flood-affected regions and reflect growing conditions as of August 1. USDA conducted re-interviews in mid-July in flood-affected areas to supplement June acreage estimates. Data from these interviews were used in the August 12, 2008, Crop Production and WASDE reports, which estimated 2008 U.S. planted and harvested corn area at 86.977 and 79.290 million acres, respectively. Planted corn acreage revised downward by 350,000 acres, while harvested acreage raised by 350,000 acres. Losses in flood-affected states, gains in states outside flood regions. High market prices encourage farmers to harvest more marginal areas. USDA estimates 2008 U.S. planted soybean acreage revised upward by 250,000 acres, harvested acreage raised by 1,220,000 acres. The USDA's August estimate for 2008 corn yields is 155 bushels per acre, the second largest on record. Excellent weather since late June has boosted the yield outlook. In contrast, soybean yields are estimated at 40.5 bushels per acre, down nearly 2% from last year and the lowest since 2003. Final yields may still vary based on growing conditions. The USDA's August estimate for 2008 corn yields is 155 bushels per acre, the second largest on record. Soybean yields are estimated at 40.5 bushels per acre, down nearly 2% from last year and the lowest since 2003. Late development and dryness in certain regions are impacting the soybean crop. Flood-related crop damage assessments are typically done at the county and state levels. The flood in 2008 caused the loss of about 889,000 acres of corn in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri, representing 1% of the total planted acres. Despite this, projected below-average abandonment rates in other states offset the lost acres. The four major flood-affected states potentially lost 148.2 million bushels of corn production, accounting for 1.2% of the total crop estimate. The USDA announced a bushel crop estimate for soybeans, with nearly 400,000 acres lost in the Corn Belt due to bad weather and flooding. Six major flood-affected states potentially lost 63 million bushels of soybean production, representing 2.1% of the total crop estimate. In 2007 and 2008, late planting, slow crop development, and severe flooding were caused by above-normal rainfall and a cold, wet winter. Iowa experienced record wet conditions, leading to saturated soils and vulnerability to erosion and flooding. Cool weather inhibited evaporation rates, hindering soil drying and impacting corn planting schedules. In Iowa, optimal corn planting dates are between April 20 and May 5, with yields decreasing if planting is delayed. Soybeans should be planted in the last week of April for the southern two-thirds of the state and the first week of May for the northern third. Excessive rainfall and cold temperatures this year delayed corn plantings in the Corn Belt. The late start to planting in the Corn Belt has resulted in only 51% of intended corn area and 11% of intended soybean area being planted by May 11, compared to the 5-year average. This delay has pushed key plant development stages into hotter weeks, making the crops susceptible to heat stress and dryness. By May 27, 88% of intended corn acres and 52% of intended soybean acres had been planted, but there were ongoing delays in plant emergence for both crops. Crop yield concerns were developing by late May due to delays in plant emergence for corn and soybeans. Heavy rains in late May and early June caused widespread flooding across the Corn Belt, damaging prime cropland in several states. Thousands of acres were flooded by swollen rivers and broken levees, leading to severe erosion and standing water in fields. The June floods in Indiana caused the worst agriculture disaster in the state's history, damaging nearly 10% of corn and soybean crops. The flooding led to abandonment of planted crop acreage and yield losses. Saturated soils during plant development may result in shallow root systems, increasing vulnerability to heat and dryness later. Assessing crop damage is challenging as outcomes depend on flood waters receding and plant growth resuming. The June floods in Indiana caused extensive damage to corn and soybean crops, leading to abandonment of planted acreage and yield losses. Farmers faced challenges with replanting due to late planting dates and herbicide damage. The extreme rain in June also disrupted transportation networks in the Midwest. The floods in Iowa caused damage to transportation infrastructure, leading to delays in grain shipments and rerouting to Texas Gulf ports. The Mississippi River reopened to commercial traffic by July 6, but significant delays persisted. Many grain elevators, storage facilities, and ethanol plants were partially submerged. The main damage to agricultural facilities was economic, with many operating at reduced capacity due to transportation infrastructure damage. The floods in Iowa caused significant damage to ethanol production capacity and grain storage facilities. The floods also resulted in livestock deaths, particularly hogs, but the actual mortality tally may be lower than initially feared. Most producers were able to move their animals to safer locations ahead of the floods. The President can issue disaster declarations under the Stafford Act in response to overwhelming catastrophes. Iowa was hardest hit by storms and flooding, with many counties declared federal disaster areas. Other states affected include Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and West Virginia. Presidential declarations lead to federal aid distribution to individuals, families, nonprofits, and public agencies in designated areas. Congress allocates funds to the Disaster Relief Fund for disaster assistance. Congress appropriates money to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for disaster assistance authorized by the Stafford Act, administered by FEMA. DRF funds are not available for agricultural losses, but USDA offers programs like federal crop insurance and emergency disaster loans. USDA is actively involved in flood response efforts, providing various forms of assistance in affected areas. Congress has allocated nearly $480 million in emergency USDA funding. Congress has allocated $480 million in emergency USDA funding for 2008 Midwest flood response activities. This funding includes $89.4 million for the Emergency Conservation Program and $390.5 million for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program to assist farmers in cleanup and restoration efforts. Additionally, the 2008 farm bill authorized a new four-year supplemental revenue crop disaster program. Without advance payments, emergency supplemental disaster assistance for 2008 crop and livestock losses will not be available until October 2009. The payment formula for determining payments is based on national average market prices, which will not be known until Fall 2009. There are discussions about amending the farm bill to require USDA to make advance payments, while some farm groups believe USDA already has the flexibility to do so. USDA is under pressure from Congress and various industry groups to address high commodity prices, as corn and soybean products are crucial for these industries. On April 25, 2008, Texas Governor Rick Perry requested the EPA to waive 50% of the Renewable Fuels Standard's ethanol requirements to ease the impact on corn prices. However, the request was denied. In response, the USDA announced that 24 million acres of Conservation Reserve Program land could be used for managed haying and grazing in 2008. The USDA announced on July 7, 2008, that permission is granted to use CRP land for grazing in presidential disaster and contiguous counties. Tight supplies and record high prices in the US and world markets have been experienced in the first half of 2008, with long-term forecasts projecting significantly higher prices for feed grains and oilseeds due to a steady rise in global population. The main factors driving higher long-term prices include projections for a steady rise in global population and income growth in developing economies, leading to increased demand for livestock products and feedstuffs. Additionally, there is an outlook for greater demand for agricultural feedstocks to meet biofuel policies in the US and EU, particularly for corn and vegetable oils. Any deviation from normal crop growing conditions could negatively impact markets and drive prices higher. The potential weather- and flood-related production losses to this year's U.S. corn and soybean crops could lead to higher commodity prices in June. The United States' significant role in global corn and soybean markets means that U.S. price changes directly affect the international marketplace. Concerns over late planting and slow crop development rates may result in volatile commodity prices, with the possibility of weather problems impacting yield and production prospects. The concerns about volatile commodity prices are likely to impact policymakers regarding consumer food price inflation, international food aid availability, and the use of commercial agricultural crops for biofuels production, especially corn for ethanol."
