The Congress finds that the Internet is a global network that operates independently of State boundaries and is inherently a matter of interstate and foreign commerce under the jurisdiction of the United States Congress. Internet transmissions are geographically indifferent and impossible to determine the precise geographic route or endpoints due to packet-switching technology. The Congress recognizes the challenges of taxing Internet activity due to its global nature and the difficulty in distinguishing between interstate and foreign transmissions. Inconsistent and unadministrable taxes imposed by State and local governments threaten to burden consumers and businesses, hinder the growth of the Internet, and raise concerns about its future viability. The application of outdated tax laws to the Internet poses unintended and unpredictable consequences. The Internet's global nature poses challenges for taxing activities, with over 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in the US alone. This could burden consumers, businesses, and hinder Internet growth. The application of outdated tax laws to the Internet has unintended consequences.

This can be achieved by utilizing the authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the US Constitution.
