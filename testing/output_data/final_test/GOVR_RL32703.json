    "content": "The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the world's largest source of population and reproductive health programs, operating in 155 countries with funds totaling $783.1 million in 2009. There has been ongoing debate in the United States about whether to financially support UNFPA due to concerns about its involvement in China's family planning policies. The United States has withheld funding to UNFPA through the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment since FY1985, which prohibits funding to organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. The George W. Bush Administration deemed UNFPA ineligible for funding from FY2002 to FY2008, but President Barack Obama resumed contributions in 2009. The issue of U.S. contributions to UNFPA will be discussed in the 111th Congress. Barack Obama announced the resumption of U.S. contributions to UNFPA with $50 million allocated in 2009. In FY2010, $55 million was provided, and in FY2011, $50 million was requested. The report outlines UNFPA's mission, U.S. support, legislative interpretations, and debates on funding. The United Nations established a Population Commission in 1947 to collect global population data and provide technical assistance. In 1969, the U.N. Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) was created to support member governments in population matters. States are encouraged to contribute voluntarily to UNFPA. The UNFPA, initially administered by UNDP, expanded its operations to include maternal and child health, family planning, communication, education, and population policy assistance. By 1972, it operated in 78 countries with a budget of over $30 million, becoming a separate entity under the General Assembly's direct authority. The United States provided the majority of funding through voluntary contributions. The United States provided significant financial support to UNFPA, representing nearly 80% of total contributions in 1972. Despite the growth in donors to 52, the U.S. remained the largest contributor with 46% of the total. Over the next decade, the U.S. share declined to about 25% as other nations increased their contributions. UNFPA played a key role in World Population Conferences in Bucharest (1974) and Mexico City (1984), leading to the expansion of international population assistance. Operations expanded rapidly, focusing on eight primary areas including family planning. In the early 1980s, UNFPA focused on family planning, data collection, population policies, communications, implementation of programs, special programs for women and children, and multisector activities. UNFPA played a major role in the outcomes of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, marking a turning point in the global debate on population issues. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo established a policy framework integrating population concerns into development, focusing on education, health, women's empowerment, and poverty reduction. The conference shifted population program strategies towards human welfare objectives and endorsed programs to promote women's education, end gender discrimination, and strengthen women's grassroots organizations. UNFPA programs are guided by the ICPD's Program of Action with goals including universal access to reproductive health services, primary education, reducing maternal mortality, infant mortality, and increasing life expectancy. UNFPA operates globally with offices in New York City and 155 countries, with a total income of $783.1 million in 2009. UNFPA's total income in 2009 was $783.1 million, a $62 million decrease from 2008 attributed to the global economic downturn. Most income comes from voluntary contributions for core programs and administrative costs, with supplementary donations allowing donors to earmark their contributions. The organization relies on a few key donors for regular country programs and operating expenses. UNFPA's regular income primarily comes from a few key donors, with the Netherlands and Japan being the largest contributors. The United States also contributed in 2009, representing approximately 9.5% of the budget. UNFPA focuses on seven program areas, including preventing HIV/AIDS and making motherhood safer. The UNFPA focuses on various program areas, including providing emergency obstetric care, supporting young people with reproductive health services, promoting gender equality through legal reforms, assisting in emergencies, securing reproductive health supplies, and preventing and treating obstetric fistula. UNFPA allocates resources to reproductive health, family planning, gender equity, and women's empowerment programs. Programs are carried out in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, with major assistance in Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Expenditures in China range between $4-6 million annually. The United States played a significant role in the launch of UNFPA in 1969, with Congress expressing concerns about rapid population growth in poor countries. In 1967, Congress amended the Foreign Assistance Act to authorize funds for population assistance programs, urging resources to be channeled through the United Nations. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) initially required other donors to match American contributions to UNFPA. This led to exceeding resource goals in 1970 and 1971. U.S. contributions to UNFPA increased in the 1970s and 1980s, but the share of resources from the U.S. declined to around 27%. In FY2009, the U.S. contribution peaked at $50 million, and it is expected to reach $55 million in FY2010, the largest to date. The United States will provide $55 million to UNFPA, the largest contribution to date. In 1984, the Reagan Administration introduced the \"Mexico City policy,\" restricting NGOs receiving U.S. population assistance from promoting or performing abortion as a family planning method in other countries. The \"Mexico City policy\" was implemented by the Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations, reversed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, and reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001. Concerns were raised at the 1984 Mexico City Conference regarding UNFPA's activities in China's coercive family planning practices. The Reagan Administration required UNFPA to provide assurances that it was not involved in abortion or coercive family planning programs before releasing funds. In FY1984, funds were withheld from UNFPA until assurances were provided. In FY1985, USAID reviewed UNFPA's programs, including in China, to ensure no involvement in involuntary abortions. UNFPA was found eligible for U.S. support but received $36 million instead of the earmarked $46 million in March 1985. In March 1985, USAID contributed $36 million to UNFPA, withholding $10 million due to concerns about coercion in China's population control program. The Reagan Administration sought to re-program the $10 million for other population aid groups, but Congress passed the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment in the FY1985 Supplemental Appropriations bill, preventing the transfer of funds. The amendment in bill H.R. 2577 prohibits U.S. funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. Representative Jack Kemp explained that support could include providing resources, training individuals, education, and assistance to government bodies. This amendment would impact U.S. funding decisions. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, enacted in 1985, prohibits U.S. funding for organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. President Reagan delegated authority to the Secretary of State to determine organizations affected by the amendment, leading to the determination that UNFPA's activities in China constituted participation in coercive practices. The Reagan Administration reprogrammed $10 million from UNFPA earmarks for voluntary family planning programs due to China's coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization practices. If the Kemp-Inouye amendment is enacted in FY1986, UNFPA could only receive funds if they withdraw from China and China addresses abuses related to coercive practices. The Reagan Administration redirected $10 million from UNFPA due to China's coercive abortion practices. A lawsuit was filed against the decision, which was upheld in 1986. USAID continued to request funds for UNFPA but found it ineligible each year due to concerns about China's family planning program. During the Clinton Administration, the controversy surrounding China's family planning program and UNFPA's role persisted. President Clinton reversed the Mexico City policy, determining that UNFPA programs in China did not violate Kemp-Kasten. The policy reversal was based on factors such as the ambiguity of Kemp-Kasten language and over-reliance on 1985 statements by Representative Kemp. The Clinton Administration believed that the Kemp-Kasten restrictions should only apply to organizations knowingly supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Representative Kemp's 1985 statements were deemed ambiguous and not adopted by his colleagues. The Clinton Administration believed that UNFPA did not knowingly support coercive practices in China, but Congress still imposed conditions on UNFPA contributions, withholding funds in some years. Despite opposition from the United States, UNFPA re-established its program in China. Despite opposition from the United States, UNFPA re-established a program in China, and in FY1999 appropriation legislation, Congress prohibited all U.S. contributions to the organization. Funding was restored in FY2000, but with the requirement that an amount equal to UNFPA expenditures in China be withheld, resulting in a $3.5 million deduction in FY2000 and FY2001. President Bush's FY2002 budget proposed a $25 million U.S. contribution to UNFPA, with no change in policy regarding the Kemp-Kasten conditions attached to U.S. contributions. In FY2002, Congress allocated $34 million for UNFPA, but the White House halted U.S. contributions pending a review of the organization's program in China. Assistant Secretary of State Arthur Dewey mentioned the funding hold before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in February 2002. The legislative text allocated $34 million for UNFPA funding, giving the Administration discretion. The US supported UNFPA's global work but had concerns about abuse in China's family planning. An investigation team was sent to China in May 2002 to review UNFPA programs. The State Department's assessment team, including Bonnie Glick and Dr. Theodore Tong, found no evidence of UNFPA's involvement in coercive practices in China. Despite some government restrictions being relaxed, China still had coercive elements in its population programs. Chinese leaders considered population control a top priority. Ambassador Brown recommended releasing $34 million to UNFPA based on these findings. President Bush withheld U.S. funding from UNFPA from FY2002 through FY2008 due to concerns about coercive practices in China. The Administration maintained that funding could be reconsidered if UNFPA ended its program in China or restructured it to comply with U.S. law. The State Department found that UNFPA was ineligible for U.S. funding due to its support of coercive practices in China, including funding equipment for the Chinese State Family Planning Commission. The State Department found UNFPA ineligible for U.S. funding due to support of coercive practices in China, including funding equipment for the Chinese State Family Planning Commission. President Obama supported UNFPA, with the U.S. contributing $50 million in FY2009. This decision highlighted the President's commitment to international family planning and women's health. In FY2010 and FY2011, the President requested $50 million for U.S. contributions to UNFPA, emphasizing that UNFPA does not support abortion as a means of family planning. The Obama Administration's request aimed to align the U.S. with other top UNFPA donors and show strong support for the organization. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $55 million for UNFPA under certain conditions, including not funding abortions and not using funds for a country program in China. Reporting requirements were established for the Secretary of State regarding UNFPA's budgeting for China programs. UNFPA received $50 million from the US in FY2010, with $30 million from the IO&P account and the rest from the GHCS account. Conditions were set for the funding, including restrictions on funding abortions and country programs in China. The US provided $50 million to UNFPA in FY2010 with conditions, including restrictions on funding abortions and country programs in China. U.S. contributions to UNFPA under 111-8 must be used for specific purposes like providing safe equipment and contraceptives, preventing obstetric fistula, and promoting maternal health services in areas with poor infrastructure. Some concerns were raised about the provision that allows funds to be made available to UNFPA regardless of any law. The Obama Administration allocated $50 million to UNFPA in FY2010 under the Kemp-Kasten amendment, with conditions such as not funding abortions. The funds were to be used for specific purposes like promoting maternal health services in areas with poor infrastructure. There have been debates on whether UNFPA programs in China violate the Kemp-Kasten. The UNFPA programs in China are under scrutiny for potential violations of the Kemp-Kasten amendment. Initially focused on data collection and maternal/child health, the programs shifted towards a more client-oriented reproductive health approach in counties without birth targets. The UNFPA implemented a reproductive health approach in project counties in China, offering education, counseling, and integrated services. The organization played a key role in reducing abortion ratios and introduced comprehensive monitoring. A new program approved in 2006 aims to build on previous policy changes and increase the utilization of high-quality reproductive health services. The UNFPA implemented a reproductive health approach in China to increase the utilization of high-quality reproductive health services and reduce vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among migrants and vulnerable groups. UNFPA's operations in China were scrutinized, with investigations concluding they were not involved in coercive family planning programs. The Population Research Institute (PRI) conducted investigations in China regarding UNFPA's involvement in coercive family planning programs. PRI's report accused UNFPA of supporting coercive practices, sparking controversy and congressional debate over U.S. financial support for UNFPA operations worldwide. The UNFPA-sponsored review team conducted an investigation in China, finding evidence of non-voluntary abortions, use of IUDs, mandatory examinations, and punishments for non-compliance. The team recommended that UNFPA continue its program in China and expand its resources in the future. The British parliamentary team visited China in 2001 and 2002, finding that UNFPA programs were positively impacting reproductive health services and giving women more choices. They reported in 2003 that China was moving towards voluntary family planning policies with UNFPA's support. The group recommended maintaining constructive engagement with China on family planning, restoring U.S. funding for UNFPA, and revising the Kemp-Kasten amendment. Critics expressed concerns over changes in funding restrictions for UNFPA and other international organizations. The State Department warned organizations like UNICEF and WHO that working with UNFPA could jeopardize their US funding. In 2003, the State Department funded an HIV/AIDS program for African and Asian refugees but excluded Marie Stopes International. The Consortium refused the $1 million grant because of this exclusion."
