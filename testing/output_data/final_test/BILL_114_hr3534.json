    "content": "The \"Audit U.S. Departments to Insulate Taxpayers Act of 2015\" or the \"AUDIT Act\" requires a GAO report. The GAO must submit an annual report to Congress with legislative proposals based on recommendations, as required by the \"Audit U.S. Departments to Insulate Taxpayers Act of 2015.\" The proposals will be introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives within 30 days of the report submission. The legislative proposal must be introduced in the House of Representatives within 5 days of submission, or any member can introduce it. It will then be referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The legislative proposal introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate will be referred to the respective committees for hearings and testimony from relevant agency representatives. If the committee does not report the bill within 60 days, it may be discharged. After 60 days, if the committee has not reported the bill, it may be discharged for further consideration and placed on the House calendar. Expedited consideration allows any Member to move for the bill's consideration after the committee has reported or been discharged. A motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and privileged in the Senate. It is not debatable, amendable, or subject to postponement. Reconsidering the vote on the motion is not allowed. If the motion is agreed to, the bill will be considered. The bill will be immediately considered without any interruptions once agreed upon. Debate on the bill is limited to 4 hours in the House and 10 hours in the Senate, divided equally between supporters and opponents. Certain motions, like limiting debate further or reconsidering the vote, are not allowed. The bill will be voted on immediately after debate, with appeals decided without debate. This section is an exercise of rulemaking powers by Congress. In this section, rules specific to each House of Congress can be changed at any time, similar to other rules of the House. The term \"agency\" is defined as in section 551 of title 5, United States Code."
