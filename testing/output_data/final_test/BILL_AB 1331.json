    "title": "AB 1331",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The commission in California amends Section 739.1 of the Public Utilities Code to continue the CARE program, providing assistance to low-income electric and gas customers. Program eligibility is based on household incomes no greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty guideline levels. Rates for CARE program participants are established to ensure low-income ratepayers are not overburdened by monthly energy expenditures. The commission ensures that CARE discounts for low-income electricity and gas ratepayers reflect the level of need determined by a needs assessment. The average effective CARE discount must be between 30-35% of revenues compared to non-CARE customers, reflecting various charges not paid by CARE customers. It is calculated as a weighted average of individual customer discounts. The electrical corporation must maintain the average effective CARE discount within a certain range and cannot reduce it by more than a reasonable percentage decrease annually. The entire discount must be applied as a reduction in the overall bill for eligible CARE customers. The commission collaborates with electrical and gas companies to set penetration goals for the CARE program. Recovery of reasonable administrative costs is authorized by the commission through a balancing account mechanism, covering outreach, marketing, regulatory compliance, certification, billing, measurement, evaluation, and equipment upgrades. The commission collaborates with electrical and gas companies to set penetration goals for the CARE program, including examining methods to improve CARE enrollment and participation. This includes comparing information from CARE and ULTS, automatic enrollment of eligible ULTS customers, customer privacy issues, and alternative outreach mechanisms. Customer consent is required before enrollment, and the commission consults with interested parties to inform ULTS customers about other low-income programs and recover reasonable costs incurred. The commission works with government entities to ensure eligible gas and electric customers in California are enrolled in the CARE program, potentially using existing public assistance programs for eligibility. They aim to streamline the application process and collaborate with corporations and the Low-Income Oversight Board. The Low-Income Oversight Board collaborates with electrical and gas corporations to achieve low-income objectives. Participants in the CARE program must respond to income verification requests or face permanent exclusion from self-certified reenrollment. The commission mandates that utility companies offering economic need-based discounts, like the Family Electric Rate Assistance program, use a single application form for all eligible assistance programs to streamline the application process for applicants. The Legislature intends for the commission to ensure CARE program participants receive affordable electric and gas service without imposing an unfair economic burden. The commission's assistance program for low-income electric and gas customers will include nonprofit group living facilities if they meet eligibility requirements. Utilities can offer discounts to eligible facilities, including women's shelters and homeless shelters, that provide proof of eligibility. An electrical corporation may require proof of income eligibility for CARE program participants with high electricity usage. If usage exceeds 400 percent of baseline, participation in the Energy Savings Assistance Program may be required for reducing energy usage. The CARE program may require participants to join the Energy Savings Assistance Program within 45 days. The electrical corporation may ask for rental information and share energy assessment results with landlords. All requirements must align with commission procedures. If a CARE program participant's electricity usage exceeds 600 percent of baseline, they must join ESAP within 45 days. The electrical corporation may request rental information and share energy assessment results with landlords. After an energy assessment, if a CARE program participant's electricity usage exceeds 600 percent of baseline, the electrical corporation may remove them from the program. The participant can appeal this decision and participate in an appeals process to verify their usage levels. A CARE program participant in a rental residence cannot be removed from the program if the landlord is unresponsive or does not allow for ESAP participation. No reimbursement is required for this act as it creates new regulations related to program participation."
