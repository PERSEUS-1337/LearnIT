    "content": "Georgia gained independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union dissolved. President Zviad Gamsakhurdia fled in 1992, and Eduard Shevardnadze became president in 1995. There were conflicts with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, leading to cease-fires in 1992 and 1994. Shevardnadze was ousted in 2003, and Mikheil Saakashvili became president in 2004. Saakashvili faced criticism in 2007 and was reelected in 2008. President Saakashvili was reelected in January 2008 with 53% of the vote. He announced new democratization initiatives at the U.N. General Assembly in 2008 to strengthen Georgia's sovereignty. In 2009, he met with opposition leaders to discuss setting up a constitutional commission for political system changes. He is constitutionally limited to two terms and stated he will not run in the 2013 presidential election. In his speeches from 2010 to 2012, President Saakashvili pledged further democratization efforts and outlined goals for a \"modern\" Georgia with a strong economy and confident citizens. He discussed progress towards achieving goals in agriculture, trade, and infrastructure by 2015. Saakashvili also promised that the 2012 legislative election would be the freest and most transparent in Georgia's history. The 2010 local elections in Georgia were considered transparent and democratic, with the ruling UNM winning majority votes. The elections were seen as a rehearsal for future elections and a mandate for the UNM. Gigi Ugulava was reelected as Tbilisi's mayor, potentially positioning him as a candidate for the 2013 presidential election. The 2013 presidential election in Georgia saw a likely candidate backed by UNM. The boycott by radical opposition parties marginalized them in the public's eyes. OSCE monitors noted progress in democratization but highlighted significant shortcomings in the local elections. Assistant Secretary of State Philip Crowley echoed the findings, emphasizing the need for improvement. In May 2010, Georgia's constitutional commission agreed on amendments to reduce the president's power and increase the legislature and prime minister's powers. The changes will take effect after the 2013 presidential election. The party with the most seats in the legislature will nominate the prime minister, who will select ministers and draft a program. Regional governors will be appointed by the prime minister instead of the president. Suggestions by the Venice Commission were considered. The Venice Commission raised concerns about the proposed constitutional changes in Georgia, suggesting a more powerful legislature to appoint and remove the prime minister with a simple majority vote. Opposition parties allege the changes are designed to allow Saakashvili to become prime minister after his presidency. The People's Assembly organization led by Nino Burjanadze and Badri Bitsadze launched demonstrations in Tbilisi, resulting in clashes with security forces, deaths, injuries, and detentions. The government accused Russia-backed protesters of planning an armed overthrow. The government issued a warrant for the arrest of Badri Bitsadze, husband of opposition leader Nino Burjanadze, for his alleged involvement in planning a coup. Various international organizations called for an inquiry into alleged excessive force used by security forces against protesters. Bitsadze was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison but returned to Georgia after his sentence was annulled. Talks on electoral code reform were initiated by ruling and opposition parties in November 2010. In November 2010, talks began on reforming the electoral code, reaching an impasse in March 2011 but resumed in June. Two opposition parties, Christian Democratic and New Rights, formed the \"Opposition Eight\" alliance with the ruling party to agree on electoral reforms. They proposed increasing legislators from 150 to 190, with 107 elected by party lists and 83 by single-mandate constituencies. This change aimed to give opposition parties a better chance at gaining seats in the legislature. The draft electoral code was made public for discussion in September. In December 2011, the UNM and some opposition parties approved a new electoral code for Georgia, with 77 members of the 150-seat legislature to be elected through proportional voting and the remaining 73 through majoritarian voting in single member districts. The code also guaranteed that a party gaining a minimum of 5% of the vote would receive at least six seats. However, the recommendation by the Venice Commission for single member districts to have relatively equal populations was not included in the new law. Additionally, a constitutional amendment in 2011 stated that the newly elected legislature would convene in a new building in Kutaisi. In October 2011, Georgian oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili announced his intention to form a party and participate in the 2012 legislative elections in opposition to the ruling UNM. President Saakashvili revoked Ivanishvili's Georgian citizenship due to his Russian and French citizenship, leading to investigations and asset seizures. Ivanishvili gave up his Russian citizenship and planned to renounce his French citizenship. The ruling party passed laws to limit corporate contributions, seen as targeting Ivanishvili's financing. In response to laws limiting corporate contributions to political parties, critics accused the ruling party of trying to hinder Bidzina Ivanishvili from funding new parties. State funding for campaigns by existing parties was increased, seen as a way to prevent the creation of new parties aligned with Ivanishvili. Ivanishvili's party coalition, Georgia Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), was established in April 2012. Constitutional changes in May 2012 allowed EU citizens living in Georgia for five years to hold high political office, potentially enabling Ivanishvili to participate in elections. Despite this, Ivanishvili stated he would only run as a Georgian citizen. He launched the GD election campaign in May 2012, emphasizing support for NATO and EU integration. On May 29, 2012, Bidzina Ivanishvili affirmed support for Georgian integration into NATO and the EU, pledged to peacefully reintegrate Abkhazia and South Ossetia into Georgia, and vowed to reduce poverty, unemployment, and emigration. Georgia's State Audit Chamber sought a fine of over $90 million on Ivanishvili's party coalition, GD, for campaign spending violations. The court later reduced the fine to $45.4 million on appeal, but Ivanishvili refused to pay it, leading to a government raid on Global TV, a cable company. On June 21, the government raided Global TV, a cable and satellite television provider co-owned by Ivanishvili's brother, seizing satellite dishes and other businesses linked to Ivanishvili. Two banks were placed under state management until a fine was paid. Concerns were raised about freedom of information as a television station owned by Ivanishvili's wife relied on Global TV for broadcasting. In response, an amendment to the electoral code was approved requiring cable providers to carry all significant television channels with news programming for 60 days before the election. In late May 2012, Ivanishvili held campaign rallies in Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Ozurgeti, and villages, focusing on cutting utility rates, investing in agriculture, universal health insurance, and increasing pensions. Saakashvili appointed Merabishvili as Prime Minister to combat unemployment, address agriculture and healthcare issues, and create an Employment Ministry. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) raised concerns about the polarized electoral environment in Georgia before the October legislative election. ODIHR criticized the revised law on campaign spending for giving too much power to the State Audit Chamber, which was accused of selectively targeting Ivanishvili. NDI warned of hate speech, harassment of political opponents, improper campaign spending, and bribery attempts. Georgian civil society and opposition parties raised concerns about impartial implementation of new electoral and campaign finance laws. NDI called for transparent application of the campaign finance law. The election for the Parliament of Georgia was held on October 1, 2012, with 16 parties and blocs participating. GD emerged as the main opposition to UNM, leading to GD's electoral victory after a video tape of abuse in a prison was released late in the campaign. The 2012 election in Georgia saw a loss of voter support for the UNM and the electoral victory of GD, who emerged with 85 legislative seats. Observers noted a polarized and tense electoral environment with instances of violence. Opposition party activists were detained and fined, and there were concerns about the blurred line between state activities and the ruling party's campaign. The 2012 election in Georgia saw a shift in voter support to the GD party, with concerns about blurred lines between state activities and the ruling party's campaign. Election observers noted inconsistencies in campaign finance enforcement and some irregularities in the voting process, such as ballot marking and tabulation errors. In the 2012 election in Georgia, errors were observed in completing results protocols in some precinct electoral commissions. The White House called the election a milestone for Georgia's democracy and urged Ivanishvili and Saakashvili to work together for a peaceful transition of power. Several Members of Congress commended President Saakashvili for his efforts in democratization, emphasizing the importance of continued commitment to democracy for U.S.-Georgia relations. Ivanishvili was approved as prime minister by the majority GD coalition on October 25, 2012. The majority GD coalition approved Ivanishvili as prime minister, along with his proposed cabinet ministers and government program. The program includes large-scale reforms in strategic directions, such as constitutional changes, restructuring the Interior Ministry, modernizing the economy, pursuing a free trade agreement with the United States, and seeking to improve relations with Russia. The program also emphasizes the United States as Georgia's main ally and aims for EU and NATO membership. The UNM members in the legislature voted against the new government. The UNM members in the legislature criticized the new government for not building on Saakashvili's reforms. Relations between the GD coalition and UNM remain contentious, with a planned 2013 presidential election approaching. The Ivanishvili government has begun arresting officials from the previous administration. Statesmanship and compromise are essential for Georgia's democratization. The government in Georgia has started arresting officials from the previous administration, including former defense and interior minister Bacho Akhalaia and chief of the armed forces Georgy Kalandadze. Prime Minister Ivanishvili assured that due process will be followed. Assistant Secretary of State Philip Gordon emphasized the importance of investigating crimes without the perception of political retribution for Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration. On November 29, 2012, Georgian Foreign Minister Maia Panjikidze met with Secretary Clinton in Washington DC, discussing prosecutions by the Ivanishvili government. Panjikidze assured Clinton that arrests were not politically motivated but aimed at restoring justice. Prime Minister Ivanishvili endorsed Clinton's statement and pledged transparent investigations. The government dismissed concerns raised by a Washington Post editorial as influenced by the UNM. In December 2012, President Saakashvili criticized the Ivanishvili government for politically motivated arrests of his former colleagues. He expressed a desire to ease tensions by focusing on foreign policy. Both leaders agreed to appoint Colonel Irakli Dzneladze as the next chief of staff of the armed forces. In January 2013, investigations and arrests of former government officials continued under the Ivanishvili government. The Georgian government launched investigations and arrested former officials and civil servants. The legislature overrode a presidential veto on amnesty for \"political prisoners,\" leading to the release of nearly 200 alleged victims, including individuals sentenced as Russian spies. Concerns were raised about the impact on Georgia's international reputation and relations with Western governments. Local councils and leaders, mostly from the UNM party, faced protests and resignations, with some accusing the GD party of attempting to take over local politics. On January 23, 2013, Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili dismissed Irakly Alasania as first deputy prime minister due to disagreements over the GD coalition's presidential candidate. President Saakashvili was blocked from delivering his annual speech by pro-Ivanishvili protesters. After being blocked by pro-Ivanishvili protesters from delivering his annual speech at the legislative library, President Saakashvili gave the speech from his residence. Ivanishvili condemned the violence and suggested it could have been avoided if the speech was postponed. Congressional Caucus members called for Secretary Kerry to address concerns about arrests of former officials in Georgia. In March 2013, the constitution was amended to limit Saakashvili's power to dismiss the cabinet without parliamentary approval. Prime Minister Ivanishvili denied reports of pressure by GD activists to force UNM local legislators to resign or switch parties and firing local government workers belonging to UNM. He called for local government workers not to be fired for political reasons and proposed provisions to support effective local self-governance after the 2014 local legislative elections. This may include a different process for choosing regional governors. In a speech to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on April 23, 2013, Ivanishvili emphasized Georgia's commitment to democratization, human rights, and Western orientation. He advocated for the appointment of Thomas Hammarberg as a Special Advisor for Legal and Constitutional Reform and Human Rights in Georgia, and pledged to allow OSCE observers and human rights advocates to monitor prosecutions of former government officials. Ivanishvili also addressed concerns about judicial independence and blamed President Saakashvili for certain issues. Some observers argue that the Ivanishvili government is pro-European but has ties to Russian officials. Ivanishvili selected Giorgi Margvelashvili as the Georgian Dream candidate for president in a non-transparent manner. Other candidates include Shalva Natelashvili and Nino Burjanadze. A poll showed a majority planned to vote for the GD candidate. The UNM hopes to hold party primaries. Former Prime Minister Merabashvili, a possible presidential candidate for the UNM, was arrested on corruption charges in May 2013. Several Members of Congress raised concerns about the arrest being politically motivated. Eleven UNM legislators left the party, reducing its presence in the legislature. Georgia was ranked as \"partly free\" by Freedom House in 2012, with improvements in political rights but concerns about arrests. Freedom House raised concerns about the mistreatment of detainees and inmates in Georgia, including systemic abuse at Gldani Prison. Graphic videos depicting assaults on inmates led to some officials being prosecuted, but there were still issues with human rights abuses. After the parliamentary elections in Georgia, numerous high-level former government officials were indicted on torture, abuse of power, and corruption charges. Most arrests were made without warrants, leading to a perception of impunity and lack of judicial oversight. The executive branch was believed to control the judiciary through the High Council of Justice, impacting judicial reforms and appointments. Several NGOs and opposition party members alleged politically motivated arbitrary arrests, especially of GD supporters before the election. There were claims of family members of GD supporters being fired from public sector jobs. The legislature declared 190 individuals as political prisoners and 25 as political exiles. Surveillance of e-mails and phone conversations was alleged by some opposition figures and NGOs. In November 2012, several high-ranking officials were arrested by the Prosecutor's Office. The Prosecutor's Office arrested Tbilisi's vice mayor, the head of the Constitutional Security Department, and nine other officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for illegal surveillance through unauthorized access to private computer networks. Government influence over media outlets remained a concern, with reports of assaults on journalists, confiscation of cameras, and intimidation by officials. Opposition TV stations faced audits and equipment confiscation during the election campaign. Accusations of editorial influence were made against high-ranking government officials and opposition politicians. The government officials and opposition politicians in Georgia were accused of influencing editorial and programming decisions through personal connections with news directors and media executives. Georgia also faced issues with sex trafficking and forced labor, but the government took steps to combat trafficking by increasing funding for anti-trafficking efforts and shelters. USAID highlighted Georgia's economic potential, citing its strategic location for trade, agricultural resources, water resources for hydropower, and overall growth opportunities. Georgia has economic strengths like ample water resources for hydropower and a willing workforce, but faces challenges such as high unemployment, low educational achievement, and market constraints. The country's economy suffered in 2008-2009 due to global economic downturn and the Russia-Georgia conflict, but started recovering in 2010. The government released an economic plan in 2011 to boost job growth and address issues like high poverty rates and income inequality. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) estimates Georgia's GDP contracted in 2009 but resumed growth in 2010. GDP grew by 7% in 2011, slowing to 6.1% in 2012 due to economic activity decline. Inflation was 8.5% in 2011, with slight deflation of -0.9% in 2012. Economic growth may slow to 4.5% in 2013 due to reduced government spending and foreign investment. Agriculture, mining, and a small industrial sector drive economic activities. Civil conflict and poverty have led to the emigration of one-fifth of the population since 1991. Georgia's working population has migrated for work in Russia or other countries, with worker remittances abroad contributing to GDP. Despite Russia's expected poor economic growth in 2013, remittances to Georgia are not expected to greatly decline. Georgia exported $3.5 billion in goods in 2012, with main trade partners being Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine. Main exports included automobiles, ferrous metals, and fertilizer. U.S. exports to Georgia were $540.6 million in 2012, while imports were $226.2 million. In 2012, Georgia's total foreign direct investment (FDI) was $1.1 billion, with state-owned companies issuing $750 million in Eurobonds for projects. Unemployment gradually rose to about 15% in 2011, with agriculture employing half of the working population. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) praised the government in 2013 for increasing social expenditures and agricultural support. The Ivanishvili government in Georgia aimed to boost government spending, lower interest rates, reform the tax code, and enact policies to increase business confidence and investment. Trade negotiations with Russia were launched in 2012 to lift trade restrictions on mineral water, wine, and agricultural produce. Russia's WTO membership was questioned due to these restrictions, with Russia gaining leverage for concessions in return for allowing some trade to resume. In May 2013, Rospotrebnadzor approved Georgian wines and mineral waters for import into Russia. However, tensions persisted as Rospotrebnadzor accused a US-Georgia laboratory of researching pathogens harmful to Russia, calling for its closure for cooperation to continue. Gennadiy Onishchenko also linked African swine fever in Russia to economic subversion from Georgia. Some animals lost in southern Russia due to economic subversion from Georgia, possibly involving a laboratory. Georgia accused of agreeing to cut U.S. collaboration with the lab. Georgia serves as a transit state for pipelines carrying Azerbaijani oil and gas to Turkey, reducing dependence on Russia. The U.S. supports Georgian ownership of pipelines, with funds from MCC for upgrades. Azerbaijan supplies increasing gas to Georgia, easing their reliance on Russian gas. Georgia, a member of the WTO since 2000, has concerns regarding Russia's WTO bid. They emphasize the need for market access and control over customs clearance at border posts, including those with breakaway regions. This request remains unchanged despite Russia's recognition of the regions' independence. Russia's WTO accession process faced obstacles due to the unresolved dispute with Georgia over customs control. Despite bilateral talks and resolution of most concerns, Russia refused to address Georgia's customs control concerns, insisting it was a political issue. Russia sought US pressure on Georgia or a majority vote by WTO members to bypass the issue. Some believed internal opposition to WTO membership in Russia used the dispute to stall accession efforts. Trade talks between Russia and Georgia mediated by Switzerland began in March 2011. Trade monitoring talks between Russia and Georgia, mediated by Switzerland, led to the signing of a trade monitoring agreement in Geneva in November 2011. This agreement cleared the way for Russia to join the WTO in December 2011. The agreement includes customs observers at three \"trade corridors\" on the Georgia-Russia border, with terminals at the breakaway regions and the Zemo Larsi-Kazbegi border crossing. Switzerland will manage a private firm to oversee customs clearance data provided by both countries. Georgia and Russia agreed to provide customs clearance data to a private firm for forwarding to the WTO. Despite initial disagreements, Georgia will allow customs officials to monitor cargoes at terminals between Russia and breakaway regions. Georgia maintains good relations with Azerbaijan and Armenia. Georgia has close ties with Azerbaijan and Armenia, an interest in Georgians residing in Turkey and Iran, and is a member of the EU's Eastern Partnership program. President Saakashvili and Prime Minister Ivanishvili aim for EU membership. Relations with Russia deteriorated during Saakashvili's presidency, leading to a break in diplomatic ties and withdrawal from the CIS. The 2012 election campaign focused on improving relations with Russia while maintaining a Western orientation. Ivanishvili appointed Zurab Abashidze as Special Representative for Relations. Minister Ivanishvili appointed Zurab Abashidze as Special Representative for Relations with Russia to improve ties. Talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Karasin aim to normalize trade, transport, and cultural relations. Georgia's military is the smallest in the South Caucasus region, with ground forces, air force, and national guard totaling 20,650 personnel. Diplomatic relations with Russia remain strained due to Georgian territory occupation. Georgia's Olympic Committee confirmed participation in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. In 2009, the coast guard elements were integrated into the border guards after the Russia-Georgia conflict. Georgia's defense ministry reported 160 military personnel killed during the conflict. The national security concept highlights Russia's occupation of Georgian territories and the risk of new military aggression as top threats. Russia aims to hinder Georgia's European integration and turn it into a failed state. International support and the EU Monitoring Mission are crucial for Georgia's security. Georgia's support from the European Union Monitoring Mission serves as a deterrent to potential Russian aggression. Georgia has strengthened security ties with the West by withdrawing from the CIS Collective Security Treaty and assuming control over its borders. NATO has deepened cooperation with Georgia through various partnerships and dialogues, although a Membership Action Plan was not offered at the 2008 NATO Summit. After the 2008 NATO Summit, Georgia was not offered a Membership Action Plan (MAP) but was assured eventual NATO membership. Concerns arose post-Russia-Georgia conflict about Georgia's readiness for a MAP due to military infrastructure destruction and uncertain leadership. NATO allies agreed to enhance work with the Georgia-NATO Council to facilitate Georgia's NATO membership, preparing annual progress plans. During meetings of the Georgia-NATO Council, an annual national plan was developed and implemented in May 2009. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen praised Georgia for progress towards NATO membership, including improvements in freedom of expression, economic growth, military reforms, and anti-corruption efforts. The 2012-2013 elections were highlighted as crucial for assessing Georgia's readiness for NATO membership. NATO pledged to enhance support for Georgia's defense sector, education, training, and role in Afghanistan during a meeting in Tbilisi. President Obama assured President Saakashvili of continued US support for Georgia's NATO aspirations. Ambassador-designate Norland mentioned plans to acknowledge Georgia's progress at the upcoming NATO summit in Chicago. The Chicago Summit Declaration strengthened ties with Georgia, reaffirming NATO's support for its territorial integrity and calling on Russia to pledge not to use force against Georgia. The NATO summit in Chicago strengthened ties with Georgia, reaffirming support for its territorial integrity and calling on Russia to pledge not to use force against Georgia. Georgia's Prime Minister assured NATO of due process in cases of arrested officials and invited NATO to monitor them. Georgian Defense Minister stated post-election Georgia was now a more stable and predictable NATO partner. Post-election Georgia is seen as a stronger and more stable NATO partner, with a commitment to upholding the rule of law. NATO expressed continued support and a desire for a closer relationship in the future. NATO emissaries praised Georgia's annual plan for 2013 and urged political factions to collaborate for the country's democratization. NATO Secretary General emphasized appreciation for Georgia's active support during a meeting in June 2013. General Anders Fogh Rasmussen praised Georgia for its support to NATO operations and urged the government to uphold the rule of law, human rights, and minority rights. He criticized Russia's border fortifications and expressed hope for Georgia's future NATO membership. The North Atlantic Council will visit Georgia in June 2013. The U.S. Congress approved the NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2007 to support Georgia's security assistance eligibility. The U.S. delegation called for NATO to extend a Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Georgia at the 2012 NATO Summit, but Georgia was not offered a MAP. Legislation was introduced in Congress to support Georgia's NATO aspirations. Several of Georgia's ethnic minorities increased dissidence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leading to the loss of central government control over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia's influence over these regions turned separatist conflicts into Russia-Georgia disputes. Residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, many of whom held Russian citizenship, desired independence or integration with Russia. U.S. diplomacy initially encouraged Georgia to work within existing peace frameworks for the regions, but this stance shifted in 2008 during the Russia-Georgia conflict. In 2008, the United States and other governments supported Georgia's calls for alternative peace settlement mechanisms due to Russian actions threatening Georgia's territorial integrity. Russia withdrew from CIS economic sanctions on Abkhazia, increased ties with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and recognized documents issued by separatist governments in the regions. In July 1992, Abkhazia declared independence, leading to a conflict with Georgian national guardsmen. The UNSC approved a UN Observer Mission in Georgia in October 1992 to facilitate a settlement. Russian \"volunteers\" helped Abkhaz separatist forces defeat Georgian troops in 1993. A political framework was agreed upon in April-May 1994, with Russian troops deployed as peacekeepers. The conflict resulted in around 10,000 deaths and over 200,000 refugees. In July 1992, Abkhazia declared independence, leading to a conflict with Georgian national guardsmen. The conflict resulted in about 10,000 deaths and over 200,000 displaced persons, mostly ethnic Georgians. The U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State worked with the Special Representative of the U.N. Secretary General and other \"Friends of the Secretary General\" to facilitate a settlement. Sticking points in talks included Georgia's demand for displaced persons to return to Abkhazia, while the Abkhazians insisted on recognition of their independence as a precondition to repatriation. In July 2006, a warlord in the Kodori Gorge area of northern Abkhazia, where many ethnic Svans reside, renounced allegiance to the Georgian government, leading to a conflict that was resolved by Georgian forces. Abkhazia accused Georgia of deploying military troops in violation of a cease-fire agreement. Peace talks between Georgia and Abkhazia were suspended in October 2006. The United States and the international community expressed concerns over Russia increasing \"peacekeepers\" in Abkhazia in response to alleged Georgian military buildup in the Kodori Gorge. In 2008, Russian troops were deployed to Abkhazia to repulse possible Georgian attacks. About 400 railway construction troops were sent for \"humanitarian\" work, leaving after repairing tracks and bridges. The region lobbied for joining North Ossetia or independence in 1989. Conflict erupted in 1990 due to repressive efforts by Georgian President Gamsakhurdia, leading to thousands of deaths and displacement. A cease-fire was brokered by Russia in 1992, with peacekeeping units from Russia, Georgia, and Ossetia in a security zone. In 2004, President Saakashvili increased pressure on South Ossetia by tightening border controls and breaking up a smuggling operation involving Russian organized crime. Georgia sent additional troops to the region, maintaining that it was within the limits of the cease-fire agreement. Georgian guerrilla forces also entered the region, with alleged assistance from Russian officials. In late 2004, tensions escalated in South Ossetia as guerrilla forces, allegedly supported by Russian officials, entered the region. In November 2006, a referendum reaffirmed South Ossetia's \"independence\" from Georgia. Conflict erupted in August 2008 when Georgia accused South Ossetia of artillery attacks, leading to a military intervention by Georgia and Russia. In August 2008, Russia launched air attacks and sent troops to South Ossetia, taking control of Tskhinvali and other areas. Russian forces advanced into Georgia, bombing Tbilisi and landing troops in Abkhazia. By August 12, Russian President Medvedev declared the operation successful in coercing Georgia to peace. The Georgian government accepted a French-brokered six-point cease-fire plan endorsed by President Sarkozy, leaving Russian forces in control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The plan included commitments to halt hostilities, provide humanitarian aid access, withdraw forces to pre-conflict positions, and open international discussions on security. President Medvedev's recognition of South Ossetia's independence was condemned by the international community. President Medvedev's decree recognized the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Only Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru, and Tuvalu have extended diplomatic relations to these regions. A ceasefire accord signed with President Sarkozy outlined the withdrawal of Russian forces by October 11 and the return of Georgian forces to their barracks by October 1. International observers from the U.N. and OSCE would remain, with an increase in observers from the EU by October 1. Russia's position is that international observers cannot patrol in Abkhazia and South Ossetia without the approval of the regions, which have refused to permit such patrols. Medvedev asserted that Russia recognized the regions as independent on August 26, 2008, and aimed to consolidate control over them. Many believe Russia also sought to depose Georgian President Saakashvili during the 2008 military incursion into Georgia. Russia aimed to achieve its goal of consolidating control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia by either directly occupying Georgia's capital or indirectly triggering the overthrow of President Saakashvili. Despite diplomatic efforts by the EU and the US, Russian troops remain in the regions, violating cease-fire accords. Russia has established military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, with around 7,000 troops stationed there as of early 2013. Russian troops have been deployed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, along with air force attack helicopters and S-300 surface-to-air missiles. Russian border guards and security personnel are also present, with some Black Sea Fleet naval forces in the port of Ochamchira, Abkhazia. The International Crisis Group estimates a declining population in South Ossetia, relying on Russian aid and personnel for governance and economic support. The European Union Monitoring Mission has deployed over 200 monitors by October 1, 2008. By October 1, 2008, the European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) had deployed over 200 monitors and Russia announced on October 9 that its troops had withdrawn from buffer zones. Georgia claims Russian troops remain in Akhalgori and Kodori Gorge, and no Russian military bases are allowed in these regions. In December 2008, Russia objected to the mandate for OSCE observers in Georgia, leading to their withdrawal in June 2009. Russia also vetoed a UNSC resolution to extend the UNOMIG mandate in June 2009, resulting in their withdrawal from Abkhazia. The EUMM is now the only international monitoring group with 300 staff, including 200 monitors. The European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) has 300 staffers, including 200 monitors based in three field offices near contested borders. The EUMM has effectively debunked allegations by Russia and separatist regions of ceasefire violations by Georgia. The United States and EU call for unrestricted access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia for monitoring. Georgia cooperates with EUMM by reporting security force movements and allowing inspections, unlike Russia, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. Abkhazia declared the head of the EUMM persona non grata in April 2012, refusing to reconvene meetings of the incident prevention group. An international conference in Geneva discussed security, repatriation, and status issues related to the conflict. Russia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia reject challenges to the claimed independence of the breakaway regions and insist on an arms embargo on Georgia. In March 2010, Georgia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia were urged to provide written pledges of non-use of force to the United Nations before signing agreements. Significant meetings at the Geneva conference included setting up an incident prevention mechanism along the South Ossetian border in 2009. The first meeting of the Georgia-South Ossetia Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism took place in April 2009, with the participation of various parties. Discussions at the July 2009 Geneva conference focused on establishing an incident prevention group for resolving issues like cross-border travel between Abkhazia and Georgia. At a meeting in Gali, Abkhazia on July 14, 2009, an incident prevention group was established to address cross-border travel issues between Abkhazia and Georgia. Russia announced the withdrawal of its troops from Perevi, Georgia near South Ossetia on October 14, 2010, with the troops leaving on October 18, 2010. South Ossetia rejected discussions on refugees and displaced persons after a U.N. resolution on their return was approved in September 2010. Georgia raised concerns about alleged Russian terrorist attacks at a meeting on June 7, 2011, and threatened to reconsider participation in the Geneva conference. At the December 14, 2011, Geneva conference, the United States, Georgia, Russia, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia discussed nonuse-of-force agreements with provisions for international monitors. Georgia and South Ossetia exchanged detainees in December 2011. In June 2012, Russia criticized Secretary Clinton's announcement on recognizing travel documents from Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Russia criticized Secretary Clinton's announcement on recognizing travel documents from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, claiming it set back the peace process. The new Ivanishvili government expressed disappointment after the December 2012 Geneva meeting and criticized Russia for not considering their proposals. Abkhaz authorities rejected a proposal to restore rail service through Abkhazia, viewing it as a ploy.
