    "content": "The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) was launched at the 4th WTO Ministerial in November 2001, focusing on integrating developing countries into the world trading system. Developing countries felt they had not benefited from previous trade negotiations. The agenda included talks on agriculture, services, industrial tariffs, antidumping, subsidies, special and differential treatment for developing countries, and assistance with implementing WTO commitments. Trade ministers at Doha agreed to continue discussions on launching negotiations by explicit consensus. At Doha, discussions continued on launching negotiations by explicit consensus on the \"Singapore issues\" for the 5th Ministerial at Canc\u00fan. The Ministerial declaration also addressed access to generic medicines for least developed countries. Negotiations were to conclude by January 1, 2005, with a mid-term review at the 5th Ministerial. However, negotiations progressed slowly with missed deadlines for agreement on negotiating modalities in agriculture and industrial market access talks. Expectations for the Canc\u00fan Ministerial were reduced to achieving an agreement on the framework. At the Canc\u00fan Ministerial, negotiators resolved the access to medicines dispute by allowing poor developing countries to issue compulsory licenses for generic drugs. The negotiations also focused on disputes over agriculture and the Singapore issues, leading to the emergence of the G-20+. The G-20+ group of developing countries demanded concessions from developed countries in agriculture negotiations and opposed negotiations on the Singapore issues, leading to the breakdown of talks. U.S. and EU negotiators criticized the G-20+ for lacking a negotiating strategy and making excessive demands. The G-20+ focused on breaking down agricultural barriers and subsidies in the US and EU. The US shifted towards bilateral and regional free trade agreements after the talks collapsed. Some G-20+ members negotiated FTAs with the US, while the EU reviewed its policy towards the WTO and multilateral trade negotiations. The EU may emphasize the Singapore issues in future negotiations, potentially pushing for the full agenda. G-20+ countries saw the lack of agreement at Canc\u00fan as a victory for developing countries, particularly in demanding changes to agricultural policies of developed nations. Several G-20+ members have withdrawn from meetings, raising doubts about the group's future as a negotiating entity. The Derbez Draft, proposed during the Canc\u00fan Ministerial, aimed to modify agricultural language in a draft negotiating text but was not adopted. The Derbez text, initially criticized, has resurfaced as a potential negotiation tool post-conference. Endorsed by APEC leaders like the US, Canada, and Japan, Brazil and the EU also show interest, with India being the only country outright rejecting it. The Derbez draft, endorsed by APEC leaders, is seen as a potential negotiation tool post-conference. India is the only country to reject it, while the text may lead to reemergence of previous disagreements in negotiations. The language is general and reflects joint negotiating positions between the US and EU in agriculture and industrial market access. Some suggest reverting to more ambitious negotiating proposals post-Canc\u00fan. Agriculture negotiations are ongoing. Agriculture negotiations in the Doha round focus on market access, export subsidies, and production subsidies. The U.S. emphasizes market access with a proposal for significant tariff reduction and elimination of export subsidies. The EU proposes a linear formula for tariff reductions and subsidies. The EU and the United States negotiated trade concessions on export subsidies and agricultural programs. The EU announced reforms to its Common Agricultural Policy in 2003, but did not revise its agriculture offer. A joint negotiating framework was adopted in August 2003, blending aspects of U.S. and EU proposals for tariff reduction and support limits. The EU and the United States negotiated trade concessions on export subsidies and agricultural programs. Support would be allowed up to 5% of the value of the country's total agricultural production. Export subsidies would be phased out for products of interest to developing countries, and WTO disciplines would be developed for state trading enterprises, export credits, and food aid programs. Special and differential treatment (S&D) was recognized for developing countries. Some observers criticized the United States for compromising with the EU instead of maintaining its initial trade liberalizing stance. The G-20+ group advocated cutting U.S. and EU domestic subsidies more drastically, eliminating export subsidies, and providing S&D treatment. The U.S. and EU proposed to eliminate export subsidies and provide special and differential treatment for developing countries. African nations suggested eliminating trade-distorting domestic support and export subsidies for cotton. The United States proposed a WTO sectoral initiative to address trade distortions for cotton and other products. The Derbez draft aimed to reconcile different positions by advocating deeper cuts in domestic subsidies and negotiating the elimination of export subsidies. The 2001 Doha Ministerial declaration called for a decision on negotiating the Singapore issues (investment, competition policy, trade facilitation, and government procurement) by explicit consensus at the 5th Ministerial, but the talks at Canc\u00fan collapsed due to an impasse over these issues. The talks collapsed at Canc\u00fan due to an impasse over the Singapore issues. The EU, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan support these issues, while the US is ambivalent. Developing countries oppose them due to sovereignty concerns and lack of resources. The Derbez text proposed including trade facilitation. The EU was willing to drop all issues except trade facilitation, which was vetoed by Botswana and other African states. South Korea insisted on negotiations for all four issues. The US proposed aggressive tariff cuts in industrial market access talks, aiming for complete elimination of tariffs by 2015. EU's initial tariff reduction proposal used a compression formula. The United States, Canada, and the European Union proposed a non-linear formula for tariff reduction, including S&D language for developing countries. Industrial market access was not a focus compared to agriculture or Singapore issues. The Derbez text reaffirmed the use of an unspecified non-linear formula for tariff reduction. The Derbez text reaffirmed the use of an unspecified non-linear formula for tariff reduction and supported sectoral tariff elimination. Following the collapse of the Canc\u00fan talks, the WTO General Council chairman is in discussions to establish a consensus on the way forward. The United States and the EU have not taken a leadership role in these discussions. The General Council is scheduled to meet on December 15, 2003, to assess progress and recommend further steps."
