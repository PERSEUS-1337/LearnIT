    "title": "SB 579",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 230.8 of the Labor Code in California is amended to protect parents of children in kindergarten through 12th grade or licensed child care providers. Employers with 25 or more employees at one location cannot discriminate against these parents for taking up to 40 hours off each year for child-related activities. This includes enrolling or participating in school or child care provider activities, with prior notice to the employer. Employees can take up to 40 hours off each year for child-related activities under Section 230.8 of the Labor Code in California. If both parents work for the same employer, only one parent can take planned absence at a time unless approved by the employer. Employees can utilize vacation, personal leave, or compensatory time off for planned absences, unless specified by a collective bargaining agreement. Time off without pay can also be used if offered by the employer. Any employee's entitlement under this section cannot be reduced by a collective bargaining agreement term agreed to after January 1, 1995. If all full-time employees are on vacation at the same time, accrued vacation benefits cannot be used for planned absences. The employee must provide documentation from the school or child care provider as proof of engaging in child-related activities upon request by the employer. \"Documentation\" refers to written verification deemed appropriate by the school or provider. Any employee discriminated against for engaging in child-related activities is entitled to reinstatement and reimbursement for lost wages. Employers who refuse to rehire or promote such employees may face a civil penalty. Terms related to this section are defined accordingly. In this section, \"parent\" is defined broadly to include various caregivers. \"Child care provider or school emergency\" refers to situations where a child cannot stay in school or with a caregiver due to specific reasons like behavioral issues or natural disasters. Section 233 of the Labor Code is amended to allow employees to use accrued sick leave for specified reasons, with a minimum entitlement of six months' worth of sick leave. The definition of \"employer\" includes various entities, and this provision does not extend maximum leave entitlement under other laws. The term \"family member\" is defined in Section 245.5. \"Sick leave\" is compensated leave provided by an employer for use during an absence for reasons specified in Section 246.5, excluding certain benefits like insurance or workers' compensation. An employer cannot penalize an employee for using sick leave to care for themselves or a family member. Employees who experience a violation of this rule are entitled to reinstatement, actual damages, or one day's pay, and appropriate equitable relief. The Labor Commissioner enforces employee complaints under this section, with the option for civil action in court. The rights and remedies provided are additional to any other legal protections."
