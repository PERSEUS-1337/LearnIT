    "content": "Since gaining independence in 1943, Lebanon has faced political and security challenges. The United States has invested over $1 billion in developing Lebanon's security forces, with some Members of Congress supporting this as a step towards stability in the region. Lebanon's population is religiously diverse, including various Christian sects, Sunni and Shia Muslims, Alawites, and Druze, reflecting its rich heritage. Lebanon gained independence in 1943, with a diverse population including Christians, Sunni and Shia Muslims, Alawites, and Druze. The country has a history of managing sectarian differences through a power-sharing-based democratic system known as \"confessional\" democracy. Lebanon's power-sharing system ensures that the president is a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the speaker of Parliament a Shia Muslim. The ratio of parliamentary seats between Christians and Muslims was adjusted to parity after the civil war. Sectarianism is not the only factor in Lebanese politics, with regional conflicts and ideological struggles also playing a role. The U.S. policy in Lebanon under the Bush and Obama Administrations aimed to weaken Syrian and Iranian influence, address corruption, strengthen democratic institutions, and deal with the presence of Sunni extremist groups. The Lebanese Armed Forces' confrontation with Fatah al Islam in 2007 highlighted the threat posed by Sunni extremists, with ongoing support for such groups among some Lebanese Sunnis. Hezbollah and Sunni extremist groups continue to pose security challenges in Lebanon. Hezbollah remains the most prominent U.S. adversary in Lebanon, despite the growth of Sunni extremist groups. Congress has allocated over $1 billion in assistance for Lebanon since 2006 to strengthen security forces and promote economic growth. Some Members of Congress have questioned the continued investment in U.S. assistance funds, especially when Hezbollah is part of the political coalition. U.S. engagement aims to support neutral national institutions and drive change for prosperity, security, and non-sectarian democracy in Lebanon. U.S. policy in Lebanon aims to support neutral national institutions and promote non-sectarian democracy. Some Lebanese groups welcome U.S. involvement, while others criticize it as self-interested intervention. The challenges faced by U.S. policy makers in Lebanon are not new, dating back to the country's independence in the 1940s. After Lebanon gained independence from French control in the 1940s, the United States supported parties aligned with its Cold War interests. The influx of Palestinian and Syrian refugees further complicated the situation, with Palestinian refugee camps becoming strongholds for various groups. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw tensions escalating towards civil war, with the U.S. providing support to the Lebanese Armed Forces. The civil war in Lebanon erupted in 1975 due to unresolved sectarian differences and external pressures from Palestinians, Israel, and Syria. The conflict lasted 14 years, with Syria and Israel sending military forces into Lebanon. The United States also deployed forces in the early 1980s as part of a multinational peacekeeping force, targeting anti-U.S. groups. The U.S. sought to strengthen the Lebanese Armed Forces to control non-state groups, similar to current approaches. The U.S. policy towards Lebanon post-civil war aimed to align with the Taif Agreement's goals of foreign forces withdrawal, disarming non-state groups, and establishing national security institutions. Successive U.S. administrations supported these principles while countering adversaries and anti-Israeli forces. Syria's security presence in Lebanon was recognized at Taif, but security negotiations were delayed until Syrian forces left after the assassination of a Lebanese Prime Minister. The assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005 led to the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon, marking a significant political moment. This event gave rise to the pro-Asad \"March 8\" coalition and the anti-Asad \"March 14\" coalition, which have since dominated Lebanese politics. The years following have been characterized by conflict, political gridlock, and further assassinations of anti-Syria figures. Both coalitions have struggled for power, with external players such as Syria, Iran, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United States vying for influence. The war in Syria, the influx of Syrian refugees, and Hezbollah's intervention on behalf of President Asad have also impacted Lebanon. The formation of a new cabinet in Lebanon in February 2014 followed months of political deadlock. The cabinet, led by Prime Minister-designate Tammam Salam, includes representatives from both the March 8 and March 14 coalitions. However, unresolved issues such as a parliamentary election law and security concerns continue to pose challenges for the new government. The cabinet positions in Lebanon are divided between the March 8 and March 14 coalitions, with some centrists also involved. Parliament approved the cabinet's policy statement emphasizing national unity and sovereignty. Efforts are being made to create the right conditions for the upcoming presidential elections. Speaker Nabih Berri is forming committees to assess the possibility of electing a new president. Political negotiations are ongoing. Political negotiations have begun for the Lebanese presidential election, with various Christian candidates considered. Army commander General Jean Kahwaji and Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh are potential centrist candidates, while Free Patriotic Movement leader Michel Aoun and Marada Movement leader Sleiman Franjieh are seen as possible pro-March 8 candidates. Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea and Kataeb party leader Amine Gemayel are also potential candidates. The key issue is maintaining the centrist orientation of the presidency under Michel Sleiman. President Michel Sleiman has been credited with steering Lebanon through turbulent times since 2008. He has criticized Hezbollah's actions and advocated for stronger state authority in security matters. Hezbollah has disagreed with Sleiman's statements, but he remains committed to discussing a defense strategy to protect Lebanon from external threats. The Lebanese Army's capabilities are being strengthened to combat terrorism, with no limitations on its authority. The current cabinet may have a limited tenure due to upcoming presidential elections, potentially leading to involvement in preparations for parliamentary elections. The ministerial policy statement includes a pledge to seek a new parliamentary election law, which could result in contentious cabinet formation negotiations. Contentious cabinet formation negotiations may lie ahead in Lebanon due to deep mistrust and animosity among political leaders. The ongoing war in Syria is exacerbating tensions, with armed Lebanese militia groups supporting opposing sides. High-profile bombings and armed clashes have increased sectarian tensions and strained security conditions. Hezbollah's involvement in the Syrian conflict has caused criticism, alleging the spread of conflict into Lebanon. Hezbollah's intervention in Syria has led to criticism for spreading conflict into Lebanon. Non-state actors like Hezbollah and extremist groups pose a constant security challenge in the country. The Abdullah Azzam Brigade, an Al Qaeda-linked organization, also poses a risk to Lebanese officials and international targets. The Obama Administration is actively countering Al Qaeda-influenced terrorists in Lebanon, with joint attacks by Sunni extremist groups collaborating with Jabhat al Nusra and ISIL. Usamah Amin al Shihabi was designated a terrorist for his role in Fatah al Islam and Jabhat al Nusra in Lebanon. The Lebanese Armed Forces are increasingly confronting Sunni extremists targeting Shia communities and Hezbollah due to Hezbollah's involvement in Syria. The Lebanese Armed Forces are targeting Sunni militants and protecting Shia communities in response to Hezbollah's involvement in Syria. Some Lebanese Sunnis perceive the LAF as biased towards Hezbollah, despite efforts by political leaders to emphasize the neutrality of state security forces. President Michel Sleiman and other leaders stress the importance of the armed forces as a nonsectarian institution. Hezbollah's emergence in the 1980s led to sectarian violence and terrorist attacks in Lebanon, raising concerns about stability and the risk of broader conflict. The U.S. intelligence community warned of increased violence that could escalate into widespread fighting. The Islamic Amal organization, formed in Lebanon, evolved into Hezbollah with support from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. They expanded their operations from the Bekaa valley to Beirut and southern Lebanon, targeting Israeli and U.S. military interests. Hezbollah emerged as a resistance force against foreign military occupation, with a strong presence in Shiite communities. In 1985, they released a manifesto outlining their militant, anti-imperialist stance. Despite calls for disarmament, Hezbollah leaders maintain their military capabilities are necessary for defending Lebanon. Hezbollah's justification for its military capabilities has shifted from resisting Israeli occupation to citing disputed territories, Israeli overflights, and Sunni extremist groups in Syria and Lebanon. Lebanese critics also emphasize the need to control remaining disputed areas with Israel. Hezbollah's military capabilities are justified by citing disputed territories, Israeli overflights, and Sunni extremist groups in Syria and Lebanon. The group aims to maintain a role in Lebanon's national defense and resist disarmament efforts. The United States contributes over $100 million annually to UNIFIL. Hezbollah's appeal among Lebanese Shia is significant but not uniform. Hezbollah, endorsed by Iran, has been participating in Lebanese elections since 1992, winning 10 parliament seats in 2009. They currently hold two cabinet posts and have been successful in municipal elections. Hezbollah competes for Shiite loyalties through various social programs and businesses, operating as a \"state within the state.\" Hezbollah, a Shiite organization endorsed by Iran, operates as a \"state within the state\" in Lebanon. Despite promoting a distinct religious identity, Hezbollah has had to adapt to Lebanon's pluralistic culture, shifting towards a more contemporary Islamist nationalist approach. Criticism has grown due to their military intervention in Syria, leading to increased scrutiny of their ties to Iran and their role in Lebanese security. The future of Hezbollah's military arsenal remains a central security question in Lebanon. Hezbollah's substantial military arsenal and capabilities, rivaling Lebanon's armed forces and police, have sparked debate on its future and Lebanon's defense posture. After provoking the 2006 war with Israel, Hezbollah faced increased scrutiny for its actions, including training Iraqi militia groups and intervening in Syria on behalf of the Asad government. These actions highlight Hezbollah's willingness to defend its position at all costs. Hezbollah's actions in Syria, including providing support to the government and engaging in combat, have led to increased scrutiny and sanctions from the U.S. Treasury Department. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has publicly acknowledged their involvement in Syria. Hezbollah has maintained 4,000 to 5,000 fighters in Syria and has worked with the Syrian military to protect regime supply lines. They have played significant roles in battles around Al Qusayr and the Qalamoun Mountains region. Additionally, Hezbollah forces monitor and target rebel positions near the Lebanese border to aid attacks in Syria and Lebanon. Since 2006, the United States has provided over $1 billion in assistance to Lebanon, focusing on implementing UN Security Council resolutions, reducing sectarianism, supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces and Internal Security Forces, and increasing economic opportunity. The assistance aims to modernize and equip the LAF and ISF for effective and nonsectarian security roles, including border security funding. The United States has provided significant assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) since 2006, focusing on implementing UN Security Council resolutions, reducing sectarianism, and increasing economic opportunity. This assistance includes funding for border security and counterterrorism programs, equipment and weaponry supply, and capability development plans to expand the force and improve armaments and logistical support capabilities. The Obama Administration believes that international donors can work together to enhance the LAF's capabilities. The United States has provided significant assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) since 2006, focusing on implementing UN Security Council resolutions, reducing sectarianism, and increasing economic opportunity. In December 2013, Saudi Arabia pledged $3 billion for French training and equipment programs for the LAF. U.S. engagement with Saudi, French, and Lebanese interlocutors aims to ensure weapons systems do not threaten Israel's security. The Administration seeks to increase U.S. assistance to the LAF. The Administration seeks to increase U.S. assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to modernize and build capabilities for border security with Syria. The FY2015 budget request includes increased Foreign Military Financing assistance, focusing on border surveillance improvements to address the porous Syrian-Lebanese border. U.S. officials aim to build an apolitical, competent state security apparatus for internal stability and public confidence in the LAF and ISF. The U.S. aims to increase assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) for border security with Syria, focusing on modernization and building capabilities. This assistance is intended to create public confidence in the LAF and ISF, potentially enabling the Lebanese government to address political reform and develop a national defense strategy. There are hopes that strengthening the LAF could help contain or dismantle Hezbollah's military capabilities, although past attempts have not been successful. Some Members of Congress have questioned the advisability of funding U.S.-sponsored initiatives in Lebanon. Some Members questioned funding U.S.-sponsored initiatives in Lebanon due to budget constraints and Hezbollah's increased role in the government. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) if controlled by a terrorist organization. General Jean Kahwaji leads the LAF, while Samir Muqbil serves as Defense Minister. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act continues the prohibition on terrorism-related funding and limits the use of U.S. Foreign Military Financing for specific purposes. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act limits the use of U.S. Foreign Military Financing for specific purposes in Lebanon, including professionalizing the LAF, strengthening border security, and combating terrorism. The act requires a detailed spend plan and regular notification to the Appropriations Committees. Some Members support greater conditionality on aid to the LAF, while others believe providing military and security assistance is the best way to weaken Hezbollah and Sunni extremist groups. The best way to weaken Hezbollah and Sunni extremist groups is to provide military and security assistance to the LAF. As of April 3, 2014, there were over 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, with estimates suggesting the actual number could be even higher. Refugees are dispersed throughout different regions in Lebanon, as the country avoids establishing permanent refugee camps. Refugees from Syria have impacted Lebanon's economy, with schools accommodating Syrian children, hospitals filled with Syrian patients, and rising rents. The country faces a $7.5 billion economic loss from 2012 to 2014, with unemployment expected to reach 20 percent. Exports and tourism have also declined significantly. The impact of Syrian refugees on Lebanon's economy has been severe, with a 30 percent decline in October 2012 following a 20 percent increase in October 2010. The budget is struggling, requiring $2.5 billion in direct support for government services and experiencing a $1.5 billion revenue decline. Humanitarian needs related to the crisis are estimated at $1.7 billion for 2013, with only 32 percent funded so far. The burden of the Syrian crisis on Lebanon is becoming overwhelming, with $340.7 million in humanitarian assistance provided by the Administration as of April 2014. efforts are being made to address the deteriorating economic conditions and gaps. The Administration has allocated $76 million in assistance for Lebanon, supporting immediate cash assistance for food, rent, education, healthcare, and shelter. This funding also includes job placement and vocational training programs for refugees and host communities, with a focus on women and vulnerable groups. Additionally, support is provided to UNRWA in Lebanon for Palestinian refugees from Syria. In 2010, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated significant undiscovered oil and gas resources in the Levant Basin, including areas of Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Gaza, and Egypt. Israel has confirmed economically recoverable resources, with natural gas production ongoing from offshore fields. The Leviathan field is expected to start production in 2016-2017, making Israel a significant natural gas exporter in the next decade. U.S. officials are working with Lebanese and Israeli leaders to resolve maritime boundary disagreements that could allow Israel to become a significant exporter of natural gas in the next decade. Lebanon objects to an Israeli-Cypriot agreement on maritime borders, claiming roughly 330 square miles of waters that overlap with areas claimed by Israel. The discovery of gas resources near the maritime boundary has intensified the controversy. The dispute over Lebanese resources near the disputed area has escalated, with both Israeli and Lebanese officials asserting their claims. The Obama Administration is mediating the disagreement, allowing Lebanon to explore non-disputed areas while addressing differences with Israel. Lebanon enacted laws defining its maritime boundaries and created a Petroleum Authority to regulate the oil and gas industry. The Salam cabinet was expected to discuss decrees on territorial waters delineation and exploration blocks in April 2014. The Lebanese government has divided its territorial waters into 10 exploration blocks for future commercial arrangements with investors. Nearly 50 companies are prequalified to bid on exploration licenses, with a bidding round expected to start once decrees are adopted. The Salam cabinet's ministerial statement emphasizes Lebanon's right to its oil and gas resources and pledges to secure maritime borders, especially in disputed areas with Israel. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Diplomacy, Amos Hochstein, expressed support for Lebanon's energy development plans during a visit. Secretary of State for Energy Diplomacy Amos Hochstein emphasized the need to resolve the maritime dispute between Lebanon and Israel to attract investments in the region. He suggested reaching an agreement on the disputed zone before drilling and shared ideas to solve the issue, highlighting the importance of certainty for international oil companies. Waiting to resolve the dispute may deter investments, so prompt action is crucial. Amos Hochstein emphasized the importance of resolving the maritime dispute between Lebanon and Israel to attract foreign investors. He suggested reaching an agreement before drilling to provide certainty for international oil companies. Hochstein acknowledged the potential delay in the bidding process but emphasized the need to move quickly and correctly to avoid risks. The fragile conditions in Lebanon, exacerbated by the conflict in Syria, highlight the urgency of resolving the dispute. Some in the Administration and Congress see the Syrian uprising as a chance to weaken Hezbollah and Iran, potentially leading to increased cooperation with sectarian rivals. The rise of Sunni extremist forces in Lebanon poses new threats for U.S. policymakers. Congressional concerns about the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and their potential to threaten Israel have limited U.S. engagement. The Obama Administration aims to support Lebanon in building national institutions to address security challenges. Lebanese leaders are concerned about potential power vacuums in leadership positions in 2014. Key political issues include the succession of President Michel Sleiman and election law reform proposals. Rising insecurity is a pressing issue in the country. The prevailing political balance in Lebanon reflects communal divisions and differing views on events in Syria. Rising insecurity has increased the need for political compromise, but it remains unlikely. Lebanese leaders are divided on moving beyond sectarian politics, with rival coalitions accusing each other of jeopardizing security by taking sides in Syria's conflict. The conflict in Syria has intensified divisions in Lebanon, with some seeking to perpetuate the confessional system for personal or communal gain.

The conflict in Syria has intensified divisions in Lebanon, with some seeking to perpetuate the confessional system for personal or communal gain. Hezbollah and its allies fear a change in sectarian power dynamics due to conflict or regime change in Syria, while the March 14 coalition aims to undermine its competitors by linking them to the Asad government's violent oppression. U.S. decision makers face choices as the Syrian conflict continues, and Lebanese leaders work towards holding elections and avoiding further crisis. Congress may influence U.S. policy through considerations of foreign assistance funds for Lebanon and proposed arms sales. Lebanon's political balance reflects communal divisions and differing views on events in Syria, leading to rising insecurity and political paralysis. The future of U.S. assistance to Lebanon will be influenced by Lebanese leaders' decisions regarding the Syrian crisis and their use of state security forces. Lebanon remains a battleground for sectarian and geopolitical competition, with ongoing assessments of U.S. engagement in the region."
