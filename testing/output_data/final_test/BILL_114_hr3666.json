    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research Enhancement Act of 2015\". Congress finds that scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis, is a chronic and potentially fatal autoimmune disease affecting about 100,000 Americans. The symptoms vary greatly, and the seriousness depends on the organs affected. Nearly 45 percent of deaths in the developed world are due to chronic fibroproliferative diseases, with scleroderma impacting multiple organ systems. Systemic sclerosis is a key disease for studying fibrosis, with insights likely applicable to other fibrotic illnesses. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration in research on fibrotic diseases to make scientific progress. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research is established to coordinate and collaborate on research for fibrotic diseases, including systemic sclerosis. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research, established to coordinate research on fibrotic diseases, will develop a long-term plan on opportunities and challenges in scleroderma and fibrosis research to be submitted to Congress within 18 months. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research will develop a comprehensive research plan prioritizing fibrosis research opportunities, topic-specific recommendations for each organ or system, and steps for implementation of scleroderma and fibrosis research. Working groups will focus on organs and systems impacted by fibrotic illness, formulating research recommendations. The Commission will be composed of members dedicated to advancing research in this field. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research will be composed of the Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, a representative from the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health, staff from various institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health, and non-Federal medical experts and patient advocates. The Commission will terminate within 2 years of its establishment. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research will include a Scleroderma and Fibrosis Working Group. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research will establish a working group called the Scleroderma and Fibrosis Working Group. This group will oversee the implementation of recommendations and research opportunities, coordinate with relevant institutes, and report to the advisory council as needed. The Scleroderma and Fibrosis Working Group, established by the National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research, consists of representatives from NIH institutes, patient advocates, and researchers to provide input on research recommendations and opportunities. The National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research mandates the Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases to convene the Working Group for meetings at least three times a year. The Director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases must report to Congress on the implementation of the long-range plan within 2 years of the National Commission on Scleroderma and Fibrosis Research being established."
