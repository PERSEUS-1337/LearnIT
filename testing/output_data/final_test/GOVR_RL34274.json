It played a crucial role in democracy by enabling communication between constituents and lawmakers. While alternative communication methods have emerged, Members of Congress still use the franking privilege to connect with their constituents today. The franking privilege in the United States has a history of controversy due to concerns about cost, abuse, and its influence on congressional elections. Congress has amended the franking statutes over time to address these issues. The five dimensions defining the franking privileges include who is entitled to frank mail. Since 1789, Congress has made numerous statutory changes to the franking privilege, which can be defined by five dimensions: who is entitled to frank mail, what can be franked, how much material can be sent, where it can be sent, and when it can be sent. Various legislative arrangements have resulted from changes to the franking privilege, with proposals for future changes potentially altering some dimensions. Other bodies, such as the House and Senate, the U.S. Postal Service, and committees like the House Administration Committee and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, have also played a role in reforming the governance of the franking privilege. The franking privilege, rooted in 17th century Great Britain, was granted to officials for free mail. In 1775, the First Continental Congress gave Members mailing privileges to communicate with constituents. Under the Articles of Confederation in 1782, Congress extended the privilege to military officers. After the Constitution, the First Congress established federal post offices, continuing the franking privilege. Members could send mail under the Post Office Act of 1792. The Post Office Act of 1792 granted Members the franking privilege to send and receive mail up to two ounces in weight during Congress sessions. Subsequent legislation extended this privilege to specific days before and after sessions, allowing for unlimited franking of newspapers and documents printed by Congress. Franked mail played a crucial role in national politics by distributing government information and serving as a proxy for the Washington press corps. Members of Congress had the franking privilege to send and receive mail for free, leading to a significant amount of mail being sent and received. In 1845, comprehensive franking legislation was passed to ease the burden on the Post Office Department. Members continued to have their franking privilege paid for out of postal revenue. After the repeal of the accounting system in 1847, the franking privilege reverted to the pre-1845 system. Congress abolished the privilege in 1873 due to perceived abuse. Members were then provided with special stamps for official government communications. Restrictions on franking were gradually relaxed over the following years, allowing for free mailing of Congressional Record, printed speeches, reports, seeds, and agricultural reports. In 1891, Congress allowed Members to send mail under their frank to any officer of the federal government. In 1895, Congress restored the general right of Members to mail under the frank, including unsolicited mail to constituents. The franking weight limit was raised to four ounces in 1904. In 1906, Congress prohibited the loan or use of the frank by unauthorized individuals. In 1953, Congress began reimbursing the Post Office Department for franking costs to promote fiscal responsibility. The Department started systematic accounting of congressional franked mail costs. In 1961, legislation allowed Members to frank mail to \"postal patrons\" without a name or address, leading to objections and a repeal in 1962. After negotiation, a compromise was reached where each chamber could handle \"postal patron\" mailings as they saw fit. The 1961 legislation expanded the definition of \"official business\" for franked mail, allowing Members to send newsletters and constituent reports. The Post Office Department monitored and regulated free mailings during this period. In 1971, the Postal Service stopped providing advisory opinions on franking privileges, leading to lawsuits in 1973 over alleged abuses by Members of Congress. The lawsuits challenged the constitutionality of the franking privilege. In response to legal challenges and concerns about Congress losing control over the franking privilege, a new comprehensive franking statute was passed in 1973. It tightened definitions of eligible mail, prohibited mass mailings close to elections, and created the Franking Commission to oversee franking use in the House. The Franking Commission was established in 1973 to oversee the use of the frank in the House and the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct was designated to make decisions regarding the franking privilege in the Senate. The Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards was authorized to issue regulations, provide guidance, and handle complaints against Members of Congress who violated franking laws. Franking reform continued in 1977 with amendments to House and Senate rules. The House Commission on Administrative Review recommended reforms to the franking privilege in 1976, which were subsequently adopted by the House and Senate. Despite efforts to address abuse, the cost of franking increased significantly between FY1970 and FY1988, leading to individual limits on Members' mail costs. In response to the increasing cost of franking between FY1970 and FY1988, Congress placed individual limits on Members' mail costs and required public disclosure of expenditures. The Senate and House established separate franking allowances for Senators and Representatives, respectively, with tighter restrictions on mass mailings. Since October 1992, Members have been prohibited from sending mass mailings outside their districts. In response to the increasing cost of franking, Congress placed limits on Members' mail costs and required public disclosure of expenditures. Senators have a $50,000 limit per session for mass mailings, while Representatives have a consolidated allowance called the Member's Representational Allowance (MRA). House regulations were amended in 1999 to allow unlimited use of funds in any allocation category. In 1996, the pre-election cutoff for Representative mass mailings was extended to 90 days. During the 109th Congress, restrictions were placed on mass mailings made by House committees due to misuse allegations. The committee funding resolution limited House committees to a $5,000 franking cost and prohibited the use of committee funds for mass mailing production without specific exceptions related to committee business. The chairman or ranking minority Member of a committee must submit material samples to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards for approval under the new regulations. During the 106th and 110th Congresses, the Committee on House Administration implemented restrictions on unsolicited mass communications, defining them as communications to 500 or more people with substantial identical content. Emails to constituents on subscriber lists were exempt from pre-election or mass mailing restrictions. The Franking Commission, established in 1973, requires Members to disclose mass communication volume and cost quarterly. It offers advisory opinions on frank eligibility for 6,000 to 8,000 mail pieces annually, regulates content and design of franked mail, and handles complaints, with the power to punish Members for violations. Currently, the franking privilege is granted to Members of Congress, the Vice President, certain congressional officers, former Members of Congress, former Presidents, former Vice Presidents, widows of Presidents, and relatives of Members who die in office. The privilege has historically been extended to high-ranking executive branch officers, postmasters, military leaders, and soldiers during wartime. The Vice President is eligible for the franking privilege under terms similar to Members of Congress. The Vice President was granted the franking privilege in 1792, and again in 1895 with restrictions similar to Members of Congress. Currently, various officers of the legislative branch are granted the franking privilege, along with former Members of Congress for a 90-day period. Former Members of Congress were granted the franking privilege for a 90-day period after leaving office. The privilege was authorized in 1847, repealed in 1863, restored in 1872, abolished in 1873, and granted reduced rate postage in 1875. The expiration date was changed to December 1 in 1877, and the privilege was restored in 1895. In 1975, Congress enacted the current law, authorizing the franking privilege for former Members for 90 days following the expiration of their term in office, and only for the sending of mail related to the closing of their office. Members who served as Speaker of the House are granted enhanced franking privileges for five years after leaving office. Former Speakers of the House are granted enhanced franking privileges for five years after leaving Congress, allowing them to send mail related to their official duties and receive public documents ordered by Congress. This privilege was first authorized in 1970 and later made permanent in 1974. In 1993, Congress limited the franking privilege to five years. Spouses and certain relatives of Members of Congress are eligible for the privilege when a Member dies in office. The privilege was extended to the spouse of a deceased Member in 1968, and in 1981, it was broadened to include immediate family members if there is no surviving spouse. Former Presidents and former Speakers of the House also have franking privileges granted by statute. In 1973, Congress enacted legislation to provide franking privileges to all surviving spouses of former Presidents. Prior to 1973, few restrictions were placed on the franking privilege of former Presidents or their widows. The current privilege applies only to nonpolitical mail within the United States and its territories. Since 1873, officials in the executive branch have used penalty mail for official government correspondence, with no limitations on volume or weight. The franking privilege was historically granted to heads of departments, the President, Vice-President, high-ranking military officials, and local postmasters. Postmasters considered the franking privilege as important as their salary, leading to a significant number quitting when it was temporarily abolished in 1845. The privilege was restored in 1847 but was ultimately abolished in 1873, restricting postmasters to penalty mail for official government communications. The franking privilege, authorized in 1776, allows free mail for government officials. Critics argue it is financially wasteful, abused for personal gain, gives unfair advantages in elections, and is outdated. Despite reforms reducing costs, critics still view it as an unnecessary expense. During FY2015, Congress spent $8.3 million on official mail, with House official mail costs at $6.8 million and Senate official mail costs at $1.5 million. In FY2014, Congress spent $16.9 million on official mail, with House costs at $15.1 million and Senate costs at $1.8 million. Expenditures show a historical pattern of spending less on official mail during non-election years. Reform efforts in the past 30 years have significantly reduced overall franking expenditures in both election and non-election years. Even-numbered-year franking costs decreased by over 85% from $113.4 million in FY1988 to $16.9 million in FY2014, while odd-numbered-year franking costs decreased by over 90% from $89.5 million in FY1989 to $8.3 million in FY2015. House mail costs dropped from $77.9 million in FY1988 to $6.8 million in FY2015, and Senate costs decreased from $43.6 million in FY1984 to $1.5 million in FY2015. Concerns about the public expense of franking have existed since the early days of the nation. In the 1840s, Congress was franking a significant amount of mail, leading to strain on the Post Office Department. This, combined with other free mail privileges, forced higher rates for paid mail and led to calls for restrictions on franking and reduced postage rates. During the 19th century, concerns about the abuse of the franking privilege for private and political gain were common. Reports to Congress indicated that laws prohibiting private use of the frank were widely disregarded, with most people using it for personal convenience or for friends. Private companies also frequently used envelopes with the frank on them, leading to calls for restrictions on the privilege. During the 19th century, the franking privilege was often abused for personal and political gain. John Quincy Adams noted that Senators ignored regulations requiring verification of their signatures for franking. The privilege was also used for party-based patronage benefits, with instances of franking abuse, such as Amos Kendall franking 13,000 letters to postmasters. Current regulations now restrict overt franking abuse. Regulations on the franking privilege now restrict abuse common in the 19th century. Critics today mainly focus on the incumbency advantage in elections, arguing that franked mail gives incumbent Members an unfair advantage over challengers. Critics claim that most franked mail is essentially publicly funded campaign material, with incumbents spending as much on mail as challengers do on their entire campaigns. Critics argue that franked mail gives incumbent Members an unfair advantage in elections, with some using it to influence election outcomes. Despite historical concerns about unnecessary costs, the franking privilege has been used to signal to constituents that a Member is working hard on their behalf. Critics suggest that modern technology has made the franking privilege outdated. The franking privilege allows Members of Congress to communicate with constituents using modern technology like email, telephone, radio, television, and the Internet. Supporters argue that it serves important democratic purposes and helps counteract the media advantage of the President. It enables better communication between Members and individual constituents. The franking privilege allows Members of Congress to communicate with constituents for greater accountability and information sharing. Proponents argue that it enhances representative accountability by facilitating direct communication with citizens on legislative matters. They believe that without this privilege, most Members would not be able to afford direct communication with constituents. Historically, the franking privilege was viewed as a right of the constituents, not the Member. The franking privilege, historically seen as a right of constituents, allows Members of Congress to communicate directly with citizens. President Andrew Jackson emphasized the importance of the Post Office Department in disseminating knowledge and gathering public sentiment. Proponents argue that free use of the mails enables Members to inform constituents about town-hall meetings, congressional developments, and other civic matters. The franking privilege allows Members of Congress to communicate directly with constituents about town-hall meetings, congressional developments, and civic concerns. Historically, the postal system has been a key channel for citizens to receive political news, with a large proportion of information being delivered through franked documents, reports, and proceedings of Congress. Scholars argue that the rise of mass media, particularly television, has changed the way political news is disseminated. The rise of mass media, especially television, has given the President an advantage over Congress in terms of communication. Proponents of franking argue that this imbalance can be addressed by allowing Members to use the franking privilege, which defines who can send mail, what can be sent, how much, where, and when. The franking privilege allows certain individuals, including the Vice-President, Members of Congress, and former Presidents, to send mail without cost. Congress has historically adjusted the scope of the privilege, with no general restrictions on its use currently in place. The franking privilege allows certain individuals, including Members of Congress, to send mail without cost. Restrictions are in place for mass mailing before federal and primary elections, with limitations on content such as soliciting money or votes. Currently, Members of Congress are limited in the amount of franked mail they can send based on cost, determined by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. In the past, there were fewer regulations on the content of franked mail, with restrictions on pictures, name usage, and biographical material. Members of Congress receive an allotment for franked mail from appropriations determined by committees. In the Senate, the allowance is managed by the Committee on Rules and Administration, and in the House, by the Committee on House Administration. The mail allowance is part of each Senator's \"personnel and official expense accounts,\" along with funds for office staff and expenses. Since 1999, Representatives have a combined fund for franked mail, office staff, and expenses. Since October 1992, Representatives have been prohibited from sending mass mailings outside their districts due to a court ruling. Critics of the franking privilege have proposed various ideas to abolish or modify it, with bills introduced regularly since the 1830s. While most proponents do not advocate for a complete ban on free mail, there is disagreement on what system should replace the franking privilege. Some options to replace the franking privilege include a postage stamp allowance for Members or using the penalty mail system. The stamp allowance may not directly address current concerns, while the penalty mail system could reduce costs but limit communication with constituents. A ban on unsolicited mass mailings could save money and alleviate concerns about congressional mail costs. A proposed legislation, such as H.R. 2687 and H.R. 5151, aimed to restrict mass mailings by Representatives to save costs and address concerns about the impact on elections. The bills would limit certain types of mailings but not affect Senators' mailings. A ban on unsolicited mass mailings could also be a cost-saving measure. A ban on unsolicited mass mailings could potentially save millions of dollars in congressional mail costs and reduce concerns about the effect on elections. Some critics have raised concerns about the franking privilege and bills have been introduced to extend the pre-election ban on mass mailings. Some critics of the franking privilege have raised concerns about its impact on elections and suggest giving challengers in congressional elections the same franking privileges as incumbents. Advocates believe this would level the playing field by allowing non-incumbent candidates to reach constituents. Opponents argue that challengers using the frank for campaign purposes would violate current restrictions on political use. Critics propose reducing the mail allowance for Senators and Representatives, with each Senator's allowance based on a formula equal to the cost of one first-class mailing to every address in their state. Senators and Representatives have allowances for mass mailings, with Senators limited to $50,000 per fiscal year. In the House, Representatives' mail allowance is part of their overall budget. Critics suggest limiting mass mailings for Representatives as well. Current disclosure rules require transparency in franking costs, with advocates pushing for more detailed disclosure. H.R. 5151 in the 111th Congress aimed to require detailed expense breakdowns for mass communications by House Members. Another proposal suggested displaying individual costs on each mailing piece. H.R. 2788 in the 110th Congress wanted each piece of franked mail in a mass mailing to include a statement with the total production and mailing cost. This legislation would not have impacted Senators' mass mailings. The franking privilege has been in place since the nation's founding, with legal restrictions on its use regularly enforced. The franking privilege, in place since the nation's founding, has seen changes by Congress over time. Restrictions on who can frank mail and what can be sent have been both tightened and loosened. Despite the availability of alternative communication methods, Members of Congress still use the frank to connect with constituents. Critics raise concerns about wastefulness and incumbency protection. Recent proposed changes to the franking privilege aim to reduce wastefulness and incumbency protection concerns by decreasing the volume of franked mail and the impact of mass mailings on elections, while ensuring Members can still effectively communicate with constituents."
