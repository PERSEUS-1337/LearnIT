The district must comply with Article XIII\u2009D of the California Constitution when levying charges. It can provide watermaster services to water rights holders on eligible parcels through agreements. The holders must pay in full before receiving the service to ensure no increase in costs for other parcels. Amounts owed to the county for services provided to the district must be included in the budget for each watermaster service area. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the unique water problems in the Big Valley Water District area, allowing for conservation and use of water for public good. No reimbursement is required as local agencies can levy charges to cover mandated services."
