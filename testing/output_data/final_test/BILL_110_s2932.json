    "content": "The Act titled \"Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008\" highlights the importance of poison control centers in the United States in preventing injuries and deaths from poisoning. In 2007, over 4,000,000 calls were managed by these centers, providing crucial emergency public health information to all people, including underserved populations. Poisoning is identified as the second most common form of unintentional death in the country. In the United States, there are between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 poison exposures annually, with 60% involving children under 6 years old. Poisoning leads to 285,000 hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and over 26,000 fatalities in 2005. Fatalities from accidental or unknown poisonings have tripled since 1990, with 26,858 deaths reported in 2005. Funding for programs to address this increasing trend is crucial. In 2004, The Institute of Medicine recommended amending the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act to provide sufficient funding for the Poison Prevention and Control System. Sustaining funding for poison control centers will reduce inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other costly healthcare services. In 2005, poison control centers saved over $525 million in Federal health care program costs. Federal funding for poison control centers is less than 11% of their annual expenditures, yet they save over $1 billion annually for Federal health care programs. Real-time data from poison control centers is crucial for detecting and responding to contamination in the environment. In the event of a terrorist event, poison control centers are critical for providing accurate medical information and public health emergency response for patients exposed to harmful agents. The reauthorization of the national toll-free number for poison control centers includes coordination and assistance for establishing and maintaining the hotline, with an authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2009. The reauthorization includes funding of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and $700,000 annually from 2010 to 2014 for the nationwide toll-free phone number under section 1271(a). The Secretary is mandated to conduct a national media campaign to promote poison control center utilization and educate the public and healthcare providers on poison prevention and resources available. The Secretary may contract with public or private entities for a nationwide poison prevention and control center awareness campaign, including developing materials, public service announcements, and other educational activities. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of the media campaign through baseline measures and benchmarks. The Secretary may contract for a nationwide poison prevention and control center awareness campaign, with evaluations submitted to Congress annually. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009-2014. Additionally, the Poison Control Center Grant Program is reauthorized under Section 1273 of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary can award grants to poison control centers and professional organizations for prevention, treatment recommendations, and operational requirements. Funds can also be used for establishing best practices in poison prevention and control outreach programs. The Secretary can award grants to poison control centers and professional organizations for various purposes, including developing patient management guidelines, enhancing toxic exposure surveillance, improving technology capabilities, fostering public health utilization of poison data, expanding toxicologic expertise, and increasing the capacity of poison control centers. The Secretary can award grants to poison control centers to improve their capacity to respond during national crises or public health emergencies. Centers must be certified by a professional organization or a State government to receive a grant. The Secretary may grant a waiver of certification requirements for noncertified poison control centers applying for a grant, with a limit of 5 years for the waiver and renewal. This is in line with the Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008. Amounts allocated to poison control centers must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, or local funds. Centers must maintain their expenditure levels when using grant funds. $27,500,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2009, with $28,600,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014. Up to 8% of the funds can be used for coordination, dissemination, technical assistance, and program evaluation. The amendment authorizes funds for poison control centers to supplement existing funds, with a focus on coordination, dissemination, technical assistance, and program evaluation. The amendment is effective from the enactment date and applies to grants from January 1, 2009 onwards. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
