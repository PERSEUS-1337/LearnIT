It emphasizes the need for Federal agencies to minimize hardships on local governments when acquiring private lands for national interest. The Federal Land Acquisition Impact Relief Act of 1993 states that Federal agencies should only acquire private land if it is in the national interest, based on a thorough analysis of benefits and costs, and without causing a net loss of local tax revenues. In this Act, \"agency\" refers to an Executive agency as defined in title 5, United States Code. \"Unit of local government\" includes counties, municipalities, or the District of Columbia with tax authority. \"Real property taxes\" encompass all taxes applicable to real property, including special assessments and charges. The term \"State\" in this Act refers to any of the several States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, or any U.S. territory or possession. SEC. 5. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS. Prior to acquiring private land, the agency must conduct an economic impact analysis, including assessing alternative acquisition methods, tax payment loss to local government, effects on services and employment, and limitations on community expansion. The agency must consult with the local government during this process. The agency must conduct an economic impact analysis before acquiring private land, considering alternative acquisition methods, tax payment loss to local government, effects on services and employment, and limitations on community expansion. They must also consult with the local government during this process and provide an opportunity for notice and comment. SEC. 6. TAX EQUIVALENCY PAYMENTS. Tax Equivalency Payments require agencies to pay annual real property taxes to local governments for private land acquired after October 1, 1992, based on the current market value of the parcel. The initial value is determined by the purchase price per acre multiplied by the number of acres acquired, with adjustments allowed by the local government. Tax Equivalency Payments require agencies to pay annual real property taxes to local governments for private land acquired after October 1, 1992, based on the current market value of the parcel. Special farm or forest use formulas are not applied to the value of the parcel. If an agency fails to make a payment, the unit of local government can file a civil action against the agency in a district court of the United States to enforce this section. The Act requires agencies to make tax equivalency payments to local governments for land acquired after October 1, 1992. Payments will be reduced if other federal laws provide payments for the same land. Appropriations are authorized for agencies to carry out the Act, and it becomes effective on October 1, 1994."
