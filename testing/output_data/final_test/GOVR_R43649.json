    "content": "California has been experiencing more dry years than wet years since 2008, with current drought conditions labeled as \"exceptional\" and \"extreme\" by the U.S. Drought Monitor. Water managers are facing challenges due to below-normal surface water storage in reservoirs and declining groundwater levels. Despite some improvement in the water year outlook after March rains, concerns remain about the duration and long-term impacts of the drought. The drought in California has led to exceptional conditions, impacting water supplies, agriculture, and ecosystems. Farmers are fallowing lands, cities are affected, and voluntary water use cutbacks of 20% have been requested by the Governor. Congressional interest in addressing drought effects has increased, with several bills introduced in the 113th Congress. Several bills introduced in the 113th Congress aim to address the drought in California and other regions. S. 2198 (Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014) and H.R. 3964 (Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act) have passed the Senate and House respectively. These bills focus on the coordinated operation of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP) to address water supply issues in California. The operation of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP) in California has been a focus of interest for Congress and the Administration. H.R. 3964, titled the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act, was introduced in response to the drought. It passed the House on February 5, 2014, and is similar to H.R. 1837 from the previous Congress. Title I of H.R. 3964 aims to improve Central Valley Project water reliability by amending the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. Changes include broadening the purposes for water use, ensuring water dedicated to fish and wildlife is replaced by 2018 at a low cost, altering fish definitions, expanding the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund usage, reducing revenues into the fund, and mandating CVP and SWP operation according to a 1994 agreement. Title II of H.R. 3964 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to cease implementation of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Agreement, remove the salmon restoration requirement, and satisfy obligations to maintain fish below Friant Dam. Title IV of H.R. 3964 focuses on Bay-Delta Watershed Water Rights Preservation and Protection. It aims to provide assurances of water rights protections for those with senior water rights to the Central Valley Project (CVP) and implement a new shortage policy for certain north-of-Delta CVP water service contracts. The title also addresses the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts and allows for accelerated repayment of outstanding obligations. Title V of the Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2014 asserts Federal supremacy to protect existing water rights in the coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP). It also adjusts a Wild and Scenic River boundary to potentially increase storage at Exchequer Dam. S. 2198, passed in May 2014, focuses on addressing water supply and drought issues in California. The bill focuses on addressing water supply and drought issues in California. It includes sections on the Table of Contents, Findings related to emergency decision-making requirements, definitions of terms, and directives to the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and the Interior, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The bill aims to address water supply and drought issues in California by directing the Secretaries to provide maximum water supplies to various contractors. Section 4(c) outlines specific project-related and operational actions to be implemented in California. Section 4(c) directs the Secretaries to ensure the Delta Gates remain open during peak tide flood periods for water supply and quality benefits. Data on operations' impact on species, water quality, and supply will be collected and assessed. Section 4(c)(2)(B) requires an assessment of collected data and recommendations from the Director of NMFS to potentially change CVP and SWP operations for fishery, water quality, and water supply benefits. Section 4(c)(3)(A) mandates turbidity control strategies to increase water deliveries without harming delta smelt. Section 4(c)(3)(B) directs management of reverse flow in OMR to minimize impacts on species according to BiOps. Section 4(c)(4) of the BiOp dated December 15, 2008, and the NMFS BiOp for salmonids dated June 4, 2009, aims to minimize water supply reductions for the CVP and SWP by implementing a 1:1 inflow to export ratio for increased San Joaquin River flows resulting from water transfers and exchanges. This flow measurement at Vernalis from April 1 through May 31 each year is tied to the governor's drought emergency declaration. Additionally, Section 4(c)(5) directs the Secretaries to issue permit decisions within 30 days for temporary barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to improve water quantity and quality for SWP and CVP South-of-Delta water contractors and other users, with a focus on providing species benefits and protection. Section 4(c)(6)(A) and (B) of the BiOp directs FWS and Reclamation to complete NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days for water transfers in California. Section 4(c)(7) allows for pilot projects to increase water supplies. The Interior Department is to provide grants for pilot projects to increase water in reservoirs in drought-affected river basins, including the Colorado River basin. The Secretary will work with states, possibly excluding California, on activities in the Upper Division of the Colorado River. Rescheduled water supplies in San Luis Reservoir and Millerton Reservoir must be maintained unless storage capacity limits prevent it. The Secretaries are directed to maximize water supply without causing land subsidence or violating water quality standards. The Secretaries would use funding from the Water Assistance Program or WaterSMART Program to meet contract water supply needs of CVP refuges through water conservation measures, conveyance facilities, and wells. Section 4(c)(9)(B) would redirect water from refuges to CVP contractors. Section 4(c)(10) authorizes a study on salt cedar biocontrol activities' effectiveness on increasing water supplies and habitat improvement. Section 4(c)(11) directs WaterSMART grant funding allocation to California. Section 4(c)(11) prioritizes WaterSMART grant funding for emergency drinking supplies, preventing crop loss, minimizing economic losses from drought, and providing conservation tools with immediate water supply benefits in California. Section 4(c)(12) directs the implementation of offsite upstream projects in coordination with California agencies to offset the effects on ESA listed species. Section 4(c)(13) mandates the use of scientific tools to identify and implement changes in water project operations. Section 4 of the bill applies to federal agencies involved in approving water projects, including the Corps of Engineers. It directs agencies to use expedited procedures for final decisions on projects providing additional water or addressing drought conditions in California. The Secretary of the Interior must convene a \"final project decision meeting\" with relevant federal agency heads to approve emergency water supply projects within 7 days of a request. The agency head must issue a final decision within 10 days after the meeting. The Secretary can call a meeting at any time, regardless of a resolution request. Section 5 of the act directs agencies to consult with the Council on Environmental Quality to develop alternative arrangements to comply with NEPA during emergencies. Section 6 addresses California's use of funds for water infrastructure projects, prioritizing projects that provide additional water supplies to areas at risk of inadequate supply or droughts. The bill directs the state to prioritize funding for water infrastructure projects to improve resilience to droughts. It also authorizes 40-year loan repayments to the SRFs and does not preempt any California state laws related to water rights protections. Authorities under certain sections of the bill would expire when the governor suspends the drought. H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 aim to increase water supplies for agricultural and urban users in California. The bills differ in their approaches, but both focus on providing more water for users of the CVP and SWP. They prioritize authorizing activities to increase water supplies while considering environmental needs. The changes would vary in duration and would only be authorized during drought conditions. H.R. 3964 aims to increase water deliveries to California's CVP contractors, potentially easing restrictions on water operations and preempting some federal and state laws. It could result in greater water availability for users, particularly those south of the Delta. The bill would establish the 1994 Bay Delta Accord as a basis for these changes. S. 2198 directs federal agencies to maximize water supplies for California water users by approving projects quickly within legal constraints. The proposed legislation, S. 2198, directs federal agencies to maximize water supplies for California water users within legal constraints. However, the potential effects of this directive are unclear, as agencies must balance increasing storage with compliance with laws and regulations. The long-term impacts on species viability and water quality may not be known for several years. There is debate over whether agencies should prioritize maximizing water supplies or consider the impact on species in the future. The bills H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 propose different approaches to increasing water supply reliability during dry years. H.R. 3964 aims to expedite water transfers without environmental requirements, while S. 2198 sets a limit on permit decision days without waiving environmental requirements. The bill directs the head of FWS and the Commissioner of Reclamation to complete necessary NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days for final permit decisions on water transfers related to fallowing nonpermanent crops in California. It also allows water transfer requests associated with fallowing to maximize water supplies for non-habitat use, as long as they comply with federal law and regulations. The bill streamlines the permit process by stating that compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act suffices for NEPA compliance for projects related to the CVP or water delivery from the CVP. H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 aim to expedite final permit decisions for water transfers in California related to the Central Valley Project (CVP) and water delivery. The bills also require rescheduled water supplies in the San Luis Reservoir to be held for the following year by water users. Additionally, S. 2198 directs agencies to consult with the Council on Environmental Quality to develop alternative arrangements to comply with NEPA during emergencies. The bills H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 aim to allow south-of-Delta water service contractors to reschedule unused CVP water for storage and subsequent use in the following year. The Secretary of the Interior would hold rescheduled water supplies in San Luis Reservoir and Millerton Reservoir, unless storage capacity limitations prevent it. These bills aim to increase water supplies in reservoirs by authorizing potential increases in water storage capacity or implementing projects to increase water in existing reservoirs. The bills H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 aim to increase water supplies in reservoirs by authorizing potential increases in water storage capacity or implementing projects that would partner with local joint power authorities. Federal funds would not be used for these projects, but federal agencies may participate in pilot projects to address drought conditions in regional river basins. The differences between H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 lie in their approaches to providing and allocating water supplies. S. 2198 authorizes actions to keep Delta Gates open and states it won't override state water rights laws. H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 differ in their approaches to water supply allocation. H.R. 3964 would preempt state and federal laws to reallocate water supplies, amending existing laws to address water conveyance and supplies for users. This includes provisions that could decrease project water for fish and wildlife, alter enhancement activities, reduce water transfer limitations, repeal pricing formulas, and change restoration provisions. H.R. 3964 aims to expedite water transfers by prohibiting certain environmental requirements and state/federal laws that could reduce water supplies. It also seeks to repeal authority related to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement. H.R. 3964 directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease implementing the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Agreement, amends the purpose of the Act to focus on river restoration, removes provisions for physical restoration, and modifies Friant Dam operations. The bill's changes would persist after the drought declaration is lifted. H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 both address issues related to water management in California, but each bill focuses on different provisions. H.R. 3964 makes extensive changes to federal reclamation law and state-federal relationships, while S. 2198 focuses on mandated actions for water conveyance in the Delta. The objective of H.R. 3964 and S. 2198 is to increase water deliveries and reliability for users, particularly those south of the Delta. The bills propose various measures such as altering Delta gates operations, maintaining a 1:1 inflow to export ratio for San Joaquin River flows, and controlling turbidity at pumps. These proposed solutions aim to address drought conditions in California and raise questions about how to balance water supply increases with environmental concerns under existing laws. Neither bill guarantees a specific amount of water delivery. S. 2198 and H.R. 3964 aim to increase water deliveries south of the Delta by proposing measures to maximize water supplies and storage. The bills provide broad discretion to federal agencies to enhance water use while adhering to laws and regulations, but the specific impact on water delivery remains uncertain. H.R. 3964 proposes measures to redirect water from fish and wildlife to agricultural and municipal users. It would set the 1994 Bay Delta Accord as the operational guide for the CVP and SWP, waiving federal ESA regulations. The exact amount of additional water available would depend on various factors. H.R. 3964 proposes operational flexibility to comply with federal ESA regulations, protecting water users from losing water supplies for future species listings. The Accord ensures no additional water costs for listed species, with additional water provided by the Federal government on a willing seller basis. The Accord in 1994 provided water supply reliability and discretion to export water to users. H.R. 3964 aims to further these advantages by exempting operations from ESA regulations and increasing water deliveries for users. It includes provisions for replacement water for CVP contractors, developing a plan to increase CVP yield, and authorizing non-federal water storage projects. Both bills support reallocating water supplies to users over environmental considerations. Under H.R. 3964, laws and regulations dedicating water supplies for environmental uses would be exempted, allowing federal agencies to supply more water to users. This could potentially harm listed species in the region as ESA regulations would be disregarded. The bill aims to strictly adhere to the Bay-Delta Accord but may lower requirements for sustaining endangered fish species in the Delta. Some argue that existing Biological Opinions also limit operational flexibility for water supply purposes. Opinions limit operational flexibility for water supply purposes, and restrictions have not significantly impacted declining species. Pumping operations under H.R. 3964 could reduce water supplies for fish and ecosystems, with unknown environmental consequences. S. 2198 aims to maximize water supplies during the drought, potentially benefiting agricultural and municipal users. The actions to maximize water supplies for users may have unintended consequences for species in the Bay-Delta, as they might not account for long-term effects. Maximizing water supplies could benefit water users during drought conditions, but the long-term effects on species viability, recreation, and water quality are unclear. Provisions under H.R. 3964 would have lasting effects beyond the current drought, potentially impacting various factors. The proposed bill, H.R. 3964, could have long-term environmental effects in the Bay-Delta region by removing ESA and state protections, potentially impacting water planning and habitat conservation efforts. It would set precedents by waiving ESA and state laws to prioritize water deliveries for federal contractors, potentially leading to exceptions to ESA guidelines and prioritizing natural resource use over species concerns. S. 2198 prioritizes natural resource use over species concerns during the current drought declaration, potentially impacting the environment. It encourages federal agencies to meet minimal environmental requirements under existing laws without authorizing new appropriations for funding. H.R. 3964 authorizes changes under existing laws to generate water for users and redirects funding to water districts. It places less emphasis on implementing projects compared to S. 2198 and requires studies that could lead to future construction projects. Both bills prioritize supplying additional water to users over other uses. Both bills prioritize supplying additional water to users over other uses, potentially limiting agencies' flexibility in balancing resource needs. S. 2198's directive to maximize water supplies for users as a priority may set a precedent, but existing laws address factors like water quality and species needs. The long-term effects of S. 2198 will be limited as most provisions will expire after the California drought declaration is lifted. The directive to maximize water supplies for users in H.R. 3964 could set a precedent by prioritizing water supplies over other competing uses. This may limit agencies' flexibility in managing water supplies, especially during droughts. The bill contains provisions that differ from S. 2198, such as waiving ESA and state laws to increase water deliveries for federal contractors. These changes could have significant implications for future water supply shortages. The H.R. 3964 bill proposes significant changes that could set a precedent for addressing ESA provisions on a species or region basis. It also prohibits any state or federal law from reducing water supplies beyond those allowed in the Bay-Delta Accord and declares federal supremacy over water management to protect existing water rights. These changes could potentially serve as a model for similar legislation in other areas."
