The crisis of displaced Iraqis is a threat to regional stability in the Middle East. Violence in Iraq has led to a humanitarian crisis with approximately 4,500,000 displaced Iraqis by the end of 2007.

The United States should lead in funding assistance for displaced persons and refugees, supporting their rights and observing the principle of non-refoulement.
