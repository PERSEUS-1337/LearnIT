    "content": "For FY2019, Congress has enacted a special provision to allow for the issuance of additional H-2B visas beyond the annual cap of 66,000 in response to high demand. DHS is making an extra 30,000 H-2B visas available, following previous years where additional visas were authorized. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 defines categories of nonimmigrant aliens admitted to the U.S. for a temporary period and specific purpose. The H-2B visa program allows for the temporary admission of foreign workers to the United States for nonagricultural labor if unemployed U.S. workers are not available. The program is limited to designated countries and involves multiple agencies in its administration. The H-2B visa program is administered by multiple agencies including DHS, DOL, and DOS. Work must be temporary and meet specific criteria for employer's need. Employers must receive labor certification to bring H-2B workers to the United States. The H-2B visa program requires employers to obtain labor certification from DOL to bring workers to the United States. A new registration requirement was established in April 2015 as a preliminary step in the labor certification process. Employers must demonstrate temporary need through this registration before submitting a labor certification application. Additionally, employers must submit a job order to the state workforce agency for recruitment of U.S. workers. To grant labor certification, the employer must show a lack of qualified U.S. workers and ensure that hiring foreign workers won't harm U.S. workers' wages or conditions. H-2B employers must offer required wages, a \"three-fourths guarantee\" of employment, and cover visa and transportation costs for workers. Health insurance coverage is not mandatory. After receiving labor certification, a prospective H-2B employer can submit a petition to DHS to bring in foreign workers. If approved, workers can apply for H-2B visas at a U.S. embassy or consulate. H-2B workers can be accompanied by eligible family members and can stay for a maximum of three consecutive years. The INA grants enforcement authority for the H-2B program to DHS, which has delegated it to DOL's WHD. Prospective H-2B employers must accurately indicate the starting and ending dates of their need for workers to attract qualified U.S. workers. The employer must file separate labor certification applications for each date of need for H-2B workers. An exception allows seafood industry employers to bring in workers within 120 days of the starting date of need. The H-2B program has a cap of 66,000 visas per fiscal year, with a limit of 33,000 for the first six months. Certain categories of H-2B workers are exempt from additional U.S. worker recruitment between day 90 and day 120. The H-2B program has a cap of 66,000 visas per fiscal year, with exemptions for certain categories of workers. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address the H-2B cap, with provisions enacted to issue visas beyond the cap. The INA was amended to establish a temporary exemption from the H-2B statutory cap for returning workers. The provision exempted H-2B returning workers who had been counted against the cap in the three prior fiscal years. This exemption was extended for FY2007 and reinstated for FY2016. Multiple bills were introduced in Congress to enact temporary or permanent H-2B returning worker exemptions from the cap. The 116th Congress introduced a bill for H-2B returning workers, allowing additional visas beyond the statutory cap based on the needs of American businesses. This provision was also included in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The FY2019 provision authorizes DHS to make additional H-2B visas available for FY2019 based on the needs of American businesses, up to the highest number of H\u20132B returning workers in any fiscal year. The DHS-DOL rule limits the additional visas to H-2B returning workers, following a similar provision in FY2017. In FY2019, DHS can provide more H-2B visas for American businesses, up to the highest number of H\u20132B returning workers in any fiscal year. DHS explained that the provision only applies to H-2B workers entering the US on visas, not those seeking a change of status. The agency determined 64,716 as the appropriate maximum number of additional H-2B visas authorized under the special FY2017 provision. The FY2017 numerical increase was limited to 15,000. The FY2017 numerical increase for H-2B visas was limited to 15,000 based on the number of returning workers approved in FY2016. The Secretary used recent figures as a basis for the maximum limitation. DHS decided to restrict eligibility for the additional H-2B workers to certain U.S. businesses. The FY2018 rule authorized up to 15,000 additional H-2B visas despite unused visas in FY2017. DHS required employers to show irreparable harm without these workers. The FY2019 rule authorizes up to 30,000 additional H-2B visas, allowing employers more time to submit petitions. Employers must demonstrate irreparable harm without these workers. The FY2019 rule authorizes up to 30,000 additional H-2B visas for workers who obtain visas abroad and seek admission to the United States. DHS clarifies that the provision does not cover individuals in the United States changing to H-2B status. The maximum number of additional H-2B visas authorized is 64,716, with DHS considering overall indications of increased need. The FY2019 rule limits supplemental H-2B visas to approximately half of the highest number for returning workers, up to 30,000. Employers must show evidence of irreparable harm without these workers. Only H-2B workers from FY2016, 2017, or 2018 are eligible for supplemental visas. DHS rationale is to prioritize returning workers. The FY2019 rule limits additional H-2B visas to returning workers who have previously participated in the program. This is to prioritize workers who have a proven track record of returning home after their authorized stay, unlike non-returning workers. The FY2019 rule limits H-2B visas to returning workers with a track record of going home. USCIS implements numerical limits on temporary worker visas, prioritizing petitions based on filing order and historical data. In FY2015, USCIS announced the final receipt date for new H-2B petitions as March 26, 2015, believing they had reached the annual cap of 66,000 petitions. However, in early June 2015, USCIS reopened the cap for the second half of FY2015 and accepted additional petitions. USCIS reopened the H-2B cap for the second half of FY2015 due to fewer than expected requests for H-2B visas. They determined there were still available visa numbers and set June 11, 2015, as the final receipt date for new H-2B worker petitions for FY2015. The final receipt date for H-2B petitions for FY2015 was set on June 11, 2015. However, for the second half of FY2018, the high demand for H-2B workers led to a random selection process (lottery) being required for the first time. Employers had to submit labor certifications to DOL by January 1, 2018, to hire H-2B workers starting on April 1, 2018. DOL received 4,498 applications covering 81,008 workers on that date. DOL announced a process change for H-2B applications, delaying their release until February 20, 2018, to allow employers time to meet regulatory requirements. USCIS received about 47,000 petitions in the first five days of accepting H-2B petitions for the second half of FY2018. In the second half of FY2018, USCIS received 47,000 H-2B petitions and conducted lotteries to meet the statutory cap. A final rule allowed for an additional 15,000 visas. High demand led to a second lottery in June 2018. Employer demand for H-2B visas in FY2019 was also high. On January 1, 2019, employers could file H-2B labor certification applications for the second half of FY2019. Due to high demand, the iCERT online application system experienced disruptions, with over 97,800 workers requested in pending applications for 33,000 visas. When the system reopened on January 7, 2019, it processed 4,749 applications covering more than 87,900 worker positions within the first hour. This led to additional process changes for FY2020. DOL announced process changes for FY2020 due to high demand for H-2B visas. USCIS conducted a lottery to select petitions for remaining H-2B numbers under the FY2019 cap. DOL implemented new processing changes for H-2B applications, randomly ordering and assigning them for processing in designated groups for FY2020. The Department of Labor (DOL) announced new processing changes for H-2B applications for FY2020 to address high demand. Applications will be randomly ordered and assigned for processing in designated groups based on start date requests. DOL is seeking comments on the changes, with the new procedures set to take effect on July 3, 2019. Most foreign nationals obtain H-2B status through visas, but some are admitted without visas, such as Canadians. Between FY2009 and FY2017, the number of individuals approved for a change to H-2B status ranged from about 110 to 470. Data on H-2B visa issuances from FY1992 to FY2018 show an increase until FY2007, reaching a highpoint of 129,547. Visa issuances fell after FY2007 due to the economic recession. Visa issuances for H-2B visas have generally been increasing since FY2009, with temporary provisions establishing exceptions to the annual cap of 66,000 in certain years. The demand for H-2B visas exceeds supply, leading to attention from policymakers. Legislative efforts to address numerical limitations on nonagricultural guest workers are likely to focus on the existing H-2B program."
