    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Responsible Implementation of Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2013\" and clarifies certain premium adjustments under the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. The amendment to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 clarifies that certain requirements only apply to properties in areas participating in the national flood insurance program with designated flood hazards published after December 31, 2013. The amendment to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 will take effect as part of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. SEC. 3. PHASE-IN OF ACTUARIAL RATES FOR NEWLY PURCHASED HOMES. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to increase premiums by 20 percent each year for properties not subject to phase-in requirements, starting after the enactment of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. The amendments made by subsection (a) will take effect as part of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. SEC. 4. LOCAL CHOICE TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow State and local governments to submit payments to cover property insurance premiums. SEC. 5. MITIGATION ASSISTANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS. Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include a special provision related to flood mitigation for eligible properties with lapsed flood insurance coverage. The Insurance Act of 1968 includes provisions for properties with lapsed flood insurance coverage, where the risk premium rate increases under the National Flood Insurance Program. Mitigation assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is offered to eligible properties to mitigate against future flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency provides hazard mitigation assistance for flooding, ensuring that at least 25% of the aid is used to elevate, acquire, or relocate eligible properties within the grant recipient's jurisdiction. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION AND RESTORATION OF FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEMS. Amendments are made to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 regarding the construction and restoration of flood protection systems. The Administrator will not consider the level of Federal funding in determining adequate progress on flood protection systems. Communities restoring disaccredited flood protection systems will not be affected by the level of Federal funding. Amendments to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 focus on the construction, reconstruction, or improvement of flood protection systems. The level of Federal funding will not impact progress on flood protection systems, and communities restoring disaccredited systems will not be affected by funding levels. SEC. 7. APPROPRIATE CREDIT FOR FLOOD CONTROL STRUCTURES. Section 1360 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to require that flood insurance rate maps accurately reflect the protection provided by levee systems against base floods, regardless of their accreditation status. If a community with a levee system chooses not to provide necessary data, the Administrator may not issue an updated flood insurance rate map for that area."
