    "content": "The Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 may be cited as the \"Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002\". Some small webcasters have reservations about the fee structure set by the Librarian of Congress and desire a fee based on revenue percentage. Congress encourages negotiations between copyright owners and small webcasters to reach an agreement. The representatives have reached an agreement in unique circumstances, with small webcasters unable to pay fees as per the July 8 order. They do not believe the agreement reflects fair royalty rates and terms, and Congress has not made a determination on its fairness. The agreement reached by representatives in unique circumstances allows parties to enter into agreements without fear of liability for deviating from the fees and terms of the July 8 order. Congress has not determined the fairness of the order, and the agreement will not be admissible as evidence in government proceedings involving royalty adjustments for copyright owners of sound recordings. The curr_chunk discusses payments to copyright owners of sound recordings for public performance or reproduction, including terms, conditions, notice, and recordkeeping requirements. SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS. Noncommercial webcasters' payments for digital sound recordings and ephemeral phonorecords are delayed until June 20, 2003. Small commercial webcasters may have their payment obligations delayed with written approval from the receiving agent. Small commercial webcasters can delay payments under sections 112 and 114 of title 17, US Code until December 15, 2002, with approval from the receiving agent. Definitions for \"webcaster\" and \"receiving agent\" are provided. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR SETTLEMENTS. Section 114(f) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to allow agreements for the reproduction and performance of sound recordings by small commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcasters from October 28, 1998, to December 31, 2004, binding on all copyright owners and other entitled persons, instead of arbitration or decision by the Librarian of Congress. The agreement for small commercial webcasters includes provisions for royalty payments based on revenue or expenses, a minimum fee, and other terms. The receiving agent is not obligated to negotiate the agreement and has no liability to copyright owners or other entitled persons. The Copyright Office will publish agreements made for small commercial and noncommercial webcasters in the Federal Register, but these agreements will not be included in the Code of Federal Regulations. The terms of the agreements will be available to eligible webcasters, and the agreements cannot be used as evidence in any legal proceedings related to setting rates or fees. The Congress intends for royalty rates and related terms for small webcasters to be considered a compromise, not a result of marketplace negotiations, in government proceedings overseen by the Librarian of Congress. The Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 aims to establish royalty rates and terms for small webcasters through government proceedings overseen by the Librarian of Congress. The Act specifies that agreements made under it should not influence the Court of Appeals' review of digital performance rates set by the Librarian of Congress. The term \"noncommercial webcaster\" is defined as a webcaster exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 establishes royalty rates and terms for small webcasters. The Act defines a \"noncommercial webcaster\" as one exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The term \"receiving agent\" and \"webcaster\" are also defined in the Act. The Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002 sets royalty rates and terms for small webcasters, including noncommercial webcasters. The authority to make settlements expires on December 15, 2002, except for noncommercial webcasters, whose authority expires on May 31, 2003. SEC. 5. DEDUCTIBILITY OF COSTS AND EXPENSES OF AGENTS AND DIRECT PAYMENT TO ARTISTS OF ROYALTIES FOR DIGITAL PERFORMANCES OF SOUND RECORDINGS. Congress finds that royalty payments from digital transmissions of sound recordings have been voluntarily negotiated to be made directly to recording artists and administrators. These arrangements have been codified in regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress, with some regulations being inconsistent with the negotiated payment terms. Congress is restoring terms negotiated among parties regarding the deductibility of costs for licensing and arbitration. In light of special circumstances and agreements reached by all parties, voluntarily negotiated arrangements are being codified. Nonprofit agents distributing receipts from transmissions can deduct costs before distribution to entitled entities. The nonprofit agent can deduct reasonable costs incurred after November 1, 1995, for administration, dispute settlement, licensing, and enforcement of rights related to royalties distribution, negotiations, and arbitration for ephemeral recordings and performances under section 112. The costs incurred for section 112 ephemeral recordings may only be deducted from royalties received under section 112. A designated agent distributing receipts from licensing transmissions can deduct reasonable costs incurred after November 1, 1995, for copyright owners and performers with whom they have a contractual relationship. Additionally, section 114(g)(2) allows for direct payment to artists through designated agents. An agent distributing receipts from licensing transmissions must allocate funds as follows: 50% to the copyright owner for public performance rights, 2.5% to an escrow account for nonfeatured musicians, and another 2.5% to a separate escrow account. The distribution of receipts from licensing transmissions includes allocating 2.5% to an escrow account for nonfeatured vocalists and 45% to recording artists featured on the sound recordings. The Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation with the Register of Copyrights, will conduct a study on economic arrangements among small commercial webcasters and third parties. The study will focus on the effect of these arrangements on royalty fees payable on a percentage of revenue or expense basis. The report will be submitted to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate by June 1, 2004."
