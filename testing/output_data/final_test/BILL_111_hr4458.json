Congress acknowledges that a significant number of individuals are incarcerated in various correctional facilities in the United States, with a high percentage eventually being released back into communities. Many of these individuals face challenges such as mental health issues, substance abuse disorders, low education levels, and barriers to employment, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. Studies show that a high percentage of incarcerated individuals have substance use problems, but only a small fraction receive treatment while in prison. Treatment for substance use disorders has been proven to reduce drug use, recidivism, unemployment, and homelessness, with every dollar invested in treatment saving taxpayers $7.46 in social costs. Incarcerated individuals face significant educational needs upon reentry into society, with many lacking a high school education. A study on releases from the Indiana Department of Corrections found a strong link between education, employment, and recidivism, showing that higher education levels lead to increased employment opportunities and decreased likelihood of reoffending. Prison inmates prioritize education as a vital need for successful reentry into the community. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, prison inmates face challenges accessing vocational training programs due to high demand and limited enrollment. State, Tribal, and local governments struggle to maintain prison education programs as the prison population continues to grow. Participation in correctional education programs has been found to reduce the likelihood of reoffending by 29%. According to studies, investing in education for incarcerated individuals can reduce recidivism rates by 29%. Job training programs for ex-convicts have been proven to increase employment opportunities and decrease the likelihood of reoffending. Unemployment after release is a significant factor contributing to repeated criminal behavior. The Act aims to enhance public safety and lower recidivism rates by providing grants to corrections agencies for a 40-hour work week curriculum promoting self-improvement activities for incarcerated individuals. The Attorney General will establish a 3-year pilot program to provide grants to State, Tribal, and local corrections agencies for a 40-hour work week curriculum focusing on self-improvement activities for inmates. Agencies must submit applications outlining the program details to receive funding. The grant application must describe the 40-hour work week curriculum, list the prisons where it will be implemented, detail participant selection, provide a budget plan, and explain the standards for determining eligibility. The grant application must describe the 40-hour work week curriculum, list the prisons where it will be implemented, detail participant selection, provide a budget plan, and explain the standards for determining the performance of incarcerated individuals participating in the curriculum. The grant funds are to be used to establish a curriculum including activities such as GED classes, literacy training, college courses, and vocational training. The grant funds will be used for vocational training and education, civic education, special education, cognitive skills training, and job training in high-demand positions for incarcerated individuals. The training must comply with state and local laws regarding prohibited trades or occupations. The grant funds will be used for various programs and services for incarcerated individuals, including substance use disorder services, mental health treatment, anger management, prison work, restorative justice activities, mentoring sessions, and life skills training. The grant funds will support programs for incarcerated individuals, including substance use disorder services, mental health treatment, anger management, prison work, restorative justice activities, mentoring sessions, and life skills training. Curriculum activities must comply with state and federal licensing requirements, and services must be coordinated with the State substance abuse agency. Additionally, the grant can be used to pay teachers, counselors, therapists, and specialists to work with incarcerated individuals. The grant funds can be used to pay for teachers, counselors, therapists, and specialists to work with incarcerated individuals as part of the approved 40-hour work week curriculum activities. Additionally, the funds can also be used to make grants to nonprofit organizations, educational facilities, or community partners to implement these programs, cover initial assessments for participants, and pay for security and administrative costs associated with providing activities within the curriculum. SEC. 5. PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS. Any incarcerated person participating in the 40-hour work week curriculum funded by a grant must undergo assessments of their abilities. Participation in the program is required for those within 3 years of release or parole eligibility, while others can volunteer to join. Inmates within 3 years of release or parole eligibility can participate in a 40-hour work week curriculum funded by a grant. Corrections officials may consult with the parole board to identify participants. Incentives for participating inmates include good time credit, monetary compensation, visitation rights, letters of recommendation upon release. Any incarcerated person participating in a 40-hour work week curriculum funded by a grant will receive information on restoring legal, civil, and employment rights, including voting rights, upon release. The Attorney General can award a grant to the National Institute of Justice for a study on the success of 40-hour work week curriculums funded by grants. SEC. 7. MATCHING REQUIREMENT. The Attorney General may not grant funds unless the recipient agrees to provide 50% non-Federal contributions. In-kind contributions are acceptable. SEC. 8. SUBMISSION OF REPORTS TO CONGRESS. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress on the effectiveness of the curriculums developed under the bill. $160 million is authorized for fiscal years 2011, 2012, and 2013, with $5 million allocated for research grants each year."
