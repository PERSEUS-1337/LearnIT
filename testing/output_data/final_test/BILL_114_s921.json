    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Delaware River Basin Conservation Act of 2015\". It includes findings related to the conservation of the Delaware River Basin. Congress finds that the Delaware River Basin is a national treasure of great cultural, environmental, ecological, and economic importance. The Basin spans over 12,500 square miles across four states and is home to over 8,000,000 people who rely on it for various purposes. Additionally, the Basin provides clean drinking water to more than 15,000,000 people, including major cities like New York City and Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Water Department conducted a study on the threat to the city's drinking water supply from loss of forests in the Upper Basin. The Basin contributes significantly to the economy, ecosystem goods, and services, supporting 600,000 jobs with $10 billion in annual wages. Almost 180 species of fish and wildlife are at risk due to habitat loss, including sturgeon, eastern oyster, horseshoe crabs, and red knots. The Basin provides habitat for over 200 resident species. The Delaware Estuary Basin supports over 200 fish species, including important commercial fisheries like eastern oysters and blue crabs. It is a crucial habitat for the American horseshoe crab and hosts the second largest concentration of shorebirds in North America. The Basin also contains significant wetlands and forests, providing essential ecosystem services. The Delaware River Basin encompasses over 700,000 acres of wetland, with 126,000 acres recognized internationally for their importance. The remaining natural landscape is at risk due to ongoing development, leading to increased pollution in rivers and streams. The Delaware River is the longest undammed river east of the Mississippi, with over 400 miles designated as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The Delaware River supports a renowned cold water fishery attracting visitors and generating revenue. Flood mitigation and habitat management are crucial, with calls for natural flood damage reduction measures following major floods since 2004. The Delaware River Port Complex is a major freshwater port handling a large volume of international tonnage. The Port of Philadelphia is the busiest terminal on the Delaware River, while the Port of Wilmington supports over 12,000 jobs. The Delaware Estuary is one of the largest and most complex estuaries where freshwater from the Delaware River mixes with saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean. The Partnership for the Delaware Estuary works to improve the environmental health of the Delaware Estuary, which is one of the largest and most complex estuaries in the National Estuary Program. The Delaware River Basin Commission oversees water resources management projects in the Basin, supported by Federal and State agency programs. Funding for these programs should continue to complement the establishment of the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program aims to coordinate restoration and protection funding at various levels, while also enhancing efficiency and private-sector investments in conservation efforts within the Delaware River Basin. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Program aims to coordinate funding for restoration and protection, enhancing efficiency and private-sector investments in conservation efforts within the basin. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms related to the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, including the Basin, Basin State, Director, Foundation, and Grant Program. The Act defines key terms related to the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, including the nonregulatory program established under section 4 for habitat conservation and enhancement, the Secretary as the Secretary of the Interior, and the Service as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Act establishes a nonregulatory program under section 4 for habitat conservation and enhancement. The Secretary will establish the \"Delaware River Basin restoration program\" within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The program will involve collaboration with various management entities to prioritize and implement restoration and protection activities in the Basin. The Secretary will establish a Delaware River Basin restoration program within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The program will support science-based restoration and protection activities, target cost-effective projects with measurable results, and maximize conservation outcomes without increasing Federal full-time equivalent employees. Coordination with Federal agencies, including the EPA and NOAA, will be ensured. The Delaware River Basin restoration program, established by the Secretary within 180 days of the Act's enactment, aims to coordinate restoration and protection activities among various entities and conservation partners in the Basin. This includes Federal, State, local, and regional agencies, as well as the Governors of the Basin States, the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary, the Delaware River Basin Commission, fish and wildlife joint venture partnerships, and other public agencies and organizations involved in conservation strategies. The Delaware River Basin restoration program aims to coordinate restoration and protection activities among various entities and conservation partners in the Basin. This includes sustaining and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat, improving water quality, managing water for flood mitigation, and enhancing public access and recreation in the Basin. The Delaware River Basin restoration program aims to coordinate activities for fish and wildlife habitat, strategic planning for natural systems, public engagement, scientific capacity building, and technical assistance for restoration and protection activities in the Basin. The Delaware River Basin restoration program includes grants and assistance for activities related to fish and wildlife habitat, strategic planning, public engagement, scientific capacity building, and technical support. The Delaware River Basin Restoration Grant Program offers competitive matching grants to various entities for activities outlined in section 4(d) to achieve specific purposes and advance priority actions identified in the Basinwide strategy. Criteria for the grant program will be developed in consultation with relevant organizations to ensure effective implementation. The Federal share of project costs funded under the grant program will not exceed 50%, with the non-Federal share allowed in cash or in-kind contributions. The Secretary may partner with organizations like the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for grant program management and funding. The organization selected under paragraph (1) will receive advance payments for each fiscal year to carry out the grant program, invest and reinvest those amounts, and administer the program to support partnerships between public and private sectors. Any amounts received by the Foundation under this section will be subject to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act (16 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) excludes section 10(a) (16 U.S.C. 3709(a)). The Secretary must submit annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act, detailing funded projects. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2021, with at least 75% allocated for grants and technical assistance."
