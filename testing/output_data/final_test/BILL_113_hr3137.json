    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Freedom and Mobility in Consumer Banking Act\" and amends the Truth in Savings Act to address consumer rights regarding closed accounts. Congress finds that economic stability and competition between depository institutions would be enhanced by uniform disclosure of terms and conditions for deposit accounts. Consumers lack meaningful choices for managing household funds due to difficulties in moving funds to new accounts. Closing accounts at depository institutions can be complex and time-consuming, with unclear procedures. Institutions may not assist in transferring automated deposits, charge fees for closing accounts, and even reopen closed accounts without consent. This can hinder banking mobility for low-income consumers. The Act aims to provide clear and uniform disclosure of interest rates and fees on deposit accounts to enable consumer comparison. It also establishes rights and responsibilities in closing procedures for certain consumer deposit accounts. \"SEC. 268A. CLOSURE OF COVERED ACCOUNTS.\" \"A depository institution cannot prevent a consumer from closing a covered account, charge a fee for closing it, or reopen a closed account without the consumer's explicit request. The institution must also provide disclosures on their account closure policies when a consumer opens a covered account.\" The Bureau will prescribe final regulations within 1 year for closing covered accounts, requiring depository institutions to close an account within 5 business days of a consumer's request. The final regulations will prescribe methods for closing covered accounts within 5 business days of a consumer's request, with exceptions for law enforcement notifications or other determined by the Bureau. Requests can be made in person, over the phone, or electronically. The regulations require depository institutions to positively verify a consumer's identity before closing a covered account with procedures for handling verification issues. The institution must provide a consumer with funds from a closed account, ensuring the consumer's identity is verified and granting access to available funds for withdrawal. Additionally, a reasonable timeframe must be established for remitting any remaining funds, including those in dispute. The depository institution must provide a consumer with access to available funds from a closed account after verifying their identity. This can be done through a cashier's check, electronic funds transfer, or any other means requested by the consumer. The Bureau may determine appropriate means for a consumer's request. A depository institution cannot impose fees on a closed account, except for overdraft fees related to pre-closure transactions initiated by the consumer. The depository institution must not limit a consumer's ability to earn interest on a covered account before closing it. Procedures must be established for handling personal checks deposited after an account is closed. The institution must provide certain information to the consumer before closing their account. Before closing a covered account, the depository institution must provide the consumer with a list of preauthorized transactions and direct deposits within specific timeframes. The depository institution must provide consumers with information about preauthorized activity relating to the covered account before closing it. Additionally, the institution is prohibited from reporting adverse information to consumer reporting agencies for the covered account. The depository institution can report a covered account with a negative balance at closure to a consumer reporting agency if it meets specific criteria. The depository institution can report a covered account with a negative balance at closure to a consumer reporting agency if it notifies the consumer and provides a reasonable period to repay. The Bureau may include additional provisions to facilitate the purposes of this section. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to identify barriers limiting a consumer's ability to close a covered account. The study required under this section will analyze potential reforms to payment clearing and settlement systems to notify consumers if a preauthorized recurring debit is directed to a closed covered account. It will also consider reforms to automatically transfer any scheduled activities relating to a closed covered account. The study will analyze reforms to payment systems to notify consumers of preauthorized debits to closed accounts and facilitate automatic transfer of scheduled activities to another account. Recommendations will be made to Congress and banking agencies for rulemaking to improve fund transfers. The Comptroller General will issue a report to Congress and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection on a study regarding the ability of consumers to close covered accounts. The Bureau will determine if regulations should be issued to remove barriers limiting consumers from closing accounts. The Bureau may issue regulations after consulting with relevant agencies and receiving public input. The term 'available for withdrawal' refers to funds that can be used for various purposes as outlined in the account agreement or institution policies. The term 'covered account' includes checking, savings, or any other account as defined by the Bureau for electronic payments, cash withdrawals, and transfers between accounts."
