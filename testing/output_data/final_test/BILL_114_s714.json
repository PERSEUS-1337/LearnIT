    "content": "The \"Frontline Mental Health Provider Training Act\" may establish a pilot program to expand the use of physician assistants for mental health care for members of the Armed Forces and veterans. The \"Frontline Mental Health Provider Training Act\" mandates a pilot program to assess expanding the use of physician assistants specializing in psychiatric medicine at military medical facilities to address the increasing demand for mental health care providers. The program will involve an 18-month psychiatry fellowship program for physician assistants at three designated military medical treatment facilities. The pilot program mandates the use of military medical treatment facilities for an 18-month psychiatry fellowship program for physician assistants. The program will involve facilities under the jurisdiction of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as three medical centers of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligible individuals can participate in the program. Eligibility for the pilot program requires a master's degree in physician assistant studies, certification by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants, a valid license to practice medicine, and a clean disciplinary record. The Department of Defense conducts a pilot program at military medical facilities for eligible individuals who are commissioned officers meeting deployment requirements. Each Secretary selects at least 12 individuals for an 18-month psychiatry fellowship program. The Secretaries will distribute selected individuals equally among pilot program locations. They will establish an 18-month psychiatry fellowship program for physician assistants, providing training equivalent to psychiatric residency. Education leading to a clinical doctorate of science in psychiatry includes inpatient and outpatient care, emergency psychiatry, neurology (child, adolescent, geriatric), pain management, addictive psychiatry, psycho-pharmacology, traumatic brain injury, and clinical practice guidelines tailored to rural and underserved populations. The Secretaries will utilize existing resources from graduate medical education programs of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to support the psychiatric fellowship program for rural and underserved populations, Armed Forces members, and veterans. A report on the pilot program must be submitted to Congress within two years of its commencement. The pilot program report must include details on implementation, education, and training at each location, differences in performance among locations, and satisfaction of Armed Forces members and veterans with mental health care provided. The pilot program report should include an assessment of mental health care outcomes, cost savings to the Federal Government, improvements in access to care for Armed Forces members and veterans, and recommendations for alternative methods to improve access to mental health care. The Secretaries must submit a final report to Congress 90 days before the pilot program ends, including an update on mental health care outcomes, cost savings, and recommendations for extending the program. Appropriate committees of Congress are defined as the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Secretaries' authority to conduct the pilot program will end after two 18-month psychiatry fellowship programs under subsection (e)."
