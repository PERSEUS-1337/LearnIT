    "content": "The \"Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003\" is established as a pilot program for child care lending. Loans authorized under the \"Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003\" can be used by certified development companies to provide loans to small, nonprofit child care businesses, subject to certain conditions. These conditions include approval by the Small Business Administration, meeting eligibility requirements, personal guarantees, and clear collateral ownership. The \"Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003\" allows certified development companies to offer loans to small, nonprofit child care businesses. These businesses must have a singular title to the collateral for the loan and sufficient cash flow to meet their obligations and operating expenses. Additionally, not more than 7 percent of total guaranteed loans in a fiscal year can be awarded under this program. The \"Child Care Lending Pilot Act of 2003\" allows certified development companies to offer loans to small, nonprofit child care businesses that care for infants, toddlers, pre-school, or pre-kindergarten children. The businesses must have a tangible net worth not exceeding $7,000,000 and average net income not exceeding $2,500,000. They must also be licensed child care providers. No loans can be made under this program after September 30, 2006. The Small Business Administration must provide reports every 6 months until that date. The Administrator must submit reports every 6 months to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business regarding the implementation of the child care lending program. The reports should include the program's start date, issuance of rules, and the number and amount of loans applied for, approved, and disbursed in the previous 6 months. The Comptroller General of the United States must also submit a report to the Committees by March 31, 2006. The Administrator must submit reports every 6 months to the Senate and House Committees on Small Business regarding the implementation of the child care lending program. The reports should include information on the first 2 years of the loan program, evaluating timeliness, effectiveness, participation, marketing, and the number of small businesses by location. The Administrator must provide biannual reports to Congress on the child care lending program, detailing the number of small nonprofit child care businesses that applied for and received loans, total loan amounts, number of loans made, average loan terms, and loan performance metrics. The Administrator collects information from certified development centers and child care providers for the child care lending program. This information includes the number and percentage of children receiving subsidized assistance and the number and percentage of children who are low income. The Administrator provides this information to the Comptroller General of the United States. The Administrator will issue final rules within 120 days to implement the loan program authorized by this section."
