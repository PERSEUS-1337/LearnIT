The Cyber Crime Protection Act Security Act (S. 2111) introduced by Senator Leahy aimed to amend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) to address cybercrime threats. It proposed creating a new offense for damaging critical infrastructure computers and clarifying the \"unauthorized access\" element. The 112th Congress held hearings on these proposals but did not take further action. CFAA regularly amends to keep up with technological advancements, focusing on computers as victims of crime. Subsection 1030(a) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act outlaws various offenses related to computer crimes, including espionage, unauthorized access to government or financial information, fraud, damaging computers, trafficking in passwords, and threatening to damage computers. Subsection 1030(b) criminalizes attempts or conspiracies to commit these offenses, while subsection 1030(c) outlines the penalties for these crimes. Subsection 1030(c) details penalties for offenses under Subsections 1030(a) and (b), ranging from imprisonment for simple cyberspace trespassing to life imprisonment for damage resulting in death. Subsection 1030(d) preserves Secret Service investigative authority, Subsection 1030(e) provides common definitions, and Subsection 1030(g) allows victims to pursue civil action. Section 7 of S. 2111 would criminalize aggravated damage to critical infrastructure computers. The new section criminalizes intentional damage to critical infrastructure computers in relation to a felony violation of section 1030, with offenders facing a minimum of three years in prison and up to 20 years. Mandatory minimum sentences would not allow for probation or alternative sentencing options. The new section criminalizes intentional damage to critical infrastructure computers, with offenders facing a minimum of three years in prison and up to 20 years. The definition of \"critical infrastructure computer\" is broad, covering systems vital to national defense, security, economic security, and public health. The section does not include individual conspiracy elements. The new section criminalizes intentional damage to critical infrastructure computers, with offenders facing a minimum of three years in prison and up to 20 years. Critics argue that mandatory minimum sentences can lead to harsh results and do little to reduce sentencing disparity, while proponents believe they ensure serious crimes are punished consistently. Section 7 proposes mandatory minimum sentences for identity theft, similar to existing laws. The Sentencing Commission has shown some support for this provision, while some members may still have reservations. Property linked to CFAA violations can now be confiscated through criminal forfeiture procedures. Administration officials view these mandatory minimums as appropriate sanctions and deterrents. Section 6 proposes expanding the scope of property confiscation in cases of CFAA violations to include real property used to facilitate the offense. It allows for the confiscation of both real and personal property through civil forfeiture procedures, without requiring the conviction of the property owner. The proposal includes expanding property confiscation in cases of CFAA violations to include real property. It allows confiscation of both real and personal property under civil forfeiture procedures, with an innocent owner defense available. This defense applies if the owner was unaware of the misconduct or took reasonable steps to prevent it. The bill aims to expand property confiscation for CFAA violations, including real property, with an innocent owner defense available. Section 6 adjusts forfeiture provisions based on the Supreme Court's interpretation of \"proceeds\" in money laundering statutes. This amendment would allow confiscation of the \"gross proceeds\" of a CFAA violation. The bill addresses the issue of unauthorized access to computers in various crimes under Subsection 1030(a). The courts have had difficulty applying the definition of unauthorized access. In United States v. Drew, a prosecution was brought under Section 1030 for exceeding authorized access to a social network. The court granted acquittal due to the government's theory being too vague. Section 8 may have been drafted in response to this case, amending the definition of \"exceeds authorized access.\" The amendment clarifies that \"exceeds authorized access\" means accessing a computer with authorization but using it to obtain or alter information not entitled to, excluding violations of contractual agreements. The purpose is to address civil liberties concerns about the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The Justice Department objected to a proposal that would deter prosecution of inside cyberthreats. A former Justice Department official warned against the implications of a certain interpretation and suggested resolving employment disputes through civil litigation. Section 4 would modify the wording of the password trafficking prohibition in 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(6). The proposed amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(6) would expand the prohibition on trafficking in passwords and similar access means for protected computers, broadening federal jurisdiction and clarifying coverage of various user identity confirmation methods. The proposed amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(6) would expand the prohibition on trafficking in passwords and similar access means for protected computers, broadening federal jurisdiction and clarifying coverage of various user identity confirmation methods, including biometric data, single-use passcodes, and smart carts. It would apply when the victimized computer is federal government-owned, a financial institution's, or affects interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act would be added to the RICO predicate offense list. The addition of violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to the RICO predicate offense list has several law enforcement advantages, including harsher punishments, property confiscation, private cause of action with treble damages, and money laundering implications. The addition of violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to the RICO predicate offense list provides law enforcement advantages, including harsher punishments, property confiscation, and money laundering implications. Money laundering statutes ban the use of proceeds from RICO predicate offenses in financial transactions over $10,000, and the proceeds are subject to confiscation. Adding Section 1030 to the RICO predicate offense list does not provide additional benefits for money laundering prosecution. The addition of violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to the RICO predicate offense list offers law enforcement advantages such as harsher punishments, property confiscation, and implications for money laundering. Violations of Section 1030 are also considered RICO predicate offenses, providing new advantages for prosecution. RICO violations result in more severe punishments compared to Section 1030 violations, with the inclusion of treble damages and attorneys' fees. The addition of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violations to the RICO predicate offense list would aid in prosecuting organized criminal groups involved in network attacks. However, concerns were raised about opening civil RICO remedies to CFAA offense victims due to potential meritless lawsuits and risks associated with treble damages and attorneys' fees. Subsection 1030(b) now punishes conspiracy or attempt to violate CFAA offenses as provided in subsection (c). Subsection (c) sets penalties for CFAA offenses, including fines and imprisonment for up to five years. Conspiracy is not specifically mentioned in Subsection (c). Reading conspiracy out of CFAA may seem inconsistent with Subsection (b), but Subsection (c) does support that interpretation. Changes in the bill could amplify the impact of removing conspiracy from CFAA. Currently, conspiracy to commit a federal felony carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The bill punishes some CFAA violations as misdemeanors and others as five-year felonies. Section 3 of the bill increases penalties for most of Subsection 1030(c)'s offenses. Section 3 of the bill increases penalties for Subsection 1030(c)'s offenses, turning misdemeanors into felonies with longer imprisonment terms. The bill also addresses conspiracy by amending the CFAA to align penalties with completed offenses. The bill proposes streamlined penalties for Subsection 1030(a) and 1030(b) offenses, eliminating penalty increases for repeat offenders. It aims to set penalties at higher levels for all offenders, including novices and repeat offenders, with the exception of fraud provisions under Subsection 1030(a). The maximum penalty for fraud would increase from 5 to 20 years. Administration witnesses support the penalty increases as a simplification of Subsection 1030(c) and to allow federal judges to punish cyberoffenses more severely. The bill proposes streamlined penalties for cyber offenses under Subsection 1030(a) and 1030(b), with the exception of fraud provisions. The maximum penalty for fraud would increase from 5 to 20 years, aligning it with traditional fraud statutes."
