    "content": "FirstNet, created by Congress in 2012, oversees the nationwide public safety broadband network. Governed by a Board of federal, private sector, and public safety representatives, FirstNet was allocated $7 billion from spectrum auctions. Congress authorized FirstNet to enter into a public-private partnership to deploy the network. The FirstNet act established a public-private partnership to deploy a nationwide broadband network for public safety users, with $7 billion in funding and 20 MHz of spectrum. It required the creation of a new federal agency, a Board of Directors, and coordination with various entities for network deployment. The act also mandated the auction of spectrum to fund FirstNet and the development of technical requirements to industry standards. In January 2016, a request for proposal (RFP) was released and awarded to AT&T in March 2017 to build the network. By January 2018, all states and territories had opted in for AT&T to deploy the network. AT&T is currently deploying the core network and recruiting users to meet adoption targets, while FirstNet oversees the network deployment to ensure timely completion and integration of network elements. FirstNet oversees network deployment to ensure completion on time, interoperability, and meeting public safety needs. Since the 1920s, first responders have used land mobile radios for communication. Public safety agencies must obtain FCC licenses to transmit messages over the airwaves. The FCC allocated spectrum for public safety agencies, but demand exceeded the allocation, leading to scattered frequency bands and non-interoperable equipment. Public safety advocates called for additional spectrum and interoperable solutions. Congress allocated 24 MHz to public safety in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. During the 9/11 attacks, public safety agencies faced communication challenges due to overloaded radio channels and lack of interoperability. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the inability of agencies to communicate effectively, calling for expedited allocation of radio spectrum for public safety. The Commission called for expedited assignment of radio spectrum for public safety use, reallocating the 700 MHz D Block spectrum for public safety broadband network. This Band Class 14 spectrum is dedicated to building a nationwide public safety broadband network. A broadband network for public safety aims to provide high-speed data access and specialized features not available on commercial networks. Public safety users face constraints on commercial networks during emergencies, requiring higher security, reliability, and redundancy for effective emergency response. LMR systems are crucial for public safety agencies, offering immediate access to communication systems with specialized features. These systems are reliable, resilient, and secure, tailored to specific agencies and geographic areas. They may operate on various frequencies and may not be interoperable with other systems in the area. FirstNet aims to provide the benefits of commercial broadband networks with added reliability and security for public safety users. However, it currently lacks the mission critical voice capabilities of LMR systems. Industry standards were approved in May 2016, and device development is ongoing. LMR systems are crucial for public safety, with industry standards approved in May 2016. FirstNet aims to supplement existing systems by providing dedicated spectrum, broadband capabilities, and advanced technologies. Congress allocated 20 MHz of broadband spectrum to public safety, with FirstNet holding the license. The act authorizes FirstNet to enter into a public-private partnership and a covered leasing agreement for network operation. Access to network capacity is permitted on a secondary basis. AT&T won the contract to access 20 MHz of unencumbered nationwide spectrum from FirstNet, allowing them to monetize the spectrum for public safety and commercial use. Experts estimate that only 1% of the spectrum will be used by public safety, giving AT&T significant capacity for commercial users. The spectrum is not limited to a specific geographical area and is licensed for public safety use. AT&T won the contract to access 20 MHz of unencumbered nationwide spectrum from FirstNet, allowing them to monetize the spectrum for public safety and commercial use. The spectrum is not limited to a specific geographical area and is licensed for public safety use, providing wider coverage with higher powered devices. AT&T sees efficiencies in deploying equipment for both FirstNet and their own 5G network, with a wider fiber footprint gained from the award. The value of the FirstNet spectrum is estimated at $8 billion, giving AT&T an advantage in 5G network deployment. The FirstNet Act mandated the establishment of a nationwide public safety broadband network with a core network and a radio access network based on commercial standards. The core network includes national and regional data centers, while the radio access network consists of cell site equipment and backhaul equipment for wireless communications. FirstNet, in partnership with AT&T, is responsible for building the core network to ensure a consistent user experience nationwide. The RAN portion of the network, including cell towers and hot spots, will be deployed state-by-state. Traffic from devices will flow through the RAN to the core network over satellite or other wireless infrastructure, meeting minimum technical interoperability requirements. The FirstNet network, in partnership with AT&T, must comply with technical interoperability requirements set by an Interoperability Board. The network is based on LTE service standards and encourages the use of commercial and government-owned infrastructure for deployment. FirstNet can enter into roaming agreements for users outside its coverage area. Rural coverage milestones are required throughout deployment phases. AT&T was awarded a 25-year contract to build and maintain the network, receiving $6.5 billion over five years and access to 20 MHz of broadband spectrum. AT&T will provide FirstNet with access to its existing infrastructure and $40 billion over the contract's life to support the public safety network. They will build a 4G LTE network for public safety users with a five-year deployment plan, including core network development and RAN deployment in each state. Public safety users will have priority access to AT&T's commercial network during emergencies. In June 2017, states received preliminary plans for the Radio Access Network deployment. FirstNet/AT&T provided preliminary state plans for deploying the Radio Access Network (RAN) based on state and local needs. Plans included network architecture, coverage, and pricing details. States gave feedback, leading to final state plans released on September 29, 2017. Governors had 90 days to review and decide to opt in or out of the network build-out. In 2017, all 50 states and 6 territories opted in to FirstNet's RAN deployment. NTIA facilitated Spectrum Relocation to clear Band Class 14 for FirstNet. Nearly $27 million was awarded for relocation costs. NIST awarded $38.5 million for public safety broadband research. The program received $300 million from spectrum auctions for public safety broadband research awards. NTIA and NHTSA proposed rules for the NG911 program. SLIGP 2.0 funding can help coordinate FirstNet activities in every state. The SLIGP 2.0 funding is available for every state and territory with a 20% matching requirement. FirstNet released a Tribal Consultation Policy in 2017 to establish a relationship with tribes during network build-out. Congress conducted oversight hearings on FirstNet, questioning state plans, opt-in/opt-out decisions, and network aspects. The act requires the FirstNet network to be self-sustaining through user fees, with Congress providing oversight to ensure deployment as intended. Issues such as coverage, security, reliability, and cost were raised by states during the review of their state plans, impacting public safety agencies' decisions to use the network. Monitoring deployment is necessary to ensure that FirstNet/AT&T meet public safety needs and attract users to the network. The FirstNet network needs users to be self-sustaining and achieve the law's intent of providing a single, interoperable network for public safety agencies during disasters. Congress oversees the network's deployment, with AT&T awarded the contract based on innovation, technical capability, and financial stability. The contract details are proprietary, making it challenging for Congress to review the network's approach. Without public access to the actual deployment approach, Congress faces challenges in understanding how the FirstNet network will be implemented. Members of Congress have raised questions about deployment specifics, rural coverage, and the security and reliability of the AT&T solution. Lack of contract details hinders Congress from ensuring compliance with the law and the network's intended purpose. State plans outline AT&T's coverage and deployment of the radio access network (RAN) in each state. FirstNet/AT&T released proprietary state plans in June 2017, detailing coverage, deployment schedule, services, and costs. Plans were accessible to select state officials through a secure portal with non-disclosure agreements. Without access to state plans, Members of Congress may struggle to understand deployment plans, funding distribution, and compliance with requirements. The $6.5 billion FirstNet project proposed by Congress aims to improve communication for first responders. Congress may need more transparency from FirstNet to ensure the project meets requirements for a nationwide public safety network. Debates have arisen over whether there should be one nationwide vendor or multiple vendors for FirstNet. After extensive input from public safety advocates and industry experts, FirstNet/AT&T decided on a one-vendor, nationwide solution for the FirstNet network. Despite advocacy for multiple interconnected cores, AT&T argued that the RFP required a single nationwide core to reduce cyber risks. FirstNet agreed with AT&T, emphasizing the need for a single core to avoid complications in a multi-core architecture. Verizon announced plans to build a dedicated public safety core network separate from its commercial core, offering first responders access to LTE network, priority services, and multi-band devices. They aim to provide a parallel service to FirstNet and advocate for interconnections with the FirstNet/AT&T core. FirstNet and AT&T advocate for a one-vendor approach for efficiency in managing, procuring, deploying, and operating the network. Some support this approach while others argue competition is beneficial for reducing costs and increasing options. Concerns exist about integrating other networks affecting security, interoperability, and sustainability. Verizon advocates for a separate public safety core network and interconnections with FirstNet/AT&T core. Verizon and AT&T have differing views on interoperability for FirstNet. Verizon believes secure interoperability is feasible and promotes innovation through competition. AT&T, however, raises concerns about security risks and the lack of a nationwide architecture for core-to-core connections. FirstNet agrees with AT&T, highlighting uncertainties in how core-to-core connections could impact interoperability and security. Additionally, GAO's 2017 Report suggests that competition among commercial carriers may affect the network's sustainability and long-term improvement. Verizon has amended its service offerings to include priority service and preemption for public safety users to sustain its customer base. The interoperability of cores may reduce costs but could negatively affect subscriptions to FirstNet. Congress mandated a secure, interoperable, and self-sustaining network, with FirstNet/AT&T adopting policies to meet these requirements. Questions remain about core-to-core interoperability, with Verizon developing a separate core that may impact FirstNet's subscribership and long-term sustainability. Congress could mandate core integration to increase network users. By January 2018, all 50 states and 6 territories accepted the FirstNet/AT&T plan to deploy the network, with some states opting in reluctantly. States noted outstanding items in state plans that needed to be addressed with FirstNet and AT&T, such as future coverage and improvements. Congress may encourage subscribership through grant funding for public safety agencies to purchase FirstNet devices. FirstNet and AT&T acknowledge they cannot address all state and local public safety needs during the initial five-year deployment. Congress may oversee the network deployment and revenue reinvestment for improvements. State and local public safety agencies may testify at oversight hearings to ensure issues like coverage, rural partnering agreements, and security are adequately addressed. FirstNet and AT&T are working on addressing key issues like coverage, rural partnering agreements, and security to ensure public safety agencies can effectively use the FirstNet network during emergencies. The act requires substantial rural coverage milestones to be set with each deployment phase and mandates consultation with state, tribal, and local entities on coverage needs. The RFP includes provisions for nationwide coverage access within six months of award to accelerate broadband adoption. The RFP includes provisions for nationwide coverage access within six months of award to accelerate broadband adoption, with a requirement for a longer-term, five-year deployment plan with rural coverage milestones for each phase. The proprietary nature of the contract and state deployment plans make it challenging to verify if the law's requirements are being met and how resources like $6.5 billion and 20 MHz spectrum are being utilized. AT&T won the contract to provide nationwide coverage for public safety agencies using their own spectrum and networks. They opened all LTE-enabled spectrum bands for public safety use, offering priority and preemption services on the FirstNet network. This ensures immediate broadband access, a nationwide network, and prioritized communication during emergencies. AT&T's offer to prioritize public safety communications on their commercial network before the deployment of the FirstNet network has sparked mixed reactions. Some see it as a way to access broadband services sooner, while others view it as a means to increase network capacity and relieve congestion. Critics argue that AT&T is rebranding their network as FirstNet instead of building a dedicated public safety broadband network as intended. AT&T is building out Band 14 as agreed in the contract, with questions raised about deployment locations and spectrum usage. Senators in a 2017 hearing asked about coverage areas, to which AT&T mentioned deploying Band 14 where additional capacity is needed, without providing specific details for proprietary reasons. AT&T plans to deploy the Band Class 14 network, known as FirstNet, in high-density areas and rural regions lacking coverage. They aim to cover over 99% of the population and 76.2% of the geography without deployable assets. By combining LTE, rural networks, deployable assets, and satellite technology, FirstNet/AT&T aims to cover over 99% of the U.S. geography. Deployable assets provide immediate coverage during emergencies but are not considered persistent or permanent solutions for rural areas. FirstNet/AT&T aims to deploy permanent communication solutions in high-density areas and rural regions. Congress may request additional details on FirstNet coverage, deployment locations, and coverage types. The RFP required substantial rural coverage milestones, allowing bidders to propose innovative solutions. The contractor was allowed to set the base for achieving milestones, but the coverage details are proprietary and not public. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the validity of the contract milestones, as they are based on unknown factors. Congress may request more information on FirstNet coverage, rural milestones, and areas covered to ensure compliance with the law's \"substantial rural coverage\" requirements. FirstNet included a 15% partnering requirement in the RFP, with AT&T likely exceeding it. The Competitive Carriers Association expressed interest in partnering with FirstNet. The Competitive Carriers Association (CCA) expressed interest in partnering with FirstNet to strengthen rural carriers and ensure reliable backup during emergencies. CCA emphasized the importance of collaboration with rural partners and raised concerns about potential delays in public safety services if partnerships are limited. Information on rural partnering agreements is not publicly available, prompting Congress to inquire about their existence to ensure compliance with the law's rural coverage requirements. Congress may inquire about rural partnering agreements with FirstNet to ensure compliance with the law's requirements and encourage expansion of service to rural regions. The law mandates technical requirements for a reliable, secure, and resilient network, with added features for public safety grade standards to withstand emergencies and disasters. This includes backup power, multiple network paths, and site hardening for sustained communication during emergencies. AT&T network reliability was questioned in a congressional hearing, with concerns about being \"public safety grade.\" AT&T stated its network meets federal, state, and local laws, with deployable assets for outages. Commercial systems meet basic laws but not higher-level standards. Congress may need more information on AT&T's network to ensure it meets public safety standards, including security, reliability, and resilience. They may also seek details on how FirstNet and AT&T will ensure the network's reliability and ability to withstand disasters. The NPSTC has released guidelines on defining public safety grade systems. The NPSTC released guidelines on defining public safety grade systems, emphasizing network hardening and reliability. AT&T highlighted the need for a public-safety-grade network but acknowledged challenges in implementing it nationwide. FirstNet and AT&T are working with states to identify critical assets for network hardening. Congress may seek to confirm that FirstNet and AT&T are adhering to technical requirements for the network. They may inquire about how sites are chosen for hardening and how future revenues will be used for improvements. The security, reliability, and resiliency of the FirstNet network are crucial for operation during disasters and gaining public safety user support. Concerns raised by stakeholders include resiliency, reliability, redundancy, cybersecurity, user identity frameworks, and user prioritization on the network. States also expressed similar concerns during the state review process. Congress may consider requesting more information from FirstNet and AT&T on the FirstNet network's public safety grade features and availability to public safety users. They may also invite state and local public safety users to testify at hearings to understand issues affecting subscribership. Most public safety agencies use land mobile radios (LMR) for communication, and commercial vendors have developed specialized features for public safety users. Mission critical push-to-talk voice (MCPTT) includes standardized features for LMR devices and systems. LMR devices and systems have standardized features like Direct Mode, Push-to-Talk, Group call, Full Duplex Voice, Alerting, Talker identification, and Audio Quality. Public safety users seek these features on the FirstNet network. Standards for MCPTT features for LTE are also important. The standards for MCPTT features for LTE devices and networks, including FirstNet, were not developed when the law was signed. 3GPP prioritized developing technical standards for public safety broadband to ensure interoperability and competition in the equipment market. MCPTT standards over LTE networks were approved by 3GPP, but testing and validation are still needed. FirstNet's Band 14 network will not initially offer MCPTT voice, although responders can communicate on FirstNet/AT&T devices. However, critical MCPTT features will not be available on the FirstNet network initially. FirstNet is a high-speed data network expected to transmit data, video, and other features. MCPTT technology will be available by March 2019. State and local agencies can use their LMR systems until MCPTT voice is fully operational. Delays in MCPTT features may impact network subscriptions. FirstNet offers devices with modified features for public safety, but concerns exist about device policy. Some Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee raised questions about the ability of FirstNet devices to roam onto rural wireless networks. AT&T confirmed that responders can roam across networks operating on 3GPP standards. However, concerns were raised about device interoperability, with the Competitive Carriers Association stating that AT&T devices may not be compatible with public safety spectrum in Band Class 14. Public safety advocates questioned whether other carriers installing Band 14 into their devices could access FirstNet services. Carriers installing Band 14 into devices can access FirstNet services. Uncertainty remains about potential dual subscriptions for users and roaming capabilities for non-AT&T device holders. FirstNet/AT&T plans to establish a Bring Your Own Device policy for personal devices used by responders. They are expediting LTE Band 14 device development and supporting standards-based, interoperable devices and applications. FirstNet is testing devices at its Innovation Lab in Boulder, CO and actively involved in standards development. In 2017, they met with LTE device vendors at Mobile World Congress to discuss integrating LTE Band 14 and promoting public safety features. Congress may monitor device progress to ensure standards-based interoperability and consider flexible use of federal grant funds for multiple technologies. FirstNet/AT&T is ensuring a secure network for public safety by leveraging industry and federal best practices, integrating cybersecurity into devices and applications, screening devices based on AT&T and federal standards, and providing a secure Identify Management and Access Management system. They are collaborating with government departments to enhance cybersecurity measures. FirstNet is implementing layers of security, including firewalls and encryption, guided by industry standards and best practices. AT&T will monitor network traffic to ensure security, but there are still cybersecurity risks, especially with applications developed by outside developers. The DHS and GAO highlighted security concerns with public safety apps and the FirstNet network, emphasizing the need for screening and testing for vulnerabilities. The President's National Security Strategy also stressed the importance of prioritizing cybersecurity efforts for networks used for national security and public safety. Congress may encourage FirstNet to engage in ensuring network security. FirstNet, as required by Congress, is encouraged to engage with federal partners, state and local Chief Information Officers (CIO), and prioritize cybersecurity policies and training for users. The network must evolve with new technologies, and bidders were required to provide relevant services for public safety. FirstNet has been gathering input from first responders on useful data applications and tools through outreach efforts. Developers and first responders can test apps in the FirstNet lab and provide feedback on new applications. FirstNet is urged to ensure interoperability and security of network applications. Collaboration with federal partners like DHS and NIST is essential to address cybersecurity risks. Continuous engagement with partners will help in developing secure and interoperable applications for future federal users. FirstNet has driven innovation in public safety communications by providing mobile broadband devices. The Public Safety Innovation Accelerator Program, funded with $300 million, is driving research in public safety broadband. $38.5 million has been allocated for research on improving resiliency, real-time video analytics, location-based services, push-to-talk technologies, and indoor communications. Concerns include unclear cost-sharing for 5G upgrades between FirstNet/AT&T and public safety agencies, potential technology gaps, and affordability issues for some agencies. State and local entities are addressing privacy and jurisdictional concerns related to video cameras, drones, and small-cell equipment. FirstNet has established security and privacy specifications for mobile and IoT devices. State and local entities need to update governance bodies, procedures, training, and exercises to integrate FirstNet technologies into response protocols. Involving Chief Information Officers may aid in the integration of FirstNet technologies and cybersecurity. Officers (OCIO) may assist in integrating FirstNet technologies and cybersecurity. Congress may expand eligible activities and costs in federal grants to allow public safety users access to advanced technologies through FirstNet and AT&T. The network must be self-funded, and AT&T can charge users for network use. AT&T can also earn revenue from excess capacity of FirstNet's broadband spectrum. AT&T must pay FirstNet operating fees and has committed $40 billion for network build-out and maintenance. States can opt-in or opt-out of deploying the RAN, but public safety agencies are not required to subscribe to FirstNet. Financial challenge for FirstNet/AT&T is enrolling subscribers to the system. FirstNet/AT&T must offer better coverage, services, and features at an affordable price to attract users. Congressional considerations include attracting more users and promoting interoperability between agencies. Many public safety users still support LMR systems for mission critical voice. Congress may consider allowing the flexible use of grant funds to enable state and local agencies to fund LMR systems and FirstNet expenses, including devices and activities that integrate FirstNet capabilities into response. Congress can monitor the deployment and use of the FirstNet network to ensure the $6.5 billion federal funding and 20 MHz of public safety spectrum benefit public safety. Oversight will help understand critical aspects, deployment as intended, user subscriptions, and stakeholder involvement in hearings to meet public safety needs. FirstNet's staffing should be monitored by Congress to ensure effective management of the network deployment. Integration of FirstNet capabilities into response plans is crucial for readiness in emergencies. The act authorized $115 million for upgrading public safety answering points to NG911 capabilities. The $115 million grant aims to assist PSAPs in upgrading their networks, with NTIA and NHTSA jointly administering the grant. Congress can monitor the grant terms to ensure wise use of funding and encourage underserved PSAPs to apply. Collaboration between FirstNet, the 911 community, and the Band 14 network deployment is crucial for considering 911 needs in network planning. Congress can encourage coordination between FirstNet/AT&T and the 911 community for system upgrades and integration of PSAPs into the FirstNet network. The T-Band spectrum in the 470-512 MHz range is set to be reallocated for commercial use by 2021, with public safety entities required to relocate by 2023. NTIA will oversee the process. Public safety agencies on the T-Band spectrum need to relocate by 2023. NTIA will use auction proceeds to cover relocation costs. Options include moving to other frequencies or migrating to the FirstNet network. A study in 2013 showed shortages in spectrum availability, especially in urban areas, with an estimated transition cost of $5.9 billion. Concerns exist about the auction's ability to attract bidders. The FCC offered 700 MHz narrowband reserve channels for licensing, with T-Band licensees getting priority access. NPSTC's report highlighted the limited additional channels available. T-Band operators could migrate to FirstNet, but concerns exist about its readiness for mission-critical voice. At a November 1, 2017 hearing, Congress emphasized the importance of not disrupting critical communications capabilities during the deployment of the FirstNet network. FirstNet is working on providing MCPTT to primary users by 2019, but time is a critical factor. The T-Band agencies affected by this issue are located in large population centers and face challenges in transitioning systems and training personnel. The T-Band spectrum issue affects public safety systems in large population centers, including first responders. Congress may consult with affected jurisdictions/agencies to understand the impact of T-Band migration on public safety communications. Public safety agencies argue there is not enough comparable spectrum for migration by 2023, which could disrupt communications in these regions. In February 2018, Representatives Engel, Zeldin, and King of New York introduced the Don't Break Up the T-Band Act of 2018 to repeal Section 6103 of P.L. 112-96. In August 2017, Senators Warner, Garner, Wyden, and Daines introduced the Internet of Things (IoT) Act to establish cybersecurity standards for federal agencies' internet-connected devices. This bill requires contractors to certify that their devices are free of known vulnerabilities to protect federal IT systems. The bill introduced by Senators Warner, Garner, Wyden, and Daines in August 2017 aims to establish cybersecurity standards for federal agencies' internet-connected devices. Vendors supplying IoT devices to the U.S. government would need to ensure patchability, absence of hard-coded passwords, and freedom from known security vulnerabilities. Executive agencies would be required to inventory and create standards for internet-connected devices to protect federal systems from malicious attacks. Discussions are already underway regarding the potential intersection of IoT and public safety. The NG911 bill aims to expand a federal grant program to support NG911 improvements, promote interoperability with FirstNet, and include multiple technologies for contacting 9-1-1. It also requires reports on NG911 cyber vulnerabilities, agencies following 9-1-1 best practices, and PSAP resiliency improvements."
