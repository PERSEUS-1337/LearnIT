    "content": "The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United invalidated the federal ban on corporate treasury funding of independent expenditures and electioneering communications. However, the ban on corporate contributions to political candidates and parties remains in place. Corporations can establish separate segregated funds (PACs) to make contributions using their treasury funds. 501(c)(4) organizations, regardless of corporate status, cannot use their treasury funds for contributions to candidates and parties. They must establish a PAC for such purposes. These organizations must also comply with IRC requirements to maintain their tax-exempt status. Campaign activity cannot be their primary focus, and groups primarily benefiting partisan interests risk jeopardizing their 501(c)(4) status. 501(c)(4) organizations must not make campaign activity their primary focus to maintain their tax-exempt status. The Treasury regulation defines \"exclusively\" as primarily promoting the common good and general welfare, excluding campaign activity from social welfare purposes. The Treasury regulation clarifies that campaign activity cannot be the primary focus of 501(c)(4) organizations to maintain their tax-exempt status. The interpretation of \"exclusively\" as \"primarily\" may be challenged in court, where the plain meaning of the statutory language would be examined. Courts typically look for statutory definitions or accepted legal meanings when interpreting terms. The term \"exclusively\" is not defined in statute, leading to potential challenges in its interpretation. The dictionary defines \"exclusively\" as \"only\" or \"solely,\" suggesting the IRS's interpretation may be overly broad. However, a 1945 Supreme Court case established that even a single substantial non-exempt purpose can jeopardize an organization's tax-exempt status, regardless of its exempt purposes. The organization did not qualify for tax exemption because its primary pursuit involved non-exempt activities, despite the IRS allowing some campaign activity for 501(c)(4) groups. The use of \"primarily\" as a standard may permit more campaign activity than under a \"substantial\" standard. The argument is that the use of \"primarily\" in the regulation may allow more campaign activity compared to a \"substantial\" standard. Understanding how the IRS interprets the regulation is crucial. Courts may give high deference to agency interpretations, especially if Congress has not directly addressed the issue. The court will generally defer to the agency's interpretation of the statute if Congress has not directly addressed the issue, even if other interpretations could also be justified. The tax code and regulations do not specify how to determine if a 501(c)(4) organization's campaign activity is its primary activity. The primary issue regarding campaign activity for 501(c)(4) organizations is the lack of clear guidance from the IRS. There is debate over what \"primary\" means, what constitutes campaign activity, and how to measure an organization's activities. Some suggest a stricter standard than the common interpretation of \"more than 50%\", such as requiring campaign activity to be \"insubstantial\". Some suggest a safe harbor threshold for campaign activity expenditures for 501(c)(4) organizations, while the tax code lacks clarity on what constitutes campaign activity. The test is whether the activity shows a preference for or against a candidate, making it challenging to determine campaign intervention. The IRS lacks clarity on what constitutes campaign activity for 501(c)(4) organizations. Determining campaign intervention is difficult as preferences can be subtle, and it depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Assessing the level of campaign activities can be done through expenditures or by examining the organization's purpose and activities. In a private letter ruling, the IRS found that a 501(c)(4) group failed to establish that its primary activity was not campaign activity. The primary purpose test for 501(c)(4) organizations depends on various factors such as how activities are conducted, resources used, time devoted, purposes furthered, and funds received. The IRS considers these factors rather than just the amount spent on one activity. However, if the campaign intervention standard is deemed vague, it could impact how the IRS applies the test. To determine if a group violates the test, information on campaign activity and other activities is needed. The Form 990 is a key source of information for 501(c)(4) groups, providing details on campaign activity and other activities. Allegations of excessive campaign activity are common during election cycles, but a determination can only be made by examining all activities throughout the tax year. This means looking at both campaign and non-campaign related activities before making any conclusions. The IRS imposes limitations on 501(c)(4) organizations engaging in campaign activity, requiring them to primarily promote the common good and general welfare of the community. This includes not serving private benefits, even if they provide public benefits. The IRS rules that a 501(c)(4) organization benefiting partisan interests risks losing its status. Allegations of violations often involve the organization registering as a political committee under FECA, which imposes contribution limits and disclosure requirements on entities raising funds for federal candidates. Under FECA, political committees must register with the FEC and file reports identifying contributions, expenditures, and donors over $200. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court clarified that contributions and expenditures only include funds for express advocacy. Non-candidate controlled organizations must meet certain requirements to be considered political committees to avoid vagueness challenges. The Buckley Court established the \"major purpose test\" to determine if an organization is a \"political committee\" under FECA. The test applies if an organization raises more than $1,000 in contributions or makes more than $1,000 in expenditures. However, there is debate on how to determine the major purpose of an organization and which groups should be regulated as political committees. The major purpose test determines if an organization is a political committee under FECA. There is debate on how an organization's purpose must be the nomination or election of a candidate to trigger regulation. Depending on how primary activity is defined, an IRC-compliant 501(c)(4) organization could participate in enough campaign activity to be regulated as a political committee. Under the major purpose test, organizations must be registered and regulated as political committees under FECA. Debate exists on whether express advocacy is necessary for an organization to meet this test. 501(c)(4) organizations must file an annual Form 990 with the IRS, reporting their political activities on Schedule C. This includes describing direct and indirect campaign activities and reporting campaign expenditures. The Form 990 requires organizations to report campaign activities, expenditures, volunteer hours, political contributions, and details of payments made to Section 527 political organizations. Donors are not disclosed on Schedule C but are reported on Schedule B for substantial donors. The Form 990 requires organizations to report campaign activities, expenditures, volunteer hours, political contributions, and details of payments made to Section 527 political organizations. Schedule B lists substantial donors who contributed at least $5,000 during the year, but their identifying information is not publicly disclosed. Form 990 can be requested from the IRS using Form 4506-A, and Guidestar is a common source for accessing these forms. The Form 990 is not a timely source for 501(c)(4) campaign activity information as it is due on the 15th day of the 5th month following the organization's fiscal year. The Form 990 for 501(c) organizations is typically due on the 15th day of the 5th month after the fiscal year ends. Organizations can request extensions up to 6 months. When these organizations finance election-related communications, they must disclose donor information to the FEC, which makes the reports publicly available online within 48 hours. Organizations spending over $10,000 on electioneering communications in a calendar year must disclose certain details. Organizations making disbursements over $10,000 in a calendar year for election-related communications must disclose donor information to the FEC. This includes details such as the corporation's identity, amount of each disbursement over $200, names of candidates mentioned, and donors who contributed at least $1,000. There is an option to avoid disclosing all donors by establishing a separate bank account for electioneering communications. FEC regulations provide exceptions to donor disclosure requirements for corporations. The regulation allows corporations and labor unions to disclose donors who contributed at least $1,000 for electioneering communications. In Van Hollen v. Federal Election Commission, a court invalidated this regulation, stating that all contributors who donated over $1,000 must be disclosed, not just those who specified their donation for electioneering purposes. In September 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed a lower court decision and reinstated a regulation regarding the financing of electioneering communications. The court found that the statute was unclear and could be interpreted to include a \"purpose\" requirement. The FEC decided not to initiate a rulemaking process and chose to defend the current regulation. The FEC decided not to initiate a rulemaking process and defend the current regulation regarding electioneering communication reports. Organizations must file reports for disbursements over $10,000 for electioneering communication costs. Section 501(c) organizations making independent expenditures over $250 in a year must disclose details of the expenditure and contributors over $200 for that purpose. Independent expenditure reports are required to be filed quarterly, with additional reporting requirements closer to an election. Organizations spending over $50,000 on independent expenditures must file electronically. The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed campaign finance regulations in various landmark decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court has generally affirmed the constitutionality of disclosure requirements in cases like Federal Election Commission v. Doe and Doe v. Reed. Compelled disclosure may infringe on privacy rights, but the Court has recognized governmental interests. Exemptions from disclosure regulations require evidence of potential threats or harassment. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court justified campaign finance disclosure requirements to provide voters with information on campaign money sources and spending. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld finance disclosure requirements, stating that they increase information on candidate support. In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Court upheld disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, citing that they do not limit campaign activities. The Court upheld disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, applying \"exacting scrutiny\" to evaluate the regulation's relation to a government interest. The scope of disclosure requirements was not limited to express advocacy, as seen in previous cases like Buckley. The Court upheld disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, applying \"exacting scrutiny\" to evaluate the regulation's relation to a government interest. In response to concerns about deterrence of donations due to potential retaliation, the Court stated that disclosure requirements could be unconstitutional if donors faced threats, harassment, or reprisals. In a case involving a Washington State public records law, the Court upheld the constitutionality of compelled disclosure, including signatures on referendum petitions, under the First Amendment's exacting scrutiny standard. The Court upheld disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, stating that public disclosure promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral process. Insufficient evidence was found to support the argument that the disclosure law would subject petition signatories to threats, harassment, and reprisals."
