    "content": "The \"TBI Treatment Act\" is a pilot program for investigational treatment of traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder in members of the armed forces. The Secretary of Defense will implement a five-year pilot program to provide payment for investigational treatments of traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder for members of the Armed Forces in non-military health care facilities. Payment will be made directly to the health care facility. Treatment approval is subject to conditions including FDA approval for drugs or devices used. The treatment for traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder must be approved by the Secretary and an institutional review board. The patient must show improvement through various approved criteria such as neuropsychological testing, survey instruments, neurological imaging, and clinical examination. The patient must receive treatment voluntarily with informed consent. Restrictions apply for retired Armed Forces members entitled to benefits under the Social Security Act. The Secretary can establish additional restrictions for reimbursement. Payments for treatments for Armed Forces members are authorized under section 1074 of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary will make payments for treatments based on reimbursement rates or cost-reimbursement basis. A database will be maintained for patient case data confidentiality and limited use. The Secretary will ensure an Internet website lists civilian institutional review board studies receiving payments. Members of the Armed Forces can be assigned temporary duty for treatment of traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder. The Secretary may waive ethics rules for travel assistance to Armed Forces members receiving treatment. Memoranda of Understanding will be made with civilian institutions for this purpose. The Secretary of Defense will establish agreements with civilian institutions to provide Armed Forces members with treatment overseen by civilian review boards. A process will be set up to inform members of this opportunity, and an annual report on the implementation of this section will be submitted to Congress. The authority to make payments under this section will terminate five years after the enactment of the Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year for the Secretary to make payments under this section."
