    "content": "The International Criminal Court (\"ICC\" or \"Court\") was established in 2002 to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Cases can be referred by States Parties or the U.N. Security Council, and the ICC prosecutor can request authorization to investigate. The United States, not a party to the ICC, was initially supportive but did not ratify the Rome Statute. In 2002, President George W. Bush decided not to become a Party to the Rome Statute due to concerns about ICC jurisdiction over U.S. officials and armed forces. The U.S. also signed bilateral immunity agreements with around 100 countries to avoid surrendering individuals to the ICC. Congress passed legislation limiting U.S. cooperation with the ICC, and President Bush signed the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002 (ASPA) signed by George W. Bush restricts U.S. government cooperation with the ICC, prohibits U.S. participation in certain U.N. peacekeeping operations, and authorizes the President to free individuals detained by the ICC. An exception allows assisting the ICC in prosecuting foreign nationals accused of ICC crimes. The U.S. softened its stance towards the ICC during Bush's second term, treating it as a tool for international criminal justice. In 2008, the U.S. did not veto a U.N. Security Council resolution referring a war crimes case to the ICC prosecutor. The Obama Administration has shown support for the ICC, attending meetings and expressing willingness to engage with the Court. The U.S. maintains concerns about the ICC's impact on American officials and military members, and ratification of the Statute is not currently an option. In 2009, the U.S. attended an ICC meeting for the first time as an observer, signaling a shift towards cooperation with the Court. The United States will participate in the ICC Review Conference in 2010 as required by Article 123 of the Rome Statute. The ASP created a Working Group to prepare for the conference by evaluating issues and potential agenda items. The ASP created a Working Group to guide decision-making for the Review Conference agenda and resolutions. The ASP approved Uganda's application to host the Conference in Kampala. Resolutions were adopted to convene the Review Conference and define its agenda, including amendments to the Rome Statute and ICC jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. The Review Conference agenda includes proposals to remove Article 124 from the Statute, expand the definition of war crimes, and discuss the ICC's work and impact on international justice. Discussions will cover cooperation among States Parties, improving national judicial systems, and prosecuting individuals for war crimes. The Review Conference agenda includes discussions on the ICC's impact on international justice, cooperation among States Parties, and improving national judicial systems' capacity to prosecute war crimes. The central issue considered is the proposed adoption of the crime of aggression into the Court's jurisdiction, including different stakeholders' positions and the definition of aggression. During negotiations to finalize the Rome Statute in 1998, some countries wanted to include aggression as a crime under the ICC's jurisdiction to end impunity for waging aggressive war. However, there was disagreement on the definition and jurisdiction provisions, so aggression was included in the Rome Statute without being defined or activated. Article 5, paragraph 1 lists the international crimes within the Court's jurisdiction. The Rome Statute includes jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. The Court will exercise jurisdiction over aggression once a provision defining the crime is adopted. A Review Conference is required to consider and adopt any additions to the Rome Statute. A Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression was created by the ASP in 2002 to propose amendments defining the crime and the Court's jurisdiction. The SWG faced challenges in its work due to the prosecution of the Court's existing crimes in previous cases. The Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression was created in 2002 to define and exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. Unlike other international crimes, aggression jurisprudence has been frozen since the late 1940s. International recognition for certain uses of force has expanded since the end of the Cold War, with an increase in U.N.-mandated peacekeeping operations since 1991. Since 1991, U.N.-mandated peacekeeping operations have significantly increased. The consideration of prosecuting illegal uses of force is complicated by the acceptance of military action by the international community. The crime of aggression, a jus ad bellum crime, poses challenges in fitting into the jurisdictional practice of jus in bello crimes. Various observers and governments, including the United States, have debated the benefits and risks of including aggression in the ICC's jurisdiction. During the Review Conference, some States Parties and the United States opposed adopting jurisdictional provisions for aggression without consensus, fearing permanent discord. Some participants believed activating aggression as an ICC crime was crucial to reduce illegal military action, while others argued it could overburden the Court with new cases. Some argued that adopting aggression as an ICC crime could hinder universal acceptance of its jurisdiction, as major powers like the US, China, Russia, and India had concerns. Activating aggression may deter these countries from becoming States Parties to the Rome Statute. State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh and US officials have expressed concerns about the ICC's jurisdiction over aggression, stating that military action decisions are inherently political and could compromise the ICC's impartiality. The United States officials are concerned about the International Criminal Court's ability to prosecute government officials for military actions, fearing that U.S. decision makers would be at risk of prosecution. This could potentially deter U.S. officials from initiating military action due to fear of ICC prosecution. The Department of Defense also remains concerned about the ICC's activation of the crime of aggression. The Department of Defense is worried about the ICC prosecuting U.S. Armed Forces for military operations abroad. Ambassador Rapp stated that if concerns are not addressed before new aggression provisions are adopted, universal acceptance of ICC jurisdiction will decrease. States Parties to the Rome Statute reached consensus on defining the crime of aggression and the ICC's jurisdiction over it. The SWG developed the definition of the crime of aggression proposed at the Review Conference with input from various stakeholders. The definition is based on a U.N. General Assembly resolution from 1974, with general support from the United States. The SWG successfully produced consensus among States Parties for the definition of the \"crime of aggression\" at the Review Conference. The adopted definition includes both the \"crime of aggression\" and an \"act of aggression,\" with specific criteria outlined for each. The definition of aggression includes acts such as military invasion, bombardment, blockading ports, attacking armed forces, aiding in aggression, and sending irregular forces into another state. States Parties and stakeholders were generally satisfied with this definition. Critics of the definition of aggression developed by the SWG argue that it is vague, overly broad, and could lead to politically motivated prosecutions. They believe that a clear definition is crucial due to limited jurisprudence on aggression crimes. The definition of aggression developed by the SWG is criticized for being vague and overly broad, potentially leading to politically motivated prosecutions. Concerns include the inclusion of lower-level commanders and officers, the difficulty in determining what constitutes a \"manifest violation\" of the U.N. Charter, and the possibility of small incursions being considered prosecutable aggression. The definition of aggression developed by the SWG is criticized for being vague and overly broad, potentially leading to politically motivated prosecutions. Concerns include the inclusion of lower-level commanders and officers, the difficulty in determining what constitutes a \"manifest violation\" of the U.N. Charter, and the possibility of small incursions being considered prosecutable aggression. Ambassador Rapp and the U.S. delegation to the Review Conference have expressed concerns about the proposed definition, stating that it could weaken the core human rights mission of the ICC by limiting certain uses of force to stop atrocities. Other observers believe the definition is detailed enough to describe prohibited actions and will only target the highest-ranking officials. Despite some criticisms, the definition has received consensus support from States Parties and stakeholders. The U.S. delegation accepted the definition of aggression but promoted an interpretation to protect U.S. interests. States Parties included \"understandings\" to guide the Court in interpreting the provisions added, maintaining a threshold for acts that may lead to an aggression prosecution. The language aims to minimize the possibility of uses of force. The language added to the definition of aggression aims to protect against prosecutions for low-level incidents or military activities undertaken to stop atrocities. It sets a threshold for acts that may lead to an aggression prosecution, requiring acts of sufficient character, gravity, and scale to constitute a manifest violation of the U.N. Charter. The States Parties adopted elements of the crime of aggression in a separate annex to the aggression resolution, further sharpening the definition in the Statute. The annex states that there is no requirement for an accused individual to determine if an act violates the U.N. Charter. The new article activating the Court's jurisdiction over the crime of aggression was the most debated action at the Review Conference. The Review Conference saw contentious debates over activating the ICC's jurisdiction for the crime of aggression. Key issues included state consent and the role of the U.N. Security Council in determining cases. The final version of the jurisdiction provision was decided during the Conference after substantial revisions to the original proposals. The Review Conference debated the authority to initiate an aggression case before the Court, with options involving the Security Council and the ICC prosecutor. Two alternative versions of jurisdiction activation provisions were proposed, with different options for the prosecutor to proceed with an investigation based on Security Council findings. The Review Conference discussed options for initiating an aggression case before the ICC, including provisions for the prosecutor to act if the Security Council does not make a determination within six months. Various options were considered, such as authorization from the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber, the U.N. General Assembly, or the International Court of Justice. The inclusion of aggression as a crime under ICC jurisdiction raised questions about state consent based on nationality or territory. States Parties and stakeholders had differing views on this issue. During the Conference, States Parties and stakeholders debated the Court's jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. Some argued that aggressor state consent should not be required, while others, like the United States, believed that the crime of aggression involves official state decisions and should be treated differently from other ICC crimes. The debate at the Conference focused on the ICC's jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. Some argued that aggressor state consent should not be needed for prosecution, while others, including the United States, believed that official state decisions should be treated differently. Legal Adviser Koh suggested that aggressor state consent should be required for ICC aggression cases to preserve sovereignty rights. Concerns were raised about a potential increase in aggression cases in national courts due to the ICC's complementarity principle. Some argue that national courts may try aggression cases for political reasons, leading some states to reject ICC jurisdiction. Certain countries, including the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, support Security Council jurisdiction over aggression cases. Many States Parties oppose giving sole authority to the Security Council for ICC aggression cases, including non-aligned movement countries and African nations. Arguments for Security Council control stem from its role in addressing acts of aggression and maintaining international peace and security. Some believe the Security Council should have the discretion to allow ICC aggression cases to proceed. Some countries argue that allowing ICC aggression investigations without Security Council sanction may violate international law. Legal Adviser Koh warns of potential conflicts if ICC independently determines aggression, leading to confusion. Others believe Security Council would be unwilling to determine aggression, allowing ICC cases to proceed. Opponents argue that giving the Security Council sole authority to initiate ICC aggression cases could hinder the ICC's judicial independence, as it would rely on a political entity to determine jurisdiction. This could weaken the ICC as an institution. Some argue that the Security Council's role in determining ICC jurisdiction over aggression cases could weaken the Court's independence and effectiveness in prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Concerns also exist about the possible politicization of the crime of aggression under the Rome Statute. The Security Council's role in determining ICC jurisdiction over aggression cases is debated. Some argue it could weaken the Court's independence and effectiveness, while others advocate for complete separation of the ICC's judicial process from the Security Council's decisions. The States Parties at the Review Conference adopted two new articles for the Rome Statute, addressing concerns about state consent to aggression jurisdiction and Security Council authority over the ICC's exercise of such jurisdiction. The provisions represent compromises and aim to provide protections for U.S. servicemembers and officials. Delegation of aggression cases under ICC jurisdiction can be initiated by a State Party referral or by the ICC prosecutor. Certain conditions and restrictions apply, such as involving officials of a State Party and taking place in the territory of a State Party. If a State Party has opted out of aggression jurisdiction, no case can be initiated. The ICC prosecutor must also consider involvement of non-party state nationals or nationals of a State Party that has opted out of aggression jurisdiction. The ICC prosecutor must determine if the Security Council has declared an act of aggression. If no determination is made within six months, the prosecutor can proceed with an investigation with authorization from the ICC's Pre-Trial Division. The Security Council can refer aggression cases involving officials from any state, regardless of their status under the Rome Statute. The Security Council retains authority to defer aggression cases for one year under the Rome Statute. The ICC may not exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until two-thirds of States Parties agree after January 1, 2017. States Parties adopted jurisdiction activation provisions for aggression but delayed its exercise. The Rome Statute delays consideration of defining aggression and the ICC's jurisdiction over the crime. The aggression jurisdiction amendments allow the Court to exercise jurisdiction only over crimes committed after January 1, 2017, and after 30 States Parties accept the amendments. States can be exempt from ICC aggression jurisdiction activation provisions. The Rome Statute delays defining aggression and the ICC's jurisdiction over the crime. States can be exempt from ICC aggression jurisdiction activation provisions, allowing them to avoid prosecution for aggression cases involving their nationals or territory. States Parties must prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The ICC's jurisdiction is based on complementarity, where it only prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide when no state with jurisdiction is willing to prosecute. The adoption of aggression jurisdiction does not create an obligation to prosecute individuals for aggression crimes under complementarity principles. This addresses concerns about prosecuting state officials for military and political decisions. The States Parties' adoption of understanding on aggression prosecutions indicates acceptance that such cases will be confined to the ICC, weakening universal jurisdiction of states. U.S. officials are satisfied with the aggression jurisdiction provisions, despite concerns about creating different classes of crimes under the Rome Statute. The United States, as a non-party state, cannot be subjected to ICC jurisdiction for aggression crimes initiated by State Party referral or the ICC prosecutor. The United States has veto power over ICC aggression cases on its soil or involving its nationals. U.S. Armed Forces and officials are not at risk of prosecution. The activation of aggression provisions has been delayed until 2017, allowing for further debate. Ambassador Rapp and Legal Adviser Koh view this delay as a temporary solution that can be revisited. The United States has veto power over ICC aggression cases involving its nationals, with a delay in activating aggression provisions until 2017. This allows for further debate and a focus on the original three ICC crimes. Article 124 of the Rome Statute allows a State Party to declare non-acceptance of the Court's jurisdiction for the first seven years, exempting prosecution for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed by its nationals or on its territory during that period. During the Review Conference, the ASP proposed deleting Article 124 of the Rome Statute, which allowed States Parties to declare non-acceptance of the ICC's jurisdiction for the first seven years. Supporters argued it was no longer needed as a transitional provision, with only two States Parties utilizing the exemption. The provision's own language requiring a review under Article 123 supported the proposal. During the Review Conference, the ASP proposed deleting Article 124 of the Rome Statute, which allowed States Parties to declare non-acceptance of the ICC's jurisdiction for the first seven years. France and Venezuela availed themselves of the exemption, but proponents argued for its removal to reflect the ICC's growth and importance under international law. Some believed maintaining the exemption could encourage more states to join the Rome Statute, even if they don't activate their exemption rights. Ultimately, the States Parties chose not to amend the Rome Statute. The ASP proposed deleting Article 124 of the Rome Statute, which allowed States Parties to exempt themselves from ICC jurisdiction for seven years. Japan and the EU emphasized its importance for universal acceptance of ICC jurisdiction. A resolution was included to add certain types of weapons in non-international conflicts to the definition of war crimes under Article 8(2)(e) of the Rome Statute. This would outlaw actions like employing poison or poisoned weapons, gases, and bullets that expand easily in the human body. The Review Conference proposed adding prohibitions on certain types of weapons in non-international conflicts to the Rome Statute. The United States expressed concerns about these provisions, particularly regarding their application to domestic authorities and U.S. Armed Forces activities in conflicts like Afghanistan and Iraq. Rosa Brooks, Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, highlighted the necessity of using certain types of weapons in counter-terrorism operations and domestic law enforcement. The Review Conference proposed adding prohibitions on certain types of weapons in non-international conflicts to the Rome Statute. Rosa Brooks, Senior Advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, emphasized the importance of using specific weapons in counter-terrorism operations and domestic law enforcement. The new prohibitions were adopted by States Parties for addition to Article 8(2)(e) at the Review Conference, with interpretations differing on the intent required for the use of certain bullet types. During the Review Conference, discussions were held on cooperation of States Parties with the ICC, the principle of complementarity, the Court's impact on victims and affected communities, and the relationship between peace and justice in armed conflict. During the Review Conference, States Parties discussed justice for crimes during armed conflict, resolutions on victims and complementarity, and the need for cooperation. Observers found the conference productive, focusing on States Parties' obligations under the Rome Statute and the ICC's impact beyond prosecutions. The discussions highlighted the importance of political will and governmental capabilities in accepting the ICC's jurisdiction and cooperating on cases. During the Review Conference, States Parties and observers discussed the ICC's effectiveness. Subject-matter experts led discussions, focusing on concrete strategies. The U.S. delegation participated as an observer, playing a central role in the stocktaking sessions. Observers promoted U.S. involvement due to its diplomatic and technical support in international criminal justice. The U.S. delegation played a central role in the stocktaking sessions at the Review Conference. They were the only non-party state to make specific pledges of support in improving work in four areas. Despite restrictions, the U.S. has provided technical assistance to the ICC and will continue to do so on a case-by-case basis. Legal Adviser Koh stated that this assistance does not require a change in U.S. law. States Parties are obligated to cooperate with the ICC in investigations and prosecutions. During the Review Conference, States Parties discussed cooperation with the ICC, focusing on issues like executing arrest warrants and the lack of national legislation allowing cooperation. Ad hoc agreements were suggested as solutions for national law deficiencies. During the Review Conference, States Parties discussed the need for ad hoc agreements to address national law deficiencies in cooperation with the ICC, including transfers of arrested individuals, enforcement of sentences, and relocation of witnesses. It was emphasized that defense teams should receive equal assistance as prosecution teams, and ICC and State Party assistance is crucial for capacity building and enabling full cooperation with the Court. Some States Parties face obstacles in cooperating with the ICC due to internal political concerns. There were concerns about the ICC's inability to punish non-cooperative States Parties and the hope that the ASP would take action. During the Review Conference, States Parties discussed the need for ad hoc agreements to address national law deficiencies in cooperation with the ICC, including transfers of arrested individuals, enforcement of sentences, and relocation of witnesses. The States Parties adopted a declaration emphasizing obligations to cooperate with the Court, encouraging voluntary cooperation agreements, and sharing lessons learned from prior ICC cooperation. They also adopted a resolution to strengthen enforcement of sentences, calling on States Parties to indicate willingness to receive sentenced individuals. Ambassador Rapp stated that the United States can foster ICC cooperation. Ambassador Rapp emphasized the importance of U.S. cooperation with the ICC, particularly in providing resources for locating, arresting, and transporting accused individuals for prosecution. The United States also expressed intent to assist ICC investigations into alleged atrocities during Kenya's 2009 elections. ICC officials highlighted the need for diplomatic support and resources from the U.S. to facilitate their work, especially in ongoing investigations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ICC serves as a last resort for prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. States Parties are expected to cooperate in arresting and prosecuting individuals accused of these crimes. The United States is shifting towards cooperating with the ICC instead of ad hoc tribunals, with a focus on completing ongoing prosecutions. During the Review Conference, States Parties discussed the need to improve national judicial systems to prosecute ICC crimes, known as positive complementarity. The ICC serves as a last resort for prosecuting high-level perpetrators when states are unable to prosecute. ICC investigations show the court's intent to address atrocity crimes. During the Review Conference, States Parties emphasized the importance of enhancing national judicial systems to prosecute ICC crimes, known as positive complementarity. Experts and representatives highlighted the need for national laws to allow prosecution of ICC crimes and the establishment of special national courts for alleged perpetrators. Assistance from international organizations, particularly the United Nations, was also recommended to help States Parties improve their national systems. During the Review Conference, States Parties stressed the need to enhance national judicial systems for prosecuting ICC crimes, known as positive complementarity. The resolution adopted at the conference reiterated the primary role of States Parties in prosecuting ICC crimes and called for increased international and state-to-state assistance to strengthen their ability to prosecute these crimes. Ambassador Rapp expressed U.S. support for this concept. The United States supports positive complementarity, aiding other states in developing their judicial capacity to prosecute ICC crimes. This aligns with the U.S. government's stance that sovereign nations should handle war crimes and atrocity crimes prosecution. The U.S. is actively involved in building judicial capacity globally, co-sponsoring programs to improve judicial systems in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. States pledged to continue aid for improving national judicial systems, including capacity to prosecute ICC crimes and share information. Calls were made for new funding for the ASP Secretariat to lead capacity building programs for States Parties. Meetings at the Review Conference discussed the ICC's impact on victims and the relationship of international justice to peace efforts in war-affected societies. Participants praised the Rome Statute's provisions for victim participation in ICC proceedings and the court's role in breaking the silence. The ICC's role in giving victims a voice and providing reparations is crucial. Efforts are needed to improve outreach to victims and increase ICC field presence. Intermediary involvement from NGOs and religious leaders is recommended to better inform and involve victims in the ICC process. Increasing assistance for victims' rehabilitation through the ICC's Trust Fund for Victims is also proposed. States Parties need to support the Trust Fund to ensure victims receive necessary help. Some participants at the Conference argued for increased contributions to the ICC's Trust Fund to support women victims living near perpetrators. The ICC's activities have helped dispel the notion that peace and justice in armed conflicts are mutually exclusive. Concerns about politically motivated prosecutions slowing down the Court's progress were also raised. The ICC's pursuit of justice has aided peace processes by marginalizing accused criminals who obstruct political settlements. Failing to ensure justice can weaken peace agreements by fueling animosity and hindering compromise between former enemies. Justice measures by the ICC may need careful sequencing to avoid undermining peace efforts, with possible U.N. Security Council deferments of prosecutions under Article 16 of the Rome Statute. Participants at the Review Conference recognized the need for national and local transitional justice measures to support the ICC in strengthening lasting peace. Some attendees expressed concerns that ICC activities could potentially delay peace settlements. A resolution was adopted highlighting the importance of preserving victims' rights and protections provided in the Rome Statute through national legislation. The resolution also called for increased accessibility to victims, more funding for the Trust Fund for Victims, and enhanced cooperation among States Parties, the ICC, and the Trust Fund Secretariat. The Review Conference participants emphasized the need for national and local transitional justice measures to support the ICC in promoting lasting peace. They adopted a resolution to preserve victims' rights, increase accessibility to victims, provide more funding for the Trust Fund for Victims, and enhance cooperation among States Parties, the ICC, and the Trust Fund Secretariat. Additionally, changes to the Rome Statute were made to expand the ICC's jurisdiction by adding the crime of aggression as a prosecutable offense. The Review Conference participants adopted changes to the Rome Statute to expand the ICC's jurisdiction by adding the crime of aggression as a prosecutable offense, despite objections from the United States. The States Parties are in favor of enhancing the ICC's role in international criminal justice to promote peaceful resolution of disputes and deter unlawful military activities. The U.S. delegation did not condemn the addition of aggression provisions, which seem to exclude U.S. officials and Armed Forces from prosecution. The Review Conference adopted changes to the Rome Statute to include the crime of aggression as a prosecutable offense, despite U.S. objections. U.S. officials and Armed Forces may be excluded from prosecution for aggression, but concerns remain about ICC prosecution for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The Obama Administration has stated that the U.S. will not join the ICC soon, but is engaging with the Court on major issues. The Obama Administration's official policy towards the ICC is one of engagement as an observer nation, with pledges of support made at the Review Conference. Congress may further examine the U.S.-ICC relationship and ASPA restrictions through hearings. Congress may conduct hearings to gather information on U.S. engagement with the ICC, including activities of executive agencies, in-kind assistance, Administration policy, potential U.S. party status to the Rome Statute, and implications for U.S. interests, especially the security of the U.S. Armed Forces. The U.S. Armed Forces may be subject to the ICC's jurisdiction for the crime of aggression. Congress could require periodic reports on U.S. cooperation with the ICC, despite ASPA prohibiting funds for ICC support. Reporting on U.S. assistance to the ICC could reveal if activities comply with legislative restrictions. ICC developments and investigations into U.S. officials could also be monitored. Congress may enact new legislation to provide direction on the U.S.-ICC relationship, including addressing the crime of aggression and defining U.S. assistance to the ICC. Legislation could set new authorities or limitations on U.S. involvement with the Court and outline U.S. support or opposition to ICC activities."
