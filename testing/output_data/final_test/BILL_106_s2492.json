    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Weapons Complex Conversion Act of 2000\". It includes findings related to the act. The Russian nuclear weapons complex is still at its Cold War size, with little information shared and 10 sensitive closed cities. These cities house 750,000 people and employ 150,000 in nuclear military facilities. The Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic Energy has been slow in downsizing its workforce, facing economic and social obstacles. In contrast, the United States has downsized its nuclear weapons complex openly and transparently, creating a significant imbalance. The United States should assist Russia in reducing its nuclear weapons production capacity to address the existing imbalance and support future arms reduction agreements. This assistance is crucial for achieving nonproliferation objectives and ensuring the protection of nuclear weapons, materials, and secrets during reductions. The Nuclear Cities Initiative aims to create job opportunities in Russia to address downsizing and nuclear security concerns. However, the current scope and funding of the program are insufficient to address the threats to the United States. Expansion and acceleration of progress in the nuclear cities are necessary to effectively address national security interests. The Nuclear Cities Initiative has laid the groundwork for increased investment and risk reduction in Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Seversk, Russian cities with key nuclear facilities. Progress has been made with limited funding, but rapid conversion and restructuring are needed to gain additional support. Reductions in nuclear weapons-grade material stocks in the US and Russia improve future prospects. The United States and Russia's efforts to enhance arms control agreements and reduce proliferation risks are bolstered by transparency in their weapons-grade materials stockpiles. However, the lack of coordination among US government agencies hinders progress in cooperative threat reduction and nonproliferation efforts. A formal single point of coordination is crucial for effective program implementation. The downsizing, transparency, and nonproliferation of the nuclear weapons complex in the Russian Federation can be effectively managed with the help of specialists trained in nonproliferation studies from the United States and former Soviet Union. This assistance can minimize the threat of proliferation of weapons materials or expertise. Expansion and enhancement of Nuclear Cities Initiative. The Secretary of Energy will expand and enhance the Nuclear Cities Initiative to assist Russia in downsizing its nuclear complex and coordinate with other US nonproliferation programs. This includes facilitating the use of MINATOM technology and research services for peaceful purposes. The Department of Energy is authorized to commercialize research and development services for industry. Other government departments are encouraged to utilize these services for activities related to environmental remediation, nonproliferation, global energy, and basic scientific research. The Secretary of Energy is tasked with accelerating the Nuclear Cities Initiative by converting military activities to civilian activities in specific nuclear cities. Before implementing programs, appropriate milestones for the first year must be established. Additionally, there is a plan for restructuring the Russian Nuclear Complex. The Secretary of Energy is urged to negotiate with Russia to restructure the Russian Nuclear Complex by 2010. This plan should ensure Russia's compliance with arms control agreements and increase transparency in nuclear weapons production processes. The Secretary of Energy is tasked with negotiating a plan with Russia to restructure its Nuclear Complex by 2010, focusing on transparency and compliance with arms control agreements. The plan includes measurable milestones for monitoring progress and encourages students in both countries to pursue careers in nonproliferation. $50,000,000 is authorized for the Nuclear Cities Initiative in fiscal year 2001, with $2,000,000 allocated for the career encouragement program. The availability of funds for the Nuclear Cities Initiative in fiscal years after 2001 should be contingent upon demonstrable progress in programs and the development of an implementation plan. Sense of Congress on the establishment of a National Coordinator for nonproliferation matters. The Sense of Congress is that there should be a National Coordinator for Nonproliferation Matters to oversee various programs related to nuclear nonproliferation. The Coordinator's role should be similar to the position designated by the President under the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, \"nuclear city\" refers to closed nuclear cities within the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy complex, including Sarov, Zarechnyy, Novoural'sk, Lesnoy, Ozersk, Snezhinsk, Trechgornyy, Seversk, Zhelenznogorsk, and Zelenogorsk. The term \"Russian Nuclear Complex\" encompasses all nuclear cities in Russia."
