    "content": "U.S.-Israel defense, diplomatic, and economic cooperation has been close for decades, based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. The United States was the first country to recognize Israel in 1948, leading to evolving relations through legislation, agreements, and trade. Congress supports Israel's security through military assistance and legislation, contributing to regional stability for over 45 years. Some lawmakers have provided funding exceeding executive branch requests for programs benefiting Israel. Israel's security concerns include Iran's influence and actions. Israel has sought to influence U.S. policy on Iran and supported the U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement. Israel has conducted airstrikes targeting Iran-backed groups in Syria to prevent an indefinite Iranian presence. Israel's relationship with Russia has become more important due to Russia's cooperation with Iran in Syria. Israel faces security threats from Iran in Syria and advanced air defense systems. The country also deals with threats from Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza, while navigating humanitarian and security challenges with Egypt. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, political disputes persist over key issues such as security parameters, borders, settlements, refugees, and Jerusalem. Domestic politics and leadership uncertainties make diplomatic concessions difficult for both Israelis and Palestinians. The Trump Administration's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the relocation of the U.S. embassy have complicated Israeli-Palestinian relations. Israeli leaders are debating diplomatic options and the importance of their relationship with the United States. Geopolitical factors set Israel apart from other developed countries. The quest for a modern Jewish homeland can be traced back to Theodor Herzl's publication of The Jewish State in 1896, inspired by European nationalism and anti-Semitism. The first Zionist Congress encouraged Jewish settlement in Palestine, supported by the British government's Balfour Declaration during World War I. Palestine became a British Mandate after the war. After becoming a British Mandate, Palestine saw increased Jewish immigration, leading to tensions with the Arab population and British authorities. Post-World War II, the demand for a Jewish homeland grew urgent, while Arabs sought self-determination. In 1947, the UN proposed a partition plan for Palestine, welcomed by Jewish leaders for conferring legitimacy on their aspirations. The Jewish Yishuv welcomed the UN partition plan for Palestine, seen as legitimizing their claims despite Arab opposition. After civil conflict, Britain ended its Mandate in 1948, leading to the proclamation of Israel's independence and subsequent Arab invasions. This resulted in the displacement of roughly 700,000 Palestinians, known as the nakba. After the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians during the nakba, many became refugees in neighboring Arab states or areas controlled by Jordan and Egypt. Israel signed armistice agreements with Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, leading to the establishment of roughly New Jersey-sized territory. Subsequent armed conflicts occurred in 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982, with ongoing threats of Palestinian attacks. Peace treaties were later signed with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994, reducing the likelihood of multi-front wars. Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral parliament (the Knesset) electing a president for a seven-year term. The current president is Reuven Rivlin. Israel does not have a written constitution but follows Basic Laws. The country has an independent judiciary system with magistrates' courts and district courts headed by a Supreme Court. The political spectrum is highly fragmented, with small parties holding significant power due to a low vote threshold for entry into the Knesset. Since Israel's founding, the average lifespan of an Israeli government has been about 23 months. In 2014, the Knesset somewhat tightened the conditions for bringing down a government. Israeli society and politics have evolved from being dominated by secular Ashkenazi Jews to a more diverse landscape. The social democratic Mapai/Labor movement led Israeli governing coalitions until the 1977 electoral victory of Menachem Begin's Likud party. Likud party, led by Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, empowered marginalized Mizrahi Jews and drove the political agenda for 15 years. Labor's momentum slowed after Rabin's assassination in 1995, leading to warnings about Israel's future as a Jewish and democratic state. Ariel Sharon split from Likud to establish his own political path. Netanyahu, a champion of the Israeli right and settlement movement, founded Kadima in 2005 as a centrist alternative. He served as prime minister from 2009, leading multiple coalitions. The appeal of Netanyahu and right-of-center parties to Israeli voters may be due to various factors, including arguments that Palestinians rejected peace and Israeli withdrawals emboldened Hezbollah and Hamas. Netanyahu's leadership has been influenced by distinct groups like Russian speakers from the former Soviet Union. The Israeli political landscape is influenced by diverse groups, including those who emigrated from the former Soviet Union and citizens aligned with the \"national religious\" movement. Compromise among these groups is necessary to form and maintain governing coalitions, with smaller parties having disproportionate influence. Netanyahu relies on support from Haredi parties for his coalition, which can be at odds with secular middle-class voters. Israeli middle class voters and Arab Israeli citizens have differing preferences in how government resources should be allocated. Arab Israelis tend to align with left-of-center parties, but forming governing coalitions is challenging due to the absence of Arab parties in them. Prime Minister Netanyahu leads a coalition of right-of-center parties, facing difficulties in consensus-building on issues like national security and preserving Israel's Jewish identity. The Israeli police recommended indicting Prime Minister Netanyahu for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. Netanyahu denies the allegations and plans to stay in office to pursue Israel's well-being, but his position as prime minister could be threatened. The recommendations cover two specific cases involving illicit gifts from billionaire benefactors. Netanyahu is alleged to have received illicit gifts from billionaire benefactors in exchange for favors. Case 2000 involves a suspected quid pro quo deal with a publisher for favorable coverage. Additional instances of corruption involving Netanyahu or his associates have also surfaced. In June 2018, Sara Netanyahu was indicted for fraudulent use of state funds. Netanyahu could face public pressure to resign if indicted, similar to former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert amid corruption allegations. The Knesset passed legislation defining Israel as the national homeland of the Jewish people and voted to withhold funds from the Palestinian Authority. Controversial legislation has passed in Israel, including stipends for Palestinian prisoners and their families, restrictions on surrogate parenting, and applying Israeli law to West Bank settlements. Critics warn these initiatives may threaten key institutions like the media and judiciary. In 2017, a decision to allow mixed-gender prayer at the Western Wall plaza was suspended. The Israeli government is reviewing policies on mixed-gender prayer at the Western Wall plaza and African migrants. There is a possibility of early elections if the governing coalition splits over cases against Prime Minister Netanyahu. Netanyahu may face challenges from figures on the right, center, or left of the political spectrum. Israel's economy is driven by an advanced high-tech sector, with well-developed agricultural and industrial sectors. The government may call for early elections before a decision on criminal charges against Prime Minister Netanyahu, who seeks a popular mandate to stay in office. Netanyahu faces challenges from various political figures across the spectrum. Israel's economy is experiencing moderate growth, with projections of around 3% over the next five years. Despite a positive macroeconomic profile, the country faces high levels of poverty and income inequality, particularly affecting Arab Israelis and ultra-Orthodox Jews. Israel relies on strengths and coordination with Arab states to manage security threats. It maintains military superiority over neighbors and Palestinians, updating efforts to project strength and defend borders. Israel has reduced unconventional threats through missile defense, cyber warfare capabilities, and heightened security measures. The military features approximately 180,000 active duty personnel and 445,000 reserves, aided by mandatory conscription for young Jewish Israelis. Israel's defense budget is $16.4 billion, constituting 4.6% of its GDP. It has a robust homeland security system with early warning practices, border controls, and reinforced shelters. Israel is constructing a national border fence network to prevent infiltration and smuggling. Israel maintains a policy of \"nuclear opacity\" and is not part of the NPT. Israel maintains a policy of \"nuclear opacity\" and is estimated to possess around 80-85 nuclear warheads. The United States has accepted Israel's nuclear ambiguity since 1969. Israeli officials closely consult with U.S. counterparts to influence decision-making on regional issues, emphasizing Israel's security and its value as a U.S. ally. Israel is a key U.S. ally with shared values, but lacks a formal defense treaty. Concerns about Iran drive closer relations between Israel and Arab Gulf states. Prime Minister Netanyahu has opposed the Iran nuclear deal and sought U.S. influence. Prime Minister Netanyahu opposed the JCPOA, welcomed President Trump's withdrawal from it in 2018, and presented Israeli intelligence on Iran's nuclear program to express concerns about Iran's credibility and nuclear ambitions. Israelis have varying views on the JCPOA, with Netanyahu and his supporters consistently against it. Israelis have differing views on the JCPOA. Netanyahu and his supporters criticize the deal for not addressing Iran's ballistic missiles and support for terrorist groups. Some Israeli officials support keeping the JCPOA for its limits on Iranian nuclear activities, while others, including Netanyahu, consider military action if Iran violates the agreement. There is a division among Israeli officials on whether to maintain the nuclear deal or focus on challenges in Syria. A \"shadow war\" has developed between Israel and Iran over Iran's presence in Syria, with Israeli leaders expressing intentions to prevent Iran from constructing bases or advanced weapons facilities in Syria. Israeli military operations in Syria have expanded in response to increasing Iran-related concerns. Iran-backed forces, including Hezbollah, have moved closer to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights since late 2017, exacerbating Israeli sensitivities. In February 2018, Iranian personnel sent an armed drone into Israeli airspace, marking a new period of direct conflict. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that Iran had transferred advanced weaponry to Syria, and Israel is prepared to block Iran's aggression. Israel has reportedly struck Iranian targets multiple times since the initial incident. Since the February 10 incident, Israel has struck Iranian targets multiple times, leading to exchanges of fire and official statements from Israel, Iran, Syria, and Russia. The possibility of limited Israeli strikes escalating into wider conflict has been highlighted, especially in cases of miscalculation. On May 10, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force fired rockets at Israeli military positions in the Golan Heights in retaliation for Israeli strikes in Syria. Israel responded with larger-scale strikes, the most significant since the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Additional airstrikes in Syria have been conducted by Israel, with its military claiming to have shot down rockets on two occasions in July. Russia's advanced air defense systems in Syria could affect Israeli operations, but to date, Russia has not taken military action against Israeli airstrikes on Iranian or Syrian targets. Speculation surrounds Russia's stance on Israel and Iran due to its military presence in Syria being protected by Iran-backed forces. Israeli officials consult with Russian counterparts to deconflict military operations in Syria and limit Iran's presence. In May 2018, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for the withdrawal of non-Syrian forces from the southern border area. Hezbollah has been leading an offensive against rebels in southern Syria, challenging Israel's security near the Lebanese border. Speculation persists about wider conflict and regional implications, with Israeli officials concerned about Hezbollah's weapons buildup and alleged use of Lebanese civilian areas as strongholds. Putin desires the situation between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights to return to pre-civil war conditions. Increased conflict between Israel and Iran over Iran's presence in Syria raises questions about the potential for Hezbollah's Lebanon-based forces to open another front against Israel. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and deputy leader Naim Qassem have made statements indicating readiness for potential surprises, but also expressing caution about opening a front against Israel from Lebanon. The conflict between Israel and Iran in Syria could potentially lead to Hezbollah launching attacks from Lebanon. Israel also faces threats from the Gaza Strip, but these have been somewhat mitigated by defense systems. Efforts by Israel and Egypt have reduced smuggling into Gaza. In 2018, protests and violence in Gaza have drawn international attention, with over 120 Palestinians killed by Israeli live fire. The UN called for an inquiry, and a resolution condemned actions by both Israel and Gaza. Tensions have escalated due to incendiary kites, sniper attacks, and funding cuts for humanitarian aid in Gaza. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has led to discussions among U.S., Israeli, and Arab leaders to improve living conditions and reduce spillover threats. There are concerns about the limited shipment of building materials into Gaza due to fears that Hamas might use them for military purposes. This has sparked a debate on how humanitarian concerns should be linked with political outcomes involving Israel, Hamas, and the PA, as well as with an anticipated U.S. diplomatic initiative. Strong bilateral relations between the U.S. and Israel have reinforced these discussions. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations, leading to significant cooperation on defense, military aid, arms sales, joint exercises, and technology sharing. U.S. military aid has helped Israel become one of the most technologically advanced militaries globally, maintaining its edge over neighboring countries. This aid also supports Israel's domestic defense industry and its position as a top arms exporter. In 1981, the United States and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance national security. Joint military exercises began in 1984, and the US stockpiled military equipment in Israel. In 1986, they signed an MOU for Israeli participation in the Strategic Defense Initiative. Israel was designated a \"major non-NATO ally\" in 1987, and in 1996, Congress codified this status. In 1961, Congress codified Israel's preferential treatment in U.S. defense contracts and access to weapons systems. Annual interagency strategic dialogues were established in 2001. The U.S.-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 and U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 promoted expanded cooperation in defense, homeland security, cyber issues, energy, and trade. Israel was designated a \"major strategic partner\" of the United States in the latter act. U.S. arms sales have been crucial for addressing Israel's security concerns since the late 1970s. U.S. arms sales are vital for addressing Israel's security concerns and those of other regional countries. Some Members of Congress worry that selling advanced weaponry to Arab nations could weaken Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME). However, administrations argue that Arab countries rely too heavily on U.S. support to use these arms against the U.S. or its allies. The threat of a nuclear-armed Iran has aligned Israeli and Sunni Arab interests in deterring a common rival, but it also raises concerns about a deteriorating QME. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are increasing defense purchases from foreign suppliers, including the U.S. In 2008, Congress enacted legislation requiring notification to Congress for any proposed U.S. arms sale to countries in the Middle East other than Israel to ensure it does not affect Israel's military edge. The definition focuses on preventing arms sales to potential Israeli adversaries based on conventional military threats, raising questions about its applicability to evolving security threats. The legislation does not clarify what constitutes an adverse effect on Israel's Qualitative Military Edge. After the 2008 legislation, a bilateral QME working group was created for Israel to address concerns about U.S. arms sales in the region. The U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 requires more frequent QME assessments and consultations, evaluating potential arms sales' impact on the regional balance and outlining measures Israel may need to take in response. Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II, receiving approximately $3 billion in grants annually since 1985. Most of the aid is in the form of Foreign Military Financing (FMF). The United States provides significant military aid to Israel through Foreign Military Financing (FMF), representing half of total FMF and 15-20% of Israel's defense budget. A new 10-year bilateral military aid MOU commits $3.3 billion annually from FY2019 to FY2028. Israel uses 74% of FMF to purchase arms from the U.S., including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. By FY2028, all FMF will go towards U.S.-origin arms. Israel has received 12 F-35s with a total of 50 expected by 2024. It was the first non-U.S. country to declare operational capability for the F-35 and has used the aircraft in combat over its northern border. Israel has domestic contractors install customized equipment and weaponry on the F-35 and is the only recipient allowed to perform depot-level aircraft maintenance within its borders. Sales of U.S. defense articles to Israel are subject to the Arms Export Control Act and a 1952 Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement. Israel has received F-35 aircraft from the United States and is the first non-U.S. country to declare operational capability for them. The U.S. has expressed concerns about Israel's use of U.S.-supplied cluster munitions during military operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, citing potential violations of agreements regarding arms sales. The Leahy Law prohibits assistance to foreign security units with human rights violations. In 2016, Senator Leahy and other Members of Congress raised concerns about possible extrajudicial killings or torture by Israeli personnel. The State Department assured them of implementing Leahy vetting. In 2017, Rep. Betty McCollum introduced a bill to end Israeli military detention of Palestinian children. Congress provides significant aid to Israel for defense systems like Iron Dome. The US and Israel conducted a special trial in 2016. In 2016, the US and Israel conducted a special trial to test missile defense system connectivity. There is interest from other countries in acquiring elements of Israeli defense systems, such as Iron Dome. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. has a cooperation agreement with Romania for Iron Dome's interception system export. Israel Aerospace Industries has sold radar systems to countries like Canada and India. The U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018 includes provisions for FMF authorization of at least $3.3 billion per year, extension of war reserves stockpile authority, access to loan guarantees, and authorization for precision guided munitions to aid in potential conflicts with Hezbollah and Hamas. It also requires a report on Israel's eligibility for strategic trade authorization exception. The U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018 includes provisions for FMF authorization of at least $3.3 billion per year, extension of war reserves stockpile authority, access to loan guarantees, and authorization for precision guided munitions. It also requires a report on Israel's eligibility for strategic trade authorization exception, cybersecurity cooperation, worldwide foreign assistance, space exploration, countering drone aircraft, and additional reporting on Israel's QME and security posture. The U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018 (found in H.Rept. 115-874) includes provisions for countering drone aircraft, extension of war reserves stockpile authority, and arms sales between the United States and Israel. Concerns have been raised about Israel's dealings with sensitive security equipment and technology, especially regarding third-party arms sales and information sharing with countries like China. The United States and Israel have a strong trade relationship, with Israel being the 24th largest trading partner of the U.S. They have a Free Trade Agreement in place since 1985, which has led to the growth of Israeli exports to the U.S. In 2017, Israel imported $12.6 billion in goods from and exported $21.9 billion in goods to the United States. The United States and Israel have launched programs to stimulate Israeli industrial and scientific research, with Congress authorizing and appropriating funds. The prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace process are complicated by various factors, including changes in U.S. policy on Jerusalem in December 2017. Israeli leaders celebrated the change in U.S. policy on Jerusalem, but PLO Chairman Abbas strongly objected. Many countries opposed President Trump's statements on Jerusalem, leading to December action at the United Nations. Palestinian leaders have sought support from other international actors to improve their negotiating position with Israel, while continuing security coordination. Tensions over Jerusalem have affected U.S. aid to the Palestinians and the prospects for restarting Israeli-Palestinian talks in 2018. The Administration is preparing a detailed document on the peace process to overcome obstacles to progress. The Administration is finalizing a peace plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seeking support from Arab states. Jared Kushner stated readiness to engage with President Abbas, warning of a public plan if no agreement is reached. Some former U.S. officials caution against presenting a plan due to Palestinian opposition. Abbas criticized the possible exclusion of core issues from negotiations as \"an American slap.\" Arab states, despite criticizing the U.S. stance on Jerusalem, are being approached for support. Arab states criticize U.S. stance on Jerusalem but are engaging more with Israel to counter Iranian influence. The 2002 Arab Peace Initiative guides their position on Israeli-Palestinian issues. Speculation surrounds a possible Trump Administration proposal favoring Israeli positions, which Palestinian officials see as undermining Abbas. In December 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and pledged to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking from the longstanding U.S. practice. Israel considers Jerusalem its capital, including the eastern part annexed after the 1967 war. President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced the move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. He stated that the city's final status would be subject to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, without explicitly mentioning Palestinian aspirations for East Jerusalem. The embassy is set to open in May 2018. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem will initially be located in the Arnona neighborhood, with consular operations continuing without interruption. Plans are in place to open a new Embassy Jerusalem annex by the end of next year, with a search underway for a permanent embassy site. The embassy officially opened on May 14. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem opened at the Arnona facility amid criticism and violence at the Gaza-Israel frontier. The site is located partly in West Jerusalem and cost $400,000 to modify. Plans include transitioning the ambassador's residence to Jerusalem and expanding the embassy at the Arnona site. Congress could consider various options for funding, timeframe, logistics, progress reports, and security. The State Department official estimated that building a new embassy in Jerusalem may cost about $500 million and take 7 to 10 years to construct. Israel has numerous official residential communities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, all located beyond the 1949-1967 armistice line. The first West Bank settlements were constructed following the 1967 war, justified as residential areas for Israel's military personnel. Major settlement building began in the late 1970s with the Gush Emunim movement. Israelis have expanded existing settlements using legal, historical, strategic, nationalistic, or religious justifications. The international community considers Israeli construction beyond the Green Line illegal. In 2015, an Israeli anti-settlement advocacy group highlighted a two-tier planning system in Area C of the West Bank, with a civil system for Jewish settlers and a military system for Palestinians. Israel has completed a separation barrier that deviates from the Green Line, aiming to prevent terrorists from entering Israel. Palestinians oppose the barrier as it separates them from East Jerusalem and is viewed as a way for Israel to unilaterally set borders for a future Palestinian state. Israeli settlers living within the barrier's perimeter, including East Jerusalem, influence political and diplomatic decisions in Israel. They constitute about 6% of the population and play a symbolic role in the country's history. Some settlers resist government regulations, potentially perpetuating Israeli military control in the West Bank. Israeli settlers in the West Bank pose challenges for Israeli military control, with some settlers defying authorities. The government complies with court orders to dismantle outposts, sometimes relocating residents within legal settlement boundaries. US policy on settlements has varied since the 1980s, with different administrations expressing differing views on their legality. The US has refrained from commenting on the legality of Israeli settlements, considering them an obstacle to peace. Loan guarantees to Israel may be reduced by the amount spent on settlements. Israeli prime ministers have continued settlement building despite US concerns. President George W. Bush acknowledged existing Israeli populations in the West Bank in a letter to Ariel Sharon. The Obama Administration opposed Israeli settlement activity but had varying approaches. In the first term, it sought a freeze on all settlement activity, including in East Jerusalem. Israel responded with a partial moratorium. In the second term, President Obama signed legislation opposing punitive economic measures against Israel. The Obama Administration opposed Israeli settlement activity, with varying approaches. In December 2016, the administration abstained from a U.N. Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements. The Trump Administration has been less critical of Israeli settlement-related announcements and construction. The Trump Administration has been less critical of Israeli settlement activity, with reports suggesting coordination on construction plans. However, in February 2018, U.S. officials denied discussing annexation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Selected U.S.-based interest groups interested in Israel are listed for further information. Selected U.S.-based interest groups focused on Israel include the American Jewish Committee, Americans for Peace Now, Anti-Defamation League, and others. The S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace and the Zionist Organization of America are U.S.-based interest groups focused on Israel."
