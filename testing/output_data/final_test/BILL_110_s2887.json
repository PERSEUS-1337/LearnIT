    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Firefighter Fatality Reduction Act of 2008\". Congress finds that each year in the United States, over 100 firefighters die in the line of duty, with tens of thousands more injured. The Federal Government has a vested interest in protecting firefighter health and safety to effectively respond to disasters. Adequate training, protective equipment, staffing levels, operating procedures, and firefighter fitness can reduce avoidable fatalities. The fire services, along with government agencies and private-sector partners, have collaborated to develop national safety standards. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health collaborates with standards-making bodies to develop national consensus standards for safe fire department operations and firefighting capabilities. These standards are crucial for ensuring firefighter health and safety, as failure to follow them has been identified as a contributing factor in many firefighter deaths. A comprehensive assessment of fire department compliance with these standards would aid policymakers in enhancing public safety and reducing avoidable firefighter fatalities. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nIn this Act, the terms \"fire department,\" \"fire service,\" \"national consensus standards,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"Task Force\" are defined. The Department of Homeland Security is required to conduct a survey of all fire departments in the United States to determine compliance with national consensus standards. A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Additionally, a task force will be established to enhance firefighter safety. The Secretary will establish a Task Force to Enhance Firefighter Safety, with members appointed from national organizations, standards-setting bodies, and other relevant individuals. The Task Force, appointed by the Secretary, will develop a plan to increase fire department compliance with national consensus standards to enhance firefighter safety. Members' terms of service may not exceed 2 years. Other government agencies may also participate in Task Force activities. The Task Force, appointed by the Secretary, will develop a plan to increase fire department compliance with national consensus standards to enhance firefighter safety. The Task Force will submit a report to Congress and the Secretary within 1 year of establishment, containing findings, recommendations, and a plan."
