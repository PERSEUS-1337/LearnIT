These requirements are debated for their impact on farm sizes and distribution of payments. Congressional interest is high due to regional and commodity differences, as well as the significant amount of annual farm program payments at stake. Annual U.S. farm program payments, averaging $18.5 billion per year, are discussed in this report regarding eligibility factors under the 2018 farm bill. It covers restrictions on payments based on various factors like legal entities, participant identification, citizenship, \"actively engaged in farming\" status, adjusted gross income limits, and conservation compliance. The report discusses farm program payment limits, including AGI limits and conservation compliance. It also addresses direct attribution of payments to individuals and annual payment limits for different farm program categories. The Appendix provides a history of payment limits for major commodity programs. Eligibility requirements vary by program and legal entity type. Farm program payment limits have evolved over time and are under the jurisdiction of the USDA's Farm Service Agency. Congressional debates have focused on attributing payments directly to individuals, capping payment amounts, and excluding high-income farming entities from eligibility. The USDA's Farm Service Agency oversees farm program payment limits, which have evolved over time. Congressional debates have centered on attributing payments to individuals, capping payment amounts, and excluding high-income farming entities from eligibility. These policy measures can impact farm management structure, crop choices, and farm size in U.S. agriculture. Eligibility for federal farm programs is subject to various statutory and regulatory requirements, with some farm businesses restricted from certain benefits or limited in program payments they can receive. Program eligibility rules have evolved over time, expanding to more programs and including limitations. Cross-cutting methods like AGI thresholds are relatively new. Eligibility requirements affecting multiple programs include participant identification, foreign ownership, AEF criteria, means tests, and conservation requirements. Identification of participants is crucial for farm program eligibility, requiring names, addresses, and either a social security number or Taxpayer ID for U.S. citizens and noncitizens. Participants in USDA programs must provide their social security number (SSN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) for individuals, or Employee Identification Number (EIN) for legal entities. Each person with an ownership interest must declare their share using USDA forms CCC-901 and CCC-902. These forms need to be submitted only once. Critical changes to a farming operation, such as adding new family members or altering land rental status, must be reported using USDA forms CCC-901 and CCC-902. This information is crucial for determining active engagement in the farming operation. Different farm business entities are categorized for program eligibility. Three major categories are considered for potential farm program participants: sole proprietorship or family farm, joint operation, and corporation. Family farms or sole proprietorships comprised nearly 87% of U.S. farm operations in 2012. Joint operations treat each member separately for eligibility and payment limits, while corporations have their own criteria. In addition to family farms and corporations, federal regulations also cover eligibility and payment limits for other types of recipients such as spouses, minor children, marketing cooperatives, trusts, estates, and various institutional arrangements. These arrangements represent a small share of U.S. farm operations according to the USDA's 2012 Census of Agriculture. The USDA's 2012 Census of Agriculture shows that various institutional arrangements represent a small share of U.S. farm operations. To be eligible for certain Title I commodity program benefits under the 2018 farm bill, participants must meet actively engaged in farming (AEF) requirements, which apply to individuals, partnerships, and corporations. An individual producer must make a significant contribution to the farming operation and share profits or losses. Family farms receive special treatment under the 2018 farm bill, where every adult member is considered to meet the actively engaged in farming (AEF) requirements. Family membership includes lineal ascendants, descendants, siblings, and spouses. The definition of family member has been expanded to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews. Additionally, if one spouse is actively engaged in farming, the other spouse is also considered to have met the requirement. The spousal exception applies to individual producers and those in partnerships, as well as landowners who receive income from the farm without providing labor or management. In a general partnership, each member must contribute active labor or management to meet AEF criteria. Failure to meet the criteria results in ineligibility for farm programs. Corporations are treated as a single entity for AEF criteria. For AEF criteria, joint owners in a corporation are considered a single entity. Each owner must contribute significant personal labor or management to the operation, separate from others. Failure to meet these requirements results in reduced program benefits. Recent farm bills have amended the AEF criteria to tighten requirements for receiving farm program payments, aiming to address the issue of passive investors claiming benefits without actively contributing to the farming operation. This change follows the broad definition of active personal labor or management that allowed individuals living far from the operation to qualify without actively participating. The 2014 farm bill tightened requirements for nonfamily producers to qualify for farm program benefits. The 2018 farm bill continues these regulations, limiting the number of nonfamily farm managers based on farm size. Additional recordkeeping is required for nonfamily members claiming active management status. Foreign persons or legal entities can participate in farm programs if they meet eligibility requirements, except for four permanent disaster assistance programs. Foreign persons or entities can participate in most farm program benefits if they have a U.S. taxpayer ID and meet certain criteria, except for four disaster assistance programs that explicitly prohibit payments to foreign entities. As of December 31, 2016, foreign individuals held an interest in 28.3 million acres of U.S. agricultural land, accounting for 2.2% of privately held agricultural land in the U.S. Foreign corporations can still be eligible for benefits if they have U.S. resident shareholders or partners. Foreign entities with U.S. residency status can request payments based on ownership interest by U.S. citizens or residents meeting criteria. No specific restrictions exist for foreign persons or entities regarding crop and livestock insurance subsidies. The Dairy Margin Coverage program, sugar processor eligibility, and participation in the U.S. sugar program do not have citizenship requirements, but sugarcane and sugar beets must be of U.S. origin. Means testing in U.S. farm programs is based on income levels, with the 2002 farm bill establishing the first means test. Income is measured by average AGI over the previous three years, excluding the most recent taxable year. Recent farm bills have maintained this measure of income. The debate now focuses on which programs should be subject to means testing and what income threshold is appropriate, considering that most U.S. farms are taxed under individual income tax. Farm households are taxed under individual income tax, with AGI measuring net income after expenses. Farm income is reported on IRS Schedule F, while a comparable measure to AGI is used for incorporated businesses. Farm and nonfarm income are combined for federal income tax purposes, with most tax paid attributed to nonfarm income. Farm operations often report operating losses for tax purposes, with a significant portion of capital expensing. Farm sole proprietors reported a net farm loss for tax purposes, with a substantial portion of capital investment expensed in the first year. Program participants must annually consent to IRS verification of compliance with AGI limit provisions using form CCC-941. Failure to provide consent results in ineligibility for program payments and refund requirements. The 2002 farm bill set an initial AGI threshold of $2.5 million, with an exemption if 75% of AGI was from farming. The 2008 farm bill replaced the single AGI limit with three separate limits for farm and nonfarm AGI. The 2002 farm bill established three separate AGI limits for farm and nonfarm income eligibility. Nonfarm AGI limit of $500,000 applied to certain farm commodity program benefits, while a farm-specific AGI limit of $750,000 applied to direct payments. A third nonfarm AGI limit of $1 million, with an exclusion for farm-related income, applied to conservation program benefits. The 2008 farm bill allowed married individuals to allocate joint AGI as if filing separately. The 2014 farm bill raised the total AGI limit to $900,000 for individuals and businesses, with a provision for married couples to allocate AGI separately. The 2018 farm bill maintained these AGI provisions and added a case-by-case approach from the 2008 farm bill. The 2014 farm bill retained AGI provisions and added a case-by-case waiver for conservation programs. Conservation compliance, including Sodbuster and Swampbuster, requires maintaining conservation on erodible land and protecting wetlands. Non-compliance may result in loss of USDA program benefits. The 2014 farm bill extended conservation compliance to federal crop insurance premium subsidies. The 2018 farm bill retains conservation compliance for federal crop insurance premium subsidies with minor amendments. Conservation compliance is a key environmentally based requirement in U.S. farm policy, involving direct attribution of payments to individuals in various legal entities. Legal entities receiving farm program payments can be composed of individuals, partnerships, and corporate entities. Farm payments flow through legal entities defined by Congress as entities owning or producing agricultural commodities. Multiperson legal entities like family farm operations and corporations are included. Ownership shares are tracked by social security numbers or EINs. Direct attribution of farm program payments to individuals associated with farming operations is crucial for monitoring payment limits. Payments made to individuals associated with farming operations are combined with payments from other operations based on their ownership levels in legal entities. This accumulation of payments is subject to annual limits. If the limit is reached at the personal farming operation level, payments to lower-level entities are reduced accordingly. Eligibility criteria must be met for payments to be received. When eligibility criteria are met, cumulative benefits from farm programs are subject to annual payment limits for individuals or legal entities. Payment limits vary among programs and legal entity types, with some limits being expanded based on participants or exceptions. The focus is often on annual payment limits for Title I commodity programs. Title I commodity programs, including ARC and PLC, have payment limits that have evolved since 1970. Payments for covered commodities are combined and subject to a $125,000 annual limit for individuals, except for peanuts which have their own limit. Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) is also subject to payment limits. Title I commodity programs have payment limits of $125,000 per individual. Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) and Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) have payment limits of $125,000 and $300,000 per crop year per individual or entity, respectively. The Secretary of Agriculture can make ad hoc payments to support U.S. agriculture under the CCC charter. The Cotton Ginning Cost Share (CGCS) Program and Market Facilitation Program (MFP) have annual payment limits. The CGCS program has a limit of $40,000 per person, while the MFP program has a per-person limit of $125,000 for different commodity categories. The farm program benefits have annual limits for qualifying recipients. Family farms receive special treatment, with every adult member potentially eligible for payments. The 2018 farm bill extended the definition of family member to include first cousins, nieces, and nephews. The ownership of joint operations can include exemptions or exceptions, with new members potentially increasing payment limits. Partnerships and joint ventures must meet criteria and AGI limits. A corporation is treated as a single entity for eligibility and payment limits. Conservation program limits predate farm support program limits. Several major conservation programs in Title II of the 2018 farm bill are subject to annual payment limits. For example, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has limits on annual rental payments and cost-share payments. Payments for CRP contracts are capped at 85% to 90% of the average county rental rate, with a total limit of $50,000 per year. Additionally, incentive payments may be waived or applied differently under certain subprograms of CRP. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) have payment limits for contracts entered into between FY2019 and FY2023. EQIP payments are capped at $450,000, with a waiver possible for new Conservation Incentive Contracts. Payments for organic production practices are limited to $140,000. CSP contracts are limited to $200,000, except for the CSP Grassland Conservation Initiative with annual payments capped at $18 per acre. Certain farm programs are not subject to annual payment limits, including benefits from the marketing assistance loan program, the sugar program, the dairy program, and certain disaster assistance programs. Crop insurance premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and Emergency Watershed Protection Program payments are also exempt from payment limits. The Watershed Protection Program (EWP) and Title I (Subtitle B) MAL program benefits are not subject to payment limits. MAL benefits include loan deficiency payments (LDP), marketing loan gains (MLG), and gains from forfeiture or commodity certificate exchanges. The 2018 farm bill excluded all MAL benefits from payment limits. The U.S. sugar program provides indirect price support to sugar beet and sugarcane producers without federal budget outlays. The U.S. sugar program provides indirect price support to sugar beet and sugarcane producers through marketing assistance loans at fixed prices, with no budgetary cost to the government. The program limits sugar supply for food use to support market prices. The dairy program, known as the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, offers margin-based support to dairy producers without payment limits. The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, formerly known as the MPP, provides support to participants through premium subsidies and indemnity-like payments. Premiums are set in statute with no limit on participation levels, and payments are not subject to limits. Additionally, disaster assistance programs ELAP, LIP, and TAP, as well as certain conservation programs, have no payment limits under the 2018 farm bill. Certain conservation programs have payments limited to the value of the specific conservation measure. The 2018 farm bill allows unlimited payments under the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. Crop insurance premium subsidies and indemnity payments have no limits on participation or value. Crop insurance indemnities are payments made to cover insurable losses and are not subject to any payment limit. To be eligible for catastrophic risk protection coverage, the producer must meet USDA's definition of a \"person.\" For other insurance plans, the producer must be at least 18 years old and have a bona fide insurable interest in a crop. Payments can exceed limits if ownership was transferred due to death, the new owner is the successor, and all eligibility requirements are met. The new owner must meet eligibility requirements and cannot exceed the previous owner's payment amount under the program contracts. The provision applies for one program year for ARC and PLC, reflecting the commitment of resources by both farming operations. The debate over farm program payment limits revolves around the balance between government support and market conditions. Tighter payment limits would lead to more reliance on market signals for resource allocation. This issue is of interest to Congress as they consider equity and efficiency in farm programs. Supporters of payment limits argue that tighter limits are necessary to prevent large payments from consolidating farms, raising land prices, and disadvantaging smaller family farms. They believe that tighter limits could indirectly benefit small and beginning farmers by reducing incentives to expand, thus lowering land prices. Additionally, they argue that large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly, as seen in critical newspaper stories about how payments are distributed. Payment limits are a contentious issue in agriculture, with advocates arguing for tighter restrictions to prevent consolidation of farms and support smaller family farms. Critics believe that all farms need support, especially during market downturns, and that larger farms should not be penalized for their efficiencies. The majority of farm payments go to a small percentage of large operators, raising concerns about fairness and distribution. Farms with market revenue over $250,000 make up 12% of farm households but generate 89% of total U.S. agricultural production and receive 60% of federal farm program payments. Setting a limit on government support payments raises questions about who benefits, impacting land values and access to capital for small farmers. Critics argue for more equity in farm program payments, while supporters defend the current system favoring larger operations. Supporters of the current system argue that larger farms are more efficient and changing in favor of smaller operators may reduce U.S. competitiveness. Tighter payment limits will impact crops with higher production value, such as rice, peanuts, and cotton, mainly in the Southeast and western states. Payment limits may also affect local economic activity, especially in regions with agricultural production. Payment limits may have a greater economic impact in rural, agriculture-based counties where agricultural production is significant. Peanuts have a separate program payment limit, giving them an advantage over other program crops. Farmers growing multiple crops, including peanuts, have two different payment limits: $125,000 for non-peanut crops and $125,000 for peanuts. The 2018 farm bill raised MAL rates for various program crops, potentially doubling payment limits for peanut farmers to $250,000. Higher MAL rates increase USDA outlays and affect PLC program payments. Peanuts have a separate payment limit of $125,000, giving them an advantage over other crops. The absence of a limit on benefits received under the MAL program creates potential challenges under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism due to surplus production and market price depression. Changes in eligibility requirements or payment limits can lead producers to adjust their behavior to optimize net revenue. Changes in eligibility requirements or payment limits can lead producers to adjust their farm operations to optimize net revenue. This may involve reorganizing the operation to increase eligibility, changing crop choices to take advantage of payment limits, or altering land use by renting out or selling land to others. Payment limits per unit or base acre offer an alternative to per-person limits and may help mitigate some challenges. Per-unit payment limits, such as the 85% payment reduction factor for base acres under PLC or ARC programs, are seen as a cost-saving measure rather than for fairness. The 2018 farm bill maintained the $900,000 AGI limit for all farm income, differing from the 2008 bill which had separate limits for farm and nonfarm earned income. The 2018 farm bill maintained the $900,000 AGI limit for all farm income, consolidating separate AGI caps from the 2008 bill. USDA analysis showed that fewer farms are affected by the single AGI cap, potentially restoring eligibility for farm program payments to some operations. Major exemptions from the AGI limit include state and local governments, Indian tribes, and waivers under RCPP. The 2018 farm bill maintained the $900,000 AGI limit for all farm income, consolidating separate AGI caps from the 2008 bill. The focus shifted towards crop insurance programs, which are not subject to the AGI cap. Concerns were raised about extending the AGI cap to crop insurance subsidies, as it could affect participation and program soundness. USDA estimated that less than 0.5% of farms and less than 1% of premiums would be affected by the income cap if extended to crop insurance subsidies."
