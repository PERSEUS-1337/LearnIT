    "content": "The debate between Congress and the Trump Administration on enhancing and expanding barriers on the southwest border has brought attention to the lack of comprehensive data on federal investment in border barriers. The evolving structure of appropriations for border protection agencies has made it challenging to track funding for barriers, with appropriations prior to FY2017 often not specifying funding levels for barriers. The Trump Administration's push for a \"border wall system\" has sparked congressional interest in understanding the historical context of border security funding. The historical context of U.S. border enforcement and funding for border barriers is briefly outlined, starting with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and the establishment of the U.S. Border Patrol in 1924. The focus is on the evolving appropriations structures and the mission of securing U.S. borders. The Immigration Act of 1924 established immigration quotas, excluding Western Hemisphere countries like Mexico. The Bracero Program brought in 5 million Mexican workers between 1942 and 1964 to fill labor gaps. Debates on immigration law enforcement intensified in the late 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1970s and 1980s, efforts to enhance immigration law enforcement were linked to counter-drug smuggling and controlling unauthorized migrant flows. Construction of barriers on the southern border began in the early 1990s, with a ten-foot-high corrugated steel barrier built between San Diego and Tijuana in 1991. The Border Patrol released a strategic plan in 1994 to enforce immigration laws along the U.S. border. The Department of Defense Center for Low Intensity Conflict experts described a strategy of \"prevention through deterrence\" to improve border control. They plan to concentrate resources in major entry corridors, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, utilize technology effectively, and aim to maximize the apprehension rate to deter illegal entry. The goal is to make the risk of apprehension high enough to discourage attempts to cross the border. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 directed the installation of physical barriers along the US border to deter illegal crossings. After the 9/11 attacks, border security responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. In 2003, the Department of Justice transferred border security responsibilities to DHS and CBP. Congress authorized and funded new construction of border barriers during the 109th and 110th Congresses. Legislation in 2005-2007 eased the construction of additional barriers, including the Secure Fence Act of 2006. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandated the construction of border barriers on the US-Mexico border by the end of 2008 to achieve \"operational control\" over the border. It focused on barriers, tactical infrastructure, and surveillance, rather than addressing broader immigration policies for improved border security. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act allocated $35 million for CBP's San Diego sector fencing, part of increased construction spending for border barriers. Congress later amended IIRIRA to require reinforced fencing along 700 miles of the US-Mexico border. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act allocated $35 million for CBP's San Diego sector fencing. Congress later amended IIRIRA to require reinforced fencing along 700 miles of the US-Mexico border, with flexibility in implementation. Border barrier funding in CBP's budget was included in the \"Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology\" appropriation from FY2007 to FY2016. Congress allocated $1,512,565,000 for border security technology and tactical infrastructure funding in FY2007, with $950 million withheld until a spending plan for a border barrier was provided. Starting in FY2008, a specific PPA for the development and deployment of technology and infrastructure was included in the appropriations. The BSFIT Development and Deployment structure for border security technology and infrastructure funding remained unchanged until FY2017 when funding was redistributed to Operations and Support and Procurement, Construction, and Improvements appropriations. Border barrier design and construction funding is now included in the Border Security Assets and Infrastructure PPA. Figure 1 shows requested and enacted levels for the Development and Deployment PPA from FY2008 to FY2016, excluding the FY2007 appropriation for border infrastructure. The Development and Deployment PPA was implemented for border security technology and infrastructure funding until FY2017 when funding was redistributed. Funding for border barrier construction was not always clearly detailed, but CRS obtained granular information from CBP. The primary program funding barrier construction was the Tactical Infrastructure (TI) Program, with funding provided from FY2007 to FY2009 resulting in increased construction. Funding data for border barriers under the TI program is presented in Figure 2 and Table 1. The Trump Administration issued Executive Order 13767 on January 25, 2017, focusing on border security and immigration enforcement improvements. Historical data on barrier construction prior to FY2017 is limited, as construction was not centrally tracked by CBP. The best available understanding of appropriations and spending on border barriers in the 2007-2016 period is presented. The Executive Order 13767 issued by the Trump Administration focuses on border security and immigration enforcement improvements, including the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border. Changes in funding structure for FY2017 complicate comparisons with previous years, as DHS components were brought together in 2003 over ongoing budget cycles. The funding structure for CBP evolved over the years, with the introduction of the BSFIT account in FY2007. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format. By FY2017, DHS implemented the CAS, eliminating the BSFIT structure and reallocating funding to CBP Operations and Support (OS) and Procurement. The Wall Program was established at CBP during FY2017 under the CBP PC&I appropriation. It oversees the execution of the FY2017 TI program funding and future wall construction. CBP first directed appropriations to the Wall Program in FY2018. The TI Program manages funding for maintenance of new and replacement border barriers since FY2007. The Trump Administration requested additional funding for CBP staffing and border wall construction in FY2017. The DHS Appropriations bill included $341.2 million to replace existing barriers and add gates along the southwest border. The Trump Administration requested $1.72 billion for border security assets and infrastructure, including $1.57 million for construction of border barriers. Congress provided $1.74 billion in FY2018 for over 90 miles of physical barrier construction along the southern border. Specific allocations included $445 million for 25 miles of primary pedestrian levee fencing in Rio Grande Valley sector, $196 million for primary pedestrian fencing in RGV sector, $251 million for secondary replacement fencing in San Diego sector, $445 million for replacement of existing primary pedestrian fencing, and $38 million for border barrier planning and design. The Trump Administration initially requested $1.647 billion for border security assets and infrastructure, including $1.6 billion for the border wall. Later, they requested $7 billion in additional border-related funding during a lapse in annual appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requested $7 billion in additional border funding, including $4.1 billion for the wall. This funding would cover approximately 234 miles of new physical barrier and fulfill the top 10 priorities in CBP's Border Security Improvement Plan. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, allocated $1.375 billion for primary pedestrian fencing in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. The President declared a national emergency on the southern border the same day he signed the appropriations act into law. The President declared a national emergency on the southern border of the United States to make additional funding available for border barriers through three methods. The Treasury Forfeiture Fund provided $601 million to DHS for law enforcement border security efforts, with $261 million for real estate planning and acquisition and $340 million for border barrier projects in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. The Department of Defense reprogrammed $2.5 billion for border barriers, with $1 billion transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for DHS-requested work. An additional $1.5 billion was announced for various initiatives, including border barrier construction. The DOD reprogrammed $2.5 billion for border barriers, with $1 billion going to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. An additional $1.5 billion was allocated for various initiatives, including border barrier construction. The Supreme Court allowed the use of reprogrammed funds for border projects, while $3.6 billion was reallocated from military construction projects for the southern border emergency. The memorandum allocates $1.8 billion in military construction funding for overseas projects immediately, with an additional $1.8 billion for domestic projects when needed. The Administration requested $5 billion for border barrier funding in FY2020 to build 206 miles of wall. The House Appropriations Committee did not include funding for border barriers in its FY2020 DHS appropriations bill and proposed rescinding $601 million from FY2019 funding. In contrast, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $5 billion for border barrier construction in S. 2582. The FY2020 DHS Appropriations Act included $1.375 billion for border barrier construction along the southwest border. The design restrictions for the barrier system remain similar to prior years, with a new exception for designs that help mitigate community or environmental impacts. Barriers are required to be built in the highest priority locations identified in CBP's Border Security Improvement Plan. The total funding available for planning and construction of barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border is compared in the first and second eras of DHS efforts. In the legislative era (FY2007-FY2016), detailed information on border barrier funding was provided directly to CRS by CBP. In the executive era (FY2017 to present), data from CBP and appropriations measures are generally consistent, but the Administration uses the \"border wall\" program to track most funding. Some funding for barrier replacement and supporting infrastructure was provided through the tactical infrastructure PPA in FY2018. E.O. 13767 focuses on the construction of a physical wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The focus is on constructing a physical wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to gain control. Congress provided $4.47 billion to CBP for border barrier planning and construction during the Trump Administration, exceeding previous funding by $2 billion. $1.04 billion was for barrier replacement, $2.02 billion for Rio Grande Valley Sector construction, and $1.41 billion for planning and construction. The Administration has taken unprecedented steps to double the funding level for CBP by Congress for barrier construction since E.O. 13767. $601 million was provided to DHS in FY2019 from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, with $124 million used for construction and $477 million for real estate planning, acquisition, and project costs. The U.S. Border Patrol relies on a strategy for barrier construction with no known cost estimates. GAO reports show barriers' contributions are not adequately measured, and cost estimates do not consider key factors. The Administration aims to expand border barriers on the southwest border, impacting budget debates. The U.S. Border Patrol lacks cost estimates for barrier construction, with GAO reports highlighting inadequate measurement of barriers' contributions. The Administration's plan to expand southwest border barriers will impact budget debates. Congress needs information on operation and maintenance costs, land acquisition, construction costs, and oversight of funds used for border barrier projects. The United States' southern border with Mexico, spanning nearly 2,000 miles over diverse terrain and ownership types, is primarily secured by DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Questions arise regarding the effectiveness of improvements in deterring illegal entry and contraband smuggling, the operational benefits versus costs, and Congress's response to funding reprogramming for border barrier work. The CBP is responsible for border security, including constructing and maintaining tactical infrastructure, monitoring surveillance technology, and deploying border patrol agents to prevent unlawful entries of people and contraband into the US. Approximately 653 miles of barriers exist on the southern border, with different designs like pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers. Materials used for pedestrian fencing include bollard, steel mesh, and chain link. The Trump Administration announced the completion of the first 100 miles of the new border wall system, replacing existing barriers with 18- to 30-foot bollard style fencing. No additional miles of primary fencing have been completed since 2015, but legacy fencing has been replaced or repaired. An interactive online project by inewsource and KPBS used FOIA data to track existing border fencing construction from 1960-2018. Fencing in San Diego was completed by 1993, covering the first 14 miles east from the Pacific Ocean. The Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion over border barrier provisions. Approximately 40 additional miles of primary fence were constructed on the southern border through 2005, with the majority of existing primary barriers built between 2007 and 2009. The Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion over border barrier provisions."
