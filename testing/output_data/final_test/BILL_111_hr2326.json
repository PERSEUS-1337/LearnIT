    "content": "The \"Oil Savings Act of 2009\" aims to address the United States' heavy reliance on foreign oil, which poses a significant threat to national security and the economy. Congress recognizes the need for transformative measures to reduce this dependence and establish an interagency working group to address the issue. Establishing an interagency working group called the \"Working Group\" consisting of key officials from various federal entities is mandated within 30 days of the Act's enactment. This group will be led by a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission and will include the Secretary of Energy and the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Additionally, an action plan will be developed as part of this initiative. The Working Group must publish an action plan within 270 days of the Act's enactment, outlining oil savings targets for each year until 2030. The plan aims to save 2.5 million barrels per day by 2015, 7 million by 2025, and 10 million by 2030. The Working Group must develop a supply disruption strategy and a peak oil strategy for Federal departments and agencies to mitigate potential negative consequences of a 4 percent annualized decline in world oil production from the prior year's baseline. Proposed regulations must be issued by Federal entities within 270 days of the enactment of the Act to meet requirements of the action plan. Final regulations must be promulgated within 18 months. Each regulation must be accompanied by an analysis. Each proposed and final regulation must be accompanied by an analysis from the applicable Federal entity to demonstrate that the regulation will achieve the required oil savings outlined in the action plan. The Working Group must provide a report every 3 years to evaluate the progress of implementing oil savings requirements. Additionally, a revised action plan is required. If intermediate oil savings targets are not met, the Working Group may publish a revised action plan within 60 days. Federal entities must propose regulations within 60 days of the report and issue final regulations within 6 months. If a notice of intent to propose regulations is issued, the regulations must be proposed within 120 days. Final Regulations: Within 6 months of the report, Federal entities must issue final regulations to meet oil savings targets. Regulations must be accompanied by an analysis demonstrating their effectiveness. SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF A BASELINE. The Working Group established under section 3 of the Act will determine the baseline level of United States oil consumption with the assistance of the Energy Information Administration and data from federal entities. The Working Group will provide any necessary data, information, and access to employees for determining the baseline under this section."
