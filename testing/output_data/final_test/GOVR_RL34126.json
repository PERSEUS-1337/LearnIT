    "content": "Since 1973, omnibus farm bills have included a rural development title, with the most recent being Title VI of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-246). The debate about the future of rural America revolves around positioning rural areas to compete in a global economic environment. As agriculture's dominance in rural economies has waned, policymakers and rural development practitioners are seeking new sources of economic development for small communities and rural residents. The evolving challenges and reform of federal rural policies are influenced by concerns about economic competitiveness, a shift towards manufacturing and services, and new political interests. This changing rural landscape raises questions about Congress's role in shaping rural policy, especially in the context of global and regional restructuring affecting agriculture and manufacturing. The rural landscape is undergoing significant changes with a shift towards manufacturing and services, impacting farm household income and job sectors. Rural development initiatives in farm bills focus on infrastructure, agricultural development, and supporting rural businesses, including innovative and alternative business development programs. Legislative support for innovative business development programs and financing mechanisms is increasing as policymakers recognize the changing structure of agriculture and rural communities. This includes technologies to assist farmers with planting decisions and investments in industries to add value to agricultural products, aiming to boost local economies in rural areas. Research is increasingly focused on improvements in agricultural waste management and environmental protections, promoting traditional strategies like value-added agriculture. While commodity policy dominates the debate, production agriculture remains a small part of the rural economy, with less than 8% of the rural population employed in agriculture. Farmers in many rural areas depend more on a healthy rural economy than the economy depends on farmers. The need to strengthen rural areas to compete in a global economy is increasingly recognized. Policy debates focus on the impact of current farm policies on economically viable rural communities. Rural manufacturing is restructuring due to foreign competition, while service employment in rural areas tends to be in lower-wage personal services. Continuing population and economic decline in rural areas is driving policymakers to create new sources of competitive advantage and innovative ways of providing public services. Economic development efforts are focusing on entrepreneurial strategies and microenterprise development to capitalize on local strengths and build a regional entrepreneurial culture. Developing \"business incubators\" and linking public and private sources are common strategies in these efforts. The trends in rural development include conservation, employment opportunities, population retention, agricultural integration, entrepreneurial capacity building, infrastructure renewal, public service innovations, suburbanization conflicts, and addressing human capital deficiencies. The rural development title of the 2008 farm bill addresses conflicts between agriculture and suburban development, human capital deficiencies in rural areas, and regional-based efforts for economic development. It aims to improve the competitive position of rural areas and target federal programs to critical needs. The Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 designated USDA as the lead federal agency for rural development, administering numerous programs targeting rural economic development. Approximately 50% of program funds go directly to rural counties through agencies like the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. The USDA Rural Development administers programs through agencies like the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. Most programs are funded through annual appropriations, with some authorized by farm bills for mandatory spending. The 2008 farm bill authorized new programs with mandatory spending, but funding was blocked by appropriators between 2002 and 2007. Some programs were instead funded through discretionary appropriations. The rural development provisions in P.L. 110-246 include three programs with mandatory funding. The 2008 farm bill authorized new programs with mandatory spending, but funding was blocked by appropriators between 2002 and 2007. Some programs were instead funded through discretionary appropriations. The rural development provisions in P.L. 110-246 include grants, the Microenterprise Assistance Program, and funding for water and waste water projects. Concerns about the effectiveness of USDA's rural development assistance have been raised, particularly regarding how funding is targeted to rural communities. Section 6018 directs the Secretary to assess different definitions of \"rural\" used by USDA and their impact on rural development programs. The provision in the 2008 farm bill directs the Secretary to make recommendations for better targeting rural development funds and establishes a new definition of \"areas rural in character.\" It also includes provisions for loans and loan guarantees for locally produced agricultural food products and prioritizes projects benefitting underserved communities. The Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program provides financial aid to economically disadvantaged microentrepreneurs in rural areas. Grants are given to support entrepreneurial activities, with mandatory funding of $4 million annually for FY2009-FY2011. The Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act authorizes $10 million. The Housing Assistance Council Authorization Act authorizes $10 million annually for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist community-based housing development organizations in rural areas.

The program also includes the creation of a National Rural Investment Board, Rural Philanthropic Institute, and National Institute on Regional Rural Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship. The rural development title includes provisions for various loan and grant programs in key areas such as broadband, utilities, business, and regional development. Section 6110 reauthorizes the Access to Broadband Telecommunications Services in Rural Areas program, making changes to improve its effectiveness.
