    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Waste Terrorist Threat Assessment and Protection Act\". The Congress acknowledges the devastating impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks, resulting in over 3,000 deaths and $1 billion in economic costs in New York City alone. The attacks caused significant economic disruption, with stock markets experiencing sharp declines. This event marked a significant escalation in terrorists' ability to cause widespread damage. The threat of terrorists causing massive damage, including loss of life and economic disruption, is a serious concern. Terrorists are willing to use any means to achieve their goal of destruction. They have shown a willingness to target innocent civilians and continue to improve their destructive capabilities. The threat alert has consistently been at an elevated level since 2002. The United States must take action to counter this ongoing threat. The Yucca Mountain Project proposes to ship 77,000 tons of high-level radioactive nuclear waste, a toxic substance, which could be a target for terrorists, posing a threat of massive economic and civilian casualties in the United States. The Yucca Mountain Project plans to store a large amount of radioactive waste, making it a potential target for terrorism. The waste would be transported through numerous states and cities, increasing the risk of accidents and potential release of radioactive particles. The Yucca Mountain Project's vulnerability to terrorist attacks has not been adequately addressed by the United States Government. This could lead to potential threats as high-level radioactive nuclear waste is transported and stored, posing risks of theft or attacks along the way. The Yucca Mountain Project's vulnerability to terrorism and sabotage, as highlighted by the State of Nevada and independent researchers, has not been addressed adequately by the Department of Energy. The risks associated with sabotage and terrorism against radioactive shipments, waste storage facilities, and Yucca Mountain itself are underestimated. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, responsible for protecting public health and safety from nuclear waste, has also not addressed these concerns. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not updated its rules on nuclear waste transportation since the 1970s, leaving the environment vulnerable to modern-day threats and terrorism. SEC. 3. YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT VULNERABILITY AND DEFENSE PLAN. The Secretary of Homeland Security will lead the development of an interagency plan to defend against terrorism targeting the Yucca Mountain Project. The plan will analyze safety and vulnerability, address attacks on shipments of nuclear waste, facilities, personnel, and infrastructure. The plan led by the Secretary of Homeland Security will focus on defending the Yucca Mountain Project against terrorism. It will cover all facilities, transportation of nuclear waste, water and power systems, and nuclear waste containers. Special attention will be given to the use of nuclear waste as a radiological weapon, advanced technologies, and sabotage or theft of high-level nuclear waste. The comprehensive strategy for defending the Yucca Mountain Project against Federal crimes of terrorism includes addressing vulnerabilities, defending against various types of attacks, considering worst-case scenarios, weather effects, and implementing no-fly zones. The policy development for infractions of a no-fly zone over key areas involved in the Yucca Mountain Project includes ensuring the size of the zone is sufficient for protection, implementing ways to defend against airborne attacks, conducting background checks for personnel transporting nuclear waste, establishing a federal standard for the use of deadly force, and defining rules of engagement for potential airborne attacks. The interagency plan for a no-fly zone over key areas involved in the Yucca Mountain Project includes measures to defend against airborne attacks and analyze economic, public health, and environmental costs. SEC. 4. YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT TERRORISM CONSEQUENCE ASSESSMENT AND RESPONSE PLAN. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will coordinate a comprehensive interagency plan to respond to terrorism at the Yucca Mountain Project, including pre-response preparations, evacuation plans, and procedures for notifying emergency units during nuclear waste transport. The comprehensive plan for responding to terrorism at the Yucca Mountain Project includes assessing the impacts of releasing radioactive materials on public health, the environment, and socioeconomic factors. This involves analyzing immediate and long-term effects, cleanup costs, economic losses, and the perception of risk. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to evaluate the economic, public health, and environmental effects of implementing the plan, including repercussions and costs from various types of Federal crimes of terrorism. The technical review process is outlined in Section 5. The Secretary of Homeland Security and FEMA will collaborate with the National Research Council for technical review of plans developed under sections 3 and 4. The reviews will focus on strengths and weaknesses of the analyses and preparations in the plans, including the need for physical testing, container vulnerability to explosive devices, and the adequacy of computer models for evaluating environmental dispersion. The curr_chunk discusses evaluating near-site environmental dispersion of released radionuclides, health effects, and cleanup requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the Department of Energy recommendation. The Secretary of Energy must meet specific requirements before submitting a license application for a repository at Yucca Mountain, including completing interagency plans, holding public hearings, ensuring project security against terrorism, and providing a liability report to Congress. The Secretary of Energy submitted a report to Congress on the potential liability costs and damages from Federal crimes of terrorism against the Yucca Mountain Project. The term \"Yucca Mountain Project\" refers to the high-level nuclear waste repository being studied at Yucca Mountain, including transportation plans, storage facilities, and waste handling sites."
