    "content": "Coal-fired power plants are responsible for a significant portion of CO2 emissions in the U.S., making it a target for reducing greenhouse gases. Options include capturing CO2 emissions, switching to low-carbon sources like wind or nuclear power, or increasing natural gas generation. Natural gas, although not zero-carbon, emits less CO2 than coal plants. Recent increases in natural gas reserves have sparked interest in it as a lower carbon energy option. Natural gas is proposed as a near-term solution to reduce carbon emissions, with existing plants being able to provide immediate CO2 reductions according to industry executives. This option was discussed at a Senate hearing on the role of natural gas in mitigating climate change. A near-term solution to reduce carbon emissions is proposed using natural gas, with existing plants able to provide immediate CO2 reductions. This approach emphasizes the potential for increased use of natural gas to quickly and substantially reduce emissions by squeezing more electricity from existing gas-fired power plants. The report provides an overview of displacing coal-fired generation with electricity from natural gas plants. The report focuses on the feasibility of displacing coal-fired electricity with power from existing natural gas plants. It highlights key issues for Congress to consider, including background on gas-fired generation, feasibility issues, and policy considerations. Appendices provide additional information on the electric power system and gas-burning combined cycle generating technology. The report does not address the cost implications of such a policy. The report examines the potential for replacing coal-fired electricity with power from underutilized natural gas combined cycle generating plants. Key factors include uncertain variables like fuel prices, infrastructure needs, and carbon costs. Engineering analysis is needed to determine the feasibility of using existing natural gas plants to displace coal generation. The report explores the possibility of replacing coal-fired electricity with underutilized natural gas combined cycle plants. These plants, including advanced technology gas-burning power plants, could potentially reduce coal usage. The report suggests that further analysis and modeling would be required to address issues related to peaking plants and old steam-electric natural gas plants. Gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants have become a popular option for new generating capacity in the United States, challenging the dominance of coal plants. Between 1989 and 2007, the natural gas share of total generating capacity doubled, making it the largest component of the national generating fleet. This shift was driven by minimal new coal capacity construction and limited growth in nuclear capacity, with only wind power posing a challenge to natural gas in the later 2000s. Gas is the largest source of generating capacity, but trails behind coal in actual electricity generation. Natural gas accounted for 21% of electricity produced in 2008, with coal at 49%, nuclear power at 20%, and hydroelectric generation at 6%. Gas-fired generation grew in the 1990s and early 2000s due to cost, environmental, and safety concerns with other sources. Additionally, favorable technological, cost, and environmental factors contributed to the growth of gas-fired plants. The 1990s saw the construction of new gas-fired plants with advanced combustion turbine technology, specifically in natural gas combined cycle power plants. These plants were designed for baseload generation, operating efficiently by capturing waste heat. Gas-fired plants with advanced combustion turbine technology, specifically natural gas combined cycle power plants, are designed for baseload generation by capturing waste heat efficiently. NGCC plants can be built quickly and cheaply, costing about $1,200 per kilowatt of capacity, half as much as coal-fired plants, and can be operational in two to three years. They are suitable for small scale and modular construction, with unit sizes of about 100 MW, making them an attractive technology option for independent power producers. Gas-fired plants, particularly natural gas combined cycle power plants, were favored by independent power producers in the 1990s due to low natural gas prices. These plants produce fewer harmful environmental impacts than coal-fired plants and are easier to permit. Natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burned, making combined cycle plants more efficient. Gas-fired plants, especially natural gas combined cycle power plants, emit about half as much carbon dioxide as coal. The restructuring of the electric power industry in the 1990s led to the rise of independent power producers who focused on constructing low-risk, efficient plants. Between 1990 and 2007, independent power producers built over 168,000 MW of NGCC capacity at 345 plant sites to meet baseload demand. In addition, 89,843 MW of less efficient peaking turbines and 56,939 MW of other generating technologies were constructed, resulting in a 43% growth in generating capacity. However, by the mid-2000s, excess and underutilized generating capacity became apparent due to the combined cycle building boom. The combined cycle building boom led to excess and underutilized generating capacity due to questionable investment decisions and a dramatic increase in gas prices after 2000. This resulted in a large amount of unused generating capacity in NGCC plants, with only 13% operating at a baseload level in 2007. In 2007, only 13% of combined cycle capacity operated at baseload level, with a third having utilization rates below 30%. NGCC plants had an average capacity factor of 42%, while coal plants had 75%. The mismatch between the two creates interest in displacing coal power with gas generation. The potential displacement of coal-fired generation and emissions by existing NGCC plants is estimated in tables. The report discusses the potential of doubling the utilization of existing NGCC plants to generate additional power equivalent to 32% of all coal-fired generation in 2007, displacing about 19% of CO2 emissions. However, achieving this maximum displacement is unlikely due to various factors such as transmission system, system dispatch, natural gas supply and price, and transportation and storage. The NGCC unit may not always be able to transmit power to the same loads as coal units, as they are often located in different areas with separate transmission paths. Regional maps show that while some regions have both coal and NGCC plants, others have only one type of plant, limiting the potential for displacement of coal-fired generation. The Ohio River valley has a dense concentration of coal plants and only a few NGCC plants. The report discusses transmission system constraints that can hinder one power plant from meeting the load of another, including isolation of interconnections, limited transmission capacity, and congestion. The analysis considers the potential displacement of coal by gas based on the proximity of coal and NGCC plants. The electric grid is divided into three interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT covering Texas. These operate as independent systems with limited links. The electric grid is divided into three interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT, operating as independent systems with limited links between them. Surplus capacity in one interconnection cannot be used to meet load in another due to electrical isolation. For example, 1,000 MW of surplus NGCC capacity in ERCOT cannot displace coal in the Eastern Interconnection due to the lack of connections between them. The power grid is a single giant machine where disturbances can be detected across long distances. It was not built with a master plan like the Interstate Highway System. Initially, transmission lines were built by single utilities to move electricity to nearby population centers. As technology advanced, local grids began to interconnect for economic and reliability benefits. The power grid was initially developed by single utilities to supply nearby areas with electricity. However, long-distance transmission lines were not a priority, limiting the capacity to move power between regions efficiently. The debate over increasing renewable power usage involves building and funding new transmission lines to improve the grid's capabilities. The use of renewable power requires building new transmission lines to transport wind and solar energy to urban areas, displacing fossil-fueled power plants. Transmission congestion can limit the movement of electricity, even over short distances, necessitating upgrades to the existing network. Regional congestion, like in the PJM power pool, can restrict power flows between different parts of the grid. Transmission congestion in the PJM power pool, which covers the Midwest and middle Atlantic regions, restricts power flows between eastern and western parts. This congestion can increase costs for consumers and force utilities to rely on inefficient power plants. Studies show that the annual costs of transmission congestion range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. The key aspect of transmission system congestion is the restrictions it imposes on power movement. Transmission congestion imposes restrictions on power flows, limiting the ability to transfer power between different types of power plants. The solution to congestion does not always require massive transmission construction, as selective additions to capacity can lead to significant economic benefits for consumers. However, without these additions, congestion remains a constraint on the choice of power plants available to meet demand. Transmission congestion limits power flow between power plants. Sophisticated computer models analyze coal displacement limitations. Proximity analysis shows NGCC plants near coal plants could potentially replace coal generation. CRS conducted a proximity analysis for coal and NGCC plants in study groups using 2007 data. The study conducted by CRS in 2007 analyzed large coal plants and NGCC plants to determine potential displacement of coal generation by NGCC plants within a certain radius. Geographic information system (GIS) was used to identify plants within a ten-mile radius, with a second analysis including plants within 25 miles. The analysis conducted in 2007 looked at the potential displacement of coal generation by NGCC plants within a 25-mile radius. Factors such as utility system dispatch, transmission system configuration, fuel cost, and power system reliability would impact the actual displacement potential. Existing NGCC plants near coal plants could potentially achieve 15% to 28% of the maximum coal generation and CO2 emissions. Existing NGCC plants near coal plants may achieve 15% to 28% of potential coal generation and CO2 emissions displacement. However, this only represents a fraction of total U.S. coal generation and CO2 emissions. The analysis suggests that these plants may only account for around 30% or less of displaceable coal-fired generation and emissions. Greater displacement would depend on more distant NGCC plants, highlighting the importance of transmission system configuration and capacity in determining actual potential for displacing coal. The transmission system's role in displacing coal with power from existing NGCC plants is determined by system dispatch patterns. Monthly utilization of coal and gas-fired plants shows similar high utilization in summer and winter, and low utilization in spring and fall. This challenges the assumption that NGCC plants are underutilized when coal plants are operating. The figure illustrates the national, monthly picture of power plant dispatch, showing that when coal plant operation is at its highest, NGCC plant operation is also high. Even during low utilization months for NGCC units, there are still periods when they run near maximum output. The analysis shows that existing NGCC plants could potentially displace coal-fired generation, leading to a significant increase in U.S. gas demand. Comparing actual gas demand in 2007 with the additional gas supplies needed if all displaceable coal-fired generation were replaced by NGCC plants highlights the potential impact on gas demand. Existing NGCC plants could potentially displace coal-fired generation, leading to a significant increase in U.S. gas demand. The increased demand for coal displacement could be met with a combination of increased domestic production, pipeline imports from Canada, Alaskan supplies, and imports of liquefied natural gas. This interest in coal displacement by gas is due to the recent increase in natural gas available from shale formations and other unconventional sources. The combination of higher gas production and reduced demand during the 2008-2009 recession has led to a sharp decline in gas prices. Optimism surrounds the long-term gas supply and price outlook, with estimates of over 2 quadrillion cubic feet of gas resources. Gas production is improving due to advancements in extracting gas from shale, making it more abundant and cost-effective. Gas production is evolving to be more like mining and manufacturing, with a high probability of production from each well drilled. The EIA's long-term forecasts for natural gas wellhead prices for 2020 and 2030 have decreased due to the rapid increase in shale gas production. Despite optimism about natural gas supplies and prices, forecasting natural gas markets has historically been challenging. The largest difference between projections and actual data has been in natural gas prices. In the 1990s, gas prices were expected to be low but by 2004 they were much higher than expected. Major gas buyers criticized the forecasting system. Prices then plummeted. In a 2009 Senate hearing, a cautionary note was sounded about the history of overestimating production increases in response to new gas supplies. In 2009, drilling has declined as price fell, leading to demand destruction and job loss. The potential increase in natural gas demand should not be underestimated, with the lowest level of increased demand raising total demand to 24,886 TBtus. The U.S. Energy Information Administration does not foresee this demand level being reached soon. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that gas demand may not reach current levels until after 2028, with a potential significant acceleration if there is a shift from coal to gas. Gas consumers receive fuel through a vast national pipeline network of 293,000 miles, with storage facilities to meet peak demands. The national pipeline network and storage facilities support gas demand, with existing capacity likely not a constraint on coal displacement by NGCC plants. Increased gas use for coal displacement could stress specific pipelines and storage facilities serving those plants. The natural gas industry has the capacity to handle a material increase in gas demand for coal displacement, with significant capacity additions planned to meet the increased demand. The potential for displacing coal consumption in the power sector by utilizing existing NGCC power plants depends on factors such as excess NGCC generating capacity, operating patterns of coal and NGCC plants, transmission grid capabilities, natural gas supply, and environmental impacts. Time dimension plays a crucial role as existing NGCC plants may have the capacity today to displace coal generation, but this could change in the future. The potential for gas displacement of coal in the power sector depends on various factors including excess NGCC generating capacity, transmission grid capabilities, and natural gas supply. Future conditions must be considered as existing NGCC plants may have the capacity to displace coal generation today, but this could change. The cost implications of a coal displacement by gas policy are uncertain and could impact the economy by affecting natural gas prices and other sectors. Congress may consider commissioning a study to assess the feasibility of replacing coal with power from existing gas-fired plants. The study would analyze the potential costs and benefits, including the impact on electric rates and infrastructure. Multiple scenarios would need to be considered due to uncertainties such as future gas prices. This study could help determine if further exploration of a coal displacement policy is warranted. Congress may consider exploring the possibility of replacing coal generation with increased output from existing gas-fired plants. Additionally, a study could be conducted to assess the feasibility of using gas in existing coal-fired plants. This could help in displacing coal while still utilizing existing transmission lines, which could be advantageous. Engineering issues and pipeline connections would need to be addressed for large-scale use of gas in coal plants. Generating plants produce electricity using combustible fuels like coal, natural gas, and biomass, or non-combustible sources such as wind, solar, or nuclear energy. Transmission lines carry electricity from power plants to demand centers, with higher voltage lines having less power loss. Policy discussions focus on high voltage networks for long-distance power movement. Capacity is the potential output of a generating unit, while energy is the actual output over time. Energy Capacity is the potential output of a generating or storage unit, measured in watts, while Energy is the actual electricity generated or released over time, measured in watt-hours. Capacity Factor measures how intensively a power plant is utilized by comparing actual output to maximum potential output. For example, a 1,000 MW power plant could generate 8.76 million MWh in a year. The capacity factor of a power plant is calculated by comparing actual output to maximum potential output. The demand for electricity varies throughout the day, with a minimum base level of demand met by baseload generating units with low operating costs. Baseload units have low variable operating costs and can adjust output to meet fluctuations in demand. Intermediate units quickly change output to match demand changes and serve as spinning reserve. Peaking units are expensive but can start up and shut down quickly to meet peak demand. Peaking units serve as spinning reserve and quick start units for meeting peak demand, operating for a few hundred hours a year. Economic dispatch prioritizes generating units based on lowest variable cost and efficiency measured by heat rate, which is the fuel input needed to produce electricity. Lower heat rate indicates higher efficiency and lower costs. Economic dispatch prioritizes generating units based on heat rate efficiency and variable costs. Plants with lower heat rates have higher economic dispatch priority. Different types of plants, such as baseload, combined cycle, and peaking units, are dispatched accordingly in a utility system. Variable renewable power plants like wind and solar are used to meet demand as available, displacing generation from gas-fired plants with higher costs. However, their output depends on weather conditions and may displace coal generation during low demand periods. These plants do not have firm levels of output and are not considered firm in power systems. Variable renewable generation from wind and solar plants is not firm due to weather dependency. Linking them to electricity storage can make them firm, but current technology limits options. Combined cycle technology achieves high efficiency by capturing waste heat to generate electricity. Combined cycle technology uses steam to drive a generator, increasing energy efficiency. Different configurations like 1x1, 2x1, or 3x1 designs allow for flexible construction based on capacity needs. Natural gas is the predominant fuel used in the United States, but fuel oil or gasified coal can also be utilized. Gasified coal can be used as fuel in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant, with two prototypes operating in the US and a commercial-scale unit under construction in Indiana."
