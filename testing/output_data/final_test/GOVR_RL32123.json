    "content": "The United States has invested over $110 billion in ballistic missile defense programs since President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in FY1985. Deployment of an effective National Missile Defense system remains uncertain despite ongoing challenges and debates surrounding foreign missile threats, technological development, budgetary costs, and implications for deterrence and global stability. Congress has played a significant role in guiding the development of missile defense programs and policy. Since the 1980s, Congress has been involved in guiding missile defense programs, showing more concern than the Defense Department about threats to U.S. military forces from shorter range ballistic missiles. Congress has consistently supported larger missile defense budgets, with $9.3 billion allocated in FY2007, making it the largest Defense Department acquisition program. The primary technological concept for missile defense has been 'hit-to-kill' interceptor missiles, with mixed results over the past 25 years. The development of laser technology for missile defense, specifically the Airborne Laser (ABL) program, has been a topic of debate. While the Air Force sees ABL as mature technology, some question its effectiveness against future ballistic missile threats. The ABL project began in the 1970s with the Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) on a modified KC-135A aircraft to demonstrate the capability of a high-powered laser on an airborne platform. The Airborne Laser Laboratory (ALL) program demonstrated the capability of a high-powered laser on an aircraft platform to destroy missiles. After successful tests in the 1980s, the Air Force became interested in using lasers to destroy enemy ballistic missiles. This led to the development of the Airborne Laser (ABL) program in 1998. The ABL program, developed in June 1998, is the primary focus of the Missile Defense Agency's Boost Defense program. The lethality test demonstration has been delayed multiple times, now planned for August 2009. Congress supports ballistic missile defenses due to global missile proliferation concerns. The ABL is seen as the best near-term solution for destroying enemy ballistic missiles during their boost-phase. The Airborne Laser program aims to disrupt enemy missiles by damaging their booster skin, causing them to fall short of their target. The United States is considering high-powered lasers as a potential alternative for missile defense in the future. This report provides updates on the program's status and related issues for Congress, without offering a technical assessment of the program. The ABL program aims to use a high-power chemical laser mounted on a modified Boeing 747 to destroy ballistic missiles in their vulnerable initial flight stage before they leave the earth's atmosphere. This approach offers advantages such as targeting the missile before warheads are deployed and potentially over enemy territory. The ABL program integrates a weapons-class chemical laser on a modified Boeing 747-400F aircraft. Extensive modifications were made to the aircraft, including adding titanium sheets for protection and a turret for the telescope. The plane made its maiden flight in July 2002 and has since been based at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The ABL program, focusing on system integration, faced challenges with delays in achieving a lethality test by 2005, now rescheduled for August 2009 due to program restructuring and technical issues. Boeing successfully conducted low-power laser testing from the ABL aircraft in 2006. Boeing rolled out the ABL aircraft in Wichita, Kansas, in October 2006, completing major system integration milestones for flight testing. By January 2007, ABL had conducted over 50 flight tests and in March 2007, successfully fired the first in-flight tracking laser at an airborne target, a crucial step in demonstrating the aircraft's capability. The ABL's major subsystems include the lethal COIL laser, tracking system, and adaptive optics system, with COIL generating energy through a chemical reaction of oxygen and iodine molecules. The ABL program involves a lethal laser system that uses a chemical reaction of oxygen and iodine molecules to generate energy. The laser's infrared wavelength easily travels through the atmosphere, but atmospheric effects can distort the beam. An adaptive optics system compensates for this distortion, allowing the laser to focus on and destroy its target. The program began in 1996 with a $1.1 billion contract awarded to Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. Boeing has overall responsibility for program management and systems integration. Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Sunnyvale, CA is responsible for the design, development, and production of ABL target acquisition, beam control, and fire control systems. Northrop Grumman Space Technology in Redondo Beach, CA is responsible for the ABL high-energy laser. A fleet of ABL aircraft would be positioned in theater and flown closer to enemy airspace as local air superiority is attained. The Defense Department once indicated that a fleet of five aircraft might support two 24-hour combat air patrols in a theater during a crisis. The current plans for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program involve acquiring seven production aircraft. The program is divided into blocks of two-year periods for research, development, testing, and evaluation activities. The goals for ABL Block 2006 include continuing integration and testing of the first ABL aircraft, improving production capabilities for advanced optics and sensors, and studying capabilities for a more advanced second ABL weapon system. Boeing successfully fired the ABL in March 2007. Boeing successfully fired the ABL's tracking laser in-flight at an airborne target for the first time in March 2007. The ABL program aims to further test the weapon system, integrate it into the ballistic missile defense system, and conduct lethality tests in upcoming blocks. In Block 2010, a broader spectrum of ballistic missile threats will be evaluated. The ABL program is focused on the second aircraft, with design activities and initial fabrication of weapon components underway. The total program cost and number of ABL aircraft to be procured are not determined due to the acquisition strategy. Previous estimates envisioned seven ABL aircraft with a program cost of $6.12 billion to $10.7 billion. The Clinton Administration estimated the cost of the ABL program at $10.7 billion for the same number of aircraft. Congress has largely supported the program with about $4.3 billion in appropriations. The Bush Administration requested $632 million for FY2007 and $548.8 billion for FY2008, with Congress approving the requests. The House and Senate decreased the ABL program request in the defense authorization bill. The ABL program faced decreased funding requests in H.R. 1585 and S. 1547. Technical challenges, a shift to a capabilities-based approach, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, exploration of alternatives for Boost Phase Intercept mission, and funding uncertainties are key factors affecting the program's future. The ABL program faces uncertainty due to technical challenges and potential industrial base problems. The GAO has highlighted significant technical challenges, with only one critical subsystem being mature technology. The program is considered high technical risk, with concerns about fielding and employing the ABL. The ABL program is considered high technical risk with various technical challenges identified by the GAO. While there is consensus on the challenges, there is disagreement on how they may impact budget and schedule. The program's new requirements process aims to reduce risk of cost and schedule growth in the future. The Missile Defense Agency made program adjustments in February 2004 to put the ABL program on budget and schedule. GAO found that changes in the program would lead to a more cost-effective approach. Technical challenges include beam control, adaptive optics, system integration, and weight concerns with the laser modules exceeding the planned weight budget. Despite the weight issue, proponents argue that the system still meets the requirement to fit within the 747's maximum takeoff weight. The ABL program faces challenges in fitting the weapon system within the 747's maximum takeoff weight of 800,000 lbs. Critics doubt the system's lethality with fewer laser modules, raising concerns about flying closer to targets in hostile airspace and potential trade-offs in fuel capacity and aerial refueling needs. Questions also arise about the program's concept of operations, including the number of aircraft to be procured, deployment locations, and operational use. The ABL inventory size raises questions about its visibility and operational capabilities. Forward basing is crucial for in-theater time, but lack of chemical replenishment at these bases may require return flights to the US. Concerns exist about enemy attacks during refueling or absence of ABL aircraft. Postponement of ABL aircraft purchase raises operational effectiveness questions for a small fleet. The Air Force's inventory of ABL aircraft raises concerns about operational capabilities and visibility. Questions arise about the adequacy of having only seven aircraft to address potential threats in multiple theaters. The Air Force's organization into 10 Air Expeditionary Forces poses challenges for how a small fleet of ABLs would support these rotations. Procuring only seven aircraft may lead to high demand, low density issues, while acquiring more would increase operational costs and personnel requirements. The impact of the ABL on the Air Force remains uncertain. The Air Force's ABL aircraft inventory raises concerns about operational capabilities and visibility. Questions arise about having only seven aircraft to address threats in multiple theaters. ABLs will likely deploy to forward operating locations during crises, requiring refueling for combat air patrols and return to base. The impact of the ABL's weight gain on fuel load and potential increased payload leading to greater aerial refueling requirements are also being questioned. The Air Force's ABL aircraft inventory raises concerns about operational capabilities and visibility, with questions about having only seven aircraft to address threats in multiple theaters. The ABL's 400 km range may be too short to engage Russian or Chinese ICBMs in boost phase from outside their airspace. This raises questions about the ABL's effectiveness in crisis situations and the need for a more powerful laser or alternative solutions. The ABL's operational capabilities and visibility are a concern due to having only seven aircraft to address threats in multiple theaters. Questions arise about its effectiveness in crisis situations and the need for a more powerful laser or alternative solutions. Issues also include using the ABL in or near commercial airspace and the uncertainty surrounding its capabilities and employment due to a flexible requirements process. The ABL's industrial base is at risk due to funding and schedule uncertainties, which may cause specialized vendors to seek other business opportunities. The criticality of these vendors to the ABL program's progress is unclear, and Congress may be asked to help preserve key technologies. The ABL's industrial base is at risk due to funding and schedule uncertainties, which may cause specialized vendors to seek other business opportunities. Congress may be asked to help preserve critical path technologies that enable the ABL. Cancelling the ABL could harm the laser industry as a whole, as it is seen as a pathfinder for other laser programs. Some argue that ABL's cancellation would have little impact on other programs due to the lack of alternatives. The lethality test for the ABL program, scheduled for August 2009, is a critical next step. Objectives include demonstrating a shoot-down of a missile over the Pacific Ocean, testing the IRST system, and showing the adaptive optics system's ability to compensate for atmospheric distortion. This test is important for assessing the integration of ABL subsystems and components. The delayed lethality test of the ABL program may indicate ongoing systems integration issues. Depending on the test results, further integration tests may be needed. If technical problems persist, the ABL platform's availability for emergency missions could be in question. The outcome of the lethality test will determine the suitability of the ABL test aircraft for emergency or contingency missions. The ABL test program faces challenges with system integration and lethality testing, raising concerns about its availability for emergency missions. Questions remain about the platform's effectiveness and the extent of future flight tests. The ABL test program has faced challenges with system integration and lethality testing, leading to concerns about its readiness for emergency missions. Costs for the lethality test contract have tripled, raising doubts about MDA's ability to conduct a thorough test. Other platforms like Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ship-based interceptors are being considered for the Boost Phase Intercept mission. Despite technical challenges, ABL officials are optimistic about overcoming them. MDA is considering the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) as a potential alternative to the ABL program. The KEI program was established in 2003 with a focus on commonality and budget changes have increased competition between ABL and KEI. MDA's FY2004 R&D request for KEI saw a significant increase in funding. The Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI) program saw a significant increase in funding, with budgets climbing from $386 million in FY2007 to $1.65 billion in FY2011. There are concerns about whether KEI is a prudent hedge against potential delays in the Airborne Laser (ABL) schedule or a drain on resources that could be used for other MDA programs. This issue was discussed in a House Armed Services Subcommittee Hearing in March 2005. MDA Director Lt.Gen. Trey Obering explained the decision to cut $800 million from the KEI's FY2006 budget request to meet budget reductions and restructure the kinetic energy intercept effort. House Authorizors expressed concern about pursuing both KEI and ABL programs, requiring a comparison of capabilities and costs. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being explored as potential alternatives for the Boost Phase Intercept mission. The Congress provided $15 million in FY1996 for a joint U.S./Israeli program to study the feasibility of using UAVs with lightweight missiles for Boost Phase Intercept in an Iraq-like scenario. The estimated cost for a 20-UAV architecture was $1.5 billion over a 10-year life span, potentially lower than other systems. UAVs offer advantages such as operating closer to launch points and not risking aircrews' lives, but they may have payload limitations. Despite these deficiencies, analysts believe in the potential of UAVs due to recent advances in their technology and operational success. Recent advances in UAVs have led to operational success, prompting analysts to reconsider their effectiveness compared to the ABL program. The Air Force previously explored equipping F-15s with air-to-air missiles to intercept TBMs in boost phase. Congress has shown a preference for UAVs over manned aircraft for this role. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports the use of UAVs for TMD applications. Ship-based missile defense systems have fewer constraints due to the US withdrawal from the 1972 ABM treaty. BPI experiments are planned for FY2004. In FY2004, BPI experiments are planned, including space-based options which are more expensive but offer greater global coverage. The ABL program may have alternative roles such as cruise missile defense, destroying enemy satellites, or intercepting high altitude missiles. The Air Force Scientific Advisory Board recommended using the ABL to attack time critical targets on the ground. Alternative uses for the ABL, such as shooting down manned aircraft, cruise missiles, and air-to-air missiles, have been discussed. The ABL could also contribute to command and control missions. The only alternative role currently considered for the ABL is BPI of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Some argue for focusing on developing ABL's technology for missile defense before exploring other uses. Congress has allocated $4.3 billion for the ABL, prompting calls for further investigation into its potential returns. The ABL is DOD's most advanced high power chemical laser program, and studying alternative uses could leverage its advancements if MDA determines other platforms offer more potential in missile defense."
