    "content": "The First Step Act mandates the development of a risk and needs assessment system at BOP to evaluate federal prisoners' recidivism risk and assign them to appropriate programs. DOJ must release the system within 210 days of the Act's enactment to classify prisoners based on their risk level, assess violent tendencies, and assign tailored recidivism reduction programs. The First Step Act mandates the development of a risk and needs assessment system at BOP to evaluate federal prisoners' recidivism risk and assign them to appropriate programs. The system includes assigning prisoners to programming based on their criminogenic needs, reassessing their recidivism risk periodically, providing incentives for successful participation, determining readiness for transfer to prerelease custody, and accommodating prisoners with dyslexia using audio technology. The Attorney General is required to consult with various agencies and conduct a review of existing risk and needs assessment systems to develop recommendations for recidivism reduction programs and activities under the First Step Act. The Attorney General must review and validate the risk and needs assessment system, evaluate recidivism rates among prisoners, and address any disparities in the system. The Attorney General must review and validate the risk and needs assessment system, evaluate recidivism rates among prisoners, address disparities, consult with the Independent Review Committee, and direct BOP on evidence-based recidivism reduction programs. The DOJ is required to provide guidance on recidivism reduction programming for prisoners, including tailoring programs to their specific needs and grouping prisoners with similar risk levels together. The system also includes screening for dyslexia and providing treatment programs. BOP must complete initial risk and needs assessments for all prisoners within 180 days of the system's release. BOP is mandated to assign prisoners to recidivism reduction programs based on initial assessments, expand program capacity within two years, and prioritize prisoners nearing release during the expansion period. Prisoners nearing release are given priority for placement in recidivism reduction programs or productive activities. High- and medium-risk prisoners are prioritized for recidivism reduction programs, while low-risk prisoners focus on productive activities. Reassessment is required annually for successful participants, with more frequent reassessments for high- and medium-risk prisoners with less than five years until release. BOP must reassign prisoners if their risk level or needs change. The First Step Act requires the reassignment of prisoners to recidivism reduction programs or productive activities if their risk level or needs change. The DOJ must provide training for BOP employees on using the system, monitor its usage, and provide incentives for prisoners to participate in programs. The First Step Act mandates reassigning prisoners to programs or activities for reducing recidivism based on their changing risk level or needs. Incentives for participation include additional phone and video privileges, extended visitation time, potential transfer to a closer facility upon release, and various rewards determined by the BOP. These rewards are earned in addition to any other eligibility criteria, such as good time credit. The First Step Act provides incentives for prisoners who successfully complete recidivism reduction programming, such as earning up to 10 days of time credits for every 30 days of participation. Minimum and low-risk prisoners can earn an additional five days of time credits for every 30 days of successful participation. However, prisoners convicted of certain offenses are ineligible for additional time credits but can still earn other rewards for program participation. Prisoners ineligible for earning additional time credits under the First Step Act include those convicted of violent, terrorism, espionage, human trafficking, sex offenses, repeat felon in possession of firearm, certain fraud, or high-level drug offenses. Prisoners with a final order of removal under immigration law are also ineligible. Retroactive earning of time credits for completed programs prior to the act's enactment is not allowed. Guidelines are required for reducing earned time credits for rule violations and a process for prisoners to regain lost credits. Prisoners can earn back lost time credits through a process that includes demonstrating reduced risk of recidivism and approval from the warden for transfer to prerelease custody. A prisoner can be transferred to supervised release if they have earned time credits equivalent to the remaining prison sentence and are assessed as a minimum or low risk to recidivate. However, they cannot start supervised release more than 12 months early. Any excess time credits earned would be served in prerelease custody with conditions on home confinement. Prisoners on home confinement under prerelease custody must have 24-hour electronic monitoring to track their location and activities. They are only allowed to leave their residences for specific reasons such as work, job-seeking, community service, medical treatment, or family-related activities. The Bureau of Prisons can adjust the conditions for compliant prisoners but can impose more restrictions for those who violate the terms. The First Step Act allows the Bureau of Prisons to impose conditions on prisoners in prerelease custody, including revoking it for non-technical violations like committing a new crime. The Act also mandates the expansion of capacity for eligible prisoners in prerelease custody and requires the submission of reports to Congress to assess the system's implementation and effects. Additionally, the Department of Justice must provide annual reports on recidivism reduction programs and activities for the next five years. The First Step Act mandates reports on recidivism reduction programs and activities provided by BOP, including capacity, gaps, and effectiveness. It also requires data on recidivism rates based on various criteria and the status of prison work programs. Additionally, the Act aims to expand work opportunities for prisoners without impacting nonincarcerated workers and utilize budgetary savings for other federal investments. The First Step Act requires a report on offenses that make prisoners ineligible for earned time credits, their demographics, criminal history categories, and participation in recidivism reduction programs and activities. The First Step Act mandates a report on prisoners ineligible for time credits based on offenses, demographics, and participation in programs. The Government Accountability Office must audit the system's usage at BOP facilities every two years, assessing frequency of prisoner assessments, availability of programs, and DOJ's compliance with duties. The First Step Act authorizes funding for DOJ to implement a system to assess eligibility for time credits, training for BOP employees, work assignments for prisoners, and reducing disparities in recidivism rates. It also makes changes to federal sentencing laws, including reducing mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses. The First Step Act reduces mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses, adjusts penalties for drug traffickers with prior convictions, and expands eligibility for the safety valve provision. It changes criteria for prior convictions and makes provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactive. The First Step Act expands eligibility for the safety valve provision, allowing judges to sentence low-level drug offenders to less than the mandatory minimum. It also eliminates stacking for firearm convictions and makes the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactive. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act of 2018 allows for the retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act, requiring prisoners to petition the court for sentence reduction. It also reauthorizes grant programs and a pilot program for early release of elderly prisoners. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act amended the authorization for reentry programs, allowing grants for reentry courts and employment opportunities. DOJ can now award both planning and implementation grants, with a maximum of $75,000 for planning grants and $1 million for planning and implementation grants to a single entity. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act amended the authorization for reentry programs, allowing grants for reentry courts and employment opportunities. DOJ can now award planning grants up to $75,000 and implementation grants up to $1 million to a single entity, with a focus on equitable geographic distribution and support from relevant authorities. Applicants for implementation grants must demonstrate collaboration with various justice systems for successful reentry of ex-offenders. The DOJ requires applicants for reentry grants to collaborate with multiple agencies and demonstrate plans for analyzing barriers to reentry. Priority is given to applications focusing on areas with a high number of returning prisoners and involving stakeholders and prisoner families. The DOJ requires applicants for reentry grants to collaborate with multiple agencies, prioritize high-risk returning prisoners, and develop strategic reentry plans with measurable outcomes. Applicants must use rigorous studies to evaluate program effectiveness. The Second Chance Act requires grantees to submit annual reports to the DOJ detailing progress towards strategic performance outcomes. Grantees receiving implementation grants must provide data on performance measures, including new outcomes such as staff training, serving eligible individuals, and providing risk screening and case planning services. The Second Chance Act requires grantees to report progress on key outcomes such as increased enrollment in treatment services, education, employment, and housing, as well as reduced drug use and recidivism rates for individuals receiving reentry services. Applicants for implementation grants can include a cost-benefit analysis in their reentry strategic plan. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act authorizes $35 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023 for grants to develop family-based substance abuse treatment programs as an alternative to incarceration. Nonprofit organizations can now receive grants, with priority given to those with relationships with criminal justice agencies. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act reauthorizes $10 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023 for a grant program to improve academic and vocational education in prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities. Grantees must report progress and allow DOJ to evaluate education methods implemented with the grants. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act requires DOJ to identify and publish best practices for academic and vocational education in prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities. It reauthorizes $5 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023 for grants to provide technology career training for prisoners, expanding to include any career training for soon-to-be-released individuals. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act allows nonprofit organizations to apply for grants to provide subsidized employment as part of career training programs for soon-to-be-released individuals. The act prioritizes applications that assess local demand for employees, offer individualized reentry career planning, connect with local employers, and evaluate employment outcomes. It reauthorizes $10 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023 for this program. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act authorizes grants for drug treatment programs in prisons to reduce post-prison drug use. Grants can be used for existing programs, developing new programs, addiction recovery support, and medication-assisted treatment services. DOJ will allocate $15 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023 for this initiative. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act focuses on providing community-based transitional services to former inmates returning to the community. The program, now named \"Community-based Mentoring and Transitional Services Grants to Nonprofit Organizations,\" offers various services such as educational, vocational, substance abuse treatment, family services, and comprehensive healthcare. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act expands a pilot program allowing elderly nonviolent offenders to serve their sentences on home confinement. The program requires offenders to be at least 65 years old, have no history of violent offenses, and have served a minimum of 10 years or 75% of their sentence. The act reauthorizes funding at $15 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act reestablishes a pilot program for elderly nonviolent offenders to serve their sentences on home confinement. Eligibility criteria include being at least 60 years old, serving two-thirds of their sentence, and not being a risk to public safety. Terminally ill offenders can also be considered for home confinement under the expanded program. Terminally ill offenders, regardless of age or sentence length, can qualify for home confinement if they require care at a medical facility or have a terminal illness. The Second Chance Act funds research projects on reentry, including studies on children with incarcerated parents and comparing recidivism rates between states. The curr_chunk discusses various studies conducted by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) on recidivism rates, characteristics of individuals who do not recidivate, unique reentry challenges, characteristics of individuals who return to prison, and violations of community-based supervision. These studies aim to improve data collection on former prisoners and identify individuals posing the highest risk to the community. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act reauthorizes appropriations for research projects on post-incarceration supervision and communication between corrections and child welfare agencies. NIJ is required to evaluate grants for reentry and recidivism reduction programs to assess cost-effectiveness and community impact within five years. NIJ evaluates Second Chance Act programs to determine their effectiveness in delivering services, impact on communities and participants, and meeting the needs of various demographic groups. Grantees must collect data on outcome measures such as employment, housing, education, and public safety. Data collected during evaluations is made publicly available while protecting confidentiality. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act requires BOP to develop policies for partnerships with nonprofit organizations to deliver recidivism reduction programming. It repealed authorization for certain programs and focuses on correctional and sentencing reform. The First Step Act amended 18 U.S.C. Section 3624(b) to allow federal prisoners to earn up to 54 days of good time credit for every year of their imposed sentence. This changed the previous interpretation by the BOP, where prisoners could earn 54 days of credit for every year served. The act also requires BOP to provide a secure storage area outside of the secure facilities. The First Step Act amended 18 U.S.C. Section 3624(b) to allow federal prisoners to earn up to 54 days of good time credit for every year of their imposed sentence. It also requires the BOP to provide a secure storage area outside of the secure facilities for qualified law enforcement officers to store firearms. Additionally, the act allows these officers to carry concealed firearms on prison grounds but outside of the secure perimeter, and prohibits the use of restraints on pregnant inmates in custody. The use of restraints on inmates is only permitted in specific circumstances, such as when there is an immediate flight risk or threat of harm. Restraints should be the least restrictive necessary and cannot be used around the ankles, legs, or waist, or to restrain hands behind the back. Pregnant inmates must be treated with special care, and if restraints are used, a report must be submitted within 30 days. The use of restraints on pregnant inmates must be reported within 30 days, detailing the reasons, type, and effects of their use. Training guidelines for restraint use during pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery must be developed by BOP and USMS. The act amends 18 U.S.C. Section 3621(b) to require BOP to house prisoners in facilities close to their primary residence, within 500 driving miles, considering various factors. BOP must consider bedspace availability, security designation, programmatic and health needs, faith-based requests, court recommendations, and security concerns when deciding where to house a prisoner. Prisoners can request to stay at their current facility or be transferred. The act amends 18 U.S.C. Section 3624(c)(2) to require BOP to prioritize placing lower-risk prisoners on home confinement for the maximum allowed time. It also allows courts to modify a prisoner's sentence upon BOP's petition, potentially reducing the sentence and imposing probation or supervised release. The act allows courts to reduce a prisoner's sentence under certain conditions, such as age and serving at least 30 years, if deemed not a danger. This is known as compassionate release. The court can act upon a petition from BOP or the prisoner after exhausting all administrative rights. The act requires the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to notify the prisoner's attorney, partner, and family within 72 hours of a terminal illness diagnosis. BOP must offer the prisoner's partner and family a visit within seven days and assist in drafting a petition for compassionate release. Requests for compassionate release must be processed within 14 days, and if the prisoner is unable to submit a petition, their attorney, partner, or family can do so on their behalf. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is required to accept and process requests for compassionate release drafted by the prisoner's attorney, partner, or family. BOP must assist prisoners who are unable to prepare their own request and provide information on the process, timeline, and appeal rights. Annual reports on compassionate release applications processing must be submitted to Congress. The act amends federal prisoner reentry initiative laws to require BOP to assist prisoners with obtaining identification and benefits before release, including social security cards, driver's licenses, and birth certificates. Pre-release planning procedures must be established for all prisoners, including those serving community confinement sentences. The act authorizes Federal Prison Industries (FPI) to sell products for correctional facilities, disaster relief, and nonprofits, excluding office furniture sales. It also mandates BOP to set aside 15% of wages for prisoners' transition upon release and provide training on de-escalation techniques for officers and employees. The act requires the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to assess and provide evidence-based treatment for prisoners with opioid and heroin abuse problems, including Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT). A report must be submitted to Congress within 90 days, outlining a plan to expand access to treatment. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) is also mandated to provide evidence-based treatment for prisoners on supervised release. The act requires the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to establish two pilot programs for opioid and heroin abuse treatment in at least 20 facilities. One program involves mentoring youth with volunteer mentors, while the other program uses prisoners to provide training and therapy to animals seized by federal law enforcement. The act also mandates the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to collect new data elements related to federal prisoners, including the number of veterans among them. The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is required to provide data on various aspects of federal prisoners, including veterans, solitary confinement, pregnant female prisoners, MAT treatment, parent/guardian prisoners, assaults on staff, recidivism reduction programs, and program enrollment. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) must submit an annual report to Congress on these statistics. The act mandates BJS to submit an annual report to Congress for seven years with specified data. It requires BOP to provide free tampons and sanitary napkins to prisoners meeting healthcare needs. The Attorney General must coordinate with various agencies and stakeholders on federal reentry policies and submit a report. The act mandates BJS to submit an annual report to Congress for seven years with specified data. It prohibits juvenile facilities from using room confinement for discipline, punishment, or retaliation. Juvenile facilities must use less restrictive techniques and try to de-escalate situations with juveniles. The act mandates juvenile facilities to use less restrictive techniques before placing juveniles in room confinement. Staff must inform juveniles why they are being placed in room confinement and when they will be released. If a juvenile poses a threat, they must be released within three hours or 30 minutes, depending on the situation. The act mandates juvenile facilities to use less restrictive techniques before placing juveniles in room confinement. If a juvenile continues to pose a threat after the maximum period of confinement, they must be transferred to another facility for adequate services. Consecutive periods of room confinement are prohibited."
