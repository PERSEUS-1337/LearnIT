    "content": "Domestic U.S. forests, dominated by few forest types, contain an array of species mixes adapted to survive within specific climatic conditions. Concerns arise over the predicted rate of change exceeding the natural adaptive rate, potentially decreasing total temperate forest area and altering forest value. The 750 million acres of U.S. forests are owned and managed by various entities. The 750 million acres of U.S. forests are owned and managed by various entities including the federal government, states, local governments, corporations, and private landowners. Ownership dominance varies regionally, with federal forests most common in the West, states/local governments in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, corporate forests in timber-growing areas, and other private forests in the eastern regions. Landholdings range from small summer homes to large areas managed by organizations for various purposes. The Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture is addressing the effects of climate change on land and resource management through its National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change. Assistance programs are available for non-corporate private forest owners to support forest resilience and adaptation. The Forest Service is providing support for forest resilience and adaptation by non-corporate forest owners in response to climate change effects. Changes in domestic forests due to climate change are projected to increase temperatures, alter hydrology, and expand disturbances, potentially leading to new ecosystems with uncertain economic values. The scientific consensus is that average temperatures in the lower atmosphere have increased over the last century and are expected to continue rising. Warming temperatures could alter habitats and spur species migration, with oak-hickory forests in southern New England projected to move north by 70-150 miles by the end of the century. Oak-hickory, oak-pine, ponderosa pine, and arid woodland habitats are expected to expand, while alpine and subalpine habitats like spruce-fir and aspen-birch are likely to decrease. Temperatures rising in Vermont's Green Mountains have caused spruce-fir and maple-beech-birch forests to move upslope by over 300 feet in elevation. By 2100, oak-hickory forests in southern New England could move north by 70-150 miles, increasing their area by 50-400%. This shift may reduce maple-beech-birch forests and maple syrup production by a quarter, moving them upslope by over 250 feet. Experts predict that temperature changes will likely be accompanied by hydrologic changes, adding stress to trees in some areas while benefiting trees in others. Warming trends may increase precipitation volatility, leading to more rain and drought. Precipitation projections among climate change models are less certain than temperature predictions. The severity and frequency of drought is expected to increase, adding stress to U.S. forests and leading to reduced tree growth and increased tree mortality. Widespread tree mortality has occurred during severe droughts in the past, such as in the southern Appalachian Mountains and the Great Plains during the dust-bowl droughts of the 1920s and 1930s. Climate models also project more frequent and intense ice storms and wind events. Increasing temperatures are expected to shorten U.S. winters, decreasing snowpack and hastening snowmelt, leading to summer moisture deficits and increasing stress on forests. This can result in higher tree mortality, making forests more vulnerable to disturbances like landslides, flash floods, and wildfires. Disturbances, such as severe storms, floods, wildfires, insect infestations, and drought, can kill trees and occur naturally in temperate ecosystems. Disturbances in temperate ecosystems, such as pests like insects and diseases, can kill trees and limit growth. In 2008, nearly 9 million acres of trees were killed by insects and diseases in the U.S. Unusually hot, dry weather patterns can increase insect outbreaks. Global warming may lead to the redistribution of insect pests, invading new habitats and forest types. The mountain pine beetle is an example of this phenomenon. The mountain pine beetle is an example of how climate variability can convert a native insect into an invasive species, with warmer temperatures accelerating reproductive success. The current infestation has spread to parts of northern Canada previously unaffected, potentially allowing the beetle to invade eastern Canada and the eastern United States. Climate variability also affects wildfires in the western United States, with higher temperatures and drier conditions expected to bring more severe fire weather. Increased climate volatility is expected to lead to more extreme events disturbing forests, potentially increasing their vulnerability. This could result in forests becoming more synchronized, with fewer species and age classes, reducing their defenses against threats like the mountain pine beetle. The synchronized regeneration of lodgepole pine forests after severe fires contributes to the current mountain pine beetle epidemic and forest mortality. Greenhouse gas emissions, including increased CO2 and nitrogen levels, may boost forest growth rates and carbon sequestration. However, higher CO2 levels can also enhance plant water-use efficiency, offset by increased water demands due to higher temperatures and longer growing seasons. Ozone and nitrogen deposition can negatively impact forest productivity and water quality. Forest resilience and adaptation are crucial for ecosystem sustainability in the face of increasing atmospheric carbon, nitrogen, and ozone levels. The effects of these changes on forest productivity and water quality are uncertain, with potential benefits and harms. Biodiversity plays a key role in providing resilience and adaptation, while unsuccessful adaptation could lead to extinction. It is important to consider the disturbance history of forests when assessing growth patterns attributed to climate change. Biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem resilience and adaptation, providing a broader base for response and recovery. Genetic diversity, the lowest level of biodiversity, allows for variations in genetic composition among species, leading to better adaptation to different conditions. Genetic diversity is important for adaptation to different conditions. Resistant trees can help reduce pest problems, as seen with white pine trees and American chestnuts affected by chestnut blight. Clones and genetic monocultures lack genetic diversity, which can be detrimental in agriculture and natural plant populations. The lack of genetic variation in crops and livestock increases risks from pests. Species diversity in temperate forests protects against pest epidemics and promotes adaptability to disturbances. Stand diversity, including variation in tree ages and sizes, further enhances biodiversity in forests. Stand diversity in forests, with variation in tree ages and sizes among stands, promotes resilience by providing different conditions to respond to changes and disturbances. Congress could play a role in promoting resilient forests by providing funding and direction for federal and nonfederal forest management. The USDA Forest Service, managing 59% of federal forests, follows a direction that indirectly encourages resilient forest management. The USDA Forest Service manages 59% of federal forests with the direction to produce sustained yields of multiple uses without impairing long-term productivity. While not explicitly focused on resilience and diversity, the direction implies management for adaptation to changing conditions, including climate change. Congress provides funding and direction for federal and nonfederal forest management, but regulation of forestry practices on private lands is solely a state responsibility. Legislation in the 112th Congress could impact forest management for adaptation to climate change, but no bills have been introduced yet. Climate change is a key issue for forestry assistance, with federal direction for adaptable, resilient forests on private lands being a state responsibility. In the 111th Congress, climate cap-and-trade bills included funding for forest adaptation, but lacked specific guidance. Some bills addressed regional forest health issues like the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Concerns exist about the ability of U.S. temperate forests to adapt to climate change without significant losses. Tree species dispersal is slow, making them vulnerable to climate change. By 2090, higher temperatures and altered hydrological patterns are predicted. Species at risk include habitat specialists, trees on the edges of their habitat, those in fragmented areas, and poor dispersers. Ecological community interactions influence ecosystem migration. Forest management can help ecosystems adapt to climate change and disturbances. Sustainable forests can provide various ecosystem services like clean water, wildlife habitat, and carbon sequestration. Management for sustainable forests suggests focusing on \"ecological adaptation\" rather than \"ecological restoration.\" Climate change may impact traditional forest management approaches. Climate change may alter regional climates, making restoration of historic conditions unsustainable. Forest management should focus on enhancing resilience and diversity at genetic, species, and stand levels. Uncertainty about temperature changes, precipitation levels, and catastrophic events leads to uncertainty in ecological responses. Efforts to manage uncertainty include research, monitoring climate change impacts, and adjusting management strategies. Forest management focuses on reducing threats, increasing diversity, and improving habitat connectivity based on simple understandings of species and ecosystems. However, uncertainty remains about forests' ability to recover from and adapt to climate change impacts. Monitoring changes and adjusting management strategies are crucial for assisting forests in adapting to changing conditions, despite the potential costs involved. Research and information on managing forest resilience and adaptation cover a wide range of topics. Researchers have identified significant research gaps in forest resilience and adaptation, including the need for baseline data on species distribution, reducing uncertainty in climate change predictions, and further research on forest ecosystem responses to stressors. Further research is needed on forest ecosystem responses to stressors such as water stress, belowground processes, habitat migration, pests, diseases, and growth rate responses to atmospheric changes. Historic data can help predict future ecological changes. Limited knowledge exists on the effectiveness of adaptive management in forestry due to long generation cycles of forests and lack of systematic monitoring programs. On-the-ground monitoring is crucial for understanding forest adaptation to climatic changes. The USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) started in 1917 to monitor tree species size, volume, growth, mortality, and wood production. FIA uses permanent forest plots for accurate timber data measurement. The European Union's intensive forest health monitoring network, EU/ICP-Forests Level II, monitors habitat shifts for various species across the EU with 6,000 plots. It provides data for policy decisions, raises public awareness, and acts as an early warning system for environmental issues. The adaptive management plan for federal forests in the Pacific Northwest was created in 1994 by the Clinton Administration. It covered 10 million acres and focused on monitoring old-growth forests, habitats for species like the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet, watersheds, and socioeconomic impacts. A 10-year assessment found that while managers were criticized for being too cautious in their strategies, the large-scale monitoring system proved to be highly beneficial, showing that forest growth exceeded losses from timber harvest and other disturbances. The USFS programs, such as the National Fire Plan and Forest Health Monitoring Program, provide valuable information on forest conditions and responses to stimuli. However, these efforts are limited geographically or topically, and may not be sufficient for determining baselines and changing conditions in forest management. Forest management impacts species diversity and stand structures, whether for timber production or protected natural areas. Forest management practices can be modified to emphasize diversity for resilient forests, including prescribed burning for wildfire management and species-focused harvesting. Forest certification ensures sustained productivity, while more intensive actions like reducing fragmentation and managing species relocation support adaptation. Strategies should evolve based on new research insights for forest health. Forest adaptation can be improved with up-to-date climate science and local information for land managers. Monitoring changes in forests by managers themselves is suggested, but it may be costly and divert attention from decision-making. \"Adaptive management\" involves taking action, assessing results, and modifying future actions based on feedback. Management implements the \"best apparent management option,\" with feedback from research and monitoring to adjust future activities. Active adaptive management allows for experimentation and quick alterations in response to new information to address expected changes. Forest management may need to be adaptive due to changing conditions. Most domestic U.S. forests are temperate, with various species mixes. Alaska contains boreal forests of hemlock-Sitka spruce and spruce-birch mixes. The United States has various temperate forest types, including tropical forests in southern Florida and Hawaii. These forests are dominated by a few tree species in the overstory and many plant species in the understory, adapted to specific climatic conditions. Climate change may exceed the natural adaptive rate, leading to a decrease in total temperate forest habitat and potentially degrading the value of U.S. forests in providing goods and services. U.S forests provide valuable ecosystem services like timber, clean water, and recreation. Climate change could impact these services, but management strategies can help increase forest resilience. Climate change may alter species mixes and increase disturbances in temperate forests, which could take decades to adapt to future conditions. Forests may take decades to adapt to climate change and other disturbances, potentially impacting economically valuable ecosystem services. Regional variations in impacts are expected due to differences in latitude, hydrology, and topography. Specific disturbances, like invasive species, can significantly alter ecosystems, as seen with the chestnut blight. Climate change increases the likelihood of invasive species introduction, affecting different forest types in varying ways. Different forest types are likely to be affected differently by climate change and may require different management strategies to promote their adaptation. U.S. forests are owned and managed by various entities, including the federal government, states, local governments, corporations, and private landowners. The Forest Service, under the Department of Agriculture, is the largest federal forest management agency primarily in the West. The Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Land Management, administers most other federal forestlands. States and local governments also own significant forestland. Several states and local governments, especially in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, own significant forestland. Private forests are more common in the North and South regions, while corporate forests are concentrated in the Pacific Coast and South, managed for industrial wood products. Other private forests dominate in the eastern regions, varying in size and purpose, from small woodlots to large landholdings managed by organizations for hunting or conservation purposes. The Forest Service and the Department of the Interior are addressing the effects of climate change on federal land and resource management through Forest Management Programs. The Forest Service released a National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change in 2010, establishing management guidance for national forest adaptation and carbon mitigation. The Interior Department established a Climate Change Task Force and created a climate change response council, regional climate science centers, and landscape conservation cooperatives. The management of private lands varies widely, with some being intensively managed, while others are left to grow with little effort. The Forest Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service offer conservation programs and assistance to private forest owners for adaptation to climate change. Federal assistance programs aim to provide information and support for forest adaptation. Management practices for forest adaptation involve enhancing diversity of species and stand structures to increase resilience. Traditional forestry practices like wildfire management and timber harvesting can be adjusted to prioritize structures that enhance forests' ability to respond to change. Landowners undertake various activities in response to disturbances, such as wildfires and insect epidemics, which can impact biodiversity. Timber management practices can either enhance or reduce forest adaptability depending on implementation. Providing migration corridors and assisting forest migration are more intensive actions that can also support forest adaptability. Wildfires are natural disturbances in temperate forests, with varying intensity and frequency. Historic fire suppression, logging, and grazing have made some ecosystems prone to intense wildfires. Alternative approaches like altering fire protection and reducing fuel levels can enhance forest resilience. Monitoring is crucial to assess how forests respond to management activities for sustained ecosystem services. The appropriate management response (AMR) allows some wildfires to burn in order to enhance forest resilience and adaptability. This approach advocates for letting wildfires burn within natural parameters to increase species diversity and stand resilience, while also saving taxpayer dollars and promoting biodiversity. Federal land management agencies have developed this approach to manage wildfires effectively. Critics suggest that the implementation of appropriate management response (AMR) for wildfires has been limited, with some ecosystems having unnaturally high fuel levels due to past suppression and logging practices. Reducing fuel levels can lower wildfire severity and promote natural stand diversity and resilience. Prescribed burning and mechanical thinning are primary tools for reducing fuels to generate benefits of stand asynchrony and heterogeneity associated with natural wildfires. Prescribed burning involves deliberately setting fires in specific areas under identified conditions, widely used for fuel management to reduce biomass to ashes acting as fertilizer, especially effective in arid regions where decomposition is slow. Prescribed burns are effective in reducing fine fuels that can lead to wildfires and disturbances. They help create more resilient forests by altering forest structure and increasing diversity. However, there are concerns about the potential for escaped burns causing extensive damage and emissions exacerbating climate change. Prescribed burns and wildfires release large amounts of CO2, with advocates arguing that prescribed burns shift fire timing without increasing total CO2 emissions. They also claim that prescribed burns reduce severe fires, thus lowering overall CO2 emissions. Forest health management involves preventing, controlling, or eradicating insects, diseases, and invasive species using specific tools tailored to each pest. Forest health management tools include manual controls, chemical controls, and biological controls to prevent, control, or eradicate pests like insects, diseases, and invasive species. Manual controls involve cutting and removing infested trees or invasive plants, while chemical controls use pesticides with caution due to potential effects on human health. Biological controls introduce species to combat pathogens. Biological controls in forest health management involve introducing species like pathogens, parasites, or predators to target specific pests. These controls can vary in specificity, with some being host-specific while others are more broad in their effectiveness. Long-term strategies may involve selecting and propagating plants resistant to diseases or pests. Forest health management tools can enhance or limit forest resilience and adaptation, but effectiveness varies depending on the pest being targeted. Forest health management tools can improve resilience and adaptability by removing invasive species and increasing native genetic diversity. Eradicating exotic pests can enhance ecological sustainability, but changing conditions may lead native pests into new ecosystems. For example, warmer winters have allowed the mountain pine beetle to migrate into previously unaffected areas. Timber production and management, known as silviculture, play a crucial role in forest management by determining timber harvesting, thinning, and reforestation practices. These decisions impact the diversity of existing and future forests by selecting which trees to cut, let grow, and in what patterns, influencing genetic, species, and stand diversity. Forest management certification ensures sustained forests over the long term. Certification assesses and assures sustained forests. Timber harvesting involves cutting trees to produce wood products. Decisions on cutting systems, rotation age, and tree selection impact forest diversity. Even-aged stands have trees in one or two age classes, while all-aged stands have greater species diversity. Tree selection is crucial in harvesting decisions. Harvesting decisions impact forest diversity by considering tree selection, including leaving legacy trees for seed production and forest regeneration. Salvage and sanitation harvests focus on removing dead, dying, and at-risk trees for forest health management. Rotation age varies based on the forest's purpose, with industrial plantations maximizing timber production and conservation areas emphasizing tree sizes. Legacy trees with superior growth characteristics are crucial for adaptable and resilient forests. Harvesting decisions impact forest diversity by considering tree selection and rotation age. Lower rotation ages can speed forest adaptation to climate change, but may reduce ecosystem values associated with old trees. Cutting unit size depends on the forest's purpose, with larger sizes lowering management costs and yielding greater harvests, while smaller units increase biodiversity and stand asynchrony for resilient forests. Thinning is the practice of cutting and removing a portion of trees in a stand to enhance timber growth, reduce wildfire threats, control insect infestations, improve tree vigor, and provide economic benefits. However, small cutting units can lead to more roads, causing issues like erosion, stream sedimentation, and forest fragmentation. All-aged management can exacerbate these problems for healthy forests. Thinning is a forestry practice used to improve tree vigor, enhance forest resilience, and provide economic benefits. It can also increase stand diversity by altering forest structure. However, there are concerns about potential impacts such as soil erosion, water quality degradation, and increased fire risk. Natural forest regeneration, following a timber harvest, relies on seeds from surrounding trees to create resilient and diverse forests. However, if desirable trees have been removed, regeneration may result in genetically impoverished stands. It can take several years for naturally regenerated trees to become established, allowing for invasive species to take hold. Artificial forest regeneration involves planting trees established in nurseries as an alternative to natural regeneration. Forest management is shifting towards planting species and species mixes to promote resilient forests. Species suitability for planting is based on resistance to pests, fire, drought, and other stressors. For example, aspen, a short-lived species, can recover quickly from intense fires and could be planted in fire-prone areas. Reforesting with species that are successful under various conditions can enhance success, but caution is needed when planting for climate change. Planting trees beyond their usual range could have unintended consequences due to complex ecosystems. Experimentation and monitoring may be necessary for successful regeneration without harm to ecosystem services. Tree nurseries can provide genetically appropriate planting stock for stress tolerance. Genetic options are available for enhancing stress tolerance in some species, including drought hardiness and pest resistance. Forest Management Certification can promote sustainability and resilience by incentivizing biodiversity and low-impact logging practices. Certification ensures forests are managed according to sustainable principles. Several sustainable forest certification organizations, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), promote principles of sustainable forestry. Low-impact logging practices, encouraged by certification, aim to minimize forest disturbances from harvesting and are relevant for resilience and adaptation in U.S. temperate forests. Practices like designing cutting units to minimize road needs and protect residual stands are common in the United States. Fragmented habitats, with habitat parcels separated by stretches of other habitat, pose challenges for species dispersal. Habitat fragmentation adds to difficulties when ecological habitat shifts outpace natural species migration rates. Climate change may move suitable habitats faster than many species can disperse, making it more difficult for adaptation. Habitat corridors can help eliminate dispersal barriers caused by fragmented habitats. These corridors are continuous landscapes with few barriers that aid species migration. However, in the continental United States, broad habitat corridors are now fragmented due to human land-use developments. Efforts to connect fragmented habitats along migration pathways through land acquisition and management practices are crucial to maintaining connectivity for species dispersal. Designing landscapes to facilitate species spread and managing landscapes at large scales to maximize connectivity are suggested, but may be challenging due to varying restrictions in migration pathways based on topography and other barriers. Habitat corridors are crucial for species migration, but fragmented landscapes in the US hinder connectivity. Efforts to connect habitats through innovative approaches and regulations are needed to prevent species extinction. Without corridors, some animal species may be lost due to restricted dispersal. Managed relocation, also known as assisted migration, is the intentional movement of trees and species to locations with higher predicted success for adaptation to climate change. This strategy is considered high-risk due to the complexity of ecosystem interactions and may require multi-species relocation. Managed relocation, also known as assisted migration, involves moving species to more suitable locations for climate adaptation. It includes various types of relationships like mutualism, symbiosis, and parasitism. Understanding community interactions in new ecosystems is crucial for successful relocation. Experimentation with species introductions across different habitats and monitoring their success is recommended. Accurate projections of habitat shifts are essential for effective managed relocation. Paleo-ecological data and historical species ranges can provide insights into forest responses to climate change and natural species migration. Northern populations of temperate forest types may already be pre-adapted to climate change. Some argue that managed relocation of species for climate adaptation may lead to the introduction of invasive species, causing uncertainties and potential impacts on ecosystems. Ecologists have difficulty predicting invasive species dominance, which can take decades to manifest. Monitoring relocated species may be challenging, costly, and require long-term efforts. Future research should focus on species' thresholds for relocation, prioritization, and best practices. Managed relocation of species for climate adaptation may be a practical approach for landowners with extensive holdings, such as major forest products companies, to ensure timber supplies and key ecosystem services in the long term. Emphasis should be placed on species' thresholds for relocation, prioritization, and best practices to minimize damage to host ecosystems."
