The plan must provide make-whole contributions to a closed class of participants whose defined benefit plan accruals have been reduced or eliminated, meeting specific requirements under section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) when the class was closed. Any plan amendments after the closure date must not alter the closed class or its benefits. The closed class of participants must meet specific requirements under section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) for make-whole contributions, even if a plan amendment causes the plan to no longer meet those requirements. Subsequent application of amendments should be based on the effective date of the plan amendment, not the original closure date of the class.

Additionally, participation requirements for protected participants are outlined, including the cessation of benefit accruals or the provision of future benefits. The Retirement Plan Simplification and Enhancement Act of 2013 allows for plan amendments to be made before the date of enactment without the need for additional changes if certain conditions are met.
