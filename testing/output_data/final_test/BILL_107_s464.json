    "content": "There is no relevant information provided in the curr_chunk to summarize. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow a child tax credit equal to $500 per qualifying child and $3,000 per applicable individual for whom the taxpayer is an eligible caregiver. Additional credit is provided for taxpayers with 3 or more separate credit amounts. If a taxpayer has 3 or more qualifying children or applicable individuals, the credits allowed under subpart C will be increased. Conforming amendments are made to section headings in the Internal Revenue Code. The Family Care Credit is amended in the Internal Revenue Code by striking and inserting new items. Sec. 24 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to define a \"qualifying child\" as an individual under 17 years old who the taxpayer can claim a deduction for and has a specified relationship to the taxpayer. The term 'qualifying child' excludes individuals who would not be dependents under section 152(b)(3) if the first sentence were applied without considering residency. An 'applicable individual' is someone certified by a physician as needing long-term care before the tax return due date. Individuals with long-term care needs must meet specific requirements, including being at least 6 years old. The term 'applicable individual' refers to someone certified by a physician as needing long-term care before the tax return due date. The text chunk discusses the criteria for individuals needing long-term care, including the inability to perform daily activities without assistance or supervision due to cognitive impairment. The criteria for individuals needing long-term care include the inability to engage in age-appropriate activities, loss of functional capacity in eating, transferring, or mobility, and the need for specific medical equipment or skilled practitioners for severe health conditions in children under 2 years old. Taxpayers can be eligible caregivers for themselves, their spouse, individuals they claim a deduction for, or individuals who would qualify for a deduction if certain conditions were met. The tax code allows for adjustments to the exemption amount by including the standard deduction and any additional deductions applicable to the individual. An individual may qualify for certain deductions if specific requirements are met. The tax code includes a residency test for individuals to qualify for certain deductions. An individual must have their principal place of abode at the taxpayer's home and be a member of the taxpayer's household for a specified period to meet the requirements. The tax code has special rules for multiple eligible caregivers for the same individual, where each caregiver must file a declaration to not claim the credit for that individual. The tax code requires individuals to file a written declaration to claim the caregiver credit. If no declaration is filed, the individual with the highest income will be considered the eligible caregiver. For married individuals filing separately, the determination of the eligible caregiver will be made based on specific rules. The tax code now requires taxpayers to include specific identification information for applicable individuals and their certifying physician on their tax return to claim the caregiver credit. Amendments have been made to ensure accurate reporting and assessment. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001."
