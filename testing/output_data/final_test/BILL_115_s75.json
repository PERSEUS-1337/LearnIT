Congress found that during World War II, members of the Armed Forces were exposed to mustard gas and lewisite in a classified program. A fire in 1973 destroyed military personnel files, affecting veterans who were unable to prove their participation in the testing program. The Armed Forces did not fully acknowledge their role in the classified program involving mustard gas and lewisite testing until 1975, 30 years after the testing was completed. The oath of secrecy was lifted in 1991, 46 years after the testing, making it difficult for veterans to prove their exposure. The Department of Veterans Affairs is struggling to adjudicate claims due to incomplete and conflicting information, rejecting around 90 percent of claims. The Department of Veterans Affairs has rejected around 90 percent of claims for benefits related to mustard gas or lewisite exposure. Veterans who participated in the testing were not given the opportunity to provide evidence for disability compensation and should receive special consideration.
