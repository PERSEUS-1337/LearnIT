The District of Columbia appropriations acts consist of special federal payments for specific initiatives, the operating budget, and general provisions approved by Congress. The provisions cover fiscal directives, administrative controls, limitations on lobbying, congressional oversight, and restrictions on social policy. The Obama Administration's proposed budget for FY2010 included $739.1 million in federal payments to the District, with a focus on the courts and criminal justice system. The Obama Administration's proposed budget for FY2010 included $739.1 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a focus on the courts and criminal justice system. This included funding for court operations, Defender Services, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, public defender's office, and education initiatives. The District of Columbia faced a budget shortfall of $603 million in FY2009 and FY2010, with proposals to address the revenue gap. This included $8.9 billion in operating funds, $1.4 billion in enterprise funds, and $631.6 million in capital outlays approved in the FY2010 budget. The District of Columbia faced a budget shortfall of $603 million in FY2009 and FY2010. To address the revenue gap, proposals included reallocation of unspent tax revenues, agency spending reductions, federal stimulus funding, sale of assets, and use of contingency reserve fund. Final action on the FY2010 budget was delayed, with the mayor signing the Budget Request Act on August 26, 2009. The House and Senate considered other components of the appropriations act. The District of Columbia appropriations act includes special federal payments and general provisions. Congress appropriates federal payments to fund District activities and reviews the entire budget, including local funds. The act is now part of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. In 2009, the House subcommittee marked up the bill for FY2010, which included $768.3 million in special federal funding. The House reported out the bill (H.Rept. 111-202) with $768.3 million in special federal payments to the District, exceeding the Administration's request by $29.2 million. The bill included increased funding for court operations and the District of Columbia Public Schools, while reducing school voucher funding. The House approved H.R. 3170 on July 16, 2009, with provisions on budgetary controls and fiscal operations. The House bill included provisions for special federal payments to the District, increased funding for court operations and public schools, and budgetary controls. It also had provisions related to statehood and congressional representation, such as prohibiting the use of federal funds for certain purposes. The House bill proposed changes to controversial provisions sought by city officials, including medical marijuana, needle exchange, and abortion services. Despite objections, the bill was brought to the floor under a restrictive rule. H.R. 3170 recommended lifting the prohibition on using District funds for abortion services and regulating medical marijuana, while also calling for eliminating the prohibition on using funds for needle exchange. The House bill proposed changes to controversial provisions, including lifting the prohibition on using District funds for needle exchange programs within 1,000 feet of certain public facilities. District officials have long sought the removal of these restrictions, viewing them as against home rule. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill recommending $727.4 million in federal payments to the District for FY2010, $40 million less than the previous year. The Senate bill recommended $727.4 million in federal payments to the District, $40 million less than the House recommendation and $12 million less than the Administration's request. It included additional funding for court operations and for District of Columbia Public Schools, as well as provisions similar to those in the House bill regarding budgetary controls and restrictions on federal funds for statehood or voting representation. The Senate bill proposed funding for various purposes in the District of Columbia, including supporting Statehood Representative and Statehood Senator offices, assisting with petition drives for voting representation in Congress, and making changes to provisions related to abortion services and medical marijuana regulation. The Senate bill proposed funding for various purposes in the District of Columbia, including supporting Statehood Representative and Statehood Senator offices, assisting with petition drives for voting representation in Congress, and making changes to provisions related to abortion services and medical marijuana regulation. Congress passed a continuing budget resolution for FY2010, allowing the District of Columbia government to spend locally generated funds at a rate set forth in the approved budget. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010, signed into law as P.L. 111-117, included $752.2 million in special federal payments to the District of Columbia, with increases in funding for court operations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010, P.L. 111-117, provided $752.2 million in special federal payments to the District of Columbia, with increased funding for court operations. It also allocated $20 million for District of Columbia Public Schools and reduced funding for school vouchers by nearly $1 million. The act included provisions prohibiting the use of federal funds for certain purposes related to statehood or congressional representation for the District. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010, P.L. 111-117, included significant changes in controversial provisions related to medical marijuana, needle exchange, and abortion services for citizens of the District of Columbia. It lifted the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services, allowed the use of District funds to regulate medical marijuana, and eliminated the prohibition on funding for needle exchange programs. District officials had long sought the removal of these restrictions, viewing them as against the concept of home rule. Both the President and Congress may propose financial assistance to the District through special federal payments. Congress may propose financial assistance to the District in the form of special federal payments. The Obama Administration requested $739.1 million for FY2010, while the House Appropriations Committee proposed $768.3 million. The Senate recommended $727.4 million. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2010, which included $752.2 million in special federal payments for the District. The District of Columbia received $752.2 million in special federal payments through P.L. 111-117. The District's FY2010 budget faced challenges due to declining revenue projections, leading to a revised budget and the approval of a modified budget to address a $150 million budget gap. The mayor signed the Second Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Request Act of 2009 into law, allowing the city to spend its local funds as outlined. Congress faced key policy issues regarding funding a needle exchange program to address HIV and AIDS among drug abusers, touching on home rule and public health policy debates. The debate over needle exchange programs in the District of Columbia revolves around reducing HIV spread among drug users. Opponents argue that such programs endorse illegal drug use and advocate for drug treatment instead. The issue also involves home rule and the city's ability to implement programs without federal interference. Congress initially prohibited the use of federal and District funds for needle exchange programs in the FY1999 Appropriations Act. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 continued the prohibition on federal and District funds for needle exchange programs, but allowed the use of private funds. The Act initially restricted the location of privately funded needle exchange activities near schools but this provision was removed in the FY2002 Appropriations Act. Prevention Works, a private nonprofit AIDS awareness program, operates a needle exchange program in the District of Columbia. District officials tried to lift the prohibition on using District funds for needle exchange programs in the FY2004 Appropriations Act, but were unsuccessful. The final bill allowed the use of private funds for needle exchange programs and required entities receiving federal or District funds to account for needle exchange funds separately. The Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2008 allowed the use of District funds for a needle exchange program to reduce HIV/AIDS spread among drug users. It was a departure from previous acts that prohibited both District and federal funds for this purpose. The District sought to lift the restriction on local funds for needle exchange programs in FY2010. The FY2010 proposal included language allowing the use of District funds for a needle exchange program, while H.R. 3170 approved by the House allowed the use of both District and federal funds. P.L. 111-117 permits the use of District funds for the program, but not federal funds. The city's medical marijuana initiative is also a contentious issue. The District of Columbia faced controversy over a voter-approved medical marijuana initiative in 1998. Congress tried to prevent the counting of ballots, but a court ruling allowed the city to tally the votes. The court ruling allowed the city to tally the votes from the November 1998 ballot initiative despite Congress's attempts to block it. Congressional actions included provisions in appropriations acts to prevent the implementation of the medical marijuana initiative, leading to legal challenges. The Marijuana Policy Project and the Medical Marijuana Initiative Committee sued in U.S. District Court to put a medical marijuana initiative on the November 2002 ballot. The court ruled that the congressional ban on using public funds for the initiative was unconstitutional, but the decision was later reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the lower court's ruling without comment on September 19, 2002. The Supreme Court later ruled that Congress had the authority to regulate interstate drug marketing, including in states that have decriminalized marijuana for medical use. The President's budget proposal and Senate bill recommended maintaining the ban on federal and District funds for medical marijuana, while the House bill suggested lifting the ban. The House bill, H.R. 3170, recommended lifting the prohibition on using District and federal funds for medical marijuana. P.L. 111-117 removed the prohibition on using District funds for regulating and legalizing medical marijuana. Congress has debated public funding for abortion services for District residents since 1979. In 1989, Congress restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services in cases where the mother's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term. President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush were involved in the decision-making process regarding public funding of abortion services in the District. In 1989, Congress restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services in cases where the mother's life would be endangered if the pregnancy were taken to term. President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush were involved in the decision-making process regarding public funding of abortion services in the District. President Bush signed P.L. 101-168 (103 Stat. 1278) with language prohibiting the use of District revenues for abortion services except in cases where the mother's life was endangered. The District later successfully lobbied for the removal of funding restrictions in the FY1994 act, reinstating rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. However, subsequent appropriations acts limited funding to cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. The Obama Administration proposed revising language in appropriations acts to allow the use of public funds for abortion services in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment, but continued to restrict federal funds for abortions. This included prohibiting federal funds for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or health threats to the woman. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, P.L. 108-199 authorized funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program and the District of Columbia Public Schools. P.L. 111-117 lifts the prohibition on the use of District funds for abortion services, but maintains the restriction on federal funds for such services except in cases of rape, incest, or a threat to the life of the mother. The Opportunity Scholarship program, part of the \"three-prong approach\" for education in the District of Columbia, provided scholarships for students to attend private schools until FY2008. Although no longer authorized, appropriations were provided through FY2009. Appropriations for the Opportunity Scholarship program were provided through FY2009 under the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, P.L. 111-8. Funding for vouchers was specified for students enrolled in the program for the 2009-2010 school year. The Administration's FY2010 budget requested the elimination of funding restrictions for the program and sought appropriations for school improvement in DCPS and public charter schools. H.R. 3288, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010, allocated $42.2 million to DCPS, $20 million to public charter schools, and $13.2 million for other purposes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2010 allocated $42.2 million to DCPS, $20 million to public charter schools, and $13.2 million for Opportunity Scholarships, with eligibility restrictions for students who received scholarships in the 2009-2010 school year."
