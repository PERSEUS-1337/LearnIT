    "content": "The Act titled \"Protect Pregnant Women and Children from Dangerous Lead Exposures Act of 2008\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. Congress finds that lead is a poison that affects every system in the human body, particularly harmful to fetuses and young children. Lead is associated with harmful impacts on the nervous system, reproductive system, cardiovascular system, physical development, kidneys, hearing, and immune system, as well as adverse behavioral impacts in children. Children, especially those in low socioeconomic and minority groups, are at higher risk of lead exposure and health issues. In 2006, over 12.8 million children lived in poverty. The CDC recognized the harmful effects of lead at levels below 10 micrograms per deciliter in 1991. Scientific studies since then have further confirmed these risks. The Administrator acknowledges that studies since 1991 have shown that blood lead levels below 10 micrograms per deciliter can harm human health, especially in children. Approximately 310,000 children aged 1 to 5 in the US have levels above this threshold. Lead-based paint poses a health risk through various exposures like indoor dust and paint chips after renovations. In 1992, Congress passed Public Law 102-550, known as the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act. This law amended the Toxic Substances Control Act to address lead exposure reduction, particularly in pregnant women and children. The Administrator was required to take actions to protect individuals from dangerous lead exposures by a specified deadline. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 required the Administrator to promulgate lead-based paint hazard standards, conduct a study on lead exposure during renovation activities, and revise regulations for renovation and remodeling by specific deadlines. The Administrator promulgated lead-based paint hazard regulations in 2001, setting dangerous levels of lead dust on floors and window sills based on the best available science. The Environmental Protection Agency is open to updating standards based on new data. In 2007, a draft final dust study on lead-contaminated dust hazards was issued. The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee reviewed the study on renovation activities and lead-contaminated dust hazards. The Environmental Protection Agency is considering updating standards for lead-contaminated dust hazards based on new epidemiological data showing children are more susceptible to lead effects than previously thought. Lead dust loading values of 40 mg/ft\\2\\ for floors and 250 mg/ft\\2\\ for window sills are deemed protective against lead poisoning. The Panel notes that recent epidemiology findings suggest adverse health effects in children with blood lead levels less than five (&lt;5) mg/dL, rendering existing surface contamination standards obsolete. Inadequate cleaning procedures fail to meet Environmental Protection Agency standards for post-cleaning lead levels. The Panel criticizes the use of white cloth verification tests for cleaning procedures, stating that they do not provide consistently reliable results. They recommend using more specific analytical measures for lead in house dust instead. The Administrator issued final lead-based paint renovation regulations on March 31, 2008, based on scientific advisors' recommendations for cleaning practices. The scientific advisors of the Administrator have criticized the lead dust loading values as inadequate and obsolete. They also disapprove of the \"white cloth\" method for verifying cleaning practices, calling it inaccurate and simplistic. The revised lead-based paint renovation rule fails to use the best available science on lead's impacts on health, adequately protect pregnant women and children, and enforce safe lead levels post-renovation. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The term \"best available science\" includes recent studies on the health effects of lead, showing that levels below 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood are harmful to children's health. The Administrator must use the best available science to revise the lead-based paint hazard standard by April 30, 2009, to protect pregnant women and children's health. This includes implementing a lead dust cleaning clearance methodology to meet the revised standard. The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee will peer review the analyses. The Environmental Protection Agency peer reviews analyses used by the Administrator to update the lead-based paint hazard standard and require a lead dust cleaning clearance methodology. By April 22, 2010, the Administrator must incorporate the revised standards and required methodology into EPA rules for renovation activities. Periodic reevaluation of the health protectiveness of the rule is mandated. The EPA must periodically review and reevaluate the lead-based paint hazard standard to increase protections for pregnant women and children, at least once every 5 years or more frequently if needed based on scientific findings. SEC. 5. NO EFFECT ON OTHER EFFECTIVE DATES. This Act does not change any effective dates in the EPA's final rule on lead renovation, repair, and repainting program."
