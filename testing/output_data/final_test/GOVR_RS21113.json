Before 1930, Argentina enjoyed political stability, leading to rapid economic growth and making it one of the world's wealthiest countries. However, from 1930 to 1983, the country faced significant political instability, including military coups, military rule, and the rise of Peronism under Juan Peron. Peron's mobilization of the working class had a lasting impact on Argentina's political landscape for the next four decades. Peronism had an enduring effect on Argentina's political system for four decades. Despite Peron's ouster in 1955, the movement survived. After a series of governments, Peron was reelected in 1973 but died a year later. His second wife, Isabel, took over, leading to economic and political chaos. The military intervened in 1976 and ruled until 1983, facing disrepute after the Falklands War. The \"Dirty War\" against leftists occurred during this period. In 1983, Argentina transitioned to civilian democratic rule under Raul Alfonsin, who faced economic turmoil. He was succeeded by Carlos Menem in 1989, who implemented free market reforms, privatized state enterprises, and opened the economy to foreign trade and investment. In 1991, Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo pegged the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar and limited printing to be backed by dollars, controlling inflation but leading to financial turmoil. Menem's shift from protectionist policies to free market reforms was remarkable, but corruption and high unemployment led to his party's defeat in the 1999 elections. Fernando de la Rua won the presidency in 1999. Fernando de la Rua won the presidency in 1999 with a coalition known as the Alliance for Work, Justice, and Education. However, by the end of 2000, doubts arose about the government's ability to bring economic recovery and corruption within the administration. Despite negotiating financial arrangements with the IMF, Argentina failed to meet IMF-imposed conditions, leading to the IMF declining further financial support in December 2001. This resulted in Argentines rapidly withdrawing dollars from banks, prompting the government to limit withdrawals to $1,000 per month. The economic crisis in Argentina led to widespread protests and violence, resulting in President de la Rua resigning in December 2001. Peronist Senator Eduardo Duhalde took over as president on January 1, 2002. President Duhalde, a well-known Peronist leader, faced political and economic challenges upon assuming office in 2002. He successfully stabilized the Argentine economy by abandoning the one-to-one peg of the Argentine currency to the U.S. dollar and implementing measures to protect local industries. Despite initial promises of increasing the state's role in the economy, Duhalde did not pursue a protectionist economic model. The government survived protests against banks and politicians, avoiding the widespread social violence of December 2001. The Duhalde government abandoned the one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar in 2002 and adopted a unified floating exchange rate. Despite facing challenges in securing IMF financing, they were able to secure a seven-month arrangement in 2003. N\u00e9stor Kirchner was inaugurated as president in 2003 after winning the presidential election with 22% of the vote. President Carlos Menem, a center-right Peronist, led the initial round of voting with 24.36% but withdrew from the race when it became clear that N\u00e9stor Kirchner was projected to win with nearly 70% of the vote. Menem advocated for neo-liberal economic policies, while Kirchner promised to continue the current economic strategies and reduce debt and interest rates. Kirchner, seen as a political outsider, aimed to distance himself from past corruption. President Kirchner, a political outsider, attracted independents and restored faith in government through bold policy moves in human rights, institutional reform, and economic policy. He tackled corruption in the federal police force and Supreme Court, purged top military officers, and vowed to prosecute those responsible for human rights violations. Kirchner asked for forgiveness for remaining silent about atrocities during the \"Dirty War.\" President Kirchner strongly supported the overturning of amnesty laws from the 1980s, allowing trials of former military and police officials for human rights violations. Several officials were sentenced, including a former federal police official and the former police commissioner of Buenos Aires. Concerns arose about the disappearance of a key witness, Jorge Julio Lopez, leading to fears of intimidation tactics. Kirchner urged Argentines to remain vigilant to prevent a repeat of the past. The Kirchner government oversaw a strong economic revival in Argentina, with impressive growth rates and successful debt restructuring. Despite macroeconomic improvements, many Argentines still face poverty and living standards challenges. Argentina, under the Kirchner government, grapples with high poverty rates and inflation, forecasted at 11% in 2006. The government's relationship with the IMF has been strained, with a $12.5 billion stand-by agreement reached in 2003 but suspended in 2004 due to pressure on debt negotiations and economic reforms. Argentina chose to repay its $9.5 million debt in January 2006. In January 2006, Argentina repaid its $9.5 million debt to the IMF to gain autonomy on economic policy. Critics argue other uses for the money would have been wiser. President Kirchner remains popular, with strong support shown in the October 2005 legislative elections. Kirchner emerged with a majority in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, asserting his dominance over the Peronist party. The contest asserted Kirchner's dominance over the Peronist party faction led by former President Duhalde. Analysts believe Kirchner would likely win the October 2007 presidential election if he chooses to run. U.S.-Argentine relations have been strong since 1983, with close ties during the Menem presidency. Argentina's contributions to peacekeeping operations worldwide, including in Haiti, have been commended by U.S. officials. Despite being designated as a major non-NATO ally in 1997, there have been occasional irritants in the bilateral relationship, such as the tough U.S. approach during Argentina's political and financial crisis in 2001-2002. In 2003, the United States supported Argentina in negotiations with the IMF. Trade between the two countries saw the US exporting $4.1 billion in goods to Argentina in 2005, while importing $4.6 billion, with concerns over intellectual property rights leading to Argentina being placed on the Special 301 Priority Watch list by the USTR. The tri-border area (TBA) of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay is a concern for U.S. officials due to activities of Hezbollah and Hamas, including arms and drug trafficking, contraband smuggling, and money laundering. While there are worries about fundraising among Muslim communities, there is no confirmed operational presence of Islamic extremist groups in the region. The U.S. has praised Argentina for its efforts in counter-terrorism. In September 2006, a U.S. Treasury Department official warned Argentina of potential financial isolation if it did not criminalize terrorist financing. Congress expressed concern over Argentina's investigation into the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA). Allegations linked Hezbollah to the AMIA bombing and a 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. In September 2004, all 22 Argentine defendants in the 1994 bombing were acquitted. In 1994, 22 Argentine defendants in the bombing were acquitted due to faults in the investigation. Despite this, international arrest warrants for 12 Iranians and one Lebanese official were reconfirmed. Interpol suspended and then cancelled the notices for the Iranians. A new Argentine investigation named a Lebanese militant from Hezbollah as the suicide bomber. In 2006, the House approved a resolution recognizing the threat of Islamist terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere. The House approved a resolution recognizing the threat posed by financiers of Islamist terrorist organizations in the Western Hemisphere and encourages the creation of a special task force to combat their proliferation in the region."
