Alzheimer's disease is a disorder that destroys brain cells, leading to dementia with symptoms like memory loss, disorientation, and personality changes. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the US, affecting an estimated 5.4 million Americans without a known cure or prevention method. Alzheimer's disease affects millions of Americans, with numbers expected to increase significantly by 2050. The disease has devastating effects on individuals, lasting an average of 4 to 8 years after diagnosis. Caregivers also bear a significant emotional, financial, and physical toll, providing billions of hours of unpaid care. Medicare spends billions annually on Alzheimer's-related expenses. In 2011, Medicare is expected to spend $93 billion on care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, projected to increase to $627 billion in 2050. Medicaid costs are expected to rise nearly 400 percent, from $37 billion in 2011 to $178 billion in 2050. Federal Government spent $450 million on Alzheimer's disease research in fiscal year 2010. Research leading to treatments delaying Alzheimer's onset by five years could cut Federal Government spending on the disease by 45 percent in 2050. In 2010, Congress passed the National Alzheimer's Project Act, requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to create the National Alzheimer's Project plan to address the growing crisis of Alzheimer's disease. The plan includes outcome-driven objectives, priority actions, and coordination of federally funded programs in Alzheimer's research, care, and services, with a focus on accelerating the development of treatments to prevent, cure, or slow the progression of the disease. The medical and research communities are equipped with ideas, technology, and the will to find breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease. They need the Federal Government to commit to an innovative research approach to save lives and provide significant returns on investment. The Federal Government is required to commit to Alzheimer's disease research under a new section added to the Public Health Service Act. The new section added to the Public Health Service Act defines Alzheimer's as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Its purpose is to accelerate breakthroughs in treatments, reduce the financial burden on federally funded programs and families. The Director of NIH will coordinate and focus all Alzheimer's research activities to establish a strategic research plan for therapeutic outcomes. The new section added to the Public Health Service Act aims to accelerate breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease research by strategically planning and coordinating research activities across all Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health. It identifies research opportunities, knowledge gaps, and priorities to guide research efforts. The National Institutes of Health are conducting various aging and neuroscience initiatives, including trans-NIH, innovative, and nontraditional projects. They aim to enhance existing Alzheimer's programs by identifying gaps in infrastructure and improving coordination for better research outcomes. The National Institutes of Health are enhancing Alzheimer's research by improving infrastructure and coordination, identifying public-private partnership opportunities for early diagnosis and therapies. The National Alzheimer's Project Act aims to slow, stop, or reverse Alzheimer's, reduce future care costs, improve outcomes for women and minorities at high risk, and incorporate research priorities identified by the Secretary and Advisory Council. The National Alzheimer's Project Act requires budget estimates for Alzheimer's activities by the National Institutes of Health, including research priorities and funds allocation. The National Alzheimer's Project Act mandates the allocation of funds for Alzheimer's research activities, including public-private partnerships to execute the strategic research plan. The National Alzheimer's Project Act mandates funds for research activities to develop diagnostic technologies, data sharing practices, and reporting requirements to track and understand Alzheimer's progression. The Director of NIH is required to submit a report to the Office of Management and Budget and the Committees on Appropriations detailing budget estimates and requests for appropriations for Alzheimer's activities outlined in the strategic research plan. Justifications must be provided for any activities not included in the funding request. The NIH Director must submit a report detailing budget estimates and requests for Alzheimer's activities in the strategic research plan, including justifications for any excluded activities. Amendments are made to the Public Health Service Act regarding Alzheimer's Disease Centers."
