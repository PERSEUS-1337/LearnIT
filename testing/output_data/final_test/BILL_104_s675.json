    "content": "Automation of multiple award schedule contracting. The Administrator of General Services will establish a system for online access to product and service information available for ordering through multiple award schedules. This system will be part of the Federal acquisition computer network and provide details on prices, features, and performance, with regular updates. The system established by the Administrator of General Services will allow online access to product and service information from multiple award schedules. Users can compare prices, features, and performance, place orders, make payments electronically, and archive order data. The system established by the Administrator of General Services will allow online access to product and service information from multiple award schedule contracts, including data on the agency or office placing the order, the vendor receiving the order, the products or services ordered, and the total price of the order. The system implementation deadline is January 1, 1998, with incorporation of additional features as practicable based on the level of FACNET architecture implementation. The FACNET architecture requires certification of 90 percent implementation by the Administrator to Congress. Orders placed through the system may contribute to the Governmentwide FACNET capability. SEC. 2. STREAMLINED PROCEDURES; PILOT PROGRAM. Contracting and Ordering Procedures for the multiple award schedule program require participation from all responsible sources and orders to be placed using a process that results in the lowest overall cost alternative, unless a different alternative offers substantially better value. The Administrator may require electronic ordering for multiple award schedule contracts to provide better value to the Government. Commercial items procurement regulations apply, and a pilot program will test streamlined procedures. The Administrator will establish a pilot program to test streamlined procedures for procurement of products and services through multiple award schedules. The program will focus on negotiation of terms and conditions other than price, vendor pricing flexibility, and awarding contracts to responsible offerors. The schedule contract is awarded to offerors with a suitable record of past performance on Federal Government contracts, agreeing to terms set by the Administrator, and accepting orders electronically. The Comptroller General of the United States will review the pilot program within three years of its establishment. The Comptroller General of the United States will review the pilot program and report to the Senate and House committees on the competition, pricing, paperwork requirements, and impact on small businesses. The Administrator's authority to award contracts under the pilot program for small businesses will expire four years after its establishment unless reauthorized by Congress. Contracts entered into before the expiration will remain in effect according to their terms. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms such as automatic data processing equipment, commercial item, FACNET architecture, and competitive procedures. The term \"procedures\" is defined in section 309(b) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 259(b)."
