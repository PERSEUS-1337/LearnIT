The Commission was established after the Watergate scandal to oversee election disclosure and enforce campaign finance laws. However, the increasing number of cases and financial activities are hindering the Commission's ability to fulfill its watchdog role effectively due to insufficient budget and enforcement powers. The Commission needs sufficient resources and authority from Congress to effectively fulfill its watchdog role in overseeing election disclosure and enforcing campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission requires resources and authority from Congress to oversee election disclosure and enforce campaign finance laws. The Federal Election Commission may require individuals to file electronic designations, statements, and reports if they exceed a certain threshold of contributions or expenditures. The Federal Election Commission may require individuals to file electronic designations, statements, and reports under regulations allowing the use of facsimile machines for verification. SEC. 3. AUDITS BY THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION. The Federal Election Commission may conduct random audits and investigations to ensure compliance with the Act, based on the contributions received by eligible Senate candidates. The Federal Election Commission may conduct random audits and investigations to ensure compliance with the Act, based on contributions received by eligible Senate candidates. An audit or investigation of a candidate's authorized committee is not allowed until the candidate is no longer running for office in an election cycle. This rule does not apply to candidates for President or Vice President subject to audit under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the period during which campaign audits may be initiated has been extended from 6 months to 12 months. The Federal Election Commission has the authority to seek injunctions. The Federal Election Commission can seek civil action for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction if there is a substantial likelihood of a violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act, expeditious action is necessary to prevent irreparable harm, and the public interest would be best served by the issuance of an injunction. The Federal Election Commission can seek civil action in the United States district court for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Amendments have been made to specify the districts where actions can be brought. SEC. 5 amends the penalty for knowing and willful violations under the Federal Election Campaign Act to a minimum of $15,000 or 300 percent. SEC. 6 introduces civil penalties for minor reporting violations. Section 309(a)(4)(A) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include provisions for minor reporting violations. The Commission will establish a definition for minor reporting violations and may assess civil penalties without following certain procedures. The Commission will establish a schedule of civil penalties for minor reporting violations, considering factors like the impact on election campaigns and the violator's compliance record. Penalties will not exceed $5,000 or the amount of the violation. The Commission may bring a civil action in court for payment of a civil penalty, and a person can also bring a civil action to review the penalty. If the Commission chooses to proceed against a person for a minor reporting violation, they cannot seek enforcement for that violation. The Commission cannot seek enforcement for a minor reporting violation under any other provision of the Act or other law. SEC. 7. Senate election reports now filed with the Federal Election Commission instead of the Secretary of the Senate. Section 302 of the Federal Election Campaign Act is amended to specify that all required filings shall be submitted to the Commission. Section 304 is also amended to involve the Commission and Secretary of State in certain filings. Section 311 is amended to remove reference to the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations is addressed in Section 8. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended by repealing section 314 and adding a new section 407 for authorization of appropriations.
