    "content": "The SEC's increased use of its in-house administrative forum to resolve charges against those violating federal securities laws is drawing attention. Congressional hearings and legal cases are challenging the SEC's authority in using the forum. This report will explore the administrative law process, reasons for the SEC's increased use of the forum, selected cases challenging its use, and potential implications. Congressional interest in the issue is also noted. Administrative agencies issue rules to implement legislation, which have the force of law. They interpret federal statutes, giving them discretion in rule-making. Agencies must have statutory authority for this discretion. The Securities Exchange Act grants discretionary authority to the SEC. Statutes like the Administrative Procedure Act outline the rule-making process. When challenging an agency's action in court, one must exhaust administrative remedies first, such as hearings and decisions by ALJs. ALJs are judges within agencies who preside over trials and adjudicate claims. The SEC has authority to seek civil money penalties under the Penny Stock Act, but its authority is limited in administrative actions. The Penny Stock Act limited the SEC's authority in administrative actions, but Dodd-Frank expanded it by allowing the SEC to impose civil money penalties on almost any person involved with securities. This provision gives the SEC the choice to proceed in federal court or conduct its own administrative enforcement proceedings. Dodd-Frank expanded the SEC's authority to conduct administrative enforcement proceedings against individuals charged with securities violations, incentivizing the agency to choose administrative actions over court proceedings. While administrative hearings offer advantages such as expedited procedures and expertise in federal securities laws, there are concerns about fairness and impartiality, with critics arguing that defendants face significant disadvantages in this process. The SEC's use of administrative proceedings allows for expedited decisions by an administrative law judge within 270 days of filing a complaint, with no discovery or right to a jury trial. Factual findings can only be reversed on appeal if they fail to meet the \"substantial evidence\" test. The SEC sees benefits in using this forum, including prompt decisions, specialized factfinders, and consideration of relevant evidence by ALJs. The SEC's use of administrative proceedings allows for expedited decisions by an administrative law judge within 270 days of filing a complaint, with no discovery or right to a jury trial. ALJs should consider relevant evidence, and the relaxed rules of evidence may give flexibility in offering evidence. Challenges to the SEC's use of the administrative forum are based on violations of due process, equal protection rights, and the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The SEC intends to continue using the administrative forum aggressively despite these challenges. The SEC aggressively uses administrative proceedings to charge securities wrongdoers and appeal court opinions. Plaintiffs accused the SEC of violating constitutional rights in a case against George Jarkesy and others for defrauding investors. Charges included violations of securities laws and the Investment Advisers Act. The co-respondents settled with the SEC for aiding breaches of fiduciary duties to hedge funds. Jarkesy sued the SEC for violating constitutional rights, but the district court dismissed the complaint citing lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court dismissed Jarkesy's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, stating that challenges to SEC orders must be brought in the U.S. Court of Appeals, even if constitutional due process claims are raised. This is in line with the Thunder Basin case, where relief in district court was allowed only for claims outside the agency's expertise. Jarkesy's complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, requiring him to exhaust administrative remedies before challenging in federal court. The D.C. Circuit referenced the Thunder Basin case for guidance on the procedure for statutory scheme review. The D.C. Circuit found that if a litigant's claims fall within the statutory scheme and Congress intended for them to be reviewed within that structure, then the statutory process is the only way to seek administrative and judicial review. Congress provided a detailed process for court review in federal court of appeals for SEC proceedings, but also allowed the SEC to pursue violations in district court. The SEC has the option to pursue violations in district court, but Congress did not enable respondents in administrative proceedings to challenge those proceedings in court. The D.C. Circuit looked at situations where Congress intended for claims to be reviewed within the statutory structure. The D.C. Circuit found no basis in the Jarkesy case for allowing district court review per any of the three Free Enterprise criteria. Jarkesy's constitutional claims can be challenged in a federal court of appeals if the SEC's final order finds him at fault. The majority of Jarkesy's challenges are within the SEC's \"ordinary course of business\" and not outside its areas of expertise. The federal securities laws provide an exclusive avenue for review, and Jarkesy cannot bypass this by filing suit in federal court. The D.C. Circuit found no basis for district court review in the Jarkesy case. Jarkesy cannot bypass the exclusive avenue for review by filing suit in federal court. The SEC filed an administrative case against Wing F. Chau and Harding Advisory for fraud related to securities selection. The plaintiffs argued that the SEC violated their due process by bringing the case before an administrative law judge instead of federal court. The plaintiffs filed suit to enjoin the SEC from proceeding with its administrative action, but the court ruled that the SEC had the authority to decide the case in the administrative forum. The court acknowledged concerns about the growth of administrative adjudication, especially in securities regulation. Article III courts, particularly in securities regulation, face concerns about their interpretive role. The court's decision in this case is limited to determining its power to hear constitutional claims, not the allocation of interpretive functions between the Commission and the courts. Policy matters are left to the legislative and executive branches. Plaintiff Laurie Bebo, former CEO of Assisted Living Concepts, Inc., sued the SEC in 2015 for bringing an unconstitutional action against her in an administrative forum. The SEC alleged that Bebo listed nonexistent occupants at senior residences to meet occupancy requirements and avoid defaulting on leases, defrauding shareholders. Bebo claimed the SEC's administrative charges violated her constitutional rights. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin held that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Bebo's claims, stating that she must litigate her claims before the SEC and then, if necessary, on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, emphasizing the requirement for plaintiffs to use the administrative review schemes established by Congress before challenging agency decisions in court. The Seventh Circuit found no evidence that Congress intended for plaintiffs like Bebo to stop ongoing administrative enforcement proceedings by challenging the constitutionality of the enabling legislation or the SEC's authority. The court considered two Supreme Court decisions, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and Elgin v. Department of the Treasury, in deciding Bebo's constitutional challenges to the SEC's administrative forum. The Seventh Circuit ruled that Bebo's constitutional challenge to the SEC's administrative forum was governed by the Elgin case. The court declined Bebo's petition for rehearing en banc, and the Supreme Court denied certiorari in Bebo's suit. In contrast, Hill v. SEC allowed a constitutional challenge to proceed, halting an SEC enforcement proceeding. In February 2015, the SEC brought an administrative proceeding against Charles Hill, a real estate developer, for insider trading. Hill sued the SEC, arguing that the selection of ALJs violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause. He claimed that the SEC's in-house court is unconstitutional because ALJs are appointed by the SEC's Office of Administrative Law Judges, not by department heads. The district court halted the SEC's administrative proceeding against Charles Hill, citing concerns about the constitutionality of ALJ appointments. The court addressed jurisdictional arguments and found no congressional basis for dismissing the case. The district court found no congressional intent to restrict its jurisdiction in Charles Hill's lawsuit, stating that the statute provides a choice of forum and does not indicate exclusivity. The court emphasized that Congress must express its own intent within the statute's language. The court found jurisdiction in Hill's lawsuit and identified three reasons supporting its conclusion: preclusion of meaningful judicial review, collateral nature of the suit, and claims outside agency expertise. The court highlighted the harm of delaying judicial review until completion of an unconstitutional administrative process. The district court found that the plaintiff's claims are wholly collateral to the SEC proceeding and not just a \"vehicle\" to shut it down. The plaintiff is challenging the SEC's constitutional authority to make decisions, not the decisions themselves. The administrative proceeding and SEC's conduct are irrelevant to the lawsuit seeking to invalidate the statutory scheme. The district court found that the plaintiff's constitutional claims against the SEC were outside the agency's expertise. The plaintiff's claims under Article II of the Constitution challenged the appointment and tenure protection of the SEC's ALJs. The district court found that the SEC ALJ's tenure protection violated the Constitution's separation of powers. The court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue to determine if the ALJ is an \"inferior officer\" under the Appointments Clause. The Court rejected the government's argument that the judges lacked real authority, emphasizing the significance of their duties and discretion. The office of special trial judge is established by law with specified duties, salary, and means of appointment. Special trial judges differ from special masters in that they perform more than ministerial tasks, exercise significant discretion, and have the power to enforce compliance with orders. SEC ALJs are similar to special trial judges in terms of their established office, duties, and appointment process. The district court found that SEC ALJs, like special trial judges, exercise significant authority and are inferior officers who must be appointed by the President, department heads, or courts of law. The court ruled that the appointment of the ALJ in the Hill proceeding was likely unconstitutional, leading to a preliminary injunction to halt the administrative proceeding. The court did not address the ALJs' statutory tenure protections. The district court found SEC ALJs exercise significant authority and must be appointed by the President, department heads, or courts. The court ruled the ALJ appointment in the Hill case likely unconstitutional, leading to a preliminary injunction halting the proceeding. The court did not address the ALJs' statutory tenure protections. The SEC appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. This decision also stopped an SEC administrative proceeding against Barbara Duka, a former managing director at Standard & Poor's, accused of fraud in S&P's ratings of mortgage-backed securities. Duka sued the SEC in federal court to halt the administrative proceedings, claiming the ALJs' selection was unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause. The court found that SEC ALJs were not appropriately appointed and their tenure protections violated Article II's executive powers. The court preliminarily enjoined the SEC from proceeding against Duka, citing jurisdiction and potential harm. The court found that SEC ALJs were not properly appointed, violating the President's constitutional authority. The SEC declined to change the appointment process, leading to a denial of their request to delay enforcement in the case against Duka. The SEC has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The SEC alleged that Lynn Tilton and Patriarch Partners fraudulently collected $200 million in fees by hiding poor company performances. Tilton challenged the SEC's authority in court but was denied a preliminary injunction. The court denied Lynn Tilton's motion for a preliminary injunction against the SEC, stating that jurisdiction over the claims was not excluded by Congress. The court found the arguments against jurisdiction more persuasive and did not make a decision on the SEC's authority to bring an action in an administrative proceeding. The SEC's administrative forum is used based on due process and equal protection. Congress has defined the roles of the Commission and the courts in such cases. The Commission decides whether to proceed in federal court or its own tribunal. The decision can be appealed to a federal court of appeals. The court lacks jurisdiction over the action, and Tilton has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The SEC's administrative proceeding was stayed to allow more time for Tilton's claim of unconstitutionality. Timbervest and its executives were ordered to pay $1.9 million in disgorgement for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. They argued that the appointment of SEC ALJs was unconstitutional. The SEC commissioners unanimously stated that the hiring of ALJs is constitutional. Timbervest petitioned the D.C. Circuit for review of the SEC's decision. The case differs as the plaintiffs waited for a final decision before challenging it in court. The D.C. Circuit has not yet decided whether to accept the appeal of the SEC's final order. Previous cases challenging the constitutionality of the SEC's administrative forum have resulted in mixed outcomes, with some validating the forum and others halting its use. Cases like Jarkesy, Chau, and Bebo have focused on due process and equal protection challenges. The Jarkesy, Chau, and Bebo cases required plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before challenging the SEC's final action in federal court. The cases focused on statutory procedural schemes rather than the merits of constitutional challenges. In contrast, the Hill and Duka cases allowed lawsuits in federal district court regarding the unconstitutionality of SEC ALJ appointments. The Tilton decision criticized the reasoning in Hill. The Tilton decision criticized the reasoning in Hill and held that the plaintiff's argument on the unconstitutionality of ALJ selection could not be brought to court until the SEC reached finality in the administrative proceeding. Timbervest differs from other cases as the plaintiff waited for a final administrative decision before challenging the SEC's administrative forum in a federal court of appeals. The D.C. Circuit has yet to decide on accepting the appeal of the SEC's final order. Bebo and Jarkesy are the only cases decided by federal courts of appeals, while others are on appeal to federal courts. The SEC's administrative forum is facing challenges on multiple fronts, including due process and equal protection issues, as well as concerns about the selection and tenure protection of SEC ALJs. Different circuit courts may have varying opinions on these issues, potentially leading to a Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the SEC administrative forum. This decision could have broader implications for administrative forums in other agencies. Challenges to the SEC's administrative forum based on due process and equal protection have had mixed results. If successful, these challenges could impact other federal agencies. The appointment of ALJs in agencies other than the SEC may be called into question if SEC ALJs are deemed inferior officers. The appointment of ALJs in federal agencies other than the SEC may be improper if they have not been appointed by department heads, as argued in Hill and Duka. This could lead to a constitutional Appointments Clause problem, as seen in the Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue case. If courts follow this reasoning, all ALJs may need to be appointed by department heads, which is not currently the case. The appointment of ALJs in federal agencies other than the SEC may be improper if not appointed by department heads, as argued in Hill and Duka. The status of ALJs as inferior officers who must be appointed by the department head is uncertain, as seen in Landry v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Justice Breyer's dissent in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board raised concerns about the potential impact of the decision on the job security and constitutional status of hundreds of high-level government officials, including ALJs. He highlighted that the Federal Government relies on 1,584 ALJs across 25 agencies to adjudicate administrative matters. ALJs adjudicate Social Security benefits, employment disputes, and other important matters. Losing parties may appeal based on the decision's constitutionality. Potential ramifications of a definitive decision on SEC ALJ appointments and tenure protections are discussed. Congressional hearings have addressed the issue. Two congressional hearings have discussed the issue of SEC administrative proceedings. H.R. 3798, the \"Due Process Restoration Act of 2015,\" would allow a defendant to terminate the proceeding and require the SEC to show clear and convincing evidence of a violation. The Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises of the House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing on the oversight of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. Representative Garrett expressed concerns about constitutional protections for individuals charged with securities violations in SEC administrative forums. He emphasized the importance of an evenhanded and non-political enforcement function that preserves due-process rights. To lower costs and increase efficiency, it is important to realize that benefits come with a cost. SEC administrative proceedings lack due-process protections for defendants, operating on a condensed timeframe without full discovery rights, jury trial, or exclusion of hearsay evidence. Appeals of ALJ rulings must be made to the full Commission, with significant deference given to the SEC's interpretation of security laws. Appealing an administrative decision is time-consuming and expensive. The SEC's 100% success rate in administrative proceedings from 2014 raises concerns about a predetermined outcome. Director Andrew Ceresney defended the use of administrative hearings to protect investors, citing various factors considered for appropriateness. This lack of due process goes against the principles of fair play and fairness in a country that values appropriate due process for its citizens. The SEC uses administrative proceedings for cases like failures to supervise and quick relief for investors. These proceedings are quicker than district court actions, with decisions made within 300 days. ALJs handle complex rules better than juries."
