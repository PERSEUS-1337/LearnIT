    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research and Awareness Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease. Both diseases present symptoms such as severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, joint pain, inflammation of the eye, and rectal bleeding. Ulcerative colitis can potentially be cured by complete removal of the colon. Inflammatory bowel disease causes joint pain, eye inflammation, and rectal bleeding. It affects up to 1.4 million people in the US, with 30% diagnosed in childhood. Children with the disease miss school due to symptoms, and adults may experience delayed puberty and growth issues. Patients are at high risk for colorectal cancer, and annual medical costs exceed $2 billion. The average time from symptom presentation to diagnosis in children with inflammatory bowel disease is 3 years, leading to more severe disease and complications. Congress allocated $3,480,000 for epidemiology research on the disease from 2005 to 2009. The National Institutes of Health issued research goals on inflammatory bowel disease in 2009. The National Commission on Digestive Diseases provided recommendations for research on digestive diseases. The National Commission on Digestive Diseases recommended research on digestive diseases, leading to the amendment of the Public Health Service Act to include an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Secretary will conduct epidemiology research on inflammatory bowel disease in both pediatric and adult populations, award grants for research development, and authorize appropriations of $1,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014. Increasing public awareness of inflammatory bowel disease and improving health professional education is addressed in Section 320C. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities to raise awareness of inflammatory bowel disease among the public and healthcare providers. Grant funds will be used for educational materials and programs on Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diagnosis testing, differences between pediatric and adult disease, physical and psychosocial issues in pediatric patients, and treatment options. The curr_chunk discusses treatment options, identifying aggressive disease in children early, complications of inflammatory bowel disease, federal and private information resources, and incidence data on pediatric and adult inflammatory bowel disease. The term \"eligible entity\" is defined as a patient or medical organization with experience in serving adults and children with inflammatory bowel disease. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2010. The Secretary must report to Congress on activities under this section and authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. Expansion of biomedical research on inflammatory bowel disease. Expansion of biomedical research on inflammatory bowel disease. Congress believes that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should support research goals for inflammatory bowel disease as outlined in the National Institutes of Health National Commission on Digestive Diseases report. This includes promoting basic, translational, and clinical research to improve diagnosis and disease understanding. The goals for research on inflammatory bowel disease include improving diagnosis and disease understanding through various approaches such as genetic susceptibility evaluation, modulating intestinal microflora, and promoting mucosal health and repair. Effective tools for clinical evaluation and intervention are also essential. The Institute should support training of health professionals in biomedical research focused on inflammatory bowel disease, including pediatric investigators, and collaborate with medical and patient organizations to promote research identified in scientific agendas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services includes information on the status of inflammatory bowel disease research at the National Institutes of Health in biennial reports submitted under the Public Health Service Act."
