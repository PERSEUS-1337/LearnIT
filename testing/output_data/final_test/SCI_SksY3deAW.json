    "content": "We introduce a new technique called BoostResNet for multiclass boosting in ResNet architectures. The training algorithm is suitable for non-differentiable architectures and only requires sequential training of \"shallow ResNets\". The training error decreases exponentially with depth T under a weak learning condition. A generalization error bound based on margin theory suggests that ResNet may resist overfitting with l_1 norm bounded weights. Deep neural networks, like ResNets and highway networks, have shown breakthrough successes in image classification and object recognition. As the number of layers increases, the network becomes more powerful in deriving features from input data. Despite their representational power, deep neural networks are challenging to train effectively. Normalization techniques have been proposed to address the challenge of vanishing or exploding gradients in training deep networks. However, a surprising degradation in training performance is observed in deep networks compared to shallow networks, even when constructed similarly. Residual networks (ResNets) have been introduced to alleviate this issue. The ResNet learning framework introduces identity loops to ease training of deep networks, showing improved optimization compared to non-residual networks. A new architecture with a gating mechanism enables optimization of networks with arbitrary depth. The proposed multi-channel telescoping sum boosting framework aims to provide a theoretical justification for the observed optimization benefits of deep residual networks. BoostResNet is a new framework that characterizes a feed forward ResNet as a layer-by-layer boosting method. It introduces a learning algorithm guaranteed to reduce error exponentially with depth, adaptively selecting training samples or changing the cost function. BoostResNet has lower computational complexity for training than end-to-end back propagation and provides advice to avoid overfitting. BoostResNet is a new framework that reduces computational complexity for training compared to end-to-end back propagation. It shows substantial performance improvements and accuracy under the MLP-ResNet architecture, with faster convergence observed under CNN-ResNet. Our approach distinguishes between classes and channels in multiclass learning, using a multi-channel telescoping sum boosting framework that can be applied to various nonlinear hypothesis units. Training deep neural networks faces optimization challenges due to the non-convex loss function, which can be addressed by selecting appropriate loss functions and network architectures. The authors propose a boosting framework for deep neural networks, focusing on ensembles of classifiers rather than boosting the accuracy of the entire network. Previous studies have explored different approaches to neural networks and boosting, such as single hidden layer convex neural networks and gradient boosting algorithms. Residual networks have been shown to address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths in very deep networks. BoostResNet is a new training algorithm for ResNet that focuses on boosting representations over multiple channels, resulting in a less \"bushy\" architecture compared to AdaNet.

The output of a ResNet is obtained through a linear classifier on the representation, with the goal of improving the performance of the weak learning algorithm. BoostResNet is a new algorithm for ResNet that aims to improve the performance of weak learning algorithms by combining many weak classifiers into a single strong classifier. It addresses the issue of training error degradation in deeper neural networks and explores the use of identity loops in training. The algorithm avoids end-to-end back-propagation through the network, making it immune to the instability of SGD for non-convex optimization in deep neural networks. BoostResNet introduces an auxiliary linear classifier on top of each residual block to construct a hypothesis module, similar to boosting. This module is defined in the binary classification setting, where only f t and w t+1 need to be trained given g t (x). The input of the t + 1-th residual block is the output of the t-th block, resulting in o t (x) = t\u22121. BoostResNet introduces an auxiliary linear classifier on top of each residual block to construct a hypothesis module, similar to boosting. The weak module classifier is defined using the idea of a telescoping sum, where the T-th residual block of a ResNet outputs g T +1 (x). An ensemble of weak module classifiers is equivalent to a ResNet's final output. BoostResNet introduces an auxiliary linear classifier on top of each residual block to construct a hypothesis module, similar to boosting. The ensemble of weak module classifiers is a new framework that allows for sequential training of ResNet, with a telescoping sum boosting framework analyzed in Section 4. The analysis applies to both binary and multiclass, focusing on binary class simplicity in the main text. The proposed learning algorithm in the main text focuses on the exponential decay of training error with the number of weak module classifiers T. The algorithm involves bounded hypothesis modules and a weak learning condition to improve performance incrementally. The weak learning condition ensures that each hypothesis module consistently outperforms the previous one. The weak learning condition in the hypothesis module aims for incremental improvement, requiring each module to perform slightly better than the previous one. This condition is motivated by learning theory and is met in practice. The proposed training algorithm for telescoping sum boosting under binary-class classification introduces BoostResNet, a module-by-module procedure for deep ResNet training. It involves sequential training of shallow ResNets and combining them with auxiliary linear classifiers to form hypothesis modules. BoostResNet is a module-by-module procedure for deep ResNet training, involving sequential training of shallow ResNets with auxiliary linear classifiers to form hypothesis modules. The telescoping sum construction is key for interpreting ResNet as ensembles of weak module classifiers, with the innovative introduction of auxiliary linear classifiers for multi-channel representation boosting. This approach differs from traditional classifier boosting, as it focuses on boosting multi-channel representations rather than classifiers. BoostResNet is a module-by-module procedure for deep ResNet training, involving sequential training of shallow ResNets with auxiliary linear classifiers to form hypothesis modules. The telescoping sum construction is key for interpreting ResNet as ensembles of weak module classifiers. The training error of Algorithms 1 and 2 decays exponentially with the ResNet depth even when each hypothesis module performs slightly better than its previous one. The algorithm guarantees exponential decay of training error with the number of modules T. The implementation of the oracle in Algorithm 2 corresponds to finding weights for the t-th nonlinear module of the residual network. Various methods can be used to implement Equation (6), such as tensor decomposition or back-propagation. The final neural network model does not include auxiliary classifiers and follows a standard ResNet structure. BoostResNet training is memory efficient and requires less training time than e2eBP in deep networks due to reduced communication overhead and speed-up in gradient forwarding and back-propagation. Memory consumption and computation cost are lower in BoostResNet compared to e2eBP. In this section, the generalization error under Algorithm 1 is analyzed to understand overfitting possibility. The ResNet classifier F(x) is considered, with a margin defined as yF(x). The MLP-ResNet with n channels is assumed to have weight vectors bounded by \u039b. A linear classifier w is restricted to l1 norm bounded classifiers. Corollary 4.3 suggests that stronger weak module classifiers with higher accuracy and larger edges will suffer less from overfitting. BoostResNet algorithm is compared with e2eBP training on benchmark datasets like MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10 using different architectures. Both algorithms have the same architecture and are initialized with the same seed. Standard boosting of convolutional modules is also experimented as a baseline. The BoostResNet algorithm is tested on the MNIST dataset, comparing its performance with the e2eBP baseline. Results show that BoostResNet alleviates gradient instability issues and outperforms e2eBP in terms of training error, despite the ResNet's identity loop. BoostResNet is tested on the BID27 dataset, containing over 600,000 training images and 20,000 test images. A 50-layer, 25-residual-block CNN-ResNet is used with BoostResNet and e2eBP. BoostResNet converges faster with fewer gradient updates than e2eBP, while maintaining comparable test accuracy. The CIFAR-10 dataset, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, is also used for evaluation. BoostResNet training on CIFAR-10 dataset shows faster convergence to optimal solution compared to e2eBP. However, test accuracy of BoostResNet is slightly lower than e2eBP. Weak learning condition is checked and representations learned by BoostResNet improve with depth for classification task. BoostResNet algorithm achieves exponentially decaying training error under weak learning condition. BoostResNet is computationally efficient and requires less memory compared to end-to-end back-propagation in deep ResNet. The learning framework is suitable for non-differentiable data and can utilize weak learning oracles using tensor decomposition techniques. The goal is to extend this framework to non-differentiable data using general weak learning oracles. There are various works on modifying loss functions to address gradient issues in neural networks. Some studies explore adding skip connections in MLP or CNN models, but lack theoretical guarantees. Identity loops have shown benefits in linear neural networks, although this setting is not practical. Improvements in backpropagation include momentum, Nesterov accelerated gradient, Adagrad, and Adadelta. Our method only requires an arbitrary oracle to solve a simple shallow neural network. The algorithm involves input-output modules and weak learning modules. The weighted summation over all modules forms a telescoping sum. The training error is measured using a 0-1 loss in the analysis. The training error is bounded by a 0-1 loss and exponential loss. Each learning module is bounded, leading to consistent learning of ResNet. Rademacher complexity is used to measure complexity. The Rademacher complexity technique measures the complexity of a family of functions based on fitting datasets using classifiers. It is defined on a sample of points in a space, and is related to hypothesis sets and their decompositions. The Rademacher complexity of two hypothesis sets with respect to data points from a distribution are also discussed. The Rademacher complexity of ResNet is equivalent to the Rademacher complexity of the family of functions each neuron belongs to. The output layer of each module is connected to the output layer of the previous module in ResNet. The maximum infinity norm over samples and the product of l1 norm bound on weights are defined. The empirical Rademacher complexity is bounded according to lemma 2 of BID4. The empirical Rademacher complexity is bounded as a function of r \u221e , \u039b t and n according to lemma 2 of BID4. With probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4, for all f t \u2208 F t , the proof for Theorem E shows that the weak module classifier is defined differently for multi-class classification compared to binary classification. The weak learning condition requires prediction better than random on any distribution over the training set. The weak learning condition for multi-class classification involves introducing a cost matrix to characterize training error and using exponential loss to bound the error. A novel learning algorithm is proposed for training ResNet under multi-class classification, utilizing the optimal edge-over-random cost function. The weak module classifier must satisfy the \u03b3-weak learning condition for each iteration in the algorithm. The BoostResNet algorithm implements an oracle to minimize the loss function for training a multi-class ResNet module. It aims to minimize the difference between the current state and hypothesis module, updating the weak learner and loss fraction accordingly. The algorithm selects the optimal \u03b1 value to minimize the accumulated weak learner, ensuring convergence. BoostResNet algorithm aims to minimize the loss function for training a multi-class ResNet module by selecting the optimal \u03b1 value. Despite the presence of identity loops in ResNet, e2eBP training shows error degradation due to susceptibility to spurious local optima. BoostResNet's sequential training procedure alleviates gradient instability issues and performs well as depth increases. Additionally, experiments with standard boosting (AdaBoost) serve as another baseline for comparison. BoostResNet algorithm utilizes standard boosting (AdaBoost) for training ResNet modules, achieving 93.8% test accuracy on SVHN dataset. Compared to e2eBP, BoostResNet trains faster and achieves the same accuracy with refined training. Hyperparameters for BoostResNet training include a learning rate of 0.004.
