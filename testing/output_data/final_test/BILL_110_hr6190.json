    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iraqi Police Service Improvement Act of 2008\". Congress found in 2004 that responsibility for organizing Iraqi security forces was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Defense. The Jones Commission was established in 2007 to assess Iraq's military and police readiness and reported progress by the Iraqi Army. The Jones Commission found that the Iraqi Police Service is incapable of providing sufficient security to protect neighborhoods from insurgents and sectarian violence. They also noted that the training effort for the Iraqi Police Service has been led by U.S. military officers, which has marginalized civilian police advisors and limited overall effectiveness. The Jones Commission recommended transferring leadership of the Coalition Police Assistance Training Team to senior civilian law enforcement professionals due to insufficient civilian international police advisors for training the Iraqi Police Service. The Department of Defense's report highlighted the need for continued advisory support, training, and equipping of the Ministry of Interior and its forces to assume missions from Coalition forces. Embedded advisors focus on addressing logistics and leadership shortcomings. The Department of Defense reports on the challenges in logistics, leadership, and budget execution that hinder progress in Iraq. Funding constraints limit coverage of police stations, with only 5 provinces having sufficient support. Iraq's 18 provinces have sufficient Police Transition Teams (PTTs) to improve police readiness and sustain progress in community policing. The Department of Defense's September 2007 Quarterly Report mentioned 238 PTTs for the Iraqi Police Service, each team consisting of 12-15 members, including civilian Department of State contractors and military personnel. Transition Teams are embedded in various military and defense entities. The Department of Defense has transferred $1.5 billion to the Department of State for training Iraqi Security Forces. This includes International Police Liaison Officers serving as advisors to mentor Iraqi Police. Several witnesses in the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives highlighted the lack of civilian police advisors for Iraqi Police units and the inadequate policing background of military advisors supporting community-policing efforts. The Department of State is responsible for police transition teams for the Iraqi Police Service. The Secretary of State will take over responsibility for Police Training Teams in Iraq from the Department of Defense, including advisory support, training, and equipment for the Iraqi Police Service. A statement of understanding on command structure will be submitted to Congress by both the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of State will ensure the composition of the teams. The Secretary of State will ensure that Police Training Teams in Iraq are composed of civilian advisors, with a majority from the Department of State or contracted employees. Each team must have at least two police officers or retirees, with the team leader also being from the Department of State or a contractor. Members of the US Armed Forces and other government agencies may support the team. The Secretary of State will take over responsibility for Police Training Teams in Iraq, with funds from the Department of Defense being transferred to the Department of State for advisory support, training, and equipment for the Iraqi Police Service. Appropriations are authorized for staffing the teams, and members of the Armed Forces may still serve on the teams. The Secretary of Defense will provide equipment from the Department of Defense for Police Training Teams at the request of the Secretary of State. The Armed Forces will also continue to provide security for the teams, similar to reconstruction teams in Iraq. SEC. 4. STUDIES REQUIRED. The Secretary of State, in consultation with Iraq and Coalition forces, must conduct a study on staffing civilian advisors for Police Training Teams in Iraq. The report should include recommendations on the number of advisors needed, availability of personnel, contractors, and funding required. Additionally, an update to the 2005 interagency IG assessment must be submitted to Congress by the Secretaries of Defense and State within 90 days. The interagency Department of Defense-Department of State Inspector General conducted an assessment of Iraqi Police Training. SEC. 5. REPORTS ON POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. The President must report to Congress every 180 days on the implementation of the Act, including the status of Police Training Teams, equipment levels of the Iraqi Police Service, number of civilian police advisors, recruitment issues, and effectiveness indicators. The President must report to Congress every 180 days on the implementation of the Act, including the status of Police Training Teams, equipment levels of the Iraqi Police Service, number of civilian police advisors, recruitment issues, effectiveness indicators, and impact of transferring recruiting responsibility to the Government of Iraq in 2007."
