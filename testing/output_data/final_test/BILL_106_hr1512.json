Statistics show that ignorance and carelessness are major causes of firearms accidents, with many incidents involving people not following basic safety rules. Practicing and enforcing firearms safety rules is crucial to reducing the number of firearms accidents. The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 1999\" defines a locking device as a mechanism on a firearm that prevents discharge without the proper key or combination. This aims to reduce unintentional deaths related to firearms among children by promoting firearm safety. The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 1999\" mandates that licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers provide a locking device and warning with each handgun sold to prevent accidental discharge. The packaging of handguns includes a warning to store them unloaded and locked away from children to avoid legal consequences. Exceptions to this rule apply to specific entities like the government. The text discusses amendments to Section 924 of title 18, United States Code, regarding civil penalties related to locking devices and warnings for firearms. The amendments specify penalties for entities such as law enforcement officers and rail police officers for not complying with firearm storage regulations.
