The Congress finds that expanded access to credit has led to high homeownership rates, but some lenders engage in predatory practices, making it costly for vulnerable families. Borrowers with fair credit can get prime loans with low rates, while those with poor credit get subprime loans with higher rates and fees. Predatory lending involves unjustifiably high interest rates, excessive fees, and other unreasonable terms, particularly targeting minority neighborhoods and cash-poor homeowners. This practice strips away wealth accumulated over decades or a lifetime, victimizing communities lacking access to traditional financial institutions. The joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Treasury Department, issued in 2000, called for legislation to curb predatory home mortgage lending by restricting abusive terms, improving consumer disclosures, and prohibiting harmful sales practices in mortgage markets. The joint report in 2000 recommended a four-point plan to address predatory lending practices, including improving consumer literacy and disclosures, prohibiting harmful sales practices in the mortgage market. The 2000 joint report recommended measures to address predatory lending practices, including new requirements for mortgage brokers, restrictions on high-cost loan terms, and improvements to market structure. The report recommended improving market structure by awarding credit under the Community Reinvestment Act to lenders promoting borrowers from subprime to prime mortgages, denying credit for violating lending laws, disclosing high-cost loans in mortgage-backed securities, and disclosing such loans in offering documents. A study found a concentration of subprime lending in minority neighborhoods and to borrowers of color. Government agencies are addressing predatory lending in minority neighborhoods and to borrowers of color at all income levels. The issue involves high-pressure sales tactics, misleading information about interest rates, and threatens the work of nonprofit organizations. More assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans, consumer education, and referrals to appropriate agencies for help.
