    "content": "Afghanistan's governing structure historically lacked a strong central government, leading to reliance on local faction leaders by ethnic and rural communities. There has been a struggle between urban modernizers and rural traditionalists. The Taliban government opposed modernization, but significant changes have occurred since their ousting, potentially aiding stability post-international involvement. Afghanistan had few Western-style democratic institutions prior to international intervention. Afghanistan lacked Western-style democratic institutions before international intervention post-9/11. King Zahir Shah was a constitutional monarch under the 1964 constitution, but parliament had limited power. The parliament was suspended after the 1978 Communist takeover. The 2004 constitution was part of a post-Taliban transition roadmap established in the Bonn Agreement. After the fall of the Taliban, a civil society of educated Afghans emerged, focusing on various issues like women's rights, media freedoms, and economics. Despite efforts to empower these groups to strengthen Afghan democracy, they have not significantly influenced the informal power structures at all levels. Local power structures in Afghanistan have been weakened over the years by war and Taliban rule. Traditional authority figures have been displaced by various groups, leading to accusations of corruption and selective application of Afghan law. Despite some areas modernizing politically and economically, traditional affiliations based on family, clan, tribe, and region still hold significant influence. Candidates in post-Taliban Afghan elections often rely on traditional clan and familial relationships for support. While ethnic-based violence has decreased, occasional clashes stem from historical disputes. All ethnic groups are represented in the government, with each having control over programs in their regions. There is an informal agreement not to appoint governors of different ethnicities than the majority in provinces. Ethnic Pashtuns, the largest single ethnicity in Afghanistan, historically assert a \"right to rule\" due to their majority population of 42%-45%. Pashtuns speak Pashtu and Dari, with a strong sentiment of leadership among the Durrani tribal confederation. Former President Karzai is a Durrani. The Ghilzai and Durrani Pashtuns dominate Afghan politics, with former President Karzai being a Durrani Pashtun. The Taliban, mostly Pashtuns, opposes the government for not enforcing strict Islamic law. Tajiks, the second-largest group, are powerful and speak Dari. Ahmad Shah Masoud, a prominent mujahedin commander, and the Jamiat Islami political party led by Burhanuddin Rabbani were key figures in Afghan politics. Masoud prevented Soviet occupation forces from conquering the Panjshir Valley and was later killed by Al Qaeda supporters. Rabbani served as president of the mujahedin government and briefly led again in 2001. Tajiks, the second-largest group in Afghanistan, played a significant role in the non-Pashtun dominated \"Northern Alliance\". Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, a key political leader of the Northern Alliance, is identified as Tajik due to his heritage. He emerged as Afghanistan's opposition leader after an unsuccessful presidential run in 2009, gaining prominence in the 2014 elections. Abdullah advocates for a parliamentary system with a powerful prime minister selected by the National Assembly to check the presidency. He aims to transition his current role as \"Chief Executive Officer\" into a Prime Ministership in 2016. In 2016, a change was formally made in accordance with the power-sharing arrangement reached with Ashraf Ghani in 2014. Prominent Tajiks like Muhammad Fahim and Bismillah Khan Mohammedi served in key positions during Karzai's term. Yunus Qanooni and Ahmad Zia Masoud have had disagreements with Dr. Abdullah. The Hazara Shiite minority has made advancements since 2001. The Hazara Shiite minority (about 10% of the population) has advanced economically and politically since 2001, with many pursuing higher education and entrepreneurship. They are becoming dominant in higher paying sectors of the Afghan economy, although slightly underrepresented in the ANSF officer corps. Prominent Hazaras include Mohammad Mohaqiq, Karim Khalili, Ramazan Bashardost, and others. The Hazara Shiite minority in Afghanistan has made significant advancements since 2001, with key figures like Ramazan Bashardost and Sima Simar. Tensions exist between Hazaras and other ethnic groups, such as the Tajiks, with conflicts arising from historical resentments. The Uzbek community in Afghanistan, comprising about 10% of the population, is Sunni Muslim and speaks a language similar to Turkish. Abdul Rashid Dostam, a prominent Uzbek leader, played a significant role in Afghan history. Many Uzbeks embraced Soviet ideology and benefited from Soviet infrastructure. Ethnic and religious minorities in Afghanistan face discrimination and attacks, with Isma'ilis being prominent in northeastern provinces. The Isma'ilis, a Shiite Muslim sect known as \"Seveners,\" make up about 5% of Afghanistan's population. Many Ismailis follow Agha Khan IV, who heads the Agha Khan Foundation investing in Afghanistan. There are also Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Bahai communities in the country. The formal Afghan governing institutions are expanding, but they still compete with traditional power structures. The ouster of the Pashtun clerics loyal to Mullah Mohammad Umar in late 2001 allowed for the formation of a new Afghan government with the help of the United Nations as a mediator. The UN's involvement was seen as credible due to its past role in ending the Soviet occupation. Various UN-mediated proposals for a government selection process, such as the loya jirga, were considered, while non-UN initiatives like the \"Six Plus Two\" group made little progress. After the ouster of the Pashtun clerics loyal to Mullah Mohammad Umar in late 2001, the United Nations played a central role in mediating the formation of a new Afghan government. This included the establishment of the \"Six Plus Two\" multilateral contact group and the signing of the \"Bonn Agreement\" in December 2001, which authorized an international peacekeeping force. The Bonn Agreement in December 2001 authorized an international peacekeeping force in Kabul, with Northern Alliance forces withdrawing from the capital. Security Council Resolution 1386 gave formal authorization for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and emphasized cooperation on counter narcotics, crime, and terrorism. A constitutional loya jirga in June 2002 and a subsequent constitutional commission drafted a constitution unveiled in November 2003. The constitutional loya jirga (CLJ) from December 13, 2003, to January 4, 2004, chaired by Sibghatullah Mojadeddi, approved a draft constitution establishing a presidential system with broad presidential powers and a separately elected National Assembly. The Northern Alliance failed to establish a system where the parliament would select a prime minister, but achieved some limitations on presidential powers by assigning major authorities to the parliament. This was likely done to balance power between Pashtuns and Tajiks. The president in Afghanistan serves a five-year term with a two-term limit and has broad powers, including the ability to appoint high-ranking officials. The election system favors a Pashtun president, while the prime minister post typically goes to a Tajik by informal agreement. The president in Afghanistan has broad powers, including appointing high-ranking officials. The Ghani-Abdullah Agreement modified presidential powers by delegating some to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Abdullah. The constitution made former King Zahir Shah honorary \"Father of the Nation.\" The CEO of the government, Abdullah, will share responsibilities with Ghani for cabinet appointments and chair ministerial meetings. Ghani's advisors are mostly Pashtuns, with Abdul Salam Rahimi as chief of staff. Rahimi, former deputy finance minister and head of media group Saba, was part of the National Security advisory staff in the presidential palace complex. Atmar, a Pashtun, was appointed national security adviser by Ghani. The bilateral security agreement (BSA) with the US was signed by Atmar on behalf of the Afghan government. Ghani-Abdullah power-sharing may lead to Tajiks receiving high-level posts in the organization. The Office of Administrative Affairs (OAA), also known as the General Administrative Office (GAO), is headed by Sadiq Mudabir and plays a role in policymaking by assisting in drafting laws, advising the president on legislation, and assessing the legitimacy of petitions. It has a history from the Communist era and currently has around 700 staff members. The Office of Administrative Affairs (OAA), previously with around 700 staff members, was further reduced during President Ghani's term due to overlap with his presidential office. The National Assembly consists of a 259-seat lower house and a 102-seat upper house, with appointments made by the president, provincial councils, and district councils. Half of the president's appointments to the upper house are required to be women. The National Assembly in Afghanistan includes a 259-seat lower house and a 102-seat upper house, with appointments made by the president, provincial councils, and district councils. Half of the president's appointments to the upper house are mandated to be women. Formal elections for the 407 district councils have not been held yet due to difficulties in confirming voter registration and determining district boundaries. The Meshrano Jirga has two-thirds of its members selected by provincial councils until district councils are elected. The lower house must have at least 28% female representation, with an average of 2 women per province. The National Assembly serves as a key institution for non-Pashtun ethnic groups and political independents to oppose or influence the president. The National Assembly in Afghanistan consists of a lower house and an upper house with the power to vote no-confidence against ministers. The national budget is first reviewed by the Meshrano Jirga and then passed to the Wolesi Jirga. The National Assembly is supported by a secretariat with oversight committees and has been assisted by the USAID program for legislative reform and budgeting. The National Assembly in Afghanistan has asserted institutional strength by reviewing presidential decrees, requiring individual approval of cabinet members, and making changes to the Supreme Court. This was demonstrated through the confirmation process of cabinet nominees and the removal of key ministers in 2010 and 2012. In August 2012, the National Assembly voted out Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and Interior Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammedi for corruption. In January 2013, 11 ministers were summoned for low budget execution. In mid-May 2013, Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal was questioned for accusing parliamentarians of smuggling goods. In July 2013, Interior Minister Ghulam Mujtaba Patang faced a no-confidence vote for security lapses. Karzai appointed Umar Daudzai as Interior Minister in August 2013. During 2014, the National Assembly passed several laws including commercial contracts, money laundering, value-added-tax, mining, and \"access to information.\" Pashtun members of the lower house supported Karzai and are likely to also support Ghani. Tajiks in the Assembly are likely to support CEO Abdullah, potentially causing polarization. Some Pashtun parliamentarians follow Abd-i-Rab Rasul Sayyaf or are from Karzai's home province of Qandahar. The upper house of the National Assembly in Afghanistan is likely to support any president, with close allies consistently chairing the body. Composed of elderly, traditionalist Afghans, the upper house tends to be more Islamist conservative than the lower house, advocating for Islamic law and restrictions on media broadcasts. During his presidency, Karzai used his appointments to the upper house to co-opt potential antagonists or reward friends, including key allies like Sher Mohammad Akhunzadeh. In 2011, after parliamentary elections, Karzai reappointed incumbents and appointed new members, including 17 women. It is uncertain if Ghani will follow Karzai's appointment patterns post-2015 elections. The Afghan constitution mandates an independent judiciary led by a nine-member Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in Afghanistan appoints judges at provincial and district levels. Members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the National Assembly. Some judges serve for 10, 7, or 4-year terms. In 2012, 181 judges, including many women, were sworn in. International donors support the expansion of the Afghan judicial system, with U.S. funding providing training and mentoring for justice officials. U.S. funding supports training and mentoring for Afghan justice officials, expands efforts on judicial security, legal aid, gender justice, and awareness. USAID's \"Rule of Law Stabilization Program\" has trained over 700 Afghan judges. The Afghan judicial system is weak, with judges and prosecutors being frequent targets of assassination. Justice is often subjective, with powerful factions influencing outcomes. NATO's rule of law support in Afghanistan ended in 2013. The Afghan government has not met many benchmarks for judicial reform, including enacting a criminal procedure code as required by the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework. The Supreme Court has clashed with the Independent Commission for the Supervision of the Implementation of the Constitution on constitutional interpretation. The Ministry of Justice in Afghanistan finalized a draft criminal procedure code in January 2014, incorporating laws on counter-terrorism, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering. The National Assembly approved the draft, and President Karzai signed it into law in February 2014. The judiciary collaborates with the Attorney General's Office, led by Mohammad Ishaq Aloko since 2010. The government aims to align informal justice sector strategy with the National Justice Sector Strategy. The Afghan government increased legal aid services with 31 offices and 101 lawyers by 2014. USAID provided funding for property registration and land administration. The Tokyo Framework aimed to address land appropriation issues. The Tokyo Framework committed Afghanistan to depoliticize the judiciary and ensure the rule of law, but lack of progress led to EU aid being withheld. Insecurity and lack of trust in the formal justice system result in 80% of cases being decided in the informal justice sector, where traditional dispute resolution practices like Pashtunwali are prevalent. The informal justice system in Afghanistan, known as Pashtunwali, includes traditional forms of apology and compensation for wrongs. It consists of shuras, jirgas, and Islamic courts, with some experts believing the latter could provide stability post-2014. However, the sector is criticized for being male-dominated, with practices like offering young girls for marriage to resolve disputes. Some shuras even take place in Taliban-controlled areas. The informal justice system in Afghanistan, known as baad, includes shuras that sometimes occur in Taliban-controlled areas. U.S. officials are concerned about Taliban-run shuras due to their extreme interpretations of Islamic law. There is a debate on the international community's involvement in the informal justice sector, with USAID implementing programs to connect formal and informal justice systems. The informal justice system in Afghanistan, including local shuras, is being supported to transmit judicial rulings to the district government. International involvement in this sector is expected to decrease as donor countries reduce efforts in Afghanistan. An informal power structure, led by faction leaders with armed forces, is gaining influence as international forces withdraw. Karzai worked with this power structure during his presidency. Karzai worked amicably with faction leaders who hold both official positions and informal influence in Afghanistan. This engagement has led to resentment among civil society activists due to allegations of nepotism and corruption. It remains to be seen if Ghani will continue this approach, with his first vice president being a prominent faction leader, Abdul Rashid Dostam. The Afghan government worked with faction leaders, including Abdul Rashid Dostam, leading to concerns about nepotism and corruption. Local security programs created new militias outside central control. Parliament passed a law granting amnesty to faction leaders for past abuses. The Afghan government amended a law in December 2009, giving victims the right to seek redress for abuses. The informal power structure uses traditional decision-making processes like shuras and jirgas, which some see as competing with the post-Taliban formal power structure. The Afghan government utilizes traditional mechanisms like loya jirgas for decision-making, with a constitutional loya jirga being the highest authority. These assemblies have been used to endorse leadership, adopt a constitution, and discuss important issues. The Afghan government uses loya jirgas for decision-making, with the highest authority being a constitutional loya jirga. Special loya jirgas were held in 2010, 2011, and 2013 to discuss peace incentives, a Strategic Partnership Agreement with the US, and a Bilateral Security Agreement. Vice President Muhammad Fahim, a key figure in bridging relationships, passed away in 2014. Vice President Muhammad Fahim, a Tajik from the Panjshir Valley region, faced criticism for his involvement in narcotics trafficking and property confiscations. He also reportedly withheld heavy weapons from U.N. disarmament officials. His passing in 2014 left the Northern Alliance without a clear leader for a potential revival of their militia. Abdul Rashid Dostam, a prominent Uzbek figure and First Vice President, is known for his past involvement with the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. Despite accusations of human rights abuses, he is recognized for his support of Western-style values and lack of emphasis on Islam. In 2005, Karzai appointed him as chief military adviser to reduce his influence in the north. Abdul Rashid Dostam, the First Vice President, has a history of feuds and altercations with other Afghan figures. He was appointed as chief military adviser by Karzai in 2005, and his support was crucial for Karzai's victory in the 2009 election. Dostam's large following helped attract Uzbek votes to Ghani's candidacy as well. He has been a rival of Balkh Province Governor Atta Mohammad Noor, and has faced legal issues, including a prosecution for allegedly influencing the hiring of his loyalists by a Chinese oil company in northern Afghanistan. Abdul Rashid Dostam, the First Vice President, has a history of feuds and altercations with other Afghan figures. He faced legal issues for allegedly influencing the hiring of his loyalists by a Chinese oil company in northern Afghanistan. Dostam's reputation is further clouded by alleged past war crimes, including the death of Taliban prisoners during the major combat phase of OEF. President Obama called for investigations into allegations of violations of laws of war. Abdul Rashid Dostam, the First Vice President, faced legal issues for allegedly influencing the hiring of his loyalists by a Chinese oil company in northern Afghanistan. Dostam's reputation is clouded by alleged past war crimes, including the Dasht-e-Laili massacre. Dostam responded to allegations of Taliban prisoner deaths by stating they were primarily due to combat and disease. Atta Mohammad Noor, the governor of Balkh Province, endorsed Dr. Abdullah in the 2009 presidential election and threatened to use his militia followers to help Abdullah seize power in 2014. Noor has kept Balkh Province secure, allowing Mazar-e-Sharif to become a major trading hub. Atta Mohammad Noor, the governor of Balkh Province, is criticized for brokering local security and business arrangements that benefit him and his allies. He commands private militias that outnumber official Afghan police in some districts, leading to complaints of abuses against Pashtuns. Another faction leader, Mohammad Mohaqiq, was a commander of Hazara fighters during the war against the Soviet Union and Taliban. Mohammad Mohaqiq, a key figure in the Hazara Shiite Islamist party Hezb-e-Wahdat, was targeted in an assassination attempt in 2013. He accused Karzai of firing the head of the Academy of Sciences for overstating Pashtun population in Afghanistan. Mohaqiq supported Dr. Abdullah in the 2014 presidential election and alleged systematic fraud by Ghani. Ismail Khan, another Northern Alliance leader, played a role in killing Soviet advisors in 1979. Ismail Khan, a key figure in western Afghanistan, played a significant role in the mujahedin uprising against the Soviet invasion. Despite being captured by the Taliban in 1995, he escaped and remains influential in the region. Khan, a religious conservative, has limited women's rights in Herat province and has been involved in Afghan politics, including supporting Karzai in elections. He has served as minister of energy and water since 2006. Ismail Khan, a key figure in western Afghanistan, has been influential in the region since the mujahedin uprising against the Soviet invasion. He has served as minister of energy and water since 2006 and has limited women's rights in Herat province. Khan also served on the High Peace Council overseeing reconciliation with Taliban leaders. In November 2012, concerns arose about his role as a faction leader and his efforts to rally followers in preparation for potential conflict with the Taliban. Khan has reportedly begun enlisting new recruits for a militia force, which was criticized by Karzai's office as contrary to government policy. Sher Mohammad Akhunzadeh, a Pashtun tribal leader in southern Afghanistan, was appointed governor of Helmand province by Karzai in 2001. He controlled loyalists who helped secure the province but engaged in illicit activities, leading to Britain's demand for his removal in 2005. Akhunzadeh supported Karzai's reelection in 2009 and influenced the removal of Helmand governor Ghulab Mangal in 2012. In 2012, Karzai removed Helmand governor Ghulab Mangal despite U.S. praise for him. The Karzai clan's influence in Qandahar province remains strong, overshadowing governors like Tooryalai Wesa. Despite losses, the clan's power endures, with Ahmad Wali Karzai's assassination in 2011 highlighting their significance. The Karzai clan's influence in Qandahar province remains strong, with key members like Ahmad Wali Karzai and Heshmat Karzai being assassinated. Shah Wali Karzai has risen in influence since 2012, while Hamid Karzai retains power in the region despite leaving office. In Qandahar province, power centers include former president Karzai and police chief Colonel Abdul Razziq, known for corruption. Ghul Agha Shirzai, a Pashtun from the Barakzai clan, resigned as governor of Nangarhar to prepare for a presidential run. In Nangarhar, Shirzai was seen as an effective leader in the 2014 presidential election but faced accusations of corruption and misuse of funds. He was questioned in Germany for carrying cash but denied any wrongdoing. Allegations suggest he intervened in the judicial process for Taliban suspects. The fall of the Taliban and international intervention has led to the rise of new centers of influence in Afghan politics, with civil society activists and independents playing a significant role. These activists dominate organizations like the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and advocate for transparent government through media outlets and independent newspapers. Civil society activists in Afghanistan, such as Malalai Joya and Fawzia Koofi, advocate for transparent government and women's rights. They face challenges from traditional faction leaders who use armed supporters to intimidate critics. Other prominent women activists include Fauzia Gailani and Shukria Barekzai. Several key figures in Afghanistan's political landscape include Fauzia Gailani, Shukria Barekzai, Palwasha Hassan, Ramazan Bashardost, and Ahmad Nadery. They have been involved in advocating for parliamentary powers, highlighting official corruption, and promoting fair elections. These individuals play a crucial role in shaping Afghanistan's political development and navigating factional, political, ethnic, and sectarian rivalries. The 2009 and 2010 elections in post-Taliban Afghanistan were marred by flaws, leading to international efforts to improve the process in the 2014 elections. Despite initial improvements, the 2014 elections still faced challenges such as ethnic and political disputes and accusations of fraud, resulting in another election-related crisis. Political parties have not been a prominent feature in post-Taliban Afghanistan, with historical ties to ethnicities and factional commanders. Since the fall of the Taliban, political parties in post-Taliban Afghanistan have struggled to become the main organizing institution for political participation. Despite the establishment of 110 parties by 2009, most were small and focused on specific personalities or ethnicities rather than clear ideological platforms. Ethnic-based parties avoid portraying themselves as such due to constitutional restrictions. A 2009 law mandated parties to re-register with 10,000 signatures from at least 22 provinces, limiting their growth. The registration rules for political parties in post-Taliban Afghanistan have evolved, with a 2012 regulation requiring parties to have offices in at least 20 provinces to register. Despite this, the Single, Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV) system hinders the development of idea-based parties. Karzai and Ghani have not formed parties, but many of Karzai's aides and supporters come from the moderate faction of Hizb-e-Islami. The Hizb-e-Islami party, led by Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal, is the only formally registered mujahedin party in Afghanistan. The militant wing, Hizb-e-Islami Gulbuddin (HIG), is loyal to Gulbuddin Hikmatyar. Abdullah has distanced himself from Jamiat Islami since 2004 and formed several parties to broaden his appeal. Some Tajik rivals have formed separate parties or joined multi-ethnic parties for government accountability. The Rights and Justice Party is a prominent secular, pan-ethnic party. The Rights and Justice Party, led by Mohammad Hanif Atmar, was formed in 2011 for government accountability. The Coalition for Reform and Development was established in 2012 to ensure fair elections in 2014. The first post-Taliban presidential election took place in 2004, with Hamid Karzai winning with 55.4% of the vote. Karzai ruled by decree in 2005 before the National Assembly was established. Ahmad Shah Masoud, former Northern Alliance military commander, served as first vice president during Karzai's first term. Elections for the National Assembly and provincial councils were held in September 2005, with varying numbers of representatives per province. The National Assembly was inaugurated on December 19, 2005. The 2009 presidential election faced credibility issues with the Independent Election Commission (IEC) being politically close to Karzai, while the Elections Complaints Commission (ECC) had more credibility due to foreign nationals holding seats. The 2009 election law allowed for three ECC seats to be held by foreign nationals appointed by UNAMA. The election date was set for August 20, 2009, with registration adding 4.5 million new voters. There were reports of registration fraud. A total of 32 candidates entered the race, with 3,200 people competing for 420 provincial council seats. About 200 women competed for the 124 provincial council seats reserved for women. In the 2009 Afghan elections, there were fewer women candidates than reserved seats in Qandahar and Uruzgan. In Kabul Province, 524 candidates competed for 29 council seats. Security concerns were prominent, with some polling centers deemed too unsafe to open. The total cost of the elections was around $300 million, with the US contributing $175 million. Anti-Karzai Pashtuns did not unite behind Ashraf Ghani, while the Northern Alliance supported Dr. Abdullah. Taliban intimidation and voter apathy were significant issues. The 2009 Afghan elections saw low voter turnout due to Taliban intimidation and voter apathy. Female turnout was also low due to a lack of female poll workers. Widespread fraud allegations clouded the election, with Karzai receiving 54.6% of the vote and Dr. Abdullah receiving 27.7%. The ECC found about 1 million Karzai votes and 200,000 Abdullah votes to be fraudulent, leading to a runoff between Karzai and Abdullah. In the 2009 Afghan elections, Karzai won with 54.6% of the vote, leading to a runoff against Dr. Abdullah who refused to participate due to unresolved issues. The Obama Administration accepted the outcome after fraud investigations. Karzai's vice presidential running mate was Marshal Muhammad Fahim, who was later replaced by Yunus Qanooni after Fahim's death in 2014. The 2009 presidential elections in Afghanistan led to a split over the election conduct, which affected the 2010 parliamentary elections. Mechanisms to prevent fraud were not fully implemented, leading to disputed results until July 2011. Donor countries provided $50 million of the $120 million budget for the parliamentary elections, giving them leverage over the election timeline. Donors withheld funds to pressure the Independent Election Commission (IEC) to address flaws from the 2009 election. Karzai signed an election decree in February 2010, superseding the 2005 election law for the 2010 parliamentary election. In March 2010, Karzai compromised with international critics and allowed the seating of two non-Afghans on the ECC. The Wolesi Jirga voted against the election decree but the Meshrano Jirga did not act, thus allowing the decree to stand. The Afghan Interior Ministry instituted a national identity card system to curb voter registration fraud, but observers noted that registration fraud still occurred. Karzai appointed a new IEC head, Fazel Ahmed Manawi, who was praised for impartiality. The IEC also barred 6,000 poll workers from the 2009 election from working in the 2010 election. The final list of candidates for the 2010 election included 2,577 candidates, with 406 women. Voter registration took place from June 12 to August 12, with over 375,000 new voters registered. About 5.6 million votes were cast out of 17 million eligible voters, with a turnout of 33%. Security concerns led to the closure of 938 insecure polling stations. The 2010 election results were delayed due to fraud complaints, with 1.3 million votes invalidated. Controversy arose as 60% of lower house winners were new members, leading to a political crisis. President Karzai's support in the lower house decreased, and the new parliament was set to be inaugurated on January 20, 2011. The certified election results led to a political crisis as Pashtun candidates claimed fraud. A special tribunal was formed to review complaints, despite objections from the IEC and ECC. Inauguration of the new parliament was postponed, but Karzai eventually inaugurated it on January 26, 2011. Abdul Raouf Ibrahimi was elected as speaker of the lower house. The upper house was completed on February 19, 2011, with Karzai making 34 appointments. A crisis arose on June 23, 2011, when a special tribunal ruled to reinstate 62 defeated candidates. Karzai decreed on August 10, 2011, that the special court cannot change election results. The IEC implemented a compromise on August 21, 2011, removing nine winners for fraud. The newly declared winners were sworn in on September 4, 2011, and the National Assembly resumed functioning. Fraud in previous elections strained relations between Karzai and the National Assembly during the confirmation of his post-2009 election cabinet. Karzai's ministerial nominees faced scrutiny for their qualifications and loyalty. Concerns over election fraud in the 2014 presidential elections were raised by the international community. The focus was on ensuring transparency, credibility, and inclusivity in the electoral process. The 2014 Afghan presidential election process received $200 million in support from USAID, with concerns raised about fraud during the June 14 runoff. The election date was set for April 5, 2014, despite calls for a later date. The Afghan presidential election process in 2014 received $200 million in support from USAID, with concerns about fraud during the June 14 runoff. The election date was set for April 5, 2014, despite calls for a later date to allow for support in the northern part of the country to thaw after winter. Provincial elections were scheduled concurrently with the presidential elections in 2013 due to logistical difficulties and costs. The next parliamentary elections are expected in 2015, following the \"Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework\" in 2012. The IEC set a deadline for candidate registration from September 16 to October 6, 2013, which was observed. The deadline for candidate registration was observed for the 2014 Afghan presidential election. Two election laws were to be adopted in early 2013 but faced delays. President Karzai vetoed a draft law that included provisions for the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) and insisted on an all-Afghan ECC. The laws eventually passed and were signed in July 2013. Karzai signed the Electoral Law and Structural Law in July 2013. A committee nominated IEC and ECC candidates, with Karzai appointing commissioners including Yusuf Nuristani as IEC chairman. The ECC, with Sattar Saadat as chairman, has the power to investigate abuses of power. The IEC investigates abuses of power and vets candidates, with assistance from UNDP under the ELECT II program. Voter registration updating took place from late May 2013 to late March 2014, issuing new voter registration cards to 3.4 million registrants. The government planned to issue 14 million biometric ID cards by March 2014 to reduce voter fraud, but this system was deemed too difficult and expensive for the 2014 vote. It may be implemented for the 2015 parliamentary elections. The government promoted public awareness of the election by setting up a call center that received 700,000 calls. Presidential candidates had to gather 100,000 voter signatures and pay an $18,000 deposit. The IEC secured 6,800 polling centers for the election, more than in previous years. 200 international observers were present on election day, with most deployed in Kabul and provincial capitals. A Taliban attack in Kabul killed one foreign national involved in the election observation process. The election observation process was disrupted by attacks in Kabul, including against IEC offices. Afghan domestic observation groups deployed 12,000 observers. Election laws reduced the required percentage of women to be elected to provincial and district councils. Efforts were made to improve female participation in voter registration. Efforts to support female voter turnout in Afghanistan included funding for female election security officers and measures to encourage women's participation in the electoral process. Despite security concerns in some districts, there was optimism that the election would be more credible than previous ones. The \"Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan\" mobilized political parties to endorse election reform demands and oversee the election process. Several political parties in Afghanistan formed a \"Cooperation Council of Political Parties and Coalitions\" to ensure fair elections. A delegation expressed optimism for the upcoming elections in April 2014. 26 presidential tickets registered for the election, with 16 candidates disqualified by the IEC. The final candidate list was announced on November 20. The final candidate list for the Afghan election was announced on November 20 by the IEC. The Taliban threatened to disrupt the election, but HIG leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar urged his members to vote. 2,713 candidates, including 308 women, were approved to run for 420 provincial council seats. The formal campaign period started on February 5, 2014. Several major presidential tickets, aiming for ethnic balance, were approved. Three candidates withdrew before the election, including Karzai's brother and former Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak. All major candidates pledged to sign the Bilateral Security Accord with the US if elected. The final candidate list for the Afghan election was announced on November 20 by the IEC. Candidates pledged to sign the Bilateral Security Accord with the US if elected. Ashraf Ghani appealed to a wide range of Pashtuns in 2014, with running mate Abdul Rashid Dostam delivering Uzbek votes. Dr. Abdullah campaigned in Northern Alliance strongholds and Pashtun provinces, emphasizing his Pashtun heritage. Abdullah, with Pashtun heritage on his father's side, had supporters mainly in the north and west. His vice presidential running mates included Mohammad Khan, a Pashtun, and Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara faction leader. Opinion polls consistently showed him as a front runner, while Foreign Minister Rassoul trailed behind Ghani and Abdullah in polls. Rassoul attempted to win Northern Alliance votes by naming Ahmad Zia Masoud as his first vice presidential candidate. An ethnic Hazara candidate, Abdi Rab Rasul Sayyaf, raised concerns due to past ties to radical Islamist groups. Other approved candidates included Nangarhar governor Ghul Agha Shirzai, Daoud Sultanzoi, Karzai adviser Hedayat Amin Arsala, and Qotboddin Helal. Turnout for the April 5, 2014, first round was over 7 million with a 60% turnout rate. After the April 5, 2014, first round of elections in Afghanistan, there were 870 fraud complaints investigated, resulting in about 375,000 votes being deducted across candidates. The certified results on May 15, 2014, showed Dr. Abdullah leading with 44.9% of the votes. The certified results of the first round of elections in Afghanistan showed Dr. Abdullah leading with 44.9% of the votes. A runoff between Abdullah and Ghani was announced by the IEC to be held on June 14. Violence increased in the runoff with about 50 people killed, and turnout was similar to the first round with about 7 million votes cast. The IEC initially stated that certified results would be ready by July 22. The IEC initially planned to have certified election results by July 22, with a new president sworn in on August 2. However, concerns arose as informal results showed Dr. Abdullah behind, leading to allegations of fraud favoring Ghani. Abdullah released taped phone conversations implicating IEC officials in helping Ghani, causing him to break off relations with the IEC and call on the U.N. Abdullah broke off relations with the IEC and called on UNAMA to be directly involved in the vote count. There were demonstrations by Abdullah supporters against the vote count process. Ghani was shown to be winning with 56.44% to Abdullah's 43.56%, leading to calls for Abdullah to declare victory. Armed factions supporting Abdullah seized government centers in three provinces and threatened to storm locations in Kabul. President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry intervened to broker a resolution. On July 12, Secretary Kerry, Abdullah, and Ghani announced an agreement for a recount of all 23,000 ballot boxes by Afghan election officials. The winner would ask the losing candidate to become the \"chief executive officer\" of the government, evolving into a prime ministership for power-sharing among major communities. The recount process faced interruptions over disagreements on vote invalidation criteria and distrust of officials. It was completed by the end of August, with results withheld for post-election power-sharing negotiations. In mid-September 2014, Abdullah and Ghani camps bridged differences over a post-election power-sharing arrangement. Ghani was declared the election winner by about 800,000 votes. On September 21, 2014, Ghani and Abdullah signed a power-sharing agreement. Ghani became President on September 29, appointing Abdullah as \"CEO.\" Afghanistan and the United States signed the Bilateral Security Agreement the following day. The agreement delegated some presidential powers to Abdullah as CEO. The power-sharing agreement between Ghani and Abdullah in 2014 delegated some presidential powers to Abdullah as CEO, who would lead weekly meetings of a \"Council of Ministers\" to implement strategic direction given by the cabinet led by the President. However, disagreements over appointments delayed the formation of a new 25-minister cabinet. The loya jirga will consider a constitutional amendment to change the CEO position to Prime Minister. District elections must be held to achieve a quorum. Ghani and Abdullah's partnership has faced challenges, but not collapsed. Ghani is focusing on asserting his constitutional role, fighting corruption, promoting women, and seeking ways to settle the conflict with the Taliban. He emphasizes punctuality and efficient meetings. Dr. Abdullah has struggled to assert his authority and define his role since taking office. Observers note his weak advisory team and focus on past election fraud. Ghani and Abdullah agreed to jointly nominate cabinet members, delaying the process until January 12, 2015. The nomination process for key appointments in Afghanistan was delayed until January 12, 2015, causing confusion in governance. Among the appointments, Sher Mohammad Karimi was nominated as Minister of Defense and Nur-ul-Haq Ulumi as Interior Minister. Both are Pashtuns, a departure from previous practices. Rehmatullah Nabil was retained as head of Afghan intelligence. Rehmatullah Nabil was kept on as head of Afghan intelligence by Ghani. Qamaruddin Shinwari, nominee for Minister of Borders and Tribal Affairs, was a deputy minister of Justice during the Taliban regime. Salahuddin Rabbani, nominated for Foreign Minister, was recently head of the High Peace Council. Jelani Popal, nominee for Minister of Finance, was a close Karzai ally. The cabinet nominees in Afghanistan were seen as a result of compromise and the influence of powerful factions, raising questions about President Ghani's pledge to base selections on merit. Despite progress in Afghan institutions since 2001, concerns remain about political considerations in the selection process. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, signed in Afghanistan on May 1, 2012, commits the United States to support Afghan governance and security beyond 2014. Various metrics are used to assess progress in building Afghan governance and security. The U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement, signed in May 2012, commits the United States to support Afghan governance and security beyond 2014. Afghan progress is measured through various metrics, including improvements in elections, access to justice, human rights, financial management, and revenue systems. The Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability offers aid incentives for Afghanistan based on these measures. The Afghan government receives direct funding through the ARTF, giving them discretion in spending. A reform decree in 2012 required ministries to develop work plans and carry out specified reforms. Progress was praised in budget transparency and achieving development goals, but improvements were needed in election reform, anti-corruption, and local governance. The Afghan government has shown progress in budget transparency and achieving development goals, but improvements are needed in election reform, anti-corruption, and local governance. Capacity building at provincial and district levels has been challenging, with an increase in government employees and modernization of ministry offices. Training programs sponsored by the U.S. and other donors aim to enhance civil service capacity. The U.S. and other donors sponsor programs to train civil servants in Afghanistan, focusing on merit-based hiring. Despite efforts, recruiting skilled workers remains a challenge, with many hesitant to work in volatile provinces. International donors offering higher salaries have also led to talent drain. Discussions have been held to establish a unified salary scale for Afghan government personnel funded by donors. The Afghan government has made progress in implementing merit-based appointments for senior positions, such as district governors and provincial governors, to improve government proficiency. A U.N. report from March 2014 shows that over half of district governors were appointed based on merit, but the number of deputy governors recruited this way has remained low. Merit-based recruitment follows an administrative reform decree from July 2012. The Afghan government has implemented merit-based appointments for senior positions to improve government proficiency. President Ghani aims to increase merit-based recruitment and the Independent Directorate of Local Governance has been directed to open all deputy provincial governorships to competition. The Afghan Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission is standardizing job descriptions and salaries for civil servants. The USAID program CTAP provided technical assistance to Afghan ministries and the IARCSC. USAID gave $85 million to support training programs for Afghan civil servants. The Civil Service Training Institute trained over 5,000 civil servants in various skills. The international community sponsored a $350 million program to enhance the Afghan government's service delivery capacity. The international community, including USAID, has been supporting the Afghan government in improving its service delivery capacity. This includes training programs for Afghan civil servants in various ministries, such as the Ministry of Mines and the state-owned Afghan power company. Countries like India, Japan, Singapore, and Germany have also contributed to training Afghan civil servants in areas like good governance and anti-corruption. These efforts are reflected in the Afghan budget process and have been praised by donors. Officials meeting in Kabul praised the Afghan government's budget transparency and its ability to execute parts of the budget, particularly in the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. The government receives funds from both internal and external sources, with the budget year running from December 21 to December 20. The 2014 budget was approved but is $600 million short due to economic uncertainty from the election dispute. Afghan officials are seeking donations to fill the gap and plan to adjust the 2015 budget accordingly. The Afghan government plans to adjust the 2015 budget to match new economic conditions. The budget process is criticized for centralization, with funds allocated to central government entities. Local councils and governors have input but no control over their budgets. The Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework aims to establish a provincial budgeting process for provincial input into the national budget. The Afghan government aims to establish a provincial budgeting process for provincial input into the national budget. President Ghani supports a decentralized budget process, but revenue diversion causes financial issues. Local officials sometimes retain locally collected revenues instead of remitting them to the central government. The diversion of locally collected revenues by local officials has increased, leading to a government revenue shortfall in 2013 and budget issues in 2014. International experts agree that direct funding is necessary for the Afghan government to improve governance and service delivery. The United States has increased direct aid to Afghanistan, reaching nearly 50% in recent years. The US has increased direct support to Afghanistan based on assessments of ministry capabilities. Some audit reports question the oversight of funds. The US policy focuses on building local governance, with additional civilian personnel sent to advise Afghan ministries. The number of US civilians in Afghanistan peaked at 1,330 in 2011 but has since decreased by 20% as Afghan security lead transitioned. Despite a 20% decrease in US civilian personnel in Afghanistan since the security transition in 2014, local governance has expanded in secure areas. Afghan local councils have formed ties with appointed leaders, but centralized decision-making processes have slowed progress. Disagreements between local officials and Kabul ministry representatives persist, with President Karzai criticizing donor-run Provincial Reconstruction Teams for hindering government capacity at the local level. The Tokyo Framework supports transferring Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) to Afghan control to enhance local governance. The US and partner countries have been closing down PRTs since mid-2012. Afghan parliamentary action is needed for further improvements in local governance institution-building. The Independent Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG) was established in August 2007 to select local leaders, separate from the Interior Ministry. Some international officials believe it was used by Karzai to mobilize voters. The IDLG, led by Abdul Khaliq Farahi, was tasked with filling open positions in provinces and reviewing governors' performance in combating corruption. It is also involved in the District Delivery Program (DDP). The IDLG is an implementing partner for the District Delivery Program (DDP) funded by various countries. It also receives assistance from the UNDP's Afghanistan Subnational Governance Program II. Effective local governance relies on appointing competent governors. International studies show positive effects of strong Afghan civilian governance. In September 2012, Karzai replaced 10 provincial governors, including Mangal, due to governance and corruption issues. The reshuffle was seen as a move to place loyalists before the 2014 election. Many successful governors were accused of arbitrary justice and independence from central authority. Despite efforts to increase merit-based appointments, half of provincial governors remain political appointees. President Ghani has replaced governors in nine provinces, including Helmand, to improve merit-based appointments and governance efficiency. The role of provincial councils remains unclear, with legislation to expand their duties being stripped of supervisory provisions. The provincial councils play a significant role in choosing the upper house of the National Assembly. Elections for the provincial councils were held in 2009 and will be held again in 2014. District governors are appointed by the president, with progress noted in developing effective district governance. Some district governors in Helmand Province returned after the U.S.-led expulsion of Taliban militants, but lack resources like staff and vehicles. District Support Teams (DSTs) are assisting in governance and service delivery in about 40 districts, transitioning to Afghan control. No elections have been held for district councils, hindering the establishment of district-level governance. No elections have been held for district councils due to boundary and logistical difficulties, leading to a lack of authoritative district-level representation. The Afghan government has agreed to a roadmap for a single district-level body, but progress has been slow. Mayors of large municipalities are appointed, with plans for mayoral elections for better city management, but no municipal elections have been held or scheduled yet. The Afghan government has been slow in holding elections for district councils, leading to a lack of authoritative representation at the district level. Village-level governance by tribal elders and notables remains intact, especially in secure areas. The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development has formed Community Development Councils nationwide to suggest development priorities, with plans for all councils to be elected eventually. The international community is pushing for Afghan governing capacity reform and transparency. President Ghani has made efforts to combat corruption in the Afghan government by addressing the Kabul Bank scandal and demanding ministries submit procurement contract paperwork. Corruption is acknowledged as a major issue in Afghanistan, with past reluctance to prosecute corrupt officials. International pressure for reform and transparency in Afghan governance continues. Some international officials questioned Karzai's attempts to blame Afghan corruption on donor countries' contracting with faction leaders. U.S. policy on corruption has been inconsistent, with reports of the CIA providing cash payments to the Karzai government, fueling Afghan corruption. Karzai tolerated officials allegedly involved in illicit activities at the upper levels of government. Karzai allegedly tolerated officials involved in illicit activities and supported their lucrative contracts from donor countries in exchange for political support. Observers claim that some provincial governors were appointed as a reward but ended up economically exploiting the population. High officials acquired expensive properties in Kabul by appropriating private land with unclear ownership. $50 million in stolen U.S. aid funds, discovered in an Afghan bank account, went missing according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in May 2013. The Afghan government failed to freeze a bank account holding stolen U.S. aid funds, leading to concerns of misuse. Corruption accusations against officials, such as National Security Adviser Spanta and Finance Minister Zakhilwal, have been used as political tactics. Observers note that governmental corruption in Afghanistan often occurs during routine functions like processing official documents, where bribes are demanded. Afghan security officials have been reported selling provided vehicles and equipment for personal gain. Additionally, corruption involves siphoning off customs revenues and placing \"ghost employees\" on payrolls to pocket salaries. Low government worker salaries contribute to the problem. Governmental corruption in Afghanistan is fueled by low salaries for government workers, leading to a culture of corruption where officials protect relationships with appointments and contracts. The Obama Administration acknowledged the widespread corruption's negative impact on government effectiveness and popularity, debating whether to prioritize reducing low-level corruption over investigating high-level allies of Karzai in 2011. The Obama Administration acknowledged the negative impact of widespread corruption in Afghanistan, debating whether to prioritize reducing low-level corruption or investigating high-level Karzai allies. Efforts to curb corruption are seen as crucial to stabilizing the country and countering support for Taliban insurgents. Karzai has allowed oversight bodies to be developed to address corruption, as highlighted in the National Anti-Corruption Strategy finalized at the Kabul conference in July 2010. The Afghan government finalized a National Anti-Corruption Strategy and committed to enacting laws to curb corruption, but few have been enacted. The High Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption was established in 2008 to identify corruption cases and catalog overseas assets of officials. The High Office of Oversight and Anti-Corruption (HOO) was given power to investigate corruption cases in March 2010 by a decree issued by Karzai. In July 2012, a presidential decree directed the HOO to assess suspicious wealth of officials and report findings every two months. An anti-corruption committee was established in each ministry in early 2013. USAID provided $30 million to build capacity at central and provincial levels. The Afghan government implemented assets declarations and verifications for officials starting in 2010. Progress on verifying these declarations fell short of expectations, with minimal movement reported. By March 2014, nearly 3,000 officials had their assets registered, with verification completed for top-ranking officials. The Kabul conference mandated the establishment of the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC) to assess the government's efforts in fighting corruption. Supported by UNDP, the MEC, led by Drago Kos, issues reports every six months. The Major Crimes Task Force (MCTF) investigates public corruption, organized crime, and kidnapping, with headquarters inaugurated in 2010 and funded by the FBI and DEA. The Major Crimes Task Force (MCTF) was established in 2010 with funding and mentorship from various international agencies. It has 169 investigators and works closely with the Sensitive Investigations Unit (SIU) in Afghanistan. The SIU was involved in the arrest of a Karzai NSC aide for bribery, which led to intervention by Karzai himself. The investigation was later ended by the Attorney General's office. The Unit and Anti-Corruption Tribunal, established in 2009, has 11 judges appointed by the Supreme Court. It tries cases referred by the Anti-Corruption Unit of the Afghan Attorney General's office. However, only 28 officials have been convicted out of 2,000 cases investigated. The Department of Justice suspended training for the Anti-Corruption Unit in 2012 due to a \"lack of seriousness.\" One of the laws pledged in 2010 to empower the Tribunal and Major Crimes Task Force has not been enacted by the National Assembly. The Head of the High-Level Officials Office (HOO) reported sending 190 corruption cases to the Attorney General's office in the past two years, with few resulting in indictments. The Attorney General's office investigated 20 senior officials but had almost no convictions, including cases involving Commerce Minister Amin Farhang, former Minister of Mines Mohammad Ibrahim Adel, and former Minister of the Hajj Mohammad Siddiq Chakari. Afghanistan signed up for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to ensure transparency in contracting. Afghanistan aims to achieve full compliance with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) by April 2012. The World Bank granted $52 million to help manage natural resources effectively. Efforts to increase salaries, particularly for security forces, were made to reduce bribery. Bismillah Khan worked on promoting transparency and accountability in promotions during his term as Interior Minister. At the July 2010 Kabul conference, the Afghan government pledged to regulate bulk cash transfers out of the country due to concerns about officials taking large amounts of cash out of Afghanistan. Only 5% of the population use banks, with 90% relying on informal cash transfers. The Afghan Central Bank has licensed 475 hawalas to control these transfers, compared to none in 2009. U.S. and Afghan authorities installed currency counters at Kabul airport to track officials' cash movements. The Central Bank of Afghanistan imposed a $20,000 per person limit on cash transfers out of the country in 2012. However, reports found that currency counters at Kabul airport were not being used to track cash movements. Some Afghan officials were suspected of taking large amounts of cash and gold out of Afghanistan, possibly to hedge against instability. Additionally, governors of border provinces were diverting customs duties meant for the central government, leading to investigations and shutdowns of these operations in some provinces. The Afghan government investigated and shut down operations in 12 provinces, including a scheme at the Torkham Gate. The Supreme Audit Office was given official standing in 2013 to conduct audits, in line with a pledge made at the 2010 Kabul conference. The office is working on an anti-corruption project funded by the UN to strengthen the government's capacity to reduce corruption. The Kabul conference committed to establishing a legal review committee to review Afghan laws for compliance with the U.N. Convention Against Corruption. In 2009, General H.R. McMaster formed DOD task forces to focus on anti-corruption efforts. The Shafafiyat task force announced significant financial restitutions and penalties for fraudulent contractors. The near-collapse of Kabul Bank in August 2010 due to large losses from shareholder investments in Dubai properties highlighted the adverse effects of corruption in Afghanistan. Local anti-corruption efforts, such as volunteer inspectors monitoring donor-funded projects, lack official mandates and authority to address inadequacies effectively. In 2010, Kabul Bank faced a crisis after reporting significant losses from investments in Dubai properties, leading to a run on the bank. Afghan investigators found questionable loans causing over $925 million in losses. President Karzai's brother and other high-profile individuals received large loans from the bank. The United States and other donors refused to recapitalize the bank, prompting an audit of Afghan banks. The IMF suspended its credit program for the Afghan government in November 2010. In November 2010, the IMF suspended its credit program for the Afghan government, demanding an outside forensic audit of the Afghan banking industry. This led to the suspension of $1.8 billion in economic aid. As a condition for resuming its credit program, the IMF insisted on selling Kabul Bank. Instead, the Central Bank separated the bank's assets and restructured it, creating \"New Kabul Bank\" with a $825 million loan. The Afghan Finance Ministry is repaying the loan over eight years with recovered assets and government revenues. Efforts to sell New Kabul Bank have been unsuccessful since early 2013. The Finance Ministry has tried to sell New Kabul Bank, but no qualified bidders have made acceptable offers, and it remains state-owned. Efforts to recoup the estimated $925 million in losses have only recovered about $150 million in cash and $215 million in property. The Afghan government continues asset recovery and banking supervision as required by the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework. On January 15, 2011, Afghan Attorney General Ishaq Aloko announced an investigation into the near-collapse of Kabul Bank, blaming lax controls by the Central Bank and its governor, Abdul Qadir Fitrat. Mahmoud Karzai was largely absolved of wrongdoing, while other key figures like Dostam were named for taking unsecured loans. Central Bank governor Fitrat disputed the findings, fled to the US, and resigned. Two former Kabul Bank executives were arrested for allowing concessionary loans to high-level Afghans. On August 1, 2011, the Attorney General's office sent about 15 people allegedly responsible for the Kabul Bank scandal to Afghan courts for trial. On April 3, 2012, Karzai ordered a special prosecutor and tribunal to try those involved. By June 2, 2012, 21 people were indicted, including Farnood and Frouzi. The trial began on November 10, 2012, with all 21 defendants found guilty. Farnood and Frouzi received five-year sentences and financial penalties. Senior officials in Kabul agreed that continued efforts were needed to hold parties accountable in the Kabul Bank scandal. An audit by Kroll Associates called Kabul Bank a \"Ponzi scheme\" involving deliberate deception. Investigations revealed funds were smuggled out of the country with alleged high-level government involvement. Recovery of lost funds and forensic audits suggested Afghanistan was meeting IMF conditions for a credit program restart, approved in November 2011 with a $133 million loan. In November 2011, the IMF approved a $133 million loan to Afghanistan, restoring donor funds and seeking to stabilize vulnerable banks like Azizi Bank. The New Ansari Money Exchange was designated as a major money laundering entity, leading to a ban on U.S. transactions. President Ghani ordered a review of the Kabul Bank scandal due to lack of accountability. Progress against corruption is a key metric for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. The U.S. has made aid to Afghanistan conditional on progress against corruption, women's inclusion in reconciliation, and reports on the Kabul Bank scandal. No U.S. funding has been permanently withheld due to legislative certification requirements. U.S. policy since 2001 aims to build human rights capacity and promote civil society and political participation in Afghanistan. The 2013 report on Afghanistan highlighted human rights deficiencies attributed to lack of security, corruption, and discrimination against women. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, led by Sima Simar, faces government interference, as seen in the dismissal of deputy chairman Ahmad Nader Nadery for alleging abuses by Karzai allies. Nadery led the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, critical of election fraud. AIHRC's budget is mainly from European donors, Canada, Australia, and the UN. Donors criticized Karzai's 2013 AIHRC appointments. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights failed to persuade Karzai to replace controversial appointees. Afghan organizations demand transparency since 2002. Since 2002, Afghan organizations have been advocating for transparency regarding human rights issues. NGOs like Afghanistan Human Rights and Democracy Organization and Equality for Peace and Democracy have played a key role in pushing for improved practices. The government has responded by establishing a human rights unit within the National Directorate of Security to investigate abuse allegations and provide training. Additionally, the Ministry of Justice's Human Rights Support Unit conducted training sessions for security forces, and the Interior Ministry was tasked with reporting on prison conditions in 2012. The Ministry was tasked by the presidential office to report on prison conditions. Karzai ordered disarmed a local security unit accused of raping a woman in Konduz Province. Afghan forces were sent to track down Taliban militants who executed a woman for adultery in Parwan Province. The National Ulema Council, consisting of 150 respected clerics, influences social freedoms and bans performances inconsistent with Islamic values. The National Ulema Council, consisting of 150 respected clerics, influences social freedoms and bans performances inconsistent with Islamic values. Some rock bands have been allowed to perform high profile shows since 2011, while alcohol is increasingly difficult to obtain due to Islamist conservatives. 350 clerics linked to the Council demanded the implementation of Sharia law in 2010, including punishments like stoning and amputations. The government did not implement the recommendation, as it would require amending the Afghan constitution. The Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs regulates religious practices in Afghanistan. The Afghan government funds and regulates approximately 6,000 mosques, with clerics paid to promote the government line. In 2012, the Ministry threatened to fire clerics preaching violence. Riots erupted in 2011 and 2012 over perceived disrespect of Islam by the U.S., resulting in casualties. In 2012, riots and protests occurred in Afghanistan over the mistaken U.S. discarding of Qurans at Bagram Airfield. The public reaction to the Quran burning was more intense than the killing of 16 Afghans by a U.S. soldier. Afghan police protected a U.S. training facility from rioters protesting a video mocking the Prophet Muhammad. These incidents may have contributed to \"green on blue\" attacks between Afghan and U.S. forces. The International Religious Freedom report for 2013 did not change U.S. assessments of religious freedom in Afghanistan. The constitution and government somewhat restrict religious freedom for minority religions like Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, and Baha'i's. Despite facing discrimination, some members of these communities hold high positions in government. Karzai created special parliamentary seats for Sikhs and Hindus in 2013. Isma'ilis have representation in the National Assembly without a quota, but Baha'is face more challenges. The Afghan Supreme Court declared the Baha'i faith as blasphemy in 2007, leading to discrimination against Baha'is. A young journalist, Sayed Kambaksh, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2008 for criticizing Islam, but was later pardoned and released in 2009. Hazaras and Afghan Shiites are less religious compared to their counterparts in Iran. Afghan Shiite leaders appreciated the enactment of a \"Shiite Personal Status Law\" in July 2009, giving Afghan Shiites legal recognition and framework for family law issues. Some Pashtuns have become resentful of open Shiite celebrations, leading to clashes. In 2012, Karzai denounced a book portraying Hazaras as un-Islamic, and Pashtun students attacked Hazara students commemorating Ashura, resulting in temporary university closures. The clashes during the holy month of Muharram led to the temporary closure of universities in Afghanistan. An Afghan man faced a potential death penalty trial for converting to Christianity, but was released after international pressure. In 2010, the Afghan government suspended the operations of Christian-affiliated relief groups over accusations of promoting Christianity. In May 2010, amputee Said Musa was imprisoned in Afghanistan for converting to Christianity from Islam, which is considered an offense under Afghan law. The arrest came after a TV show on Afghan Christians aired, leading to international pressure for his release. Musa was eventually freed in February 2011 and granted asylum in Italy. Afghanistan's conservative traditions have led to restrictions on media freedoms, despite the country having one of the freest presses in the region since 2001. The Afghan government expanded media freedoms in 2009 but imposed content restrictions and licensing requirements. A new media law is being drafted, facing opposition from human rights groups. Journalists face intimidation and violence for criticizing the government or local leaders, with some news organizations being closed for incorrect reporting. In 2012, the government threatened to expel media staff. In 2012, the Afghan government threatened to expel International Crisis Group staff for a report warning of civil war if the 2014 elections were not fair. USAID trained journalists on corruption reporting, and the US funded an Afghan Government Media Information Center. President Ghani revoked the expulsion of a New York Times journalist. The Ulema Council and clerics like Ayatollah Asif Mohseni have influenced media content in Afghanistan, leading to the banning and restoration of Indian soap operas on Tolo Television. Pressure from the Ulema Council also resulted in the removal of a soap opera called \"Forbidden Love\" in 2011. Additionally, there have been calls to ban programs deemed \"vulgar, obscene, or un-Islamic.\" The \"Azadi\" service in Afghanistan distributed 20,000 solar powered radios to improve access to information for poor Afghans. Reports highlight widespread torture, rape, and abuses by officials and security forces. US and partner transfers of prisoners to Afghan facilities were suspended due to alleged torture. UNAMA monitors detention facilities to prevent torture and provided assistance in redrafting prison-related directives. Concerns remain about new incidents of alleged torture. In 2007, Afghanistan resumed enforcing the death penalty after a four-year moratorium, executing 15 criminals. In August 2010, Taliban insurgents ordered a young couple stoned to death in Konduz Province. President Karzai signed an execution order for five men convicted of gang rape in 2014, which was carried out by President Ghani despite concerns over a fair trial. The Ministry of Women's Affairs in Afghanistan praised the execution of criminals as a historic lesson. Afghanistan was upgraded to Tier 2 in the State Department Trafficking in Persons Report for 2014, showing improvement from previous years. Despite not fully complying with minimum standards, the government is making significant efforts to combat trafficking. Women from China are mentioned in the report. The State Department report highlights trafficking of women from China, Africa, Iran, and Central Asia into Afghanistan for sexual exploitation. Trafficking within Afghanistan is more common than across borders, with families selling children for forced prostitution, including bacha baazi. Afghan National Security Forces have been involved in sexually abusing boys for bacha baazi. Despite social and religious risks, many women turn to prostitution due to economic hardship. Women and women's groups play a significant role in post-Taliban civil society in Afghanistan. The Afghan government promotes equality for women through the National Action Plan for Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA), as required by the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework. President Ghani has shown support for women's rights, despite criticism for his wife being a Christian. Women's freedoms have expanded post-Taliban, with increased participation in government and civil society. The formation of the Ministry of Women's Affairs in 2002 aimed to improve women's rights in Afghanistan, including promoting awareness of relevant laws and regulations. The Ministry oversees women's shelters to protect women from domestic abuse, but faced criticism in 2012 for allegedly encouraging \"immorality and prostitution.\" The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorized $15 million per year for the Ministry. The Ministry of Women's Affairs in Afghanistan received funding from USAID's ESF accounts, with the United States continuing to provide support after AFSA expired. The Afghanistan Women's Network, AIHRC, and other human rights groups focus on women's rights. Women in Afghanistan now hold jobs previously rare for them, with 19% in the civil service and serving in the police force and military. Women in Afghanistan have made significant progress in various sectors, with female representation in the police force, military, judiciary, journalism, and community development councils. They are legally allowed to drive, with a growing number of women learning to drive. The wearing of the burqa is no longer mandatory, and fewer women are choosing to wear it. Additionally, a women-only park called \"Women's Garden\" has been opened in Kabul for women to engage in fitness and job training activities without male escort. Some groups report backsliding on women's rights in Afghanistan since 2008, despite marginal improvement in 2012. Denial of education and job opportunities persists due to conservative traditions, especially in rural areas. The Ulema Council mandated women to wear veils and have male chaperones for travel, endorsed by Karzai. However, women still have rights to inherit, own property, and choose their partners. On March 6, 2012, Karzai endorsed the Ulema Council statement, which highlighted widespread abuses in Afghanistan, including forced marriages, underage brides, and the practice of baad. Women face incarceration for actions like running away from home or defying family choice of spouse, despite leniency towards males in the penal code. The \"Elimination of Violence Against Women\" law was issued by Karzai in 2009 to prevent abuses against women in Afghanistan. Women's rights activists have been targeted, with some being assassinated, including a prominent activist abducted and killed by Taliban militants. The law limits the sentencing of women who commit adultery to two years in prison. The \"Elimination of Violence Against Women\" law in Afghanistan has led to an increase in convictions for abuses against women. A \"High Commission for the Elimination of Violence Against Women\" oversees the implementation of the law, with provincial offices established in most provinces. Despite the law, only a small percentage of violence reports are registered with the judicial system, and the number of women jailed for \"moral crimes\" has increased by 50% since 2011. Efforts to enact the law have faced opposition from Islamic conservatives. Despite opposition from Islamic conservatives, women in Afghanistan have made progress in governance with some setbacks. Three women were nominated to cabinet posts in January 2015, the same number as since 2004. Women have also held prominent positions such as governor of Bamiyan province. Despite attempts at presidential candidacy, women have received minimal support in elections. In the 2014 election in Afghanistan, a woman's presidential candidacy was disqualified due to insufficient nominating signatures. The constitution reserves seats for women in the National Assembly, with 69 women elected in the 2010 parliamentary elections. NGOs believe that women elected through quotas are not seen as legitimate parliamentarians. In Afghanistan, women elected through quotas are not always considered legitimate parliamentarians. The High Peace Council overseeing the reconciliation process has 9 women out of 70 members, but their views are not fully taken into account. The US promotes women's rights in Afghanistan through its \"Strategy for Assistance to Women in Afghanistan, 2010-2013.\" The US has been following its \"Strategy for Assistance to Women in Afghanistan, 2010-2013\" by allocating aid towards women's programs in the country. Specific earmarks for US funds for women and girls in Afghanistan have increased steadily, with funding provided in pillars such as health, education, economy, legal protection, and leadership. Total US funding for women's programs in Afghanistan remained consistent for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, including small grants from the US Ambassador to support gender initiatives. U.S. funding for democracy, governance, and rule of law programs in Afghanistan has increased in line with the Obama Administration strategy. From FY2002 to FY2012, USAID spent about $1.5 billion on these programs, with ESF amounts for FY2013 totaling $578.2 million. This includes funding for good governance, rule of law, human rights, political competition, and consensus-building. The Obama Administration has requested $1.665 billion in ESF and $475 million in INCLE funding for Afghanistan, with allocations for democracy, governance, and civil society programs. A potential settlement with the Taliban could impact Afghan politics, elections, government performance, and human rights. The Obama Administration initially withheld endorsement of reconciliation with the Taliban due to concerns about their ties to Al Qaeda and potential rollback of freedoms. Minority communities, women, and intellectuals remain skeptical of reconciliation. Taliban insurgents oppose women's rights and have targeted girls' schools. Afghan and U.S. officials suggest that any settlement would require the Taliban to compromise on their demands. The Taliban is willing to compromise on some demands, including the withdrawal of foreign troops, adoption of an \"Islamic\" constitution, and imposition of Islamic law. This issue is discussed further in the CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Post-Taliban Governance, Security, and U.S. Policy."
