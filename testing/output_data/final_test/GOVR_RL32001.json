Brazil has a low prevalence rate due to active prevention efforts and an extensive ARV treatment program. In contrast, some Caribbean and Central American countries have high prevalence rates and transmission is primarily through unprotected sex. The HIV epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America is primarily spread through unprotected heterosexual contact, making it challenging to contain. In 2007, the adult infection rate in the Caribbean was 1.0%, with an estimated 11,000 lives lost that year. Haiti, the Bahamas, Belize, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago had the highest prevalence rates between 2% and 4%, while Barbados, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Suriname had rates between 1% and 2%. Haiti and the Dominican Republic account for three-quarters of the region's infected population. The HIV epidemic in Haiti and the Dominican Republic is influenced by poverty, conflict, and unstable governance. Prevention efforts have led to declining infection levels in both countries, with an increase in condom use and a drop in the number of sexual partners. In the Dominican Republic, the epidemic appears to have stabilized, but high prevalence rates persist among workers on sugar cane plantations. In Central America, cane plantations (bateyes) have high HIV prevalence rates, with Honduras having the highest rate of 1.5%. The epidemic is concentrated in urban areas, but rural areas are also affected. The Garifuna community in Honduras is particularly hard hit, with over 8% and 14% infected. Unprotected heterosexual sex is the main mode of transmission, but sex between men is also a factor in some countries. In Central America and the Caribbean, high HIV infection rates are found among men who have sex with men, with bisexuality acting as a significant bridge for transmission. Female sex workers also have high prevalence rates in certain countries. Stigma and homophobia in the Caribbean hinder HIV services, potentially masking a higher percentage of infections attributed to sex between men. However, increased condom use has reduced prevalence rates in some areas. In Jamaica, there is pervasive homophobia and targeted violence against gay men, leading to violence against people living with HIV and organizations providing HIV/AIDS education and services. Notable activists like Brian Williamson and Steve Harvey were murdered in hate crimes. The Jamaican government launched an anti-stigma media campaign in 2006 to combat discrimination associated with HIV infection. UNAIDS condemned the murders and called for addressing homophobia to prevent the spread of HIV. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America is negatively impacting economic and social development. It is a leading cause of death among adults aged 15-44 in the Caribbean, affecting life expectancy and infant mortality. UNAIDS reported lower life expectancy in Haiti and the Dominican Republic due to the epidemic. In Trinidad and Tobago, AIDS mortality is projected to reduce the population by 2010, straining already burdened health systems in the region. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America has further burdened already-strained health systems in the region. There are approximately 250,000 AIDS orphans in the Caribbean, with a significant number in Haiti, and 73,000 AIDS orphans in Central America. The World Bank warns that increasing HIV prevalence in the Caribbean will negatively impact economic growth, affecting sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and finance. The epidemic is also expected to shock the labor market in the region due to deaths from AIDS, potentially crippling the workforce. Prime Minister Denzil Douglas of St. Kitts and Nevis highlights the threat of the epidemic on the labor force amid the push for competitiveness in global markets. The World Bank warned in 2001 that the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean could have a similar impact as in Africa if action is not taken early. The epidemic is affecting younger people who are key human resources. The U.S. government sees it as a national security issue due to its impact on economic development and political stability. Officials have warned about the spread of the disease in regions like Central America and the Caribbean. The Director of the White House Office of AIDS Policy warned in 2002 about the AIDS problems in the Caribbean, referring to it as \"our third border.\" USAID Assistant Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean highlighted in 2005 that migration from the region contributes to HIV risk in the United States, with Caribbean immigrants representing 46% of those testing positive in New York City. The response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America involves support from various entities including governments, bilateral donors, regional and multilateral organizations, and NGOs. The World Bank has played a significant role in supporting efforts to combat HIV/AIDS in Latin America. The World Bank has provided substantial support to combat HIV/AIDS in Latin America and the Caribbean, with Brazil being the first country to receive assistance. A $155 million lending program was approved for the Caribbean in June 2001 to help finance national HIV/AIDS prevention projects. Loans were approved for various countries including Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad & Tobago. In March 2005, an $8 million Central America regional project was approved to manage the epidemic. The Inter-American Development Bank has also supported HIV/AIDS activities in countries like the Bahamas and Guatemala. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has provided significant assistance to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the Bahamas, Belize, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Suriname. They have allocated about $484 million to the region, supporting health infrastructure for HIV/AIDS treatment and care programs. Additionally, beneficiaries in Central America and the Caribbean include Belize, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Panama, as well as multi-country programs for CARICOM, CRN+, and OECS. The Latin American and Caribbean region has seen significant progress in HIV/AIDS treatment and care, with varying quality and scope of programs due to socioeconomic disparities. Access to antiretroviral drugs has improved in many countries, but universal treatment in resource-limited countries may take years to achieve. Brazil stands out for offering treatment to all HIV patients, leading to improved survival rates. In Latin America and the Caribbean, access to antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS has improved, leading to a rise in survival rates. Countries like Brazil offer universal treatment, resulting in significant progress. However, some smaller countries in the region have lower coverage rates, with disparities in access to treatment. In Haiti and other countries like the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, and Trinidad and Tobago, less than 50% of those needing ARV treatment were receiving it in 2006. Partners in Health initiated a program in Haiti in 1998 to provide ARV treatment to patients in impoverished rural villages, showing that even in severely impoverished countries, sustained treatment for people with HIV is possible. Regional and multilateral institutions in the Caribbean support a regional approach to combat HIV/AIDS due to small governments and limited resources. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has led efforts with initiatives like the Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS (PANCAP) to involve government, business, and the international community in combating the epidemic. The Pan American Health Organization and CAREC are assisting in implementing a strategic plan to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central America. Regional efforts include initiatives to protect vulnerable populations and negotiate price cuts for antiretroviral drugs. The U.S. provides support through various agencies like CDC and NIH. The United States provides funding and support through various agencies like CDC, NIH, Department of Labor, Department of State, and USAID to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic abroad. Additionally, the U.S. contributes to multilateral efforts such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The U.S. is also a major financial contributor to institutions like the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank for HIV/AIDS projects in the region. U.S. government funding to combat HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean and Central America has increased in recent years, rising from $11.2 million in FY2000 to an estimated $139 million for FY2008. Assistance to the region for HIV/AIDS increased due to the inclusion of Guyana and Haiti in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). USAID provides HIV/AIDS assistance through bilateral and regional programs in the Caribbean. USAID provides HIV/AIDS assistance through bilateral and regional programs in the Caribbean, including countries like Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, St. Kitts and Nevis, and others. The program aims to expand education and prevention programs, improve health delivery, and reduce stigma and discrimination. In the Dominican Republic, USAID funds NGOs for prevention, support for people with HIV, and policy work. In the Caribbean, USAID supports HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs in countries like Jamaica, Guyana, and Haiti. The focus is on reducing stigma, promoting prevention activities, and supporting high-risk populations. Collaboration with local governments and organizations is key in expanding education and prevention efforts. In Haiti, USAID supports education and prevention activities for high-risk groups and people living with HIV/AIDS, including programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission and condom marketing. Increased assistance under PEPFAR is scaling up prevention, treatment, and care activities, including ARV treatment. In Central America, USAID funds HIV activities in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Belize, and Panama, focusing on high-risk populations and comprehensive care for people living with HIV/AIDS. USAID and CDC collaborate on HIV/AIDS prevention programs, including condom marketing and behavioral change initiatives for high-risk populations. CDC funds programs in Haiti, Guyana, and the Caribbean region through CAREC in Trinidad and Tobago. Plans are in place to fund programs in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic in 2008. In Central America, CDC has funded regional programs since 2003. The CDC has funded regional programs in Central America since 2003 and plans to fund programs in Honduras and Nicaragua in 2008. The NIH has funded international research efforts worldwide, focusing on vaccine research, prevention of disease transmission, research on women and AIDS, HIV infection prevention and treatment in children, opportunistic infections, and training of foreign scientists. The Department of Labor has funded HIV/AIDS workplace education and prevention projects in several Caribbean and Central American countries. Members of Congress have pushed to expand assistance under PEPFAR to more Caribbean countries beyond Haiti and Guyana due to high mobility in the region. Members of Congress have pushed to expand assistance under PEPFAR to more Caribbean countries beyond Haiti and Guyana, citing high mobility in the region as a reason for a regional approach. Caribbean officials express concerns that targeting specific countries could be disastrous due to significant travel among islands and American tourists. Legislation does not prevent the President from designating additional Caribbean countries, with H.R. 848 proposing to add 14 more countries to the focus list. In the 109th Congress, legislation was considered to reauthorize U.S. assistance to combat HIV/AIDS worldwide during FY2009-FY2013, with a proposed $30 billion over five years. Similar language was included in previous Congresses, but no final action was taken. The House approved a PEPFAR reauthorization bill authorizing $50 billion from FY2009 to FY2013 to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria overseas. The Senate version also authorizes $50 billion over the same period but does not designate 14 Caribbean countries as focus countries. HIV/AIDS assistance to the Caribbean and Central America is funded through annual appropriations.
