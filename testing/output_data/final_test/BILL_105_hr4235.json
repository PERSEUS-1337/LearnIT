    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that harmful algal blooms, such as Pfiesteria piscicida, are increasing in frequency and intensity in coastal waters. Other occurrences include red tides in the Gulf of Mexico, brown tides in New York and Texas, ciguatera fish poisoning in Hawaii, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and shellfish poisonings in various regions. These blooms have led to fish kills, manatee deaths, beach closures, and threats to marine life. Harmful algal blooms have caused economic losses of $1 billion in the past decade and can lead to hypoxia, harming marine life. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 53% of U.S. estuaries experience hypoxia, with a 7,000 square mile dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico due to excessive nutrient loading. There is a need for more effective actions to reduce nutrient loadings in coastal waters. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration highlights the need for comprehensive efforts to prevent harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Funding for research programs will improve understanding and capabilities in addressing the environmental costs associated with these issues. Other federal agencies, along with states, tribes, and local governments, also play a crucial role in controlling harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The action plan outlined in Section 3 focuses on addressing harmful algal blooms and hypoxia through comprehensive efforts involving research programs and collaboration with federal agencies, states, tribes, and local governments. The President will establish an Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia, consisting of representatives from various government departments and agencies. The Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia, established by the President, will work with various federal agencies to develop an action plan within 12 months to address harmful algal blooms. This plan will involve coordinated efforts to prevent, reduce, manage, and control the impacts of harmful algal blooms on the environment and public health. The Task Force, in consultation with various stakeholders, will develop an action plan within 12 months to address hypoxia in U.S. coastal waters. The plan aims to provide a comprehensive and coordinated Federal response to manage and mitigate the impacts of hypoxia. The Federal response to hypoxia in U.S. coastal waters includes establishing a research program, identifying actions for Federal agencies, preventing duplication of efforts, and coordinating with states and local governments. The Task Force will submit annual reports to Congress and the President describing progress in implementing action plans to prevent, reduce, manage, mitigate, and control harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Reports will also assess plan effectiveness, propose changes for improvement, and include additional information as needed. The Task Force may disestablish after submitting the third report. SEC. 4. NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO HYPOXIA. The Task Force must submit an assessment report on hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico by March 30, 1999, examining causes, consequences, nutrient sources, reduction methods, and costs. The President must develop a plan by March 30, 2000, based on the assessment, to reduce hypoxia, consulting with various stakeholders. The President must develop a plan by March 30, 2000, to reduce hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico, consulting with stakeholders including tribes, local governments, academic, agricultural, industry, and environmental groups. A summary of the proposed plan will be published in the Federal Register for a 60-day public comment period. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of $25,500,000 annually for research, education, and management activities on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. Consultation with States required. Allocation of funds for research and assessment activities by NOAA and ECOHAB project. The ECOHAB project under the Coastal Ocean Program is allocated $3,000,000 for peer-reviewed research on harmful algal blooms management measures. Additionally, $5,500,000 is designated for Federal and State monitoring activities, and $5,000,000 for research and monitoring on hypoxia by NOAA. The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is involved in service. The National Sea Grant College Program Act is amended to allocate funds for research on harmful algal blooms. The Coastal Zone Management Act is also amended. The Coastal Zone Management Act is amended to allocate up to $2,000,000 for technical assistance in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to support State implementation and analysis of measures to prevent harmful algal blooms and hypoxia."
