    "content": "The 2002 farm bill expanded commodity support to include additional commodities such as dry peas, lentils, and wool. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pays for commodity support using a line of credit from the U.S. Treasury. Expenditures for commodity support have averaged $12.6 billion per year, but are expected to decrease to $7 billion per year due to high market prices for supported crops. The USDA's proposed 2007 farm bill aims to save $4.494 billion by modifying commodity programs to be more market-oriented and less distorting. Current law sets support prices for 25 commodities, but the Secretary of Agriculture believes that high crop loan rates lead to overproduction and lower market prices. The USDA's proposed 2007 farm bill aims to save $4.5 billion by setting loan rates based on market prices to reduce overproduction and lower market prices. Loan rates would be determined by the lesser of 85% of the five-year Olympic average of market prices or the rates specified in the House-passed 2002 farm bill. This proposal is expected to save $4.5 billion over 10 years compared to baseline spending on marketing assistance loan program operations. The USDA's proposed 2007 farm bill aims to save $4.5 billion by setting loan rates based on market prices to reduce overproduction and lower market prices. The proposal would determine loan rates based on the lesser of 85% of the five-year Olympic average of market prices or the rates specified in the House-passed 2002 farm bill, saving $4.5 billion over 10 years compared to baseline spending on marketing assistance loan program operations. The proposal raises questions about the impact on federal outlays, commodities with prices below proposed levels, potential savings decrease with current law loan rates, consideration of replacing nonrecourse loans with recourse loans, and the use of commodity certificates to circumvent payment limits. The USDA proposes changes to the marketing assistance loan program to save $250 million over 10 years by replacing daily posted county prices with monthly prices for farmers to receive Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs) based on. This change aims to address difficulties in calculating daily prices and prevent windfall opportunities for farmers during short-term market price declines. Farmers can still collect LDPs and hold onto commodities to market them later at higher prices. The USDA proposes changes to the marketing assistance loan program to save $250 million over 10 years by replacing daily posted county prices with monthly prices for farmers to receive Loan Deficiency Payments (LDPs). Direct payments were enacted in the 2002 farm bill as a replacement for production flexibility contract payments. The direct payment program is designed to cost about $5 billion per year. The direct payment program, costing about $5 billion per year, provides payments to eligible farms based on historic production and yield. The Secretary has proposed to maintain current payment rates from 2008 through 2009, with a 7% increase in 2010 for a three-year period. The increase in direct payments aims to support farmers during high market prices and reduced marketing loan program payments. The economic justification for higher direct payments, particularly for upland cotton, is questioned due to the impact on land prices and rents. The decline in the domestic textile industry may limit price gains despite past export offsets. Concerns arise about the alignment of cotton loan rates and target prices with market conditions, as well as the potential high costs of marketing loan and counter-cyclical programs compared to other commodities. The eligibility and payment rates for direct payments do not differentiate among farmers based on age, longevity, or ownership status. Beginning farmers would receive direct payments at a rate 20% higher than other farmers under the Secretary's farm bill proposal. The question is raised whether the proposed $5.5 billion increase in direct payments would be better used for crop disaster assistance or crop insurance over the next 10 years. Crop disaster payments have averaged $1.3 billion per year over the past five years, with no payments made for disaster losses in 2005 and 2006. The USDA plans to provide beginning farmers with direct payments 20% higher than other farmers for the first five years, costing $250 million over 10 years. Questions arise about defining beginning farmers, the number of beneficiaries, and potential impacts on cropland prices. Counter-cyclical payments aim to stabilize market losses, costing about $2.5 billion annually from FY2003-FY2007. Counter-cyclical payments, estimated at $2.5 billion annually, are triggered by a shortfall in national crop revenue rather than price. This change aims to incorporate crop yields and production, generating $3.7 billion in savings under the OMB 10-year baseline. Counter-cyclical payments, worth $2.5 billion yearly, are now based on national crop revenue shortfall instead of price, saving $3.7 billion under the OMB 10-year baseline. Can revenue-based counter-cyclical payments integrate commodity support, disaster assistance, and crop insurance effectively? What are the barriers to creating a national counter-cyclical revenue program for subsidized crops? The Administration's farm bill proposal may not offer a fair alternative for farmers not growing program crops. Congress implemented limits on commodity support program payments in 1970, with current per person limits of $40,000 on direct payments, $65,000 on counter-cyclical payments, and $75,000 on marketing loan gains. The total limit of $180,000 can be doubled under certain allowances. There are no limits on commodity certificate gains or marketing loan gains. The 2002 farm bill-authorized Commission on the Application of Payment Limitations for Agriculture set an adjusted gross income (AGI) eligibility cap of $2.5 million. Most farmers find ways to avoid payment limits, with cotton and rice farmers feeling threatened by the limits due to the higher per acre value of their crops. Some argue for lower payment limits to prevent farm consolidation, while opponents believe large payments are essential for the agricultural safety net. The Secretary has proposed changes to tighten eligibility and payment limits for commodity program payments, aiming to prevent evasion of a $360,000 per individual limit and exclude those with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income. The proposal is expected to save $1.5 billion from the $75 billion 10-year baseline for commodity support. Questions remain about the impact on farms and individuals, the reduction in cotton and sugar payments, and the management of commercial farms by operators who own some land. The Secretary's proposal aims to tighten eligibility and payment limits for commodity program payments, preventing evasion of a $360,000 per individual limit and excluding those with over $200,000 in adjusted gross income. This could impact absentee landlords receiving commodity program payments and lead to changes in tenant-landlord lease contracts towards cash rent. The proposal also includes a provision related to Section 1031 of the federal tax code, which allows for tax-deferred exchanges of income-producing property, including farmland. The Secretary's proposal aims to tighten eligibility and payment limits for commodity program payments, including prohibiting commodity subsidy benefits to farms acquired through a 1031 exchange. The justification is that tax-deferred farmland exchanges are driving up prices, hindering new entrants and small farms. Questions raised include exemptions for farmers consolidating holdings, beginning farmers using 1031 exchanges, and the broader economic impact of Section 1031. The USDA studies show that commodity subsidies impact land prices and rental rates. The debate is whether redesigning commodity programs to eliminate this effect is necessary. Consultation with the Treasury Secretary and Ways and Means Committee is needed to consider changes to the tax code regarding 1031 exchanges for farmland. The Dairy Price Support Program in the 2002 farm bill supports milk prices through purchasing dairy products at set prices. The Administration proposes continuing the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program at $9.90 per cwt. The program pays dairy farmers when market prices fall below $16.94/cwt, with a 34% payment rate. The program is set to expire in August 2007, with a recommendation to renew at 34% for FY2008 and gradually reduce to 20% over six years. The USDA study on dairy policy concludes that current programs have limited impact on farm viability. Large dairy farms criticize the MILC program's payment limit. The federal government responds to concerns about bias. The federal government's response to concerns about dairy policy includes a proposal to reduce support for the dairy price support program in the Doha Round. The current U.S. proposal aims to decrease total amber box support from $19.1 billion to $7.6 billion. The USDA is asked if they considered an alternative policy decoupled from price and production. The MILC program, established in 2002, has provided $2.4 billion in payments over five years. The USDA's proposal estimates a cost of $793 million for extending the program. Changes include basing payments on a three-year average of milk marketed, rather than current production levels. The proposal aims to reduce expenditures and improve dairy market conditions. The MILC program, established in 2002, has provided $2.4 billion in payments over five years. The USDA's proposal aims to reduce expenditures by basing payments on a three-year average of milk marketed, instead of current production levels. Support for raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar are mandatory under the 2002 farm bill. The United States maintains market prices above mandatory support levels by limiting supplies through import barriers. The United States limits sugar imports under WTO rules, with Mexico allowed to ship 276,000 short tons until 2007. After that, Mexican sugar has open access to the U.S. market under NAFTA. The U.S. can impose domestic marketing allotments on sugar only when imports are below 1.532 million short tons. Imports exceeding this limit may result in costs of $1.107 billion. The farm bill proposal aims to save $1.107 billion over 10 years by continuing the sugar support program but eliminating the provision to suspend marketing allotments when sugar imports exceed 1.532 million short tons. Key questions include the amount of sugar the CCC would acquire under the loan program and the potential impact on sugar farmers if government savings were passed on to them. Additionally, USDA is exploring a direct payments program on sugar base acres as an alternative policy. The 2002 farm bill included provisions to enhance cotton export competitiveness and protect domestic textile mills. Step 1 allowed for a downward adjustment in the adjusted world price for upland cotton, increasing the loan deficiency payment to producers. Step 2 mandated offsetting payments to exporters and domestic users of cotton to prevent buyers from being disadvantaged by buying U.S. cotton. Step 3 allowed for a special additional import quota for upland cotton. The USDA's farm bill proposes to eliminate Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 in the current cotton program. Step 1 and Step 3 were created to address tight supplies for domestic mills, but have been used infrequently. Eliminating these steps would not have adverse consequences for upland cotton producers or domestic textile mills. Step 2 for extra long staple (ELS) cotton would also be eliminated due to violations of WTO rules. The 1996 and 2002 farm bills prohibit planting fruits, vegetables, and wild rice on program crop base acres to maintain planting flexibility for other subsidized crops. Direct and counter-cyclical payments are lost for violating this restriction. The limitation aims to prevent competition for high-value specialty crops from subsidized land and meets WTO obligations by considering direct payments as minimally production- and trade-distorting. The USDA farm bill proposal aims to eliminate the base acre planting restriction on fruits, vegetables, and wild rice to comply with WTO green box rules. This could impact producers of these crops and raises questions about the integration of U.S. agriculture sectors. The USDA farm bill proposal aims to eliminate base acre planting restrictions on fruits, vegetables, and wild rice to comply with WTO rules. This could impact producers and raise questions about integrating U.S. agriculture sectors. The proposal also addresses the retention of base acreage benefits when converting cropland to nonagricultural uses, ensuring equity among farmers. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) provides technical and financial assistance to farmers addressing water and soil resource concerns. Limited funding has constrained the program to 14% of the nation's watersheds, with many farmers finding the administrative burden excessive. The Secretary proposes offering farms with program crop base acres a \"conservation enhanced payment\" equal to 10% of the commodity program direct payment for adopting conservation practices equivalent to the Progressive Tier requirement of the Conservation Security Program (CSP). This option would require forgoing counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan benefits for the duration of the 2007 farm bill. The question arises whether this option is a pilot effort to convert commodity programs into green box payments and if it would create two categories of CSP contracts. The Conservation Enhanced Payment Option offers farms a 10% increase in direct payment for adopting conservation practices equivalent to the Progressive Tier requirement of the CSP. Questions arise about potential differences in benefits for CSP participants and the trade-offs involved in giving up commodity program safety nets for this option. The Secretary has proposed modifications to the circuit breaker authority to comply with trade agreements. The Secretary has proposed modifying the circuit breaker authority to accommodate new agreements from the Doha round or other WTO agreements. Questions about the use of the circuit breaker authority and U.S. amber box subsidies are raised. Conservation programs have evolved from less than $1 billion annually before the 1985 farm bill to over $5.2 billion annually with more than 20 distinct programs now in place. The 2002 farm bill authorized large increases in mandatory funding for agricultural conservation programs, with the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) making up almost 55% of the $5.2 billion in annual spending. The Administration's proposed 2007 farm bill outlines an increase in funding for agricultural conservation programs, estimated at $7.825 billion over 10 years. This includes an increase in funding for EQIP and an increase in the acreage limit for the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). The Administration's proposed changes aim to consolidate existing conservation programs to increase efficiency and reduce confusion. Questions arise regarding the expected savings from these consolidations and plans for utilizing them. Additionally, concerns are raised about inconsistencies in funding proposals for working lands conservation programs, with the Administration proposing to increase funding for CSP and EQIP in the farm bill while reducing them in the FY2008 budget proposal. The Administration proposes to reduce CSP and EQIP funding in the budget, with EQIP authorized at $1.27 billion and the budget requesting $1.0 billion, and CSP estimated at $451 million with a request for $316 million. Questions arise about how the proposed increases in mandatory conservation programs in the farm bill would offset these cuts. EQIP offers cost-share payments, technical assistance, and incentive payments for conservation practices on private working lands through programs like GSWC and CIG. The program targets agricultural water needs for water savings, similar to the Klamath Basin program. CIG fosters innovative conservation approaches. Other programs like WHIP, AMA, and Forest Land Enhancement Program focus on wildlife habitat, risk mitigation, and resource concerns on private forest lands. The Secretary suggests consolidating existing cost-share programs due to duplication in requirements and policies. The Secretary recommends consolidating existing cost-share programs into a newly designed EQIP program and creating a Regional Water Enhancement Program. The proposal includes additional funding for the CIG program to address a backlog of unfunded applications. The increase in funding would be $4.25 billion over the current services baseline, raising concerns about USDA's capacity to handle the workload. The USDA's proposal includes consolidating cost-share programs into EQIP and creating a Regional Water Enhancement Program. Questions arise about the capacity to address the application backlog and the timeline for reaching full spending authority. Concerns also arise about how specialized programs targeting specific resource concerns would be affected by consolidation. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) offers technical and financial assistance for addressing water and soil resource concerns. It operates with three tiers of conservation and funding, with Tier III receiving the highest payments. CSP financial assistance includes stewardship, maintenance, cost-share, and enhancement payments. The Conservation Security Program (CSP) offers financial assistance for conservation efforts in eligible watersheds. Limited funding has constrained the program to 298 out of 2,119 watersheds, with proposed adjustments including changes to payment types, tier consolidation, and funding expansion to $8.5 billion. Key questions include how participation patterns may change and potential overlap with the Conservation Enhancement Option in Title I. The proposed Private Lands Protection Program would consolidate three existing programs: the Farmland Protection Program (FPP), the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), and the Healthy Forest Reserve Program (HFRP). These programs aim to purchase conservation easements, restore and protect rangeland and grasslands, and address forest land habitat for threatened species. The effectiveness of the Conservation Security Program (CSP) is questioned due to limited technical assistance funding, with no recommendation to repeal the 15% limitation. The Secretary recommends consolidating the Farmland Protection Program (FPP), Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP), and Healthy Forest Reserve Program (HFRP) into a new Private Lands Protection Program, increasing funding by $900 million over 10 years. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) remove cropland for conservation use with rental payments and cost-share assistance. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a land retirement program with a spending of $1.828 billion in FY2005. The program aims to convert land for environmental improvement, limited to 39.2 million acres. The Secretary recommends reauthorization with a focus on environmentally sensitive lands, prioritizing whole-field enrollment for energy-related biomass production. Rental payments are limited to income forgone or costs incurred by participants for conservation requirements during biomass harvesting for energy production. The proposal raises questions about conflicting components in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) regarding biomass harvesting on environmentally sensitive lands. The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program (WREP) provide assistance to private landowners for wetland restoration and protection. The Secretary recommends consolidating WRP with the floodplain easement program. The Secretary recommends consolidating the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) with the floodplain easement program of the Emergency Watershed Program and increasing the enrollment cap to 3.5 million acres, which would result in a significant financial increase. Questions are raised about the impact on local economies and the President's no-net-loss goal, as well as the possibility of achieving wetlands conservation objectives under a working-lands program. The 1985 farm bill included the first conservation compliance requirement for farmers participating in USDA programs. The Administration recommends expanding conservation compliance provisions to include new \"Sod Saver\" rules, creating disincentives for converting grassland into crop production. Sod Saver would make newly converted grasslands permanently ineligible for USDA programs. The Administration proposes the Sod Saver rule to discourage converting grasslands to cropland, making them ineligible for USDA programs. Questions arise about the effectiveness of Sodbuster and the lack of federal assistance for off-site damages caused by cultivation. The Administration proposes the Sod Saver rule to discourage converting grasslands to cropland, making them ineligible for USDA programs. Beginning and limited-resource farmers receive additional incentives in conservation programs through various funding mechanisms and targeted initiatives. The largest incentive is the increase in cost-share payments in EQIP. Other programs also have initiatives directed toward these farmers. The Administration recommends reserving 10% of farm bill conservation financial assistance for beginning farmers, socially disadvantaged producers, and limited-resource farmers. The Secretary may reallocate funds if unused. Implementation may impact commercial farmers' participation in conservation programs. $50 million over 10 years is proposed for developing uniform standards. The Administration recommends allocating $50 million over 10 years to develop uniform standards for environmental services and encourage new private sector environmental markets. The focus is on establishing credit registries and offering credit audit certification services to supplement existing conservation programs. The goal is to enhance disaster assistance to private landowners through market-based approaches. The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) are currently administered by different agencies. The Secretary is proposing to consolidate them into a new Emergency Landscape Restoration Program to address confusion and frustration during natural disasters. The new program would have discretionary funding and the agency responsible for administering it is yet to be determined. Land eligibility differences between the two programs are also being considered for consolidation. The consolidation of the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program and the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) into a new Emergency Landscape Restoration Program is being considered to address confusion during natural disasters. Land eligibility differences between the two programs are under review for potential consolidation. Funding for USDA agricultural trade programs is authorized in farm bills, with the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural exports. The 2002 farm bill authorized the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program (TASC) to address barriers related to specialty crops. TASC is funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation's borrowing authority, with funding levels increasing from $2 million annually to $10 million by FY2015. USDA proposes to expand funding for TASC, increase maximum project awards to $500,000, and allow more flexibility in project timelines. USDA requests funding for the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program (TASC) to allow for larger projects and better quality proposals. They propose funding on a mandatory basis using CCC's borrowing authority. The Market Access Program (MAP) supports overseas marketing for U.S. high-value agricultural products. The Market Access Program (MAP) funds overseas marketing and promotional activities for U.S. agricultural trade associations, cooperatives, state-regional trade groups, and small businesses. It supports generic and brand-name promotion, with funding levels authorized at $875 million over six years. The program is mandatory and funded by the CCC, with a proposed increase of $25 million annually to address inequities between program crops and non-program commodities. The USDA's farm bill proposal includes a recommendation to increase MAP funding by $25 million annually to address inequities between program crops and non-program commodities. This increase aims to assist specialty crop producers and firms, with a focus on overseas marketing and promotional activities. The impact of MAP on increasing U.S. agricultural exports and addressing non-tariff barriers, such as unscientific SPS standards, is also being evaluated. The Administration's farm bill proposes a new grant program to address SPS issues for all commodities, funded by the CCC at $2 million annually. This program aims to tackle barriers threatening U.S. agricultural exports, focusing on issues like antimicrobial treatments, wood packaging material, biotechnology, and mycotoxins. Grants would support projects to reduce the need for permanent technical staff and involve the private sector. The USDA proposes a new grant program funded by the CCC to address significant SPS barriers affecting U.S. agricultural exports. The program aims to involve the private sector, commission scientific reports, and utilize outside technical experts to tackle issues like antimicrobial treatments, wood packaging material, biotechnology, and mycotoxins. The USDA requests mandatory funding for this initiative to address technical trade barriers in international forums and WTO dispute settlement. Countries are using technical trade barriers to restrict U.S. agricultural imports. The U.S. is increasing involvement in international bodies to establish food safety standards. USDA is requesting $15 million over 10 years to enhance staff support at these organizations. The USDA is seeking funding to close the compensation gap for senior staff in international organizations to influence decision making and cover costs for professional officers focusing on U.S. SPS priorities. The Administration is concerned about the lack of U.S. funding leading to a more Eurocentric approach at the FAO, potentially conflicting with U.S. objectives in reducing technical trade barriers. The increased number of U.S. agricultural trade disputes has led commodity groups and agribusiness firms to seek recourse under U.S. trade remedy laws to address unfair competition. The process of pursuing a dispute case is complex, lengthy, and costly, especially for smaller agricultural industries. The Administration is requesting broad discretionary authority to provide support to agriculture groups with limited resources to assist them in resolving trade disputes and eliminating technical trade barriers. The USDA is seeking authority to assist smaller agricultural groups affected by unfair foreign trade practices and to pursue trade dispute cases on their behalf. This includes providing technical assistance for trade disputes and determining eligibility criteria for assistance. The USDA is proposing $20 million in funding over 10 years to expand agricultural extension programs in fragile countries, aiming to support agriculture sectors and food safety. This initiative is part of the U.S. government's efforts to address development needs in unstable areas like Sudan or Somalia. The funding would help in agricultural reconstruction and extension efforts, benefiting those reliant on agriculture for food and employment. USDA administers export credit guarantee programs to facilitate sales of U.S. agricultural exports by providing financing to foreign buyers. The programs guarantee repayment in case of borrower default, allowing for more favorable interest rates and longer repayment periods. Eligible countries are determined by USDA, and the use of guarantees for foreign aid or debt rescheduling is prohibited. The GSM-103 program guarantees intermediate-term financing up to 10 years, SCGP guarantees deferred payment sales up to 180 days, and FGP improves handling, marketing, storage, or distribution facilities for U.S. commodities in emerging markets. The 2002 farm bill authorized $6.5 billion annually for guarantee programs, with $1.0 billion for emerging markets. FAS determines allocation between short and intermediate term programs based on market conditions and demand. Program activity has declined in recent years. The USDA guarantee programs have seen a decline in activity over the last three years due to reduced demand and changes made to comply with a WTO ruling. In FY2006, almost $1.4 billion in guarantees were approved, down from $2.6 billion in FY2005. The Administration is proposing statutory changes to reform the programs to ensure WTO compliance, including removing the 1% fee cap and terminating the SCGP program. The budget impact of guarantees is minimal, reflecting only administrative costs and loan subsidies. The USDA is proposing changes to guarantee programs to comply with WTO rulings, including removing the 1% fee cap and terminating the SCGP program due to loan defaults and fraud. The cost of changes to the FGP would be minor. Questions include the impact of higher loan guarantee fees on participation, the prospect of collecting on $200 million in loan defaults, and reasons for declining interest in USDA loan guarantees. The USDA established the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) in 1985 to help U.S. commodities compete globally. EEP has been inactive in recent years, with an annual program level of $478 million set by the 2002 farm bill. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to consult with Congress every two years and prepare a Global Market Strategy report. Administrative costs for one report are about $250,000. The USDA proposes to repeal the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) and the Global Market Strategy report mandate due to program inactivity and redundancy. This would allow the USDA to focus resources on priority issues and align with the U.S. objective to eliminate export subsidies worldwide. The USDA proposes to repeal export subsidy programs like the Export Enhancement Program and focus on existing programs like the United Export Strategy and Country Strategy. These programs include food aid initiatives like P.L. 480, Food for Progress, McGovern-Dole, and Section 416(b) of the Agricultural Act of 1949. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized these programs except for Section 416(b), which is permanently authorized. The USDA has programs like P.L. 480, Food for Progress, McGovern-Dole, and Section 416(b) to provide food aid. Title I offers low-interest loans for purchasing U.S. agricultural commodities, while Title II donates commodities for emergency and non-emergency food needs. Funding for these programs is set between $1.6 and $1.7 billion annually. The Food for Progress Program, funded by the CCC, supports countries expanding free enterprise. The McGovern-Dole program uses commodities and financial assistance to support education and nutrition programs in foreign countries. The program level for FY2006 was $97 million, with donations dependent on CCC commodity availability. The Emerson Trust provides emergency food relief when U.S. supplies are short. Title II of P.L. 480 is used to purchase and ship U.S. agricultural commodities overseas. The Administration seeks authority to quickly meet emergency food needs overseas by using cash for immediate relief until U.S. commodities arrive or filling gaps in the food aid pipeline. U.S.-sourced food aid takes months to arrive, while local purchases can be done in days or weeks. The Administration's farm bill proposes using up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of emergency food to respond more quickly to those in need. The Administration's proposal seeks to use cash for immediate relief to quickly respond to emergency food needs overseas. This would involve using up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of emergency food. Key questions include past examples of how this authority could have helped alleviate food emergencies, identifying developing countries for food purchases, assessing the sufficiency of current resources for global needs, considering additional funding for programs like McGovern-Dole, and understanding the impact on food aid availability for development purposes. The Administration's proposal aims to use cash for immediate relief by allocating up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchase and distribution of emergency food. Key questions include the impact on the availability of U.S. food aid for development purposes and the effect of using U.S. funds to purchase overseas commodities on the support for the U.S. food aid program by various groups. Additionally, there are considerations regarding retirement savings plans and their exclusion as assets when determining food stamp eligibility. The TANF program can align federal disregard with their rules, making food stamp asset eligibility rules irrelevant for TANF and SSI recipients. Rules for retirement savings/plans vary by state and applicant type. Countable assets for food stamps include retirement/education savings, liquid resources, some illiquid resources, and household-owned vehicles. The Administration proposes to disregard retirement savings and plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, aiming to encourage retirement savings and remove penalties for those in temporary need. Critics suggest further liberalizing asset treatment, while others argue that current state TANF options and automatic food stamp eligibility for TANF/SSI recipients provide enough flexibility. The proposal is estimated to cost $548 million over five years and $1.305 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposal aims to disregard retirement savings for food stamp eligibility, costing $548 million over five years and $1.305 billion over 10 years. Questions arise about the impact on food stamp applicants and the need to raise the asset limits for eligibility. The Administration is urged to consider standardizing and simplifying rules for vehicles as assets, similar to retirement savings. Questions are raised about the cost-effectiveness of keeping a food stamp asset test and the elimination of asset tests for TANF benefits in some states. Current food stamp rules provide federal matching for state support for work-related expenses, but employed recipients do not receive similar support. The Administration proposes a pilot project to assist households with work-related expenses, excluding child care costs, to support work and self-sufficiency. Critics question the effectiveness of the project. The Administration proposes a pilot project to assist employed food stamp recipients with work-related expenses, but critics question its effectiveness due to dollar and covered-expense restrictions. Concerns include the limited $3 million budget, lack of evaluation costs, and potential productivity compared to TANF initiatives. Additionally, questions arise about whether this support will become a regular feature of the Food Stamp program if successful. The Administration proposes to eliminate caps on expense deductions for dependent care costs in the food stamp program to help working families. Critics argue for recognizing high non-food living expenses like shelter costs. The estimated cost for this proposal is $20 million over five years and $42 million. The Administration estimates costs for lifting dollar caps on dependent-care expense deductions at $20 million over five years and $42 million over 10 years. Questions arise about the impact on households affected and the possibility of lifting dollar caps on shelter-expense deductions. Current food stamp policy allows for disregarding college savings plans as assets if deemed \"inaccessible,\" with states having the discretion to exclude them based on TANF or Medicaid policies. State agencies must assess the accessibility of education savings unless they have rules in place that disregard them. The Administration proposes to disregard IRS-approved postsecondary education savings plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, aiming to promote education savings and eliminate penalties for applicants. This aligns with current policies allowing states to exclude these savings based on TANF or Medicaid rules. The Administration's proposal aims to disregard IRS-approved postsecondary education savings plans as assets for food stamp eligibility, to promote education savings and simplify program administration. Critics suggest further liberalizing asset treatment, while the estimated cost of the proposal is $8 million over five years and $18 million over 10 years. The Administration is considering raising the dollar limits on countable assets for food stamp eligibility and standardizing rules for disregarding vehicles as assets. The Administration is proposing to permanently disregard combat-related military pay as income for determining food stamp eligibility and benefits. This would align with the current practice of disregarding this pay through appropriations laws since FY2005. Additionally, the Defense Department offers a Family Assistance Supplemental Allowance to military families to increase their income and reduce the need for food stamp participation, but few families opt for this option. The Administration is proposing to permanently disregard combat-related military pay as income for food stamp eligibility. Critics suggest using the Defense Department's special allowance program instead. The estimated cost of the proposal is $5 million over five years and $10 million over 10 years. The proposal is included in the Administration's FY2008 budget package. The Food Stamp program, originally established in 1939, used actual stamps that were pasted into booklets by grocers for cash redemption. After World War II, the program was closed down due to surplus food production. Revived in the 1960s, participants received paper coupons until the switch to electronic benefit transfer cards. The Food Stamp program has transitioned to using electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards for delivering benefits. The Administration suggests renaming the program to the Food and Nutrition program to reflect the changes in benefit delivery and focus on nutrition. USDA sought public input on renaming the program and received various suggestions. Questions remain about the cost of renaming the program, the number of states using alternative names for their EBT-based programs, and the possibility of keeping the existing name while allowing states to choose their own program names. The Administration proposes to \"de-obligate\" unredeemed food stamp coupons to save costs. They estimate a net savings of $2 million over five years and $7 million over 10 years. The Administration envisions setting a time deadline for redeeming outstanding coupons. The Administration proposes changes to food stamp benefit collection procedures, aiming to promote program integrity and fair treatment of recipients. States may retain a portion of collections unless over-issuance was due to state agency negligence or fraud. States could be liable to repay the federal government for over-issued benefits caused by systemic errors. The Administration is proposing changes to food stamp benefit collection procedures to ensure program integrity and fair treatment of recipients. Critics are concerned about the potential \"chilling effect\" on state efforts to improve administration. Questions arise about defining \"widespread systemic errors\" and the new authority to collect from states for over-issued benefits. The Administration is proposing changes to food stamp benefit collection procedures to ensure program integrity and fair treatment of recipients. Concerns arise about the impact on state innovation in administering food stamps and the potential for states to exploit categorical eligibility options. The Administration's proposal aims to restrict automatic eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, to prevent potential abuse of the system. Critics argue that this change could harm working households with high non-food expenses and those transitioning off cash welfare. They also highlight concerns about increased administrative costs. The Administration's proposal aims to restrict automatic eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs, to prevent potential abuse of the system. Critics argue that this change could harm working households with high non-food expenses and those transitioning off cash welfare. There would be added administrative costs and some households would lose their categorical food stamp eligibility, affecting their eligibility for free school meals for their children. The Administration estimates savings of $611 million over five years and $1.360 billion over 10 years. The Administration's proposal aims to limit automatic eligibility for food stamps to those receiving cash benefits under TANF programs to prevent potential abuse. Critics argue this change could harm working households with high non-food expenses. The proposal could result in added administrative costs and some households losing categorical food stamp eligibility, affecting their eligibility for free school meals. The Administration estimates savings of $611 million over five years and $1.360 billion over 10 years. The proposal raises questions about the number of affected households, budget savings, state issues with expansive eligibility, potential loopholes, and added administrative costs for states. The Administration seeks more flexibility in imposing fines on retailers violating food stamp rules, aiming to impose fines for minor violations and fines in addition to disqualification for major violations. Critics question the extent of the problem and USDA's clarity on the issue. The Administration aims to impose fines on retailers for minor violations and fines in addition to disqualification for major violations of food stamp rules. Critics are concerned about the lack of clarity on the issue and the need for new authority to impose fines instead of disqualification in minor cases. The Administration proposes to allow the USDA to seize retailers' food stamp receipts in certain egregious trafficking cases to increase enforcement effectiveness. Critics are concerned about the potential framing and use of this new authority, fearing it may pre-judge accused retailers. The Administration proposes to allow the USDA to seize retailers' food stamp receipts in certain egregious trafficking cases to increase enforcement effectiveness. The proposal aims to disqualify those who exchange food purchased with food stamp benefits for cash. The Administration's proposal aims to disqualify individuals who exchange food purchased with food stamp benefits for something other than cash. The Food Stamp program has a quality control system to measure erroneous determinations, with overpayment rates at 4.53% and underpayments at 1.31% for FY2005. States with consistently high error rates may face fiscal sanctions. States with high error rates may face fiscal sanctions, calculated based on improper payments and proper payments not made. Eight states currently have a sanction liability totaling $3.6 million. Some states may receive bonus payments for improved payment accuracy. The food stamp QC system also measures states' improper denials, suspensions, or terminations of applicants/recipients. In FY2005, the national average negative action error rate was 6.91%, with nine states having rates over 50%. The national average negative action error rate was 6.91%, with nine states having rates 50% or more above the national average. States with high error rates may receive bonus payments for improved accuracy, while overpayment and underpayment error rates have been decreasing. The Administration proposes penalties for states with consecutive high error rates, equal to 5% of the federal share of food stamp administrative costs. The Administration's proposal aims to impose penalties for high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. Critics argue that the proposal re-opens the 2002 farm bill agreement with states and imposes overly large penalties without sufficient justification. The estimated savings from this proposal are $57 million over five years and $166 million over 10 years. The proposed sanctions for high rates of improper negative actions are significantly higher than those for food stamp overpayments and underpayments. The Administration's proposal aims to impose penalties for high negative action error rates to promote program integrity and correct eligibility determinations. The 2002 farm bill abandoned the previous practice of assessing sanctions as a reduction in federal share of state administrative costs in favor of sanctions based on the dollar value of improperly paid benefits. The Administration's chosen sanction method for high rates of negative actions raises questions about exacerbating the problem and potential cuts in federal matching payments for state costs like nutrition education and work programs. States at risk of fiscal sanctions for high error rates may invest in federally approved improvements to administration using unmatched state funds. The Administration proposes to eliminate the option for states to invest in administrative improvements instead of paying fiscal sanctions for high error rates in the Food Stamp program. Critics argue that this recommendation reopens the 2002 agreement without sufficient rationale. Minimal cost savings are estimated from this proposal. The Administration's proposal aims to enhance nutrition education efforts for food stamp recipients and low-income populations. The proposal includes specific language in the Food Stamp Act to support nutrition education as an approved activity. This is in response to rising obesity rates among Americans. The USDA nutrition programs support nutrition education activities to combat rising obesity rates among Americans. Efforts include funding state nutrition education for food stamp recipients, providing materials for schoolchildren, revising school meal patterns, and implementing mandatory nutrition education in the WIC program. The Administration's proposal includes competitive grants to address obesity in low-income populations with evaluations of the results. The USDA is launching a five-year, $20 million per year initiative to address obesity among low-income Americans. Ideas being considered include point-of-sale incentives for fruit and vegetable purchases by food stamp recipients, grants to connect food stamp shoppers with farmers' markets, and education programs promoting healthy diets and physical activity. The initiative aims to coordinate with existing child nutrition and WIC programs, with states required to submit plans for USDA approval every four years. The Administration proposes to make TEFAP state plans effectively permanent, only requiring revisions when necessary due to changes in operations or rules. Critics question the burden of resubmitting state plans every four years, emphasizing the importance of TEFAP state plans as states have significant control over program rules and operations. The current requirement for new state TEFAP plans every four years is questioned by critics, who suggest making the plans effectively permanent with revisions as needed. States have significant control over program rules and operations, including the selection of local organizations to distribute TEFAP foods. The Administration proposes to require states to re-compete contracts with TEFAP distributing organizations every three years to encourage new, more efficient providers. Critics question the feasibility of competitive selection due to varying state programs. The Administration's proposal to re-compete contracts with TEFAP distributing agencies every three years is being questioned for its feasibility due to the varying nature of state programs. Critics raise concerns about the potential termination and reassignment of all contracts simultaneously, the cost of competitive solicitations, and the confusion that may arise among recipients when distribution systems change. The Administration is revising the method for allocating federal payments for administrative costs for FDPIR, seeking increased funding of $26-$27 million over 10 years. Critics question the initiative's placement in the farm bill and its alignment with current FDPIR law. The decision on a new allocation method has not been finalized. The Administration is seeking increased funding of $26-$27 million over 10 years for FDPIR administrative payments. Questions remain about the new allocation method and its impact on tribal organizations receiving current allotments or modest increases. The proposal's details and potential inclusion in law are also under scrutiny. The Administration is proposing changes to food stamp laws to disqualify those disqualified from the FDPIR in order to ensure program integrity and consistent eligibility rules. Critics question the need for new provisions in the law to achieve this goal. The Administration proposes changes to food stamp laws to disqualify those disqualified from the FDPIR for program integrity. SFMNP vouchers may be disregarded in means-tested public assistance programs to align with other nutrition benefits. States may be prohibited from SFMNP participation if sales taxes are charged on food purchases. The Administration recommends prohibiting states from charging sales taxes on SFMNP voucher purchases to align with other nutrition assistance programs. Additionally, a $6 million survey of school food purchases is proposed every five years to gather data for USDA efforts in implementing new meal pattern rules. The Administration proposes new rules for school meal patterns to align with Dietary Guidelines, manage USDA commodities for schools, and assess economic impact. Critics question if this should be in the farm bill. USDA acquires over $300 million annually in fruits and vegetables for schools, with an additional $50 million proposed for the School Lunch program. The Administration is proposing new rules for school meal patterns to align with Dietary Guidelines and manage USDA commodities for schools. Critics are concerned about the lack of expansion in the fresh fruit and vegetable program and the proposed $50 million increase in fruit and vegetable purchases for the School Lunch program. Questions arise about how the funding will be distributed among schools and if it will be mandatory. \"Section 32 is a permanent appropriation that allocates 30% of annual customs receipts to support the farm sector. Most of this funding goes towards child nutrition programs, with a portion used to purchase non-price-supported commodities for schools. These purchases, totaling over $900 million annually, include both required and surplus commodities.\" The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service purchases fruits and vegetables using Section 32 authority, totaling over $900 million annually. USDA proposes to increase these purchases by at least $200 million per year to promote healthy diets. Critics are concerned about the impact on support for other commodities. The Administration's farm bill proposals do not include new spending for the increased purchases, raising questions about how the cost will be covered. The USDA proposes to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million annually using Section 32 authority. Questions arise about how the cost will be covered, potential impact on other commodity support, unobligated funds carryover, legislative authority, and implementation assurance by future Administrations. The USDA proposes to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million annually using Section 32 authority. The Administration also suggests revisions to farm loan programs to enhance availability for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers. The Administration proposes changes to farm loan programs to target more loans to beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, increasing the maximum loan size to account for inflation. The cost of these changes is zero as they are funded by discretionary appropriations. The distribution of program benefits may be affected, but actual spending levels will still be controlled by appropriators. The Administration proposes to double the targeting percentage for direct operating loans and increase the targeting of direct farm ownership loans. New re-pooling procedures would redistribute funds to targeted groups of farmers before others. Additionally, the Administration plans to enhance the beginning farmer down payment program by lowering interest rates, eliminating property value caps, decreasing producer contributions, deferring payments, and adding socially disadvantaged farmers as eligible applicants. The Administration proposes to raise the borrower limit on direct farm ownership and operating loans to a combined $500,000, not indexed for inflation. This is slightly higher than the current $400,000 total across the two types of loans. The rationale for indexing guaranteed loans and not direct loans is questioned. The 2002 farm bill required a study on the effectiveness of USDA's direct and guaranteed loan programs, questioning the need for direct loans in rural housing programs. USDA's experience with the pilot program to guarantee contract land sales was also examined. The USDA's Rural Development mission area includes three agencies responsible for various programs such as rural housing, business-cooperative services, and utilities. Additionally, the agency administers initiatives like Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, Rural Economic Partnership Zones, and the National Rural Development Partnership. The Critical Access Hospital Program, created by the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, ensures Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas have access to healthcare services and supports the development of integrated health delivery systems. The Administration proposes mandatory funding for guaranteed loans and grants to complete reconstruction and rehabilitation of all certified Rural Critical Access Hospitals. This budgetary impact amounts to $80 million for loan guarantees and $5 million for grants over 10 years. In FY2007, USDA supported 53 critical access hospitals with $260 million in loans and guarantees. The Community Facilities program has a total loan guarantee budget authority of $208 million. The Administration is proposing $500 million in the 2007 farm bill for backlogged loan and grant applications to improve infrastructure and essential services for sustainable economic development. The Administration is proposing $500 million in the 2007 farm bill to address the backlog of infrastructure projects. Questions arise about how the funds will be allocated among communities and projects, especially with the proposed termination of certain grant programs. The farm bill also includes proposals for broadband access, distance learning, and telemedicine programs, raising concerns about the consistency of funding levels and program terminations. The FY2008 budget proposal aims to terminate long-standing programs that provide loans and grants for business development and infrastructure in rural areas. The Administration's farm bill suggests consolidating these programs into new platforms to streamline operations. The Administration proposes to consolidate USDA energy grant and research program authorities under the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, with proposed mandatory funding of $500 million over 10 years. Competitive grants would be increased to $150 million over 10 years. The funding aims to support various renewable energy activities across different geographic areas. The Department of Energy (DOE) is investing $385 million in six biorefinery projects using cellulosic feedstocks. The Administration proposes to consolidate USDA energy grant programs, increase funding to $210 million, and prioritize biorefinery construction. This platform aims to support renewable energy activities and provide economic development potential for rural America. The Administration proposes to support $2.17 billion in guaranteed loans over 10 years, with a focus on cellulosic ethanol projects. The loan cap for cellulosic ethanol projects would be raised to $100 million, and the cap on loan guarantee fees would be eliminated. Funding would prioritize biorefinery construction. Questions arise about the level of funding for corn-based ethanol and support for other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power. The Administration proposes to consolidate rural grants programs into a single law to enhance assistance to rural areas and address obstacles within USDA Rural Development's mission agencies. The 2008 budget request calls for terminating two programs to focus on cellulosic ethanol projects, raising loan caps, and prioritizing biorefinery construction. Questions remain about funding for corn-based ethanol and potential crowding out of other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power. The Administration's FY2008 budget request aims to consolidate rural grants programs to enhance assistance to rural areas. This includes terminating programs like Rural Business Enterprise Grants and Rural Business Opportunity Grants to focus on cellulosic ethanol projects and prioritize biorefinery construction. Questions arise about the impact on funding for corn-based ethanol and other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power. The FY2008 budget proposes consolidating rural grants programs to focus on cellulosic ethanol projects and prioritize biorefinery construction. Questions remain about the impact on funding for corn-based ethanol and other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar power. The proposed community programs platform aims to consolidate various community programs, including those targeting rural areas with high unemployment and outmigration. However, two programs, Economic Impact Grants and Community Facility Grants, are slated for termination as they are deemed duplicative of programs in other federal agencies. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized USDA programs in agricultural research, education, and extension through FY2007. The agencies in USDA's Research, Extension, and Economics (REE) mission area include ARS, CSREES, ERS, and NASS. The 2002 farm bill reauthorized USDA programs in agricultural research, education, and extension through FY2007. The agencies in USDA's Research, Extension, and Economics (REE) mission area include ARS, CSREES, ERS, and NASS. The Administration proposes the consolidation of ARS and CSREES into a single agency called the Research, Education, and Extension Service (REES) with the title of Chief Scientist. Land grant universities also propose reorganizing USDA's research mission area with a proposal known as \"CREATE-21\". The proposal \"CREATE-21\" aims to reorganize USDA's research mission area by combining ARS and CSREES into one agency, keeping ERS and NASS in the research mission area, and bringing the research function of the Forest Service under the same administrative umbrella. It also suggests establishing a national institute for research on food and agriculture to support both intra- and extramural science through competitively awarded grants. This proposal mirrors a similar merger in the mid-1970s under the Carter Administration, citing reasons such as reducing redundancy, improving coordination, and directing more resources into research programs. The proposed reorganization of USDA's research mission area aims to combine ARS and CSREES into one agency, while keeping ERS and NASS in the research mission area. The proposal also suggests creating a national institute for research on food and agriculture. The 1994 USDA reorganization combined CSRS and the Extension Service to form CSREES, but intramural and extramural research programs have remained separate for over 25 years. The merger in the 1970s did not function as intended due to a lack of effort to create a new, combined structure and culture. The Forest Service receives $250 million annually for research related to forest lands. Land grant universities propose bringing Forest Service research under the same umbrella as ARS and CSREES. The Department's 2007 farm bill proposal keeps Forest Service research separate. ARS receives direct funding through USDA appropriations acts, while states receive federal funds through CSREES. The Administration has proposed cuts to formula funds for states while maintaining or increasing ARS appropriation. Questions arise regarding the treatment of funding mechanisms under a proposed ARS and CSREES merger, potential changes to formula funding, and the shift towards competitive grants. The CREATE-21 proposal aims to manage a new funding system without financial disadvantage to ARS or state research institutions. Key to the proposal is doubling funding for agricultural research. The Administration's CREATE-21 proposal aims to double funding for agricultural research and extension over the next seven years. It includes a $50 million annual funding for 10 years for an Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative to make agricultural biomass a viable alternative to petroleum and develop industrial products from bioenergy byproducts. Coordination with Department of Energy activities is planned. The Administration proposes a new Specialty Crops Research Initiative with $100 million in annual funding. Questions arise about potential displacement of current ARS work, Department of Energy's control over research funding, and collaboration between public and private research. Concerns also include how funding will be divided between intramural and extramural programs, potential addition of new scientists to ARS, and assurance for specialty crop producers regarding unfunded research programs. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center, a premier U.S. facility for research on foreign animal diseases, is aging and inadequate for current biosecurity research needs. The Department of Homeland Security plans to replace it with a new \"National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility\" (NBAF). The Department of Homeland Security plans to replace the aging Plum Island Animal Disease Center with a new \"National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility\" (NBAF) for research on high consequence foreign animal diseases. Congress has allocated $46 million for planning and site selection, with an estimated construction cost of $451 million. DHS has selected 18 sites in 11 states for further consideration, with a final location to be chosen in early 2008 and construction completion expected in 2013. Plum Island is currently the only approved facility in the U.S. for studying high-consequence foreign livestock diseases like foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The U.S. Code restricts the use of live FMD virus to coastal islands like Plum Island, but there is a proposal to allow research on mainland locations. Plum Island and USDA NVSL in Ames, IA are the only BSL-3 agriculture facilities in the U.S. The U.S. does not have BSL-4 agriculture facilities, which are found in Canada and Australia. The planned NBAF is likely to be a BSL-3 facility, with the possibility of a BSL-4 facility. DHS is already moving forward with building the new laboratory. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is proceeding with building a new laboratory for FMD research on the mainland. Questions arise about the Secretary of Agriculture's regulatory authority and USDA's involvement in the decision-making process. Critics are concerned about security risks if the facility is located in regions with livestock. The advantages and risks of building a biosecurity facility in Kansas compared to a coastal site like Plum Island are being questioned. The comparison between animal and human disease risks at different locations, such as the CDC BSL-4 lab in Georgia versus Plum Island, is also being discussed. The USDA's role in forestry programs and past farm bills addressing cooperative assistance programs are mentioned. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposes new programs for forest planning, grants, wood-to-energy technology, and community forest assistance. The Forest Land Enhancement Program (FLEP) is not being reauthorized. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposes new programs for forest planning, grants, wood-to-energy technology, and community forest assistance. The proposed program aims to address the increasing public demand for forest products and amenities, pressure on landowners to convert forests to other uses, and risk from wildfire by providing financial and technical assistance to state forestry agencies for Statewide Forest Resource Assessments and Plans. Key questions include the effectiveness of statewide planning compared to direct landowner assistance programs like FLEP, the results of existing cost-share assistance programs for private landowners, and how national direction for statewide forest planning can provide flexibility. The Administration's farm bill proposal includes a new landscape-scale forestry competitive grant program to address diverse forests in different states, funding challenges, and the growing demand for forest products. The Administration's farm bill proposal includes a new landscape-scale forestry competitive grant program to address diverse forests in different states, funding challenges, and the growing demand for forest products. The program aims to stimulate local economies through the creation of value-added forest product industries. Key questions include defining \"landscapes\" for the grants, the level of cooperative involvement required from landowners, and how to encourage collaboration across ownership boundaries. The Administration is proposing a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to accelerate development and use of new technologies to utilize low-grade woody biomass that degrade forest health and exacerbate wildfire risks. Key questions include program goals, measurement of progress and effectiveness, and the potential for converting woody biomass to cellulosic ethanol. The Administration is proposing a new wood-to-energy program to utilize low-grade woody biomass for cellulosic ethanol production. The program aims to address forest health and wildfire risks. Additionally, a community forests working lands program is proposed to assist communities in acquiring and conserving forests for sustainable use. The proposed community forests program differs from the existing Forest Legacy program. The federal role in funding and assisting communities in acquiring and conserving local forestlands is outlined in the 2007 farm bill. This bill includes provisions for renewable energy systems and expands federal research on renewable fuels and bioenergy. However, some expiring provisions from the 2002 farm bill are not mentioned. The 2007 farm bill includes provisions for renewable energy systems and expands federal research on renewable fuels and bioenergy. Some expiring provisions from the 2002 farm bill, such as the Energy Audit and Renewable Energy Development Program, went unfunded. Questions arise about dropping these provisions from future legislation and improving coordination between USDA and the Department of Energy. The USDA's energy proposal aims to increase funding for renewable energy programs, with a focus on cellulosic ethanol projects. The farm bill includes incentives for developing a cellulosic-based ethanol industry, but questions remain about its potential. The potential of cellulosic ethanol production raises questions about economic implications, biomass challenges, competition with cattle forage, conservation concerns, and the future of the corn-based ethanol industry. The outlook for corn-based ethanol plants in America is uncertain due to the potential shift towards cellulosic ethanol production. The $0.54 per gallon tariff on imported ethanol protects American ethanol blenders but limits access to adequate ethanol supplies in major coastal regions. The tariff on ethanol imports creates supply issues for major metropolitan areas distant from the Corn Belt. The U.S. ethanol sector receives significant support through tax credits, Renewable Fuels Standard, and federal subsidies totaling $5.1 to $6.8 billion annually. The federal support for the biofuels sector ranges from $5.1 to $6.8 billion annually. There are concerns that subsidies for combustion engines and biofuels may hinder the development of new sustainable technologies. The Administration recommends changes to the Federal Procurement of Biobased Products program for better effectiveness. Additional mandatory funding of $2 million per year is also suggested. Federal law mandates the use of renewable fuel, but future growth may not require federal agency procurement assistance. The Administration proposes consolidating loan program authorities, prioritizing funding for biorefinery construction, and raising the loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants to $100 million. The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Loan Guarantee Program would be consolidated under this platform, with increased funding to $210 million to support $2.17 billion of guaranteed loans over 10 years. The focus would be on energy development in rural areas, particularly cellulosic ethanol production. The Administration proposes prioritizing funding for biorefinery construction and raising the loan guarantee limit on cellulosic plants to $100 million. The focus is on energy development in rural areas, particularly cellulosic ethanol production. There are concerns about the level of funding for corn-based ethanol and the potential crowding out of other renewable energy technologies. The creation of cellulosic ethanol facilities may create local construction employment, but the long-term competitive advantage is uncertain. The Administration proposes consolidating USDA energy grant programs under the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 with $500 million in mandatory funding over 10 years. Competitive grants would increase to $150 million over 10 years, focusing on establishing a self-sustaining cellulosic ethanol industry. The DOE announced a $385 million investment in six biorefinery projects using cellulosic feedstocks. The Administration's energy grants proposal aims to coordinate funding with DOE efforts for rural economic development. The Conservation Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program provide land conservation with annual rental payments. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a significant land retirement program with a budget of $1.828 billion in FY2005, limited to 39.2 million acres. The Secretary proposes reauthorization with a focus on environmentally sensitive lands, prioritizing whole-field enrollment for energy-related biomass production. Harvesting biomass after nesting season would be allowed, with rental payments limited to income foregone or conservation costs. There are concerns about potential conflicts between focusing on idling lands and allowing biomass harvesting. The Administration proposes consolidating USDA energy grant programs under the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, with mandatory funding of $500 million over 10 years. Additionally, a new Agricultural Bioenergy and Biobased Products Research Initiative is proposed with annual funding of $50 million for 10 years. This raises questions about the impact on lands in the Conservation Reserve Program and how priorities for land release would be determined. The Administration is proposing a new 10-year, $150 million wood-to-energy program to accelerate the development and use of new technologies for utilizing low-grade woody biomass. Key questions include potential displacement of current ARS work, management control by the Department of Energy, and collaboration between public and private research. The proposal aims to use technologies to convert low-grade woody biomass into cellulosic ethanol to address forest health and wildfire risks. It also considers the costs, biomass conversion factors, and other critical factors for energy utilization. The federal crop insurance program is permanently authorized, and enhancements have been made to address these factors. The federal crop insurance program has seen major enhancements since 1980, with the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 injecting $8.2 billion in new federal spending primarily through more generous premium subsidies. Despite widening scope and increased subsidies, the goal of eliminating disaster payments has not been achieved, with ad hoc disaster payments provided annually since 1988 for weather-related crop losses. The Administration's farm bill proposal aims to enhance crop insurance participation, address fraud and reduce costs. One significant change would allow farmers to purchase insurance for their deductible portion not covered by existing policies. Additional policy coverage would trigger payments for losses exceeding a set threshold in the producer's county. Cost-saving measures include reducing premium subsidies by 2 to 5 percentage points and charging premiums for catastrophic events. The Administration's farm bill proposal includes reducing premium subsidies by 2 to 5 percentage points, charging premiums for catastrophic coverage, and requiring private insurance companies to absorb more costs. Farmers would also need to purchase crop insurance to participate in farm commodity support programs. The estimated annual cost of the proposed supplemental deductible coverage is $35 million. The 1994 crop insurance act required farmers to purchase a policy to participate in farm commodity programs, but this provision was removed in the 1996 farm bill. The current proposal for mandatory linkage may face opposition from farm groups. \"Section 32\" allocates 30% of annual customs receipts to support the farm sector, with most funds going to child nutrition programs. Some money is used to purchase non-price-supported commodities for schools and feeding programs. The USDA purchases non-price-supported commodities for schools and feeding sites, including \"entitlement\" and \"bonus\" commodities. Fruit and vegetable purchases under Section 32 authority have averaged $308 million per year. USDA proposes to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million per year, but this is not reflected in the Administration's FY2008 budget. The Administration proposes to increase fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million per year, but it is unclear how this will be funded or if other food purchases will be reduced. Questions arise about the unobligated funds in the Section 32 account and whether they will be used to cover the cost. Additionally, it is uncertain if new legislative authority is needed for this proposal. The Department's proposal includes increasing fruit and vegetable purchases by $200 million annually, with questions about funding sources and potential impact on other food purchases. There are concerns about the need for new legislative authority and how the Department determines distribution proportions for domestic nutrition programs. The Administration's farm bill proposal recommends more funding for research and marketing programs to support organic farming growth. Funding sources for this initiative are unclear. The USDA's farm bill initiative aims to address gaps in organic regulations to support enforcement activities, which may require additional funding for personnel and resources. The Department is exploring ways to fund increased program oversight and enforcement as the number of certified operations grows."
