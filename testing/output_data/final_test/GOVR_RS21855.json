    "content": "The Greek city-state of Athens developed the first known democracy around 500 B.C. Modern Greece has been a democracy since 1974. The New Democracy (ND) party and the PanHellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) have alternated leadership. ND was in power from 2004 to 2009. In the 2007 national elections, ND won a slim majority in parliament. PASOK also suffered losses, while smaller parties gained seats, including the ultra-nationalist LAOS party. In 2007, ND lost one seat in parliament due to corruption scandals, law and order crisis, and economic issues. A scandal involving Siemens Group's bribery of politicians tarnished both major parties. Minister George Voulgarakis resigned over allegations of government involvement in a land deal. This led to the resignation of State Minister Theodoros Roussopoulos. The government's ability to maintain public security was questioned after police shot a teenage boy in December 2008, sparking violent protests. In December 2008, police fatally shot a teenage boy, leading to violent protests in Athens and beyond. The riots were attributed to socioeconomic issues and a culture of impunity. Critics criticized the government for its passive response. In June 2009, a police officer's murder highlighted the government's deficiencies in maintaining law and order. PASOK led in public opinion polls and called for early elections. Greece also faced devastating fires in August. In August 2009, Greece faced fires, with criticism towards the government for lack of fire protection improvements. The president is head of state, while the prime minister holds most powers. Former Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias won the presidency in 2005. Prime Minister Karamanlis called for early elections in September 2009 to avoid a prolonged pre-election period. Prime Minister Karamanlis called for early elections in September 2009 to avoid a prolonged pre-election period. The parliamentary elections were rescheduled to October 4, 2009, as PASOK announced it would not support President Papoulias for reelection, forcing the early election. ND's election prospects were dim due to the recession and Greece's budget deficit exceeding EU mandates. Greece faced challenges meeting EU's 3% deficit ceiling and had a national debt of 110% of GDP. The government was criticized for poor performance in firefighting and law enforcement. Prime Minister Karamanlis proposed economic measures including spending cuts and combating tax evasion to address the financial crisis. PASOK leader Papandreou presented a program for his first 100 days in office, focusing on boosting demand with pay increases, protecting borrowers, freezing utility rates, passing tax reforms, increasing public investments, and supporting employment. The plan aimed to address economic challenges and stimulate the economy with a price tag of \u20ac3 billion or U.S.$4.38. Papandreou's PASOK stimulus plan, costing \u20ac3 billion or U.S.$4.38 billion, aimed to increase unemployment benefits funded by better tax collection, EU cohesion policy funds, and public-sector real estate. Other parties like LAOS focused on nationalist and populist themes, while SYRIZA dealt with a leadership dispute. President Alexis Tsipras demanded to lead both SYRIZA and SYN, but faced resistance from other parties in SYRIZA. Some wanted Alekos Alavanos, former head of SYN, to lead the list. SYRIZA entered elections without a leader at the top of its list, and Alvanos did not run for parliament. Greeks were believed to have voted against the ND government rather than for PASOK. Voter turnout was 70.92%, down slightly from 2007. Karamanlis resigned as ND leader and was succeeded by Antonis Samaras. Prime Minister Papandreou proposed a smaller cabinet, created a Vice President position, and reorganized several ministries, including the creation of the Ministry of Economy, Competitiveness, and Shipping. Greece's mixed capitalist economy has the public sector accounting for about 40% of GDP. The ND government cut the budget deficit and taxes on corporations, leading to increased tax revenues. Unemployment initially decreased, but 20% of the population remained below the poverty level. Social security reforms were passed despite opposition. Greece sustained growth through tourism and shipping booms. The European Commission seeks further action in this area. During the second ND term, Greece faced the global financial crisis, leading to a contraction in GDP for three consecutive quarters in 2009. Unemployment reached 9.6% in July and was expected to rise. The country also grappled with a projected budget deficit exceeding 12% of GDP and a debt surpassing 125% of GDP in 2010, amounting to a record \u20ac300 billion (U.S.$442 billion). The debt in Greece reached a record \u20ac300 billion (U.S.$442 billion), leading to credit rating downgrades. The government plans to reduce spending, increase revenues, and implement economic reforms. Greece benefits from EU membership and received financial support. Inflation is controlled due to participation in the euro zone. Authorities have dismantled domestic terrorist groups. The U.S. State Department lists the Revolutionary Organization 17 November (17N) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization responsible for murders of U.S. embassy employees in Athens. Arrests and convictions of 17N members have occurred, but some have been released due to retrials and acquittals. Neither 17N nor Revolutionary Popular Struggle (ELA) are active, but successor groups like Revolutionary Struggle (EA) and Popular Revolutionary Action (LED) operate in Athens. An attack on the U.S. Embassy in Athens in 2007 by EA caused no casualties. In 2009, Revolutionary Struggle claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack at the Athens Stock Exchange causing damage and injuries. Greece implemented EU counterterrorism policies, new secure passports with biometrics, and ratified extradition agreements with the US and EU. The Greek navy participates in NATO's Operation Active Endeavor. Greece is a member of the EU and NATO, engaging in various antiterrorism and security missions. Greece is involved in EU missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, as well as military observer missions in Georgia. The Republic of Cyprus has been divided between Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north since 1974. Greece supports reunification efforts for Cyprus. In 2002, a draft settlement plan was offered by the U.N. Secretary General to unite Greek and Turkish Cypriots. In April 2004, Karamanlis cautiously supported the \"Annan Plan\" for Cyprus, which was rejected by Greek Cypriots but accepted by Turkish Cypriots. The settlement process stalled, with Turkey extending its customs union with the EU to Cyprus but not recognizing the Republic of Cyprus. Greece has backed efforts for reunification, supporting direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders under U.N. auspices since 2008. Greece and Turkey have historically had strained relations but began a period of rapprochement in 1999. Athens supports Turkey's EU membership if it meets EU standards. The two countries share interests in regional peace, bilateral trade, a natural gas pipeline, and combating terrorism. Greece is a significant investor in Turkey, with the National Bank of Greece purchasing a Turkish bank in 2006. Despite progress, unresolved issues like the Cyprus dispute hinder further normalization of relations. The unresolved issues hindering the normalization of relations between Greece and Turkey include the Cyprus dispute, the refusal of Ankara to authorize the reopening of the Greek Orthodox Theological Seminary on the Turkish island of Halki, and disagreements over the ecumenical status of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul. Sharp differences over Aegean Sea sovereignty have led to major crises in the past, prompting over 40 rounds of exploratory talks to address disputes over air space, territorial seas, and related issues. Despite ongoing discussions, no resolution has been reached yet. Greece and Turkey have unresolved issues regarding territorial disputes in the Aegean Sea. Greece wants to take the disagreement to the International Court of Justice, but Turkey does not accept the Court's jurisdiction. Greece also objects to Turkey's infringements on its claimed air space over the Aegean. Territorial disputes between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea have led to tensions, with references to \"gray zones\" and the issue of demilitarization. The lack of a solution is highlighted by disputes arising from oil exploration desires. In 2009, Prime Minister Papandreou visited Istanbul for a meeting, emphasizing the ongoing challenges in the region. The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia's independence in 1991 has led to ongoing disputes with Greece over its name and territory. Greece objects to the Republic of Macedonia using its constitutional name, claiming it usurps Greece's heritage. The two countries signed an interim agreement in 1995 to normalize relations, but have not reached a solution on the name. Greece suggests a compromise composite name like Republic of Northern Macedonia. The international trend favors Macedonia using its constitutional name, with 125 governments recognizing it as the Republic of Macedonia. Despite the name dispute with Greece, Macedonia has no intention of renouncing this recognition. Greece is the top investor in Macedonia, and bilateral trade is strong. Despite the name dispute with Greece, Macedonia maintains strong bilateral trade and investment ties with Greece. However, Macedonian Prime Minister Gruevski's actions, such as calling for recognition of a \"Macedonian minority\" in Greece, have strained relations. Greece, which only recognizes a Muslim minority as per the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, deemed Gruevski's actions as provocative and an attempt to undermine name negotiations. In response, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis denied the existence of a \"Macedonian\" minority and urged Gruevski to move past nationalist rhetoric. In November, Macedonia filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Greece for violating the 1995 Interim Accord. Greece plans to respond with evidence of Skopje's failure to adhere to the agreement. Prime Minister Papandreou agrees with Karamanlis's stance on negotiations with FYROM, linking FYROM's EU entry to resolving the name issue. Greece's EU membership support for Macedonia is on hold due to the name issue. Papandreou has the political capital to compromise. Greece seeks EU membership for Serbia and Balkan neighbors for regional stability. Greece opposes Kosovo's independence and seeks a UN Security Council agreement. Greece does not recognize Kosovo, maintaining a liaison office in Pristina. Athens maintains a liaison office in Pristina and does not recognize Kosovo's independence. Greece also does not recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abhazia. The Papandreou government defends Greece's participation in NATO's Afghan mission for national interests, despite economic constraints. Greece's limited participation in the NATO mission in Afghanistan is due to economic constraints. The country has a small military presence in Afghanistan, with an engineering company and one transport aircraft. Former Defense Minister Evangelos Meimarakis stated that Greece cannot send more troops or equipment to Afghanistan due to defense commitments, particularly regarding perceived threats from Turkey. Greece accuses Turkey of violating its airspace and territorial waters in the Aegean Sea, making it difficult to redeploy aircraft and helicopters. Obama announced plans for Greek forces to take over Kabul International Airport in 2010, with a reinforced strength of 30-40 officers. Greek soldiers were to assist international forces at the airport until then. After the transfer to Afghan control, the mechanized company would move to Herat under Italian command. Greece also planned to deploy a medical unit, a special unit to train Afghan police, and potentially train Afghan soldiers in Greece. Greece modified its plans for military deployment in Afghanistan, with a focus on not relocating forces to higher-risk areas. Former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis called for increased civilian presence for education, culture, and development. Greek Ambassador to NATO provided financial support for development projects in Baghlan province. Greece has good bilateral relations with the United States, based on various ties. The United States operates a Naval Support Activity at Souda Bay in Crete under a mutual defense cooperation agreement. Greece may continue to contribute funds for Afghan reconstruction to ease pressure from NATO allies. The Naval Support Activity at Souda Bay in Crete, operated by the United States, supports U.S. Sixth Fleet Aircraft and U.S. Navy Air Detachments. The Greek government provided strong political support and military assets for counterterrorism after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Greece does not consider the war in Iraq as part of the war against terror and did not participate in training the Iraqi army or allow its military personnel to join a senior officer training mission in Iraq. Greece did not send military personnel to join a senior officer training mission in Iraq but provided training in Bulgaria and equipment to the Iraqi armed forces. The US provided aid for the 2007 wildfires and military education and training funds to Greece in FY2008. In FY2009 and FY2010, Greece received $443,000 in International Military Education and Training (IMET) funds. The United States supports the rapprochement between Greece and Turkey through direct talks. Both countries are part of the U.S.-initiated Southeast Europe Brigade (SEEBRIG). Tensions arose in U.S.-Greek relations when the U.S. recognized FYROM as the Republic of Macedonia in 2004. President Bush supported Macedonia's path to a multiethnic, democratic state and backed U.N.-assisted negotiations between Athens and Skopje. The U.S. regretted Greece's refusal to agree to a NATO invitation for Macedonia due to the unresolved name issue. The Bush Administration would have accepted a NATO invitation for Macedonia as the FYROM. Greece is not part of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program due to not meeting eligibility criteria post-9/11. The Greek government prioritized joining the Visa Waiver Program after issuing more secure passports in 2006. The Department of Homeland Security is working on including Greece in the program. Legislation introduced in 2009 aims to designate Greece as a program country for the Visa Waiver Program. Greece values its role as an international energy hub but faced concerns from the Bush Administration regarding energy links to Russia. The Bush Administration had concerns about Greece's energy links to Russia, fearing increased dependence. They supported the Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline to diversify energy sources. The Obama Administration remained neutral on the South Stream pipeline. Anti-American sentiment in Greece stems from past events like U.S. support for the Greek military junta and perceived inaction during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In 1974, there was an invasion/intervention in Cyprus. Allegations of U.S. interference in Greek political affairs surface regularly, leading to anti-American sentiment and mass demonstrations by various groups."
