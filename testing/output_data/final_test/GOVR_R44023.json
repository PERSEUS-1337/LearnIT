    "content": "The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a congressionally mandated document, originating in the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. It has been an unclassified document published by the President since 1987, highlighting broad national security priorities of each Administration. The FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act amended the NSS to be presented to Congress in classified form, with an unclassified summary. The Obama Administration released a new NSS in 2015. The 2015 National Security Strategy (NSS) document, the second under the Obama Administration, outlines principles and priorities for American power and influence in the world. It emphasizes U.S. leadership, strategic patience, and persistence in a fluid strategic environment. The strategy aims to shape events and advance national interests by evolving American leadership. The 2015 National Security Strategy (NSS) emphasizes a diversified and balanced set of priorities for the world's leading global power. It retains key elements from the 2010 version, focusing on national security, a strong economy, universal values, and a rules-based international order. It also emphasizes cooperation and the importance of international institutions. The 2015 National Security Strategy (NSS) shifts emphasis from galvanizing collective action to leading with strength, capable partners, and all instruments of U.S. power. This suggests a more direct U.S. role in diplomacy and potential military operations, moving towards more involved leadership within international institutions and between nations. The 2010 NSS focused on improving security, completing initiatives, and strengthening security at home. It aimed to disrupt Al Qaeda, prevent the spread of weapons, advance peace in the Middle East, and secure cyberspace. In contrast, the 2015 NSS reflects a more turbulent world, emphasizing the need for direct leadership in the face of global threats. The 2015 NSS emphasizes a more challenging environment and a need for direct leadership by the United States. It focuses on strengthening national defense, combating terrorism, preventing conflict, and addressing climate change, envisioning a more active U.S. role in the world compared to the 2010 NSS. The 2015 NSS highlights national security challenges, including climate change, and the need for a comprehensive policy approach. It prioritizes the \"rebalance\" to Asia and the Pacific, in contrast to the 2010 NSS which focused on global themes. The 2015 NSS focuses on regional challenges such as Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North Africa, Africa, and the Americas. It takes a tougher stance on China and Russia while emphasizing the importance of cooperation. The 2015 NSS aims to deter Russian aggression and counter Moscow's propaganda with the truth. Some analysts question if it adequately addresses evolving strategic threats, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. Critics suggest the NSS lacks acknowledgment of significant changes, while others argue it presents a coherent philosophy and accurate assessment. The 2015 NSS is debated for its coherence and accuracy in assessing the world. An analyst describes it as promoting smart multilateralism and emphasizes the importance of the US's economic and military strength in global institutions. The FY2016 NDAA mandates a study on the DOD's role in national security strategy formulation, examining its relationship with the National Military Strategy and prior Quadrennial Defense Reviews. The study mandated by the FY2016 NDAA examines factors contributing to successful national security strategies, including strategy updates, synchronization, prioritization, roles and responsibilities, resourcing, and implementation within agencies. The FY2017 NDAA adds a focus on the capabilities and limitations of the DOD workforce responsible for strategic planning. A report is due to the Secretary of Defense by May 25, 2017. The report to the Secretary of Defense, due by May 25, 2017, includes a nation's strategy as a decision on how to use national power in all its forms, including military power. Strategic thinkers have expanded the definition to include the development and utilization of all the nation's resources for implementing policy in war. A national strategy involves coordinating national power to achieve objectives, linking resources and activities. The U.S. military's doctrine emphasizes using all instruments of power for national strategic objectives. The distinction between \"national security strategy\" and \"national strategy\" lies in achieving national objectives in conflict. Congress plays a significant role in determining means for national strategy. The 2015 NSS outlines threats to U.S. interests and goals across various areas, but lacks clear links between objectives, resources, and activities. Congress should assess if the NSS effectively connects ends, means, and ways, and establishes priorities among goals. The National Security Strategy (NSS) from 1987 to 2015 has been submitted to Congress multiple times, with varying frequencies under different administrations. Some analysts criticize the NSS for being influenced by political rather than strategic considerations. Some analysts wanted Congress to play a larger role in reviewing U.S. national security strategy by suggesting an independent commission for a strategic review. Congress responded by changing legislative requirements for strategy documents prepared by the Department of Defense in the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2017 NDAA established a Commission on the National Defense Strategy to shape assumptions for the next strategy review. Congress may have a role in the classification level of the NSS process, with recent administrations not producing a classified NSS. The challenge for Administrations preparing multiple NSS reports is how to approach subsequent versions amidst significant flux in the international security situation. The 2015 NSS was delayed due to world events making drafts obsolete, leading to the conclusion that the US may be facing a fundamentally new international environment. The 2015 NSS reflects a shift in the international security environment, with renewed great power competition and challenges to the U.S.-led international order. It mentions major developments such as Russia's aggression, conflicts in Syria and Iraq, negotiations with Iran, instability in North Africa, and infectious disease outbreaks in Africa. Some argue that it does not address all challenges to the assumptions of the 2010 NSS. The 2015 NSS raises oversight questions for Congress regarding the accuracy of identifying key features and trends in the international security environment and addressing the shift in the strategic situation since late 2013. It questions whether the 2015 NSS qualifies as a true strategy in linking objectives to means. The 2015 NSS raises oversight questions for Congress regarding the accuracy of identifying key features and trends in the international security environment and addressing the shift in the strategic situation since late 2013. It questions whether the 2015 NSS qualifies as a true strategy in linking objectives to means and establishing priorities among goals. The 2015 NSS raises oversight questions for Congress regarding the accuracy of identifying key features and trends in the international security environment and addressing the shift in the strategic situation since late 2013. Congress may also consider issues associated with the 2015 NSS legislatively as part of the debate over the National Defense Authorization Act. Questions include whether NSS statements are functioning as intended, their value in supporting oversight of Administration policies, and if the mandate requiring NSS reports should be modified or repealed. The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a report issued by the President to Congress annually, as required by the Goldwater-Nichols Act. It must address U.S. interests, goals, policies, commitments, and capabilities in a classified form since FY2017. The National Security Strategy (NSS) is a report issued annually to Congress, addressing U.S. interests, goals, policies, commitments, and capabilities. NSS reports have described objectives and activities to meet those goals, without directly addressing risk. NSSs have been submitted regularly, with some gaps in certain years. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is required to prepare a National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) every four years, starting in 2017. The NIS must align with the national security strategy and other relevant U.S. department plans. The National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) must address national and military intelligence, major security missions, utilization of resources, threat assessment, organizational roles, and strategic sources. The National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) mandates the Director of National Intelligence to assess intelligence needs, identify risks, and analyze factors affecting national security missions. The report must be submitted to congressional intelligence committees within 45 days. The sensitivity of the topics may result in a classified report. The Quadrennial defense strategy reviews are internal DOD processes to formulate national defense strategy. The FY2017 NDAA rescinded the mandate for the Defense Strategy Review/QDR and now requires DOD to prepare a National Defense Strategy every four years. Various strategy reviews were conducted by the Department of Defense after the Cold War to reassess plans and priorities. The first \"Base Force\" review in 1991 shifted focus from global war with the Soviet Union to regional threats and forward presence. The \"Bottom-Up Review\" initiated in 1993 by Les Aspin was a response to the changing security environment post-Soviet Union collapse and the Gulf War. It comprehensively reviewed defense strategy, force structure, and modernization. Congress mandated a one-time Defense Review in 1997 for a balanced and affordable defense program. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) was made permanent in 2000, requiring it to be conducted in the first year of each Administration. Subsequent QDRs were conducted in 2001 and 2006. The Quadrennial Defense Reviews (QDRs) have been conducted regularly since 2000 to review DOD plans and priorities. Congress increased requirements for these reviews in the FY2015 and FY2017 National Defense Authorization Acts. The FY2017 NDAA mandated the creation of a \"National Defense Strategy\" (NDS) to outline DOD's priority missions and force planning scenarios, replacing the QDR with the Defense Strategy Review (DSR). The National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines DOD's priority missions, force planning scenarios, strategic environment, threats, strategies, resource investments, roles and missions of the Armed Forces, force size and shape, capabilities, readiness, infrastructure, organization, personnel, innovation, and required major investments over a five-year period. It is completed after a presidential election and new Secretary of Defense confirmation. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) is confirmed annually by the Secretary of Defense and if not prepared, an assessment is submitted to congressional defense committees. A competition of ideas is suggested to enhance the strategic review process, either internally or externally. The Commission on the National Defense Strategy for the United States promotes a competition of ideas related to the NDS process. The FY2017 NDAA established a Commission on the National Defense Strategy for the United States to review and make recommendations on the national defense strategy, including assessing the strategic environment, threats, force size, readiness, capabilities, resources allocation, and military risks. The commission's final report is due by December 1, 2017. The National Defense Strategy Commission was established by the FY2017 NDAA to review and make recommendations on the national defense strategy. Its final report is due by December 1, 2017, to the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the congressional defense committees. The National Military Strategy requirement involves the organized application of military means to support broader national goals, dating back to the 1990s. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was required to submit a strategic military plan annually from 1991 to 1993, addressing threats, military contributions to national objectives, risks, and military force organization. The National Military Strategy (NMS) involves the organization and structure of military forces, functions of military departments, and major weapons acquisitions. The NMS was made a permanent requirement in 2004, with updates every two years. It includes a description of the strategic environment, threats, national military objectives, strategy, and assessment of U.S. forces and allies. The National Military Strategy (NMS) assesses the requirements for contractor support of armed forces in various operations. The FY2017 NDAA brought significant changes to the NMS content to align with the National Defense Strategy (NDS). Each NMS evaluates the strategic environment, threats, and military means to support national security objectives. The most recent strategic annual report of the Secretary of Defense, NDS, and Secretary of Defense policy guidance provide the framework for assessing military strategic and operational risks, developing risk mitigation options, and establishing military guidance for joint force development. This replaces previous requirements for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to articulate how the U.S. military will help achieve objectives outlined in national security strategies. The Chairman's Risk Assessment (CRA) is a key component of formal strategy-making and planning, involving the assessment of risks associated with various threats and challenges faced by the United States. This includes considerations of the strategic environment, force planning implications, capabilities of U.S. forces, synchronization with partners, and requirements for operational support. The CRA also outlines assumptions leading to conclusions derived from these assessments. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regularly assesses risks associated with the National Military Strategy, defining military and strategic risks. The assessment is mandated by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 153(b) annually. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is required to annually assess the risks associated with executing the National Military Strategy, as mandated by Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 153(b). The assessment includes updates on changes to the strategic environment and identification of strategic and military risks to U.S. interests. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff assesses risks associated with executing the National Military Strategy, including identifying differing levels of risks, assessing risk by category and level, determining budgetary priorities and tradeoffs, identifying risks when partnering with allies, and assessing critical deficiencies in force capabilities. The Department of Defense has submitted classified Congressional Risk Assessments (CRAs) frequently, not always in compliance with timelines. The Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review (QRM) originated from the Goldwater-Nichols Act, assessing roles and missions for the Armed Forces. The Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review (QRM) assesses roles and missions for the Armed Forces every three years or at the request of the President or Secretary. The NDAA for FY2001 mandated that the Chairman's assessment of the QDR be quadrennial and reported to Congress. The QRM examines core mission areas, competencies, and capabilities of the Armed Forces. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) was created in response to the 9/11 attacks to assess the U.S. government's homeland security architecture. It was modeled after the Department of Defense's Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review (QRM). The QHSR was mandated by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) was established by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to evaluate the nation's homeland security strategy every four years. It requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to collaborate with various agencies to develop a national homeland security strategy, prioritize missions, enhance interagency cooperation, assess budget plans, organizational alignment, and acquisition procedures of the Department of Homeland Security. The QHSR is not mandated to align with the current National Security Strategy. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) is required to be consistent with the National Strategy for Homeland Security. The Secretary must submit an unclassified report to Congress by December 31 of the review year, which should also be made publicly available on the DHS website. The first QHSR report in 2010 clarified that it is not a resource prioritization document and does not detail specific roles and responsibilities for each mission area. The most recent QHSR was submitted in June 2014. Departments and agencies may conduct strategic reviews without congressional mandate, raising oversight questions for Congress. DOD's 2011 comprehensive review, driven by strategic and budgetary needs, had no explicit statutory mandate. In 2011, DOD conducted a comprehensive review prompted by executive and legislative actions, including President Obama's directive to identify $400 billion in defense budget savings. The Budget Control Act of 2011 further spurred this review by establishing budget caps. The mandate for the review included strategy and resources, emphasizing a strategic-driven approach to achieve savings. In May 2011, Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized the importance of DOD's review to prioritize spending decisions based on strategy and risks. Secretary of Defense Panetta confirmed in August 2011 that DOD was conducting a fundamental review to determine essential missions, strategic risks, and financial costs. DOD officials launched a senior-level review process in line with the President's guidance, involving iterative engagement with the White House. The Department of Defense conducted the SCMR in response to Secretary Hagel's direction in March 2013. Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter was tasked with overseeing the review, with a deadline set for May 31, 2013. OSD CAPE managed the day-to-day operations, following a similar process to recent QDR reviews. The SCMR was a budget-driven effort overseen by Deputy Secretary Carter, aiming to examine DOD spending and inform budget plans for FY2014 and beyond. It considered three budget scenarios and focused on management efficiencies, compensation reforms, and force structure changes. The SCMR focused on force structure and modernization plans, considering a trade-off between force size and technology. DOD concluded the review on schedule, briefing President Obama, Congress, and the public on the results. The primary focus was on budgetary impacts and developing options to address budget reductions. The review found that drastic options could only help DOD meet sequester-level caps towards the end of the 10-year period.

DOD concluded the review on schedule, briefing President Obama, Congress, and the public on the results. The review found that drastic options could only help DOD meet sequester-level caps towards the end of the 10-year period. DOD officials stressed that the SCMR generated ideas, not decisions, and that the 2014 QDR process would help make tough strategic choices. Some have suggested that increased austerity may prompt a reconsideration of defense strategy aims and the role of the United States on the world stage. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) was initiated in 2010 by the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development, with a second process concluded in 2015. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) was initiated in 2010 by the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton directed the review, with Secretary of State Kerry also directing a similar one. The QDDR process was based on the QDR and the QHSR, focusing on priorities, resourcing, and organization. The 2010 report proposed specific changes in the State Department's focus and structure, while the 2015 report aimed to enhance effectiveness, agility, and innovation in U.S. diplomacy. Both reports were issued as unclassified public documents, building on the foundations laid in the 2010 report. The Quadrennial Intelligence Community Review (QICR) aims to enhance the effectiveness and agility of U.S. diplomacy and development post-9/11. Unlike the QDDR, the QICR lacks a statutory mandate, leading to less attention in national security debates. The Quadrennial Intelligence Community Review (QICR) lacks a statutory mandate, but there is interest in creating one. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence recommended a structured quadrennial intelligence review similar to the QDR. Two national intelligence strategies have been issued by the Director of National Intelligence in 2005 and 2009. The QICR mandates are not publicly available, but they follow a basic quadrennial timeline and consider the link between strategy and resourcing over a long time frame. The Quadrennial Intelligence Community Review (QICR) follows a basic quadrennial timeline and considers the link between strategy and resourcing over a long time frame. QICRs have been conducted in 2001, 2005, and 2009, with the 2009 report focusing on scenario-based exercises looking out to 2025. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the QDR in 2014, leading to changes in the review process. The committee report highlights concerns that the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) has become less compliant with the law and strayed from Congress's intent. Congress has increased statutory requirements for the QDR in the FY2015 and FY2017 National Defense Authorization Acts, aiming to better prioritize Department of Defense activities, shape the force, guide resources, and adapt to strategic changes. The FY2015 NDAA amended Title 10, U.S. Code to enhance the QDR process. The Defense Strategy Review (DSR) changed the QDR process by requiring a more specific exploration of priorities, risks, and strategic tradeoffs. It shifted the strategic outlook to three time frames: near-term, mid-term, and far-term. The DSR also emphasized a more in-depth assessment and articulation of defense strategy compared to previous reviews. The Defense Strategy Review (DSR) mandated the Department of Defense to link its assessment to other national security documents, including risk assessments from the Chairman and other strategic estimates. It also required a detailed analysis of force structure and understanding of strategic and military risks associated with executing national defense strategy. The DSR mandated the Department of Defense to articulate risk categorization, integrate with non-DOD agencies and allies, estimate budget levels for missions, and have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff conduct a risk assessment. The DSR mandated the Department of Defense to articulate risk categorization, integrate with non-DOD agencies and allies, estimate budget levels for missions, and have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff conduct a risk assessment. The DSR transformed the Chairman's review to include risks and capabilities needed to address them, in addition to the Chairman's Risk Assessment report. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) required the department to state the national defense strategy of the United States in the DSR report to Congress, as mandated by the FY2015 NDAA. Prior to this legislation, the National Defense Strategy was intermittently produced either as part of the QDR or as a stand-alone document. The National Defense Strategy is a defense planning document that is not mandated by legislation. The DSR report submission time frames require it to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees by March 1 of the following year. The report is to be unclassified with a possible classified annex. The first DSR should include an analysis of enduring mission requirements for DOD activities financed using allocated funds. The National Defense Panel (NDP) requirement mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish an independent advisory committee of 10 private civilians who are national security experts as part of the Defense Strategy Review (DSR) process. This requirement was first mandated in the 1997 QDR report and became permanent after the 2006 QDR process. The independent panel assesses the QDR review, recommendations, and assumptions. The National Defense Panel (NDP) serves as an audit mechanism under the QDR construct, reviewing the Secretary's terms of reference, strategy findings, and force structures. The panel conducts an independent assessment and compares resource requirements. The most recent NDP was published in July 2014 to support the 2014 QDR, with a more expansive mandate compared to the DSR panel. The DSR panel serves as auditors of the defense strategy role, producing its own mini-DSR concurrent with the broader DOD review. Panel duties include assessing the security environment, suggesting key issues for the DSR, identifying national security interests, assessing assumptions and findings of the DSR, considering alternative defense strategies, and assessing various elements necessary for mission execution. The FY2017 NDAA replaced the NDP with a Commission on the National Defense Strategy of the United States."
