Easements will be granted across the Anacostia River for development purposes. Easements granted for constructing bridges, roads, utilities, and improvements on the Islands as per District Building Code and safety requirements. The District grants easements for constructing, maintaining, and providing facilities on National Children's Island. These easements can be assigned to lessees, sublessees, or operators. The development of the island must adhere to specified guidelines or agreements. The property transfer and easements are conditional on the island's use for National Children's Island purposes. The property on National Children's Island will revert to the United States if improvements in the recreational park are not started within three years of obtaining building permits or four years after title transfer, or if the operation of the park is not commenced within five years of obtaining building permits. The property on National Children's Island will revert to the United States if improvements in the recreational park are not started within three years of obtaining building permits or four years after title transfer, or if the operation of the park is not commenced within five years of obtaining building permits. The abandonment or non-use of the recreation park for a period of two years or conversion of the Islands to a use other than specified in this Act will also trigger reversion. Any lawsuits seeking to enjoin the development or operation of National Children's Island will extend the reversion period. The District is responsible for any claims and judgments during their ownership of the Islands and playground. Any entity developing National Children's Island must provide security for restoration of the park. Upon reversion of the property, the National Park Service must restore the recreation park within two years. If restoration is not started or diligently pursued, funds in escrow will go to a nongovernmental entity. SEC. 4. PROVISIONS RELATING TO LANDS TRANSFERRED AND EASEMENTS GRANTED. The operation of the recreation park is dependent on the opening of a children's playground at National Children's Island. Public parking on the Islands is prohibited, except for specific vehicles. Final design plans for the park and playground require approval from the National Capital Planning Commission. The District of Columbia must review the project in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as required by the Children's Island Development Plan Act of 1993. The effect of property transfer is outlined in Section 5. Upon the transfer of the Islands to the District, the jurisdiction transfer from the National Park Service will become null and void. The Islands will no longer be part of Anacostia Park or the park system of the District. The District of Columbia will have exclusive control over the Islands and easements transferred, ceasing their status as a reservation or public grounds of the United States. The District is authorized to grant rights for parking facilities on lands currently leased from the United States. The District of Columbia has control over the Islands and can grant rights for parking facilities as needed for National Children's Island. SEC. 6. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This Act does not endorse any construction on National Children's Island, does not exempt the park from US laws, and allows for additional conditions to mitigate adverse impacts."
