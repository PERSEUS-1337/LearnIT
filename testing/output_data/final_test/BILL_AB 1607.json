    "title": "AB 1607",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14169.53 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require all fees to be paid to the state in the form of remittances payable to the department. The department will transmit fee payments to the Treasurer for deposit in the fund, with interest and dividends earned on these deposits retained in the fund for specified purposes. All funds from the fee assessed in this article will be used to enhance federal financial participation for hospital services under the Medi-Cal program, provide additional reimbursement to hospitals, support quality improvement efforts, minimize uncompensated care for uninsured patients, cover administrative costs, and fund children's health coverage. To cover staffing and administrative costs, up to $250,000 per quarter will be allocated. Additionally, $155 million per quarter will be designated for children's health care coverage, excluding federal matching funds. Increased capitation payments will be made to managed health care plans for services provided to eligible individuals under federal Social Security Act. Increased payments and grants will be provided to hospitals for services rendered to eligible individuals under the federal Social Security Act. The moneys in the fund are continuously appropriated for specific purposes during different program periods, regardless of fiscal year, as outlined in various articles and sections. Any excess quality assurance fee collected will be refunded to general acute care hospitals pro rata, or used for the next program period if federal rules prohibit refunds. The department may modify any methodology or provision in consultation with hospitals to meet federal requirements or enhance the probability of federal approval, as long as it aligns with the spirit of the article and conditions set forth. Notification to legislative committees is required 30 days before implementation of any modifications. The department will adjust amounts to comply with federal regulations and seek approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for implementation. Specific approval will be sought to exempt certain providers from fees as necessary. The definitions for \"Actual net benefit,\" \"Aggregate fees,\" \"Aggregate payments,\" \"Net benefit,\" and \"Net benefit period\" are provided for the purposes of this subdivision. These definitions apply to payments, grants, and fees collected from hospitals under this article for a specific fiscal year starting on or after July 1, 2014. The department determines the preliminary net benefit for each net benefit period before the program period begins. The funding for children's health care coverage is 24 percent of the net benefit. Actual net benefit is reconciled within six months after the department's determination. The department reconciles the fund used for children's health coverage based on preliminary and actual net benefit. Any excess amounts used are returned to the fund, while the difference is available for the department to use. Results of the reconciliation are reported to the appropriate committees within five working days. The department consults with the hospital community to make calculations and reconciliations using the best available data. After consulting with the hospital community, the department determines a deadline for all fees and payments to be completed within two years after the program period. Once this deadline is set, no further payments will be made, and any collected fees will be used for the next program period. The department will inform relevant committees of this deadline within five working days. The department will inform Budget Committee and fiscal policy committees within five working days of the determination. The curr_chunk discusses the use of fee proceeds to enhance federal financial participation for payments to hospitals under specific eligibility requirements. It also mentions the amendment of Section 14169.75 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 14169.75 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to become inoperative on January 1, 2018. Hospitals are not required to pay the fee after this date unless it was owed during the operative period. Payments authorized under Section 14169.53 are also restricted to the operative period. This act is related to the Budget Bill and will take effect immediately. This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect to provide continued health care coverage for Californians."
