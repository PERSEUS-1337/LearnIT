    "content": "The \"Clean Renewable Water Supply Act of 2009\" may be cited as the Clean Renewable Water Supply Bonds under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Clean Renewable Water Supply Bonds are defined as bonds issued for capital expenditures by qualified borrowers for qualified projects, issued by a qualified issuer, designated for this purpose, and issued within 6 months of receiving an allocation from the Secretary. The national clean renewable water supply bond limitation for each calendar year ranges from $100,000,000 in 2010 to $1,500,000,000 in 2017. Unused allocations within a 6-month period are carried over to the next application period. The national clean renewable water supply bond limitation is set at $1,500,000,000 for 2017, $1,750,000,000 for 2018, and $0 for 2019 onwards. The Secretary allocates this limitation among qualified projects through a specified application process each calendar year. The Secretary will allocate the national clean renewable water supply bond limitation to qualified projects on a first-come, first-served basis within 30 days after the application period. Allocation to a project requires certifications regarding regulatory approvals from the qualified issuer. The Secretary will allocate the national clean renewable water supply bond limitation to qualified projects based on first-come, first-served basis within 30 days of application. Allocation is contingent on receiving all necessary regulatory approvals for project construction. The Secretary is restricted from allocating more than 60 percent of the bond limitation to large projects in a calendar year. The Secretary is restricted from allocating more than 18 percent of the national clean renewable water supply bond limitation for a calendar year to any single large project, or more than 12 percent to any single non-large project. The Secretary is limited from allocating over $95,000,000 in a calendar year for any single project that delivers more than 10,000,000 gallons of water per day, with exceptions to the national clean renewable water supply bond limitation. The clean renewable water supply bond limitation for each calendar year remains unallocated if applications do not exceed the limit. Any excess limitation from one year carries over to the next year. Bonds exceeding a 20-year maturity are not considered clean renewable water supply bonds. The clean renewable water supply bond has no maturity limit exceeding 20 years. Definitions include governmental body, local water company, qualified borrower, and qualified desalination facility. The term 'qualified desalination facility' refers to a facility that produces new water supplies by desalinating seawater, groundwater, or surface water with high chloride or total dissolved solids levels. The term 'qualified groundwater remediation facility' refers to a facility that reclaims contaminated groundwater for potable use. The term 'qualified project' refers to any facility owned by a qualified borrower, such as a desalination or recycled water facility. A 'qualified issuer' can be a governmental body or an entity authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds for a state or political subdivision. The term 'qualified recycled water facility' refers to a wastewater treatment facility that is designed to comply with regulations for minimizing environmental impact. A 'qualified recycled water facility' is a wastewater treatment facility that exceeds Clean Water Act requirements and is used to reclaim wastewater from various sources. Reclaimed wastewater can be used for beneficial purposes instead of potable water supplies, but it cannot be used for certain impermissible uses like discharging into waterways or restoring habitat. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to minimize the environmental impact of qualified facilities, including consultation with the EPA. The Treasury Secretary will conduct a study on the allocation method for the national limitation under the Internal Revenue Code. The Treasury Secretary will conduct a study on the allocation method for the national limitation under the Revenue Code of 1986 to assess different methods for developing water projects efficiently, considering administrative burdens, environmental impact, and cost effectiveness. The study will involve consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and allow for public comment. The study on the allocation method for the national limitation under the Revenue Code of 1986 will be submitted to Congress before July 1, 2014. Conforming amendments include adding a new subparagraph for clean renewable water supply bonds. The Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding a new clause for clean renewable water supply bonds. Sec. 54G introduces clean renewable water supply bonds, with amendments applying to obligations issued after December 31, 2009."
