    "content": "India is seen as a potential counterweight to China's growing international influence and has a strategic partnership with the United States. Bilateral trade has increased significantly, reaching over $115 billion in 2016. Indians make up a large portion of H1-B visas and Indian students are the second largest group studying in the U.S. The influence of the wealthy Indian-American community is reflected in Congress's India caucuses. Presidents Obama and Modi strengthened U.S.-India relations through strategic dialogues and visits. Obama became the first U.S. President to visit India twice while in office. During his time in office, the U.S. President visited India twice, resulting in the most extensive Joint Statement between the two countries. The statement included a new \"Joint Strategic Vision for the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean Region,\" emphasizing maritime security and referencing the South China Sea. Bilateral ties were expressed as satisfactory, with cooperation in various areas such as dialogue mechanisms, investment partnerships, and defense partnership. India's economic growth and new donor status have led to a decrease in U.S. foreign assistance, with President Trump's Administration requesting $33.3 million for FY2018. The only major policy change announced so far is the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change, with New Delhi closely monitoring potential shifts in U.S. policy. Key policy figures for South Asia, including an Ambassador to New Delhi, have yet to be named by the Trump Administration. President Trump's potential approach to India has been speculated upon, with limited indicators from the President himself. In conversations with Indian leaders, references were made to India as a \"true friend and partner\" and plans to build upon bilateral defense cooperation. The importance of the U.S.-India strategic relationship was emphasized during a visit by the President's National Security Advisor. President Trump is set to meet with the Indian leader to reaffirm India's Major Defense Partner status. Many Indians see Trump as a strong leader against Islamist militancy, potentially forming a \"bromance\" with Modi. However, differences over immigration, trade, and relations with other countries may hinder personal rapport. India's interest in immigration flows, especially for IT professionals, and concerns about restrictive U.S. policies. Some worry about a potential \"G-2\" deal with Beijing, India's priority in the White House, and the preparedness of the U.S. President's India team. Observers note the Trump Administration's slow start on India but expect long-standing strategic ties to prevail. Many analysts hope the current U.S. Administration will continue the India-friendly approach of its predecessors, emphasizing the importance of a consistent U.S. actor in the region. President Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change was poorly received in India, where focus is on developing renewable energy sources. President Trump falsely accused India of making its participation in international agreements contingent on foreign aid. India's external affairs minister denied the allegations, highlighting concerns about U.S. immigration policies and anti-immigrant sentiment in the country. Indian nationals, particularly those on H-1B visas, closely monitor U.S. immigration policies. Critics of the H-1B program, including President Trump, argue that there is no shortage of qualified American workers to fill jobs, while sector executives claim that there is a lack of Americans with necessary skills. President Trump's Executive Orders aim to prioritize skilled and highly-paid foreign workers for U.S. visas to protect American jobs in the IT sector. Indian opposition parties have urged Prime Minister Modi to intervene in the decision to limit H-1B visas, as India's IT sector employs 4 million Indians and relies on the U.S. market for 60% of its business. Indian technology companies, which rely on the U.S. market for 60% of their business, argue that they create American jobs and contribute billions in tax revenue. Proposed changes to H-1B visa policies, such as raising the minimum annual wage, are met with resistance from IT firms aiming to keep wages closer to $75,000. Critics fear that such changes could be linked to broader anti-immigrant sentiments in politics. Some analysts argue that higher wages for H-1B visa holders could erode U.S. competitiveness and result in job losses. An incident in a Kansas bar where two Indian nationals were verbally harassed and shot sparked outrage in India, with concerns about safety for Indian visitors, students, scholars, and tech workers in the U.S. In early 2017, India's growth rate slowed to 6.1%, with an annual rate of 7.1%. Assessments of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's performance are mixed, with progress seen in liberalization and FDI restrictions. India's workforce is rapidly expanding, with 1 million new workers entering the market each month. India's economic slowdown was partly due to the demonetization policy implemented by the Modi government in November 2016, which aimed to cleanse the economy of counterfeit currency. This policy, along with a lack of robust investment and nonproductive loans, may have contributed to a sputtering growth rate in India. Analysts suggest that deeper reforms are needed for the economy to expand faster. The federal government in India aims to boost the economy by removing bureaucratic obstacles, strengthening judicial bodies, and easing land and labor laws. A new Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been established to create a uniform market, with implementation expected to begin soon. Additionally, a new bankruptcy law may improve credit attractiveness in India. The newly implemented bankruptcy law in India may enhance the credit markets, which currently hold over $100 billion in nonperforming loans. State-level politics in India significantly influences national politics and regulatory constraints on commerce. Recent elections in five Indian states, including Uttar Pradesh, provided a measure of political support for Prime Minister Modi's government. The BJP, led by Prime Minister Modi, emerged victorious in the Uttar Pradesh elections, solidifying their dominance in Indian politics. This win also reinforced Modi's popularity as a strong political leader. The BJP's victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections solidified Modi's popularity as a strong political leader and indicated a strong position for his reelection in 2019. The win may lead to a BJP majority in Parliament's upper house, potentially facilitating economic reform legislation. However, the dominance of Modi and the BJP has raised concerns about the future of India's democratic traditions and human rights. In 2017, Modi's decision to appoint Yogi Adityanath as UP chief minister surprised analysts. There are concerns about rising Hindu chauvinism among India's minority communities. India's foreign policy is shifting towards increased bilateral engagements, especially with the United States. Pakistan remains a key state actor in India's external relations. India's key bilateral relations with Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Japan, and Iran are crucial for its national interests. New Delhi seeks a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, with support from the US and four of the five current permanent members. India's strategic outlook is shaped by its disputed borders with Pakistan and China, as well as its position in vital sea lanes. India's strategic outlook is shaped by its key bilateral relations with Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Japan, and Iran. New Delhi is cautious of close U.S.-Pakistan ties and is engaged in an \"Act East\" policy in Southeast and East Asia. The India-Pakistan border and Kashmir remain potential nuclear flashpoints, with ongoing conflicts across the Line of Control. Since 2014, Prime Minister Modi's government has cautiously engaged with Pakistan, despite some Hindu nationalist ministers' aggressive rhetoric. High-level engagement was disrupted in mid-2015 but resumed with Modi's surprise visit to Pakistan in 2015. However, tensions escalated in 2016 after attacks on an Indian military base in Pathankot and Uri, Kashmir, by Pakistan-based militants. The fragile negotiation process was once again thrown into doubt. New Delhi conducted a \"surgical strike\" in response to militant attacks in Pakistan-held Kashmir, leading to condemnation from Islamabad. India blamed the attacks on the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist group and called for Pakistan's cooperation in bringing the conspirators to justice. Analysts believe the attacks were a result of opposition to the India-Pakistan peace process, with tensions escalating after the killing of a militant leader in mid-2016. The Trump Administration criticized Pakistan for supporting anti-India militants, while India faced violent protests in Jammu and Kashmir. The mid-2016 killing of militant leader Burhan Wani in Kashmir led to protests and violence. Tensions escalated with the killing of another militant commander in 2017. India claimed to destroy militant outposts in Pakistan, leading to clashes and casualties. The U.S. maintains that the Kashmir issue should be resolved between India and Pakistan. The U.S. position on Kashmir is that it should be resolved between India and Pakistan, considering the wishes of the Kashmiri people. In 2017, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley suggested the U.S. might get involved in de-escalating India-Pakistan tensions. India rejected third-party mediation, while Pakistan welcomed it. The U.S. faces challenges in stabilizing Afghanistan, with a military commander acknowledging a \"stalemate.\" India is a major contributor to Afghan reconstruction. India is the largest regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction, pledging $2 billion since 2001. Indian leaders envision a peaceful Afghanistan as a trade hub. India seeks to bypass Pakistan by developing Iran's Chabahar Port. India and Pakistan compete for influence in Afghanistan, with Indian targets under attack from Pakistan-based militants. India is skeptical of U.S. reliance on Pakistani interlocutors and provides security assistance to the Kabul government. Many Indians now support a lasting U.S. presence in Afghanistan, a shift from the past. India's relations with China have been tense for decades, with disputes over borders and the presence of the Dalai Lama in India causing friction. China claims India's Arunachal Pradesh as its territory and protested the Dalai Lama's visit to the region in 2017. India's Modi government allowed a visit that may be a response to China's increased investment in Pakistan, including the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). India objects to the BRI due to territorial concerns. China's increased investment in Pakistan, including the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has India watchful for signs of containment of its influence. Beijing's focus on preeminence in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region, as seen in the BRI, is intensifying competition with India. One obstacle to friendlier India-China ties is Beijing's refusal to designate Masood Azhar, leader of the anti-Indian terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed, as a \"global terrorist\" at the UN Security Council. China's refusal to designate Masood Azhar, leader of the anti-Indian terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed, as a \"global terrorist\" at the UN Security Council has hindered friendlier India-China ties. Despite bilateral friction, China has become India's largest trade partner, with significant investments pledged in the coming years. India aims to maintain non-adversarial relations with Beijing and has deepened engagement with Japan. India's deepening engagement with Japan is part of New Delhi's \"Act East\" policy, with relations blossoming in the current century. The countries acknowledge common values and interests, forming a strategic partnership in 2006. A bilateral free trade agreement was finalized in 2011, and Japanese companies have invested significantly in India, notably in the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor project. Trilateral naval exercises involving the U.S., India, and Japan have taken place, highlighting the growing convergence between the countries. India's relations with Japan and Iran have been a focus of recent discussions. Indian Defense Minister Arun Jaitley visited Tokyo to strengthen military cooperation with Japan. Despite positive ties with Iran, India's policy has become more nuanced, including reducing oil imports and withdrawing from a gas pipeline project. India has committed $500 million to develop Iran's Chabahar port for access to Central Asian markets, bypassing Pakistan. Uncertainty over U.S. policy is causing delays in Chabahar's development. The Obama Administration focused on closer U.S.-India defense relations in 2016, with priorities including expanding collaboration under the Defense. The Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) collaboration between the U.S. and India has been a priority, along with supporting India's \"Make in India\" efforts and enhancing cooperation in maritime security. Secretary Carter praised the progress made during his tenure, but concerns have been raised about the future of bilateral defense engagement due to the absence of senior-level appointees in the U.S. administration. President Obama recognized India as a \"major defense partner\" during Prime Minister Modi's June 2016 visit to Washington, DC, allowing India to access American technologies. The DTTI and Joint Technical Group met in New Delhi in mid-2016, where India signed a $1.1 billion contract for Boeing P-8I Poseidon aircraft. The India-U.S. Defense Policy Group, revived in 2001, has met annually since, with four subgroups focusing on military cooperation. The U.S.-India Defense Policy Group, revived in 2001, has met annually with four subgroups focusing on military cooperation. In 2005, a ten-year defense pact was signed between the United States and India, outlining collaboration in multilateral operations, defense trade, technology transfers, and missile defense. The pact was enhanced and renewed in 2015 for another ten-year period, despite U.S. engagement with India's rival, Pakistan. U.S.-India security cooperation has grown in the 21st century, reflecting new dynamics in Asian and global geopolitics. India's growing role in military cooperation is seen as crucial for global security, especially in the Indian Ocean Region. However, some analysts believe that India's ability to influence regional security dynamics will remain limited due to hesitance towards U.S.-Pakistan ties and China. Some Indian observers are concerned about the reliability of the United States as a defense partner, citing past resistance to signing defense cooperation agreements. Despite signing the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement in 2016, operationalization is still pending. Since 2002, the United States and India have increased joint military exercises, with a focus on navy-to-navy collaboration through the annual \"Malabar\" exercises. The 2015 iteration included Japanese naval units, establishing a trilateral effort. The 2016 exercises expanded to the East China and Philippine Seas, emphasizing operational readiness for humanitarian relief in the Indian Ocean Region. The 2016 Malabar exercises included phases in the East China and Philippine Seas, near contested South China Sea waters. Chinese analysts are closely monitoring the development, with the Beijing government expressing displeasure. In addition to major naval exercises, there are regular \"Red Flag\" air-to-air combat exercises and \"Yudh Abhyas\" Special Forces simulations to enhance combat skills. Defense trade is also a significant aspect of the bilateral relationship, with India emerging as a major arms purchaser in the global market. India has become a major arms purchaser in the global market, seeking to modernize its defense capabilities with advanced technology. The United States has signed defense contracts worth $11 billion with India since 2008, with proposals for co-production of combat aircraft. India plans to spend up to $100 billion on new procurements over the next decade to update its military arsenal. In November, India signed a $737 million contract to purchase 145 M777A2 ultralight howitzers from BAE systems. The Defense Procurement Procedure 2016 aims to promote partnerships with indigenous defense firms for hardware manufacturing under \"Make in India.\" Reforming India's defense procurement and management systems is crucial for bilateral security cooperation. Progress has been made in key areas of bilateral security cooperation between the US and India, including jet engine manufacturing and aircraft carrier design. Both countries have effective cooperation in counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and homeland security, with a commitment to combat terrorist threats. Cooperation also extends to law enforcement agencies, mutual legal assistance, extradition, and cyberterrorism. The US and India have strong bilateral security cooperation, including in counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and homeland security. They are focused on disrupting terrorist groups operating from Pakistani territory and have called on Pakistan to dismantle safe havens for terrorist networks. The 2015 U.S.-India Joint Declaration on Combatting Terrorism paved the way for greater intelligence sharing, while the 2016 summit emphasized bilateral attention to Pakistan-based threats. The US and India have strong bilateral security cooperation, focusing on disrupting terrorist groups from Pakistani territory. They called on Pakistan to bring perpetrators of terrorist attacks to justice. Bilateral initiatives include combating terrorists accessing nuclear materials, exchanging screening information, and enhancing cyber policies and capacity building. The U.S. and Indian governments share concerns about terrorist threats from groups like the Indian Mujahideen, Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State. Despite some progress in intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation, many anti-India groups still operate from Pakistan. Despite progress in intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation, there is asymmetry in the willingness of the US and Indian governments to move forward. While Washington seeks more cooperation from India, New Delhi remains hesitant due to distrust of US intentions and structural impediments like the lack of a national-level security body for coordination. India has a nuclear arsenal of approximately 110-120 warheads and the capability to deliver them over 5,000 km. They have a triad of air, sea, and land-based platforms, including successful submarine launches. India has not defined what constitutes a \"credible minimum deterrent\" and has not joined the NPT or accepted IAEA oversight. India has not joined the NPT or accepted IAEA safeguards on its nuclear material and facilities. Despite calls to accede to the NPT and ratify the CTBT, India prioritizes global nuclear disarmament and has proposed a Nuclear Weapons Convention for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. India has proposed a Nuclear Weapons Convention for the global elimination of nuclear weapons within a specified timeframe. Despite not signing the CTBT, India has a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. There are concerns about a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, with Islamabad expanding its nuclear arsenal. Measures are in place to prevent nuclear conflict, including a dedicated hotline between the two governments. In 2004, governments agreed to establish a secure hotline between Foreign Secretaries to prevent misunderstandings on nuclear issues. The Nuclear Suppliers Group exempted India from export guidelines in 2008, with the US supporting India's membership in various regimes. India became a member of the MTCR in June 2016, and the United States supports India's membership in other export control regimes. The NSG has discussed India's membership but has not made a decision yet, as India may not meet the group's criteria. Factors for NSG participation include adherence to the NPT or an equivalent non-proliferation agreement. The Wassenaar Arrangement also has specific factors for state eligibility. India, a member of the MTCR, is supported by the United States for membership in export control regimes like the NSG. The NSG criteria include adherence to the NPT, while the Wassenaar Arrangement has its own eligibility factors. Despite being a key strategic partner, India is a relatively small trading partner for the United States. India is the 9th largest source of U.S. goods imports and 18th largest goods export market. The United States is India's largest country destination for goods exports and second largest source of goods imports after China. There is potential for greater bilateral trade between the two countries if India's trade and investment barriers are reduced. India has made progress in trade liberalization since the 1990s. Under the Modi government, India aims to increase exports to $900 billion by 2019-2020 and raise its share in world exports. Domestic initiatives like Make in India and Digital India support the manufacturing sector. Protectionist policies persist due to poverty challenges and competition with China. President Trump's trade policy changes may impact India's trade relations. President Trump's focus on enforcing U.S. trade laws and addressing unfair trade practices raises questions about enhancing bilateral trade. He directed agencies to report on trade deficits with U.S. partners, including India. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with India was $24.4 billion in 2016. The Trade Policy Forum (TPF) is a potential avenue for future engagement. The Trade Policy Forum (TPF) is a key bilateral dialogue between the U.S. and India, chaired by the U.S. Trade Representative and the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry. The U.S. plans to partner with India on mutual interests ahead of the 2017 TPF. Other dialogues like the CEO Forum allow business leaders to discuss joint interests and make recommendations to both governments. Negotiations on a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) have been ongoing since 2009. Negotiations on a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) between the U.S. and India have been uneven and currently stalled. The U.S. pursues BITs to secure market access and investment protection through investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). Both countries have revised their model BIT templates, with India requiring investors to exhaust domestic remedies before arbitration, a requirement not present in the U.S. approach. Questions remain on bridging key differences in the templates if negotiations resume under the Trump Administration. India announced its intention to replace existing BITs with new treaties based on its new Model BIT, possibly influenced by ISDS claims. The U.S. and India, as WTO members, have differing views on key issues hindering the Doha Round. A breakthrough was the 2013 WTO \"Bali package\" including the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) which entered into force in 2017. India proposed negotiating a new WTO \"services TFA\" to address various services trade issues. India is not participating in the TiSA negotiations but favors engaging under the WTO framework. The outcomes for the 11th WTO Ministerial in December 2017 are uncertain. India's priorities include reaching a permanent solution on public stockholding for food security purposes. The United States and India use the WTO dispute settlement process to address trade-related complaints. The United States has FTAs with 20 countries but not with India. India is not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and has its own trade agreements. The United States withdrew from TPP in 2017. India is involved in negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with several countries. India's cautious approach to RCEP, driven by concerns about market access to China, may impact the final agreement. Without U.S. participation, RCEP could play a significant role in shaping regional trade norms. India's high tariff rates, especially compared to its WTO commitments, create uncertainty for U.S. businesses due to potential tariff adjustments. India has adjusted tariffs on telecommunications equipment imports, medicines, and agricultural products. The country plans to implement a national goods and services tax (GST) in mid-2017 to streamline its tax structure. U.S. firms face barriers in accessing India's services market due to limits on foreign ownership. India has restrictions on foreign ownership in financial services and retail, local presence requirements in banking and insurance, and limitations on foreign participation in education and legal services. India filed a WTO dispute against the US over worker visa fees, and is concerned about H-1B visa category revisions. India seeks a totalization agreement with the US to avoid dual taxation for Indian workers. India seeks a totalization agreement with the United States to avoid dual taxation for Indian workers. The two countries are discussing the coordination of payroll taxes and benefits under their Social Security systems. The United States challenges India's SPS barriers for agricultural exports, with the WTO ruling against India's ban on importing U.S. poultry and live swine. India's compliance with WTO SPS Agreement is debated, especially regarding import measures lacking scientific basis. The issue of agricultural support programs and IPR protection is a major bilateral trade concern between India and the United States. U.S. business groups and Congress members are worried about India's inadequate IPR enforcement. Both countries have differing views on IPR protection under the TRIPS Agreement. India remained on the Priority Watch List of the \"Special 301\" annual report by USTR in 2017, tracking IP protection practices. The report acknowledged some improvements in India's trade secrets regime and state-level IP enforcement actions but highlighted ongoing concerns with India's IP regime, particularly in patents. U.S. concerns include limitations on patentability of pharmaceutical innovations, burdensome patent administration, and insufficient protection against unfair commercial use of test data. The Indian government's approval for patents is a concern due to the risk of compulsory licensing or revocation. India's stance on IPR for pharmaceutical products aims to balance protections with access to medicines for its large population. Counterfeit goods in India raise copyright protection concerns. India's lack of anti-camcording legislation and non-membership in WIPO's \"Internet Treaties\" raise concerns about copyright and trademark protection. The National IPR Policy aims to promote IP for growth while addressing public interest, but fails to tackle India's major IP issues according to some U.S. industry groups. USTR criticizes the policy for avoiding specific legal and policy issues raised by stakeholders. India's localization barriers to trade and indigenous innovation trends, such as in-country testing and data localization, are noted by USTR. These measures aim to protect domestic industries but can be discriminatory barriers to trade. India's National Manufacturing Policy promotes local content requirements in sectors like information technology and clean energy. India's Preferential Market Access mandate in India imposes local content requirements for electronic products, raising concerns for the U.S. regarding localization barriers to trade. WTO rulings have found India's local content requirements on solar technology to violate non-discrimination rules. The bilateral investment relationship between the U.S. and India is small but growing, with India attracting foreign direct investment through reforms in sectors like insurance and defense. India increased foreign investment limits in insurance and defense sectors, but barriers remain. Key services industries like banking and insurance are dominated by the Indian government. Foreign investment cap in Indian insurance companies raised to 49%, with new requirement for \"Indian control\". Limits on foreign ownership in financial services, retail, and audiovisual services persist. Barriers to FDI in education and architecture sectors. Foreign participation prohibited in legal services. Limited regulatory transparency and judicial infrastructure pose challenges for U.S. investors. U.S. FDI in India and Indian FDI in the U.S. linked to U.S. jobs and exports. India and Indian FDI in the United States are linked to U.S. jobs and exports across various sectors. Concerns about offshoring of U.S. jobs to India have been raised. India's desire to join APEC has been supported by the U.S., but questions remain about India's commitment to economic liberalization. The U.S. GSP program provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries, recently extended until December 31, 2017. The U.S. GSP program, extended until December 31, 2017, provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries. India, the largest beneficiary in 2016, faces debate over its GSP status due to concerns about IPR regime. U.S. commercial exports and investments in India have benefited from trade financing and promotion assistance. Limited Ex-Im Bank activities in India may be due to its partial operational status since 2014. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) activities in India include support for microfinance lending, SMEs, and solar power projects. Congressional consideration of institutional structures could impact federal support for U.S.-India trade. Challenges in initiating bilateral nuclear energy commerce persist due to strict liability laws. In 2015, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi announced a breakthrough compromise during meetings in New Delhi. In 2015, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi announced a breakthrough compromise in New Delhi with an Indian Memorandum of Law. Westinghouse Electric signed a contract for six nuclear reactors in Andhra Pradesh, but their 2017 bankruptcy declaration has jeopardized the plans. The U.S.-India Joint Statement aimed to finalize contractual arrangements by mid-2017, with a competitive financing package from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Access to visas is a key concern for Indian workers. Access to visas for temporary work in the United States, specifically the H-1B visa, is a key concern for Indian workers. Congress is interested in reforming the H-1B visa due to concerns about displacing U.S. workers, lack of accountability and oversight of employers, and potential fraud and abuse within the program. There are debates about the need for more H-1B workers due to a perceived shortage of qualified U.S. workers. The U.S. government is implementing stricter measures to prevent H-1B visa fraud and abuse, including increased oversight and site visits to employers with a high number of H-1B employees. USCIS has also set up an email for reporting suspected fraud or abuse. The Department of Labor published cases of H-1B fraud involving Indian nationals. India's energy demands are growing, with a focus on renewable sources and expanding electricity access. U.S.-India relations regarding energy remain uncertain. India's growing energy demands focus on renewable sources and expanding electricity access. It is unclear if U.S.-India cooperation on clean energy projects will continue under the Trump Administration. India's significant greenhouse gas emissions make it a necessary participant in addressing climate change. India, the world's tenth-largest emitter per capita, signed and ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change. India aims to exceed the agreement's targets by increasing non-fossil fuel energy to 40% by 2030, focusing on solar, wind, and nuclear power. This marks one of the largest energy transformation projects in history, with a rapidly growing renewables sector. India has seen a drastic decline in the cost of solar and wind energy, leading to the cancellation of some coal plant projects and a 10% reduction in coal production targets. Despite these advancements, human rights abuses remain a significant issue in the country, including police brutality, corruption, and crimes against women and marginalized groups. Human rights abuses in India include violence against women, children, and marginalized groups, as well as restrictions on NGOs and privacy rights. Court backlogs delay justice, while laws in six states restrict religious conversion. Rape, domestic violence, and honor killings are ongoing issues. Human rights abuses in India include violence against women, children, and marginalized groups, as well as restrictions on NGOs and privacy rights. Rape, domestic violence, dowry-related deaths, honor killings, sexual harassment, discrimination against women and girls, child abuse, female genital mutilation, forced and early marriage, trafficking in persons, societal discrimination against persons with disabilities and indigenous persons, discrimination and violence based on gender identity, sexual orientation, and persons with HIV, lack of accountability for misconduct at all levels of government, investigations and prosecutions with infrequent convictions due to lax enforcement and resource shortages. The overburdened and under-resourced court system in India contributes to infrequent convictions, while international human rights watchdogs highlight widespread abuses. Press freedoms are also under threat in India, especially since the Hindu nationalist BJP came to power in 2014, raising concerns about Hindu majoritarian policies under Prime Minister Modi. The BJP's victory in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh state elections led to the appointment of controversial Hindu nationalist Yogi Adityanath as chief minister. Adityanath's crackdown on beef sellers and public loiterers, seen as targeting Muslims, raises concerns about the BJP's Hindu majoritarian governance approach eroding India's secular traditions. U.S. congressional attention on human rights in India focuses on religious freedom and communal repression. The U.S. congressional attention on human rights in India focuses on religious freedom, human trafficking, female infanticide, and legal constraints on NGOs. Concerns have been raised about communal repression targeting religious minorities and attacks on India's Christian minority. The issue of human slavery in India has also been highlighted by senior members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Uneven female-to-male ratios persist in India due to societal discrimination, with female infanticide and gender-selective abortions remaining serious human rights issues. The U.S. congressional attention on human rights in India includes concerns about religious freedom, human trafficking, female infanticide, and legal constraints on NGOs. Senior Members of the House are interested in the restrictive laws on NGO operations in India, which have impacted the provision of charitable health and human services. U.S. aid to India totaled $16.6 billion from 1947 to 2016, with cuts in assistance announced in 2007 and 2008 due to India's economic growth and ability to fund development programs. Increases in GHCS funds were seen under the Obama Administration. Under the Obama Administration, increases in GHCS funds and some added Development Assistance brought aid close to early 2000s levels. In 2011, India received U.S. food aid, with the U.S. Agency for International Development recognizing India as an emerging donor of humanitarian and development assistance. The Trump Administration's approach to the U.S.-India relationship is uncertain, with New Delhi closely monitoring potential shifts in U.S. policy. Key legislative and oversight considerations for Congress in U.S.-India relations include determining levels of U.S. foreign assistance to provide India and continuing bilateral clean and renewable energy cooperation programs. Key legislative and oversight considerations for Congress in U.S.-India relations include renewable energy cooperation, immigration policy, defense trade, trade and investment issues, trade promotion programs, and India's GSP status. Key legislative and oversight considerations for Congress in U.S.-India relations include renewable energy cooperation, immigration policy, defense trade, trade and investment issues, trade promotion programs, India's GSP status, IPR protection and enforcement, supporting India's membership in expert control regimes, and responding to human rights abuses in India. U.S.-India relations are likely to remain a prominent area of legislative interest for the 115th Congress."
