    "content": "The military missions of Department of Defense (DOD) units drive the need for facilities and infrastructure on military installations. The MILCON process is structured to comply with the PPBE process and can take three or more years for a project to move from requirements determination to implementation. The military construction process, governed by Chapter 169 of Title 10, United States Code, spans over seven years from the realization of the need for a facility to its occupancy. Section 2801 defines military construction as any development or extension on a military installation, including land acquisition and defense access road construction. Section 2802 of Title 10, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary of Defense and military departments to carry out military construction projects as authorized by law. This includes surveys, site preparation, facility acquisition, equipment installation, and planning/administration overhead. These requirements are in addition to those specified in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72801 for military construction processes. The MILCON-unique requirements in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72802 are additional to Section 114, which mandates project-by-project authorization and appropriation for military construction projects. The annual MILCON/VA appropriations bill funds DOD construction activities, including Unspecified Minor Construction projects costing up to $6 million under 10 U.S.C \u00a72805. The annual MILCON/VA appropriations bill funds DOD construction activities, including Unspecified Minor Construction projects estimated to cost no more than $6 million under authority provided in 10 U.S.C \u00a72805. Unlike major MILCON projects, unspecified minor construction projects do not require specific congressional authorization and are appropriated as unspecified minor construction. Planning and design work on construction projects must be sufficiently advanced to ensure accuracy in budget requests. Construction projects in the President's annual budget request are typically based on planning and design work funded by this nonspecific appropriation. Family Housing New Construction includes replacement, acquisition, expansion, addition, extension, and alteration of government-owned military family housing. Family Housing Operation and Maintenance covers debt payment, leasing, minor construction, principal and interest charges, insurance premiums, and routine provision. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations for various housing improvement funds, base realignment and closure functions, NATO security investment program contributions, and chemical demilitarization construction for military facilities. Demilitarization Construction refers to military construction needed for the destruction of the U.S. stockpile of lethal chemical agents and munitions. Chapter 169 of Title 10 establishes monetary thresholds for the MILCON budget process and oversight of DOD facilities. The term \"Secretary concerned\" is used to refer to the Secretaries of the military departments or the Secretary of Defense. Appendices provide reference tables for thresholds and requirements. 10 U.S.C \u00a72805 authorizes an expedited process for unspecified minor construction projects costing $6 million or less. Projects over $750,000 require advance approval. Projects under $2 million can be funded from Operation and Maintenance appropriations. Projects exceeding $2 million require MILCON appropriations. 10 U.S.C. \u00a72805 requires notifications for projects exceeding $2 million, with justification and estimated cost. It allows the use of O&M and RDT&E appropriations for certain UMMC projects. NDAA Section 2802 adjusts dollar limitations for minor military construction projects based on construction cost index. Section 2811 allows the Secretary concerned to carry out repair projects using O&M appropriations without budgetary limitations, but projects over $7.5 million require approval and notification to Congress. Section 2806 of 10 U.S.C. allows the Secretary concerned to obtain architectural and engineering services for MILCON and family housing projects. Congressional notification is required for services estimated to exceed $1 million, with a 14-day waiting period before funding can be obligated. Services can be paid for using MILCON or Family Housing planning and design appropriations. Section 2804 permits the use of appropriated military construction funds for projects without prior congressional approval. Section 2804 of 10 U.S.C. allows the Secretary to use appropriated military construction funds for projects without prior congressional approval if deemed vital to national security or urgent. The Secretary must report the project to congressional committees justifying the need and estimated cost. Section 2803 and 2808 of 10 U.S.C. allow for emergency military construction projects to be initiated without prior congressional approval, with a cap of $50 million in funding per fiscal year. The Secretary of Defense can use unobligated military construction appropriations for projects necessary during war or national emergencies. The Secretary of Defense can use Section 2808 authority for construction projects necessary to support the armed forces. The authority requires reporting to Congress with estimated costs and terminates at the end of the war or national emergency. Construction projects may be initiated for new missions, unit movements, modernization, or replacement of existing buildings after a facility requirements evaluation by installation engineers. After engineers determine the need for a military construction project, prioritization begins at a Facilities Utilization Board conference with installation engineers and major resident organizations. The prioritized list of construction needs is presented to the senior military commander after Facilities Utilization Board conferences. A Department of Defense Form 1391 (DD 1391) is created for each proposed project, including cost estimates, project descriptions, and justification information. The DD 1391 accompanies the construction request throughout the approval process. The DD 1391 form accompanies construction requests through the approval process. High-priority projects within budgetary guidance are included in the President's request, while lower-priority projects are funded in future years through the Future Years Defense Program. Construction projects may be deferred for future budget submissions, with priorities subject to change annually. The Army reorganized property management in 2002, creating the Installation Management Agency (IMA) and later the Installation Management Command (IMCOM) in 2006. IMCOM was divided into four regional directorates before November 2016. Construction projects from Army posts were prioritized by IMCOM regions based on submissions from garrison commanders. The Department of the Army realigned IMCOM's domestic regions into three functionally aligned directorates in 2016. The prioritized lists from these directorates are submitted to Headquarters, IMCOM in San Antonio for further review and consolidation. The consolidated list is then reviewed by the Army's Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management. The Army's construction requests are managed by various departments, starting with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management. The civilian Army Secretariat then handles the Army's construction projects, which are later reviewed by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy, and Environment. Approved projects are sent to the Office of the Secretary of Defense for consolidation into a prioritized DOD master list. The Air Force has a similar department called the Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center. The Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center (AFIMSC) was established in August 2014 to standardize construction and civil engineering support across all Air Force installations. AFIMSC provides program management, resourcing, and support activities previously handled by different Air Force commands. It consolidates project lists from installation commanders into a single priority list for evaluation and recommendations by the Air Force Corporate Structure before submission to the Secretary of the Air Force for approval. The Navy centrally manages its facilities through the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), which plans, builds, and maintains facilities. There are nine Facilities Engineering Commands reporting through NAVFAC Atlantic and NAVFAC Pacific. Each Navy shore installation has a Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC) responsible for developing necessary DD 1391s. NAVFAC headquarters staff reviews and prioritizes construction projects for submission. NAVFAC headquarters staff reviews and prioritizes construction projects, forwarding the list to Navy Installations Command in Washington, DC. Navy Installations Command consolidates and reprioritizes projects before submitting to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) through the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. The CNO's staff then passes the list to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations and Environment for submission to OSD. The Marine Corps relies on Navy's ROICCs for construction planning and administration, channeling construction requests through their own chain of command for screening and prioritization. After installation construction requirements are determined and DD 1391s are created, they are forwarded to Marine Corps Installations Command headquarters for screening. Projects are reviewed, reprioritized, and sent to Fleet Marine Force (FMF) headquarters. FMF reviews projects and submits them to Headquarters, Marine Corps in Washington, DC. A final list is compiled and submitted to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations and Environment for presentation to OSD. The National Guard is a state-based reserve component with its own distinct military organization. Each state's Army National Guard has Construction and Facilities Management Officers (CFMOs) who develop a project priority list for military construction. CFMOs advise the Adjutants General on construction projects and submit them to the National Guard Bureau for approval. The National Guard Bureau acts as a liaison between state National Guards and the Department of Defense. The National Guard Bureau (NGB) acts as a liaison between state National Guards and the Department of Defense. The Director of the ARNG provides a prioritized list of Guard military construction candidates for federal funding, which is reviewed by the Army Staff in the Pentagon. Base Civil Engineers (BCEs) for each state's Air National Guard (ANG) installations initiate military construction projects. The state's Air National Guard (ANG) installations follow a process to prioritize military construction projects, which are then sent to the National Guard Bureau (NGB) for consolidation and reprioritization. The Director of the ANG provides the highest-priority projects to the Headquarters Air Force staff for review and approval. Legislation for funding military construction originates in the Committees on Appropriations. The Committees on Appropriations oversee legislation for funding military construction projects, including those for the Department of Defense. They provide guidance and opportunities for input from Members of Congress not assigned to the committees of jurisdiction. The guidance for military construction projects includes additional documentation and a deadline for submission, usually in late March. Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) or Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) manage the projects, with construction involving planning, design, bidding, and construction phases. The contracting officer typically uses design-bid-build or design-build approaches for federal building projects. Title 40 of the United States Code mandates a three-step process for design-bid-build projects, involving initial design, construction bidding, and actual construction phases. Specialized firms handle planning and design under specific contracts, followed by general contractors bidding for construction work and seeking subcontractor quotes for specialty tasks like concrete, plumbing, and electrical work. The design-build approach allows for a shorter two-step process for design and construction under a single contract, offering advantages such as full responsibility on a single firm and potential for a reduced schedule. However, it may limit the number of firms able to compete in bidding. Design-build contracts may limit competition in bidding. Section 2305a allows contracting officers to use this process if three or more offers are expected, design work is required before proposals, and offerors will incur significant expenses. Factors to consider include project requirements definition, time constraints, and contractor capability. USACE, NAVFAC, Army National Guard, and Air National Guard oversee bids, contracts, and project assistance. Government oversight and assistance are provided throughout the project's design, contract award, construction, completion, and financial closeout. Facility engineers collaborate with a design firm to create a plan within the project's scope. They cannot enter into a contract or allocate funds until authorized. Once funding is approved, bids are solicited, contracts awarded, and construction begins. Government engineers manage the project and monitor construction. Funds for the project follow a detailed allocation path, as illustrated in a Navy construction project example. The necessary funds are drawn from the Military budget authority provided by Congress. The authority for the project is provided by Congress, and funds are drawn from the Military Construction, Navy account at the Treasury. The funds are then allocated to OSD, who further reallocates them to NAVFAC (Atlantic or Pacific). NAVFAC then distributes the funds to its regional divisions, called Facilities Engineering Commands (FECs), who administer construction contracts and pay contractors. Projects can take five years or more to complete from approval to finish. Military construction projects requested by the President are listed in detailed budget justification documentation. Projects requested by the President for military construction are detailed in budget justification documents on the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) website. Approved projects by the House and Senate are listed in reports accompanying annual bills. The final list of projects is found in conference reports. Department of Defense Form 1391 (DD 1391) is used to request construction funding from Congress. The DD 1391 form is used to request construction funding from Congress for individual projects, providing details such as cost estimates, project descriptions, requirements, current situations, and impacts if the project is not approved. Planning and design funding involves steps to identify issues, provide conceptual design, and cost estimates for construction activities. Planning is primarily handled by civil engineers, while design is primarily handled by architects. Prior to FY2018, Congress would provide authorization of appropriation for military construction projects for up to three years, but now appropriations are typically available for up to five years. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act aligned authorization with appropriations, providing authorization for FY2018 projects and appropriations through 2022. Military construction projects require separate authorization and appropriation for funding. Military construction projects require separate authorization and appropriation for each construction project. Section 114 of Title 10, United States Code, specifies that funds cannot be appropriated for military construction unless specifically authorized by law. This includes any construction, development, conversion, or extension of military facilities. Congress mandates project-by-project authorization and appropriation for military construction projects. In March 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns about the Department of Defense's (DOD) construction cost estimates. DOD agreed that its cost estimating guidance lacks specificity and intends to revise it in FY2019. The Government Accountability Office raised concerns about the Department of Defense's construction cost estimates in March 2018. DOD plans to revise its cost estimating guidance in FY2019. Congress authorizes and appropriates budget authority for specific facilities listed on the associated DD 1391. If the budget authority exceeds the actual project cost, congressional appropriators may rescind the remaining authority or approve reprogramming for other projects. Additional costs exceeding the budget authority can be covered through reprogramming or additional appropriations. The \"McCain Rules\" are criteria in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995, stating that appropriations for military construction projects not in the DOD annual budget request should be considered for authorization only if necessary. The McCain Rules outline criteria for authorizing military construction projects not included in the DOD annual budget request. Projects must be essential to national security, consistent with past actions, in the Future Years Defense Program, executable in the authorized year, and offset by reductions in other defense accounts. The rules are used for congressional consideration of Member requests but have had little practical effect since funding such requests was suspended. The DOD applies the McCain Rules in formulating the annual report on unfunded priorities. The Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is an annual catalog summarizing DOD operations, funding, manpower, and force structure needs over a five-year period. It is approved by the Secretary of Defense and updated during the budgeting phase to reflect final funding decisions. The FYDP includes high-priority construction projects within budgetary guidance and lower-priority projects for future funding. The Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is an annual catalog summarizing DOD operations, funding, manpower, and force structure needs over a five-year period. It is approved by the Secretary of Defense and includes high-priority construction projects within budgetary guidance. Projects may be deferred if new requirements are identified as higher priority. The actual data in the FYDP are classified, even though the structure is unclassified. The Fort McNair Physical Fitness Center at Joint Base Myer Henderson Hall in Washington, DC opened in 2008 through military construction. The 35,000-square-feet facility includes various amenities like locker rooms, gymnasium, handball/racquetball courts, exercise and weight room, indoor track, saunas, and parking for 70 patrons. Force Protection/Anti-terrorism measures are also in place. The Fort McNair Physical Fitness Center in Washington, DC, opened in 2008 and includes amenities like locker rooms, gymnasium, courts, exercise rooms, saunas, and parking. It serves military and civilian personnel at Fort McNair and their families, with Force Protection/Anti-terrorism measures in place. The facility features traffic control barriers and laminated glass for security."
