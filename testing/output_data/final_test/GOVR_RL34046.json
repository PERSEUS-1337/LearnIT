    "content": "The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 into law, which included the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations. The act provided $103.6 billion in total budgetary resources, with $65.5 billion for DOT and $37.6 billion for HUD. Congress converted the State, Foreign Operations appropriations bill into the Consolidated Appropriations bill in December 2007. The conference committee recommended $105.8 billion for the FY2008 THUD appropriations bill, exceeding the Administration's budget request. The President threatened to veto the bill, and the Senate did not take up the agreement. Congress provided funding through continuing resolutions at FY2007 levels until the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 was signed into law. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $105.9 billion for transportation and housing appropriations for FY2008, with an additional $1.2 billion added for highway bridge repair. The House passed a bill providing $104.4 billion for the same purpose. The President's net FY2008 request for transportation and housing programs was $100.3 billion, $4.4 billion more than FY2007 and $4.1 billion more than requested. The DOT request was $64.5 billion, with increases for highway and transit programs. The HUD request was $35.6 billion. The HUD request for FY2008 was $35.6 billion, $1.0 billion less than FY2007. The reduction aimed to prioritize funding for programs with measurable results, reflecting the Administration's effort to cut funding for ineffective programs. Proposed reductions included $1 billion from various HUD programs and the elimination of others. The FY2008 appropriations bill proposed reductions in several HUD and DOT programs, including cuts to Airport Grants, Amtrak, and subsidies for air service to small communities. Both the House and Senate rejected the proposed reductions and provided increases for both departments over FY2007 levels. The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 provides $104.4 billion, $4.1 billion more than requested and $4.4 billion more than FY2007 funding. The Senate-passed version provides $105.9 billion, $5.6 billion more than requested and $6.3 billion more than FY2007 level, with increases for DOT and HUD programs. The Senate bill's major funding difference with the House bill is in providing more funding for DOT, particularly for repairs to bridges in response to the collapse of an interstate highway bridge in Minnesota. The conference agreement on H.R. 3074 recommended a total of $105.8 billion, which is $5.5 billion more than requested and $6.2 billion more than the FY2007 enacted level. The agreement recommends $66.7 billion for DOT, $2.2 billion more than requested and $3.5 billion more than provided in FY2007, and $38.7 billion for HUD, $3.1 billion more than the budget request and $2.4 billion more than the amount provided in FY2007. The conference agreement on H.R. 3074, reported on November 13, 2007, was approved by the House on November 14, 2007, with a vote of 270-147. Discussions focused on the limited time for reviewing the bill, the high number of earmarks, and the addition of earmarks not present in the original versions. Complaints were also raised about a provision (Section 193) that would restrict the use of funds in the agreement. The conferees added a provision to the agreement that prohibits funds from being used for budget justifications to non-appropriations committees before May 31, 2008. This provision is similar to one in a previous appropriations act and was also included in a Senate-passed bill for FY2007. In FY2007, a continuing resolution (P.L. 110-5) provided funding for agencies, with the President threatening to veto the bill for exceeding requested funding levels. Congress combined unfinished appropriations bills into one consolidated act (H.R. 2764), including the THUD appropriations act as Division K of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The THUD appropriations act was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act after negotiations to reduce overall spending. The bill included rescission of contract authority and a 2% rescission for earmarked projects. The FY2008 THUD appropriations bill status is outlined in Table 1, while Table 2 shows funding for FY2007 and requested amounts for FY2008. Subcommittee structure changes have occurred three times since 2003. In 2003, a new Homeland Security subcommittee was added, leading to the combination of Transportation appropriations with other subcommittees. In 2005, the House Committee on Appropriations reduced its subcommittees from 13 to 10, merging the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee with the District of Columbia subcommittee. This resulted in the Subcommittee on Transportation gaining jurisdiction over appropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary. In 2005, the Senate Committee on Appropriations reduced its subcommittees to 12, merging the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee with the District of Columbia subcommittee. The Senate also added jurisdiction over appropriations for the Departments of Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The House and Senate subcommittees had almost identical areas of coverage for appropriations, with the main difference being that the Senate had a separate bill for the District of Columbia appropriations. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures, dividing the responsibilities of the TTHUD subcommittees between two new subcommittees: Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD); and Financial Services and General Government. This reorganization complicates year-to-year comparisons of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriation bills, as their appropriations now appear in different bills with various other agencies. Other factors, such as supplemental appropriations for disaster response and changes in the Department of Treasury makeup, also impact the appropriations process. The Department of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development experienced funding increases from FY2003-FY2007. The President's FY2008 budget proposed $64.5 billion for DOT, a $1.3 billion increase from FY2007. In FY2007, there were increases in funding for highways and transit, as well as for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration and the Research and Innovative Technology Administration. However, there were decreases in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program, Amtrak, and the Essential Air Service Program. The Administration proposed a (-54%) cut in funding for the Essential Air Service Program, along with restructuring the FAA budget. The House and Senate passed bills with higher DOT funding levels, with the Senate providing additional funds for the FHWA's Bridge Repair Program and emergency funding for Minnesota after the Interstate 35 bridge collapse. Neither chamber supported the Administration's proposed decreases in transportation accounts or the FAA budget restructuring. The proposed restructuring of the FAA budget is reflected in the bill, with significant increases in funding for various programs such as the FHWA Bridge Program, FAA Aviation Improvement Program, and Amtrak. The conference committee recommended $66.7 billion for the Department of Transportation, which is $3.5 billion more than the previous year. This includes additional funding for highway bridge repair and replacement. The House approved an additional $1 billion for highway bridge repair and replacement, $750 million for the FAA airport grant program, and $475 million for Amtrak. The Senate did not take up the agreement. The FY2008 THUD appropriations act provided $65.5 billion for DOT, $2.3 billion more than FY2007, including the additional $1 billion for highway bridge repair and replacement. The FY2008 THUD appropriations act included additional funding for highway bridge repair, the FAA airport grant program, and Amtrak. The Administration's budget for DOT prioritized FAA reauthorization, a new highway congestion initiative, and Amtrak spending changes. The FAA's authorization was extended, with proposed reforms to the air traffic control system and funding sources still under consideration by Congress. The highway congestion initiative aims to redirect $175 million for pilot programs in cities to test congestion reduction strategies like congestion pricing and flexible work schedules. The House rejected the funding request, citing DOT's discretion in awarding grants from FY2007 funding for highways. The Senate approved $136 million for a congestion initiative, funded by the RABA mechanism, not by reallocating funds from designated projects. The final THUD appropriations act requires a review of DOT's implementation of the initiative by GAO. The act also limits the use of FTA's bus program funds for the initiative in FY2008 to 10% of unallocated funds. The House and Senate provided increased funding for Amtrak in FY2008, with the House allocating $1.4 billion and the Senate allocating $1.37 billion. Both included money for operating and capital assistance, as well as a matching grant program for state investment in passenger rail. The Senate also removed a provision limiting Amtrak's discounts. Concerns were raised about Amtrak's failure to reach collective bargaining agreements. The conference agreement recommended $1.375 billion for Amtrak, with $475 million for operating assistance and $900 million for capital assistance and debt service. Additionally, $75 million was recommended for a matching grant program to encourage states to invest in passenger rail service. The final THUD act provided $1.325 billion for Amtrak, with $475 million for operating assistance and $850 million for capital assistance and debt service. The final THUD act provided $850 million for capital assistance and debt service, $31 million more than FY2007. It also included $30 million for a matching grant program to improve intercity passenger rail service. The Administration requested $900 million for Amtrak in FY2008, $394 million less than FY2007. Amtrak's Board of Directors, appointed by the Bush Administration, requested $1.5 billion for operations and $100 million for a matching grant program in FY2008. The Administration has consistently sought to reduce funding for Amtrak, pushing for changes in operations and passenger rail policy. Congress has historically provided more funding than requested. Amtrak, a quasi-governmental corporation, operates intercity passenger rail service and rail infrastructure in the Northeast. It relies on federal subsidies to cover its deficit. Reauthorization efforts have been stalled due to disagreements between Congress and the Administration over future rail policy. The FAA budget funds air traffic control and provides grants for airport development. The President's budget requested $14.1 billion for airport planning, development, and air traffic infrastructure in FY2008, with a proposed cut to AIP funding. Both the House and Senate approved $14.6 billion for FAA, rejecting the proposed cut to AIP funding. AIP funds are used for airport improvement programs. The final THUD appropriations act provided $3.5 billion for airport planning and development, including grants for airport capacity projects. Concerns were raised by some Members of Congress over proposed cuts to the AIP program despite forecasts of aviation traffic growth. The President's budget requested a $59 million reduction for the Essential Air Service program, but both the House and Senate rejected this, providing $110 million for FY2008. This program aims to maintain air service to small airports in rural areas by subsidizing costs. The Essential Air Service program, which aims to maintain airline service to rural communities, is facing proposed funding cuts. Supporters argue that this program is essential to preserve transportation connections in rural areas. Previous budget requests have also suggested reducing funding for this program. The President's budget for FY2008 includes an increase in funding for federal highway programs. The FY2008 highway funding was increased by $631 million over its original level due to higher-than-expected revenues to the Highway Trust Fund. The House approved $41.0 billion in new funding for federal highway programs for FY2008, representing a 3% increase over FY2007. The DOT Secretary noted that preventive action was needed to avoid a projected deficit in FY2009, and the Administration did not request the additional $631 million authorized for FY2008 to help forestall the deficit. The FY2008 highway funding was increased by $631 million over its original level, reaching the full authorized level for FY2008. The Senate and conference agreement approved $42.2 billion in new funding, including $1 billion for the FHWA bridge program and up to $195 million for emergency repair of the I-35 bridge in Minnesota. The final THUD appropriations act provided $42.0 billion in new funding, with an additional $195 million for the I-35 bridge. This marked a $2.3 billion increase over FY2007, mainly due to highway funding increases and $1 billion for bridge inspection and repair after the I-35 bridge collapse. The Administration requested $528 million for FMCSA, with $300 million for grants to states for truck and bus safety. The House approved $528 million, the Senate approved $531 million, and the final THUD appropriations act provided $530 million. A provision in the act prohibits funds for a cross-border trucking program with Mexican companies. The Department of Transportation (DOT) implemented a program in a zone extending 20 miles into the U.S. from the U.S.-Mexico border. Funding for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was requested at $833 million for FY2008, with the House approving $836 million and the Senate approving $835 million. The final conference agreement recommended $838 million in new funding. The final THUD appropriations act provided $838 million in new funding for the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) for FY2008, which is a decrease of $400 million (28%) from the previous year. The majority of the budget is allocated to support Amtrak, with reductions in funding for safety programs and research and development of rail safety improvements. The House approved $1.667 billion for FRA, an increase of $188 million over FY2007. The House approved $1.667 billion for FRA in FY2008, an increase of $188 million over the previous year. The increase in funding is mainly for Amtrak, with additional funds for a rail line relocation grant program and research and development. The Senate approved $1.657 billion, with most of the increase also going towards Amtrak. The conference agreement recommended $1.656 billion, maintaining the same level of funding for FRA's safety and operations account as in FY2007. The final THUD appropriations act provided $1.561 billion for FY2008, an increase of $83 million over FY2007. The Administration requested $9.422 billion for FTA, with an increase of $447 million over FY2007. Most of the increase was for passenger rail activities, while the requested reduction was in the New Starts program, which helps fund new transit projects. The Administration requested $1.4 billion for New Starts, a decrease of $166 million from FY2007. The Administration requested $1.4 billion for New Starts in FY2008, a decrease of $166 million from FY2007. The reduction was defended as necessary budget choices, with funding allocated for projects ready in FY2008 and potential future projects. $100 million was also included for the Small Starts program for projects under $250 million, although regulations were not finalized. The House approved $9.710 billion for FTA in FY2008, $701 million more than FY2007. The Senate approved $9.565 billion, $590 million over FY2007. The House provided $1.7 billion for the Capital Improvement program, including $200 million for Small Starts. The Senate allocated $1.566 billion for New Starts, $166 million less than the House. The Senate committee recommended $9.649 billion for FTA, with $1.650 billion allocated for the New Starts program. The final THUD appropriations act provided $9.358 billion for FTA, $348 million over the FY2007 enacted level. The FY2008 funding for MARAD was $358 million below the authorized level, with reductions in formula and bus grants, bus funding, and Capital Grants program. The Administration requested $295 million for MARAD, supporting the maritime transportation sector, including the Maritime Security Program. The federal government requested $115 million for Operations and Training, with additional funding approved by the House and Senate for MARAD, including assistance to small shipyards and loan guarantees. The FY2008 funding for MARAD was below the authorized level, with reductions in various grants and programs. The conference agreement recommended $313 million in new funding for MARAD for FY2008, $23 million more than FY2007 and $18 million more than FY2008. Additional funding was provided for MARAD's operations and training account, assistance to small shipyards, and loan guarantees under the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program. President Bush released his FY2008 budget request before the Congress finished work on the FY2007 spending bills. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution (CR) funded most HUD programs at their FY2006 levels, with some decreases and increases. The CR provided over $36.6 billion for HUD in FY2007. The FY2007 supplemental funding bill made changes to HUD funding levels. The President's FY2008 budget requested a decrease in funding for HUD, targeting the elimination of several programs. The FY2008 funding debate for HUD was influenced by program eliminations or funding cuts, as well as the decline in receipts from the Federal Housing Administration. Legislative proposals were offered to increase the amount available to offset the cost of the budget. On July 11, 2007, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved funding bills for HUD programs, including Section 8 rental assistance and CDBG. The House later approved H.R. 3074 with amendments, transferring funds to housing counseling assistance. The Senate approved legislation on September 12, 2007, with housing-related amendments including funding for foreclosure prevention, translated materials for limited English proficiency individuals, American Dream Downpayment Initiative, and additional funding for tribal colleges and universities. On November 8, 2007, House and Senate conferees agreed to a FY2008 THUD funding bill for HUD. The funding level in the conference agreement was lower than the House and Senate-passed levels but higher than the President's request. The President intended to veto the bill due to the higher funding level. Congress later enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 to fund most of the federal government, including HUD, for the remainder of the fiscal year. The HUD funding level provided in the Act was less than originally approved by the House, Senate, or House-Senate conference committee. The FY2008 THUD funding bill for HUD was originally approved by the House, Senate, or House-Senate conference committee, but is about $2 billion higher than the President's request. It funds most HUD programs at the levels provided in the conference agreement, although it reduces funding for some programs. The bill also contains a rescission of $723 million in advance appropriations for the Section 8 voucher program and was signed into law by the President on December 26, 2007. The FY2008 THUD funding bill for HUD was approved with $16.3 billion provided for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance. The conference agreement funded the account at $16.4 billion, with a rescission of $723 million, leaving $15.6 billion available. Congress has made changes each year in how HUD distributes voucher renewal funding to public housing authorities. In FY2008, Congress made changes to how HUD distributes voucher renewal funding to public housing authorities. The House-passed bill adopted a formula similar to the President's request, while the Senate-passed bill proposed funding based on PHAs' recent leasing and cost data. The conference agreement used a formula similar to the Senate version. The final appropriations act, P.L. 110-161, allocates renewal funding to public housing authorities based on leasing and cost data from the prior year, adjusted for inflation and other factors. Funding is reduced for PHAs with unusable program reserves exceeding 7% of their FY2007 allocation. The total funding for renewals was reduced by $723 million in FY2008 to account for agency reserves. Prior to FY2008, no new incremental vouchers had been funded since FY2002. The House and Senate bills proposed funding for incremental vouchers targeted to certain populations, with the final agreement allocating $135 million for homeless veterans, families in the child welfare system, and non-elderly disabled families. The President's FY2008 budget requested a $130 million increase in funding for the public housing Operating Fund. HUD has not provided sufficient appropriations to fund all PHAs at 100% of their Operating Fund formula eligibility. The FY2008 appropriations law provides $200 million more than the President's request for the Operating Fund. For FY2008, the President requested $2 billion for the Capital Fund, a $400 million reduction from FY2007 funding. The House- and Senate-passed bills would have increased funding above the President's requested level for the public housing Capital Fund. P.L. 110-161 funds the account at the House-passed level. The President also requested no new funds for the HOPE VI program in FY2008. P.L. 110-161 provides $100 million for the HOPE VI program in FY2008, which is less than the House bill's proposed $120 million but the same as the Senate bill. The President's budget recommended $3 billion for the CDBG program, a 20% decrease from FY2007. H.R. 3074 would have allocated $3.9 billion for CDBG formula grants, while the Senate version proposed $3.7 billion. The conference agreement for funding CDBG formula grants was $3.8 billion, slightly higher than the $3.7 billion proposed. P.L. 110-161 allocated $3.6 billion for CDBG, less than what was proposed by the House, Senate, or conference agreement. The Community Development Fund also funded other programs like EDIs and NIs, which the President's budget aimed to eliminate as duplicative of CDBG activities. Both House and Senate bills included funding for EDIs and NIs earmarks, with varying amounts allocated. The Administration's budget proposed reducing funding for EDIs and NIs, with the final allocation in P.L. 110-161 being $180 million for EDIs and $26 million for NIs. Additionally, the President's request to eliminate funding for programs like Brownfields Redevelopment and Rural Housing Grants was rejected in the House and Senate bills. The House bill included funding for Section 108 loan guarantees, Brownfields Redevelopment, and Rural Housing Grants, while the Senate bill allocated $6 million for these programs. The enacted level for FY2007 was $16.8 million. The Senate bill proposed $6 million for Section 108 loan guarantees, $10 million for Brownfields Redevelopment, and $17 million for Rural Housing and Economic Development. P.L. 110-161 provides $4.5 million for Section 108 loan guarantees, $10 million for Brownfields Redevelopment, and $17 million for Rural Housing and Economic Development. The President's budget for FY2008 proposed a $144 million increase for Homeless Assistance Grants, totaling $1.586 billion. The House and Senate bills proposed different funding levels for homeless programs, with the Senate bill aligning with the President's recommendation of $1.586 billion. The final bill, P.L. 110-161, adopted the Senate's funding level and included $25 million for a new program to rapidly rehouse homeless families. None of the funding bills considered by Congress included the President's proposal for the Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative. The funding bills considered by Congress, including P.L. 110-161, proposed consolidating competitive grants. The President's FY2008 budget suggested reducing funding for the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program. The House-passed version of H.R. 3074 allocated just under $735 million for elderly housing programs, while the Senate-passed version allocated exactly $735 million. P.L. 110-161 provides $735 million for the Section 202 program. The President's FY2008 budget proposed cutting funding for the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program by nearly half, from $237 million to $125 million. The decrease was due to a proposal to stop funding the capital grants component and only fund the rental voucher component. The House-passed bill would have provided funding at the FY2007 level, while the Senate-passed bill, conference agreement, and P.L. 110-161 included $237 million for Section 811 in FY2008. The President's FY2008 budget proposed cutting funding for the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program from $237 million to $125 million. The FHA account was expected to generate $250 million in offsetting receipts, which is less than the administrative expenses. This decline in offsetting receipts is due to FHA's declining market share. The budget included legislative proposals to generate $362 million in savings, including removing the aggregate limit on Home Equity Conversion Mortgages and amending the National Housing Act to increase loan limits on multifamily housing programs. The President's budget proposed cutting funding for the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program. The budget included legislative proposals to increase loan limits on multifamily housing programs and move accounts from the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance fund. Congress adopted the first two proposals but not the proposed transfer of accounts."
