    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Academic Anesthesiology and CRNA Payment Improvement Act of 2006\". Since 1991, Medicare has reduced reimbursements for anesthesia services involving education of nurse anesthetists or anesthesiology residents by 50%, creating financial disincentives for anesthesia education. In 2002, CMS authorized an alternative payment system for nurse anesthesia and anesthesiology resident education, but it has not been widely adopted, and CMS has not further reformed the anesthesia teaching rules. The anesthesia teaching rules have not been reformed further without an Act of Congress. Society has a strong interest in ensuring access to high-quality anesthesia care due to the aging population increasing the demand for anesthesia services. Continued evaluation and innovation are needed to enhance patient safety in anesthesia provision. Improvements in anesthesia are necessary for enhancing patient safety. There are 130 anesthesiology residency programs and 102 accredited nurse anesthesia educational programs in the US. Both programs face challenges in recruiting and retaining faculty under current Medicare payment rules. Reforms to anesthesia teaching rules under Medicare should treat teaching anesthesiologists and CRNAs similarly. Both anesthesiology medical residents and student registered nurse anesthetists should be treated equally and not favored over one another. The Act aims to ensure financial stability of nurse anesthesia and anesthesiology educational programs to support student nurse anesthetists and medical residents in pursuing anesthesia specialties for continued access to quality healthcare. Additionally, a special payment rule is established for teaching anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists. The Act establishes a special payment rule for teaching anesthesiologists involved in training physician residents or student nurse anesthetists in anesthesia cases. The fee schedule amount for each case is determined under specific conditions. The Act sets a payment rule for teaching anesthesiologists in training scenarios. The teaching anesthesiologist must be present during critical portions of the case, and another anesthesiologist must be available for the entire case. The Act specifies that for training student nurse anesthetists, a certified registered nurse anesthetist must work with a teaching anesthesiologist. The teaching anesthesiologist can receive 100 percent of the fee schedule amount if they personally perform the anesthesia services. The Act specifies that a teaching anesthesiologist can medically direct a certified registered nurse anesthetist involved in training student nurse anesthetists in anesthesia cases. Amendments are made for the services of certified registered nurse anesthetists. Amendments are made for the services of certified registered nurse anesthetists, including those involved in training student nurse anesthetists in anesthesia cases. This includes provisions for medically directed or supervised nurse anesthetists in single or concurrent cases. The teaching certified registered nurse anesthetist must be present during critical portions of the anesthesia service and immediately available for the entire case to receive 100 percent of the fee schedule amount. The teaching certified registered nurse anesthetist must be present during critical portions of the anesthesia service to receive 100 percent of the fee schedule amount. Effective January 1, 2007, the amendments made by this section apply to services furnished."
