    "content": "A major challenge in learning image representations is disentangling factors of variation in image formation using an autoencoder architecture. The proposed method overcomes the trade-off between image reconstruction and conditioning output on specified factors by progressively growing the latent code dimension while constraining the Jacobian of the output image. This results in effective models for both disentangling and reconstruction in unsupervised settings. The method demonstrates the applicability of learning disentangled representations in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios, achieving high-quality image generation while controlling multiple attributes with a single model. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods by obtaining more disentangled factors and realistic results without adversarial training. Autoencoders can learn disentangled representations where latent variables correspond to specified factors of variation. The \"shortcut problem\" arises when the latent code dimension is too large, leading the decoder to ignore specified variables. Conversely, a small latent code dimension limits the decoder's reconstruction capabilities. The \"shortcut problem\" in autoencoders occurs when the latent code dimension is too large, leading to distorted reconstructions. To address this, a method is proposed that avoids the shortcut problem without the need for adversarial training. The proposed method aims to avoid the shortcut problem in autoencoders without adversarial training. It involves training a teacher autoencoder with a small latent code dimension to disentangle factors of variation, then constructing a student model with a larger latent code dimension for nuisance variables. The student model optimizes reconstruction loss and an additional constraint to match the teacher's output variation. The proposed method involves training a teacher autoencoder with a small latent code dimension to disentangle factors of variation, then constructing a student model with a larger latent code dimension for nuisance variables. The student model aims for better reconstruction than the teacher model while maintaining disentangling ability and conditioning on specified factors. In this paper, a method called Jacobian supervision is proposed to impose a first-order constraint on factors of variation. Two applications are demonstrated: an unsupervised algorithm for disentangling principal factors in image datasets and training an autoencoder model for facial attribute control. The resulting model surpasses existing methods in reconstruction quality and attribute manipulation ability. Autoencoders are utilized to reconstruct input images and learn a disentangled low-dimensional representation of factors of variation. In this work, the focus is on learning disentangled representations to control factors of variation in generated images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Disentangled representations have applications in downstream tasks like classification and in generative settings for controlling image variations. In a generative setting, adversarial training is used to learn disentangled representations. Fader Networks propose applying the adversarial discriminator on the latent code to prevent it from containing information about specified factors of variation. This allows for visually pleasing attribute manipulations by appending known factors of variation to the latent code. Despite challenges in adversarial training optimization, Fader Networks generalize well to real-valued attribute conditioning. In a generative setting, adversarial training is used to learn disentangled representations. Other disentangling methods like BID5 and BID3 do not require adversarial training and focus on minimizing cross-covariance or using a Variational Autoencoder framework. Domain-transfer methods like BID6 and BID8 involve translating images into unknown domains. In the face generation task, the Jacobian supervision is applied to learn a disentangled image representation with main factors of variation discovered unsupervised. Using a simple autoencoder model, the latent code is split into factors of variation and nuisance variables. The latent code of the teacher is 2-dimensional, representing the main factors of variation in the dataset. A 3-layer MLP was trained on MNIST digits with BatchNorm used for normalization. Sampling the two-dimensional variable resulted in blurry digits, but the hidden variables encoded the digit class. A student autoencoder model was created with a larger latent code to improve reconstruction. To maintain conditioning of the digit class, the Jacobian of the student with respect to the hidden variable y should match that of the teacher. Two random samples from the training set are fed to the student autoencoder to obtain latent codes, which are compared with the teacher's latent codes. By analyzing the Jacobians of the teacher and student decoders, a relationship between the partial derivatives of the output and latent variables is derived. The proposed method enforces assumptions in FORMULA5 and FORMULA6 by using reconstruction losses during training of the student autoencoder. Random pairs are visited during training to impose constraints for random directions sampled from the data, leading to more efficient training. The loss function includes a reconstruction part and a Jacobian part for training the student autoencoder with Jacobian supervision. The unsupervised algorithm discovers principal factors of variation related to stroke and handwriting style. Adding hidden units to the autoencoder reveals new factors of variation. Ablation studies on hyperparameters are presented in the appendix. Cross-covariance between y and z helps in decorrelating disentangled features. In experiments, the loss is weighted with \u03bb xcov = 1e \u22123. The student model produces better reconstructed images than the teacher model, utilizing an expanded latent code. This allows the autoencoder to learn new factors of variation in the dataset. The procedure involves training the student model with increasing hidden units to achieve an unsupervised disentangled representation. The procedure involves training the student model with increasing hidden units to achieve an unsupervised disentangled representation. Results show that the final model can maintain conditioning of the digit class while achieving better reconstruction. Another model without Jacobian supervision also achieves good reconstruction but loses conditioning. Quantitative evaluation of disentangling performance is done by analyzing how the first two latent units control the digit class in each model. The study involves training a student model with increasing hidden units to achieve unsupervised disentangled representation. Results show that the model can maintain conditioning of the digit class while achieving better reconstruction. The reconstruction-disentanglement trade-off is more advantageous for the student with Jacobian supervision. The goal is to obtain a model that has good control over factors affecting image formation in human faces. The study involves training a student model with increasing hidden units to achieve unsupervised disentangled representation. Using Jacobian supervision, the model aims to control factors affecting image formation in human faces through faithful image reconstruction. The training procedure includes a teacher autoencoder to first learn disentangling, followed by training the student model to improve visual quality. The training process involves a teacher model for disentangling attributes and a student model for improving visual quality. The teacher model reconstructs input images while predicting ground truth attribute labels, with the goal of encoding specified attributes in y and remaining information in z. The training process involves a teacher model for disentangling attributes and a student model for improving visual quality. The attributes part of the latent code y is swapped with another training sample to produce a new image. The reconstruction is evaluated using the same encoder, without the need for adversarial training. The loss function used for training consists of multiple loss terms. The autoencoder does not require adversarial training and consists of reconstruction loss, prediction loss, and cycle-consistency loss to control variations of attributes in generated images. Compared to other methods, the decoder learns from real-valued predicted attributes, allowing for subtle variations and generalization to unseen combinations of content and attributes. The autoencoder uses cycle-consistency loss to generate images with attributes not present in the training set. By forming a new artificial latent code, the decoder should produce an image with the attributes of one image and the content of another. This approach allows for generalization to unseen combinations of content and attributes. The training approach involves sampling predictions from the data to ease the task of the decoder and ensure generalization to unseen attribute values. To prevent the encoder from replicating input codes, the weights of the encoder are frozen during backpropagation of cycle-consistency losses.

To prevent the encoder from replicating input codes, the weights of the encoder are frozen during backpropagation of cycle-consistency losses. The global loss used to train the teacher includes five terms with weights \u03bb i \u2208 R, i = 1 : 5. Ablation studies on the contribution of each loss are detailed in the appendix. After training the teacher, a student autoencoder model with a larger dimension for nuisance variables z is created and trained using reconstruction and Jacobian supervision. Both teacher and student autoencoders are implemented as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Further architecture and implementation details are provided in the Appendix. The method is trained and evaluated on the CelebA dataset with 200,000 aligned faces of celebrities and 40 annotated attributes. The latent code of the teacher autoencoder consists of a feature map with 512 channels. The encoder concatenates 40 channels for attributes, resulting in latent vectors with dimensions of 40 for y and 2048 for z. A symmetrical architecture is used for the decoder, with attribute prediction concatenated to every feature map. Grid search is performed to find weights, with \u03bb values of 10^2, 10^-1, 10^-1, 10^-4, and 10^-5 used in experiments. The teacher autoencoder is trained with weights \u03bb values of 10^2, 10^-1, 10^-1, 10^-4, and 10^-5. Initially, only reconstruction, attribute prediction, and linear decorrelation are trained. After 100 epochs, cycle-consistency losses are introduced for another 100 epochs. The student model is created by increasing the latent code dimension from d = 2048 to d = 4096 at the 200th epoch. The latent code size was doubled from d = 2048 to d = 4096 at the 200th epoch and then to d = 8192 at the 400th epoch. The student model was trained using reconstruction and Jacobian loss with specific hyperparameters. Images from CelebA were used for training and validation, with quantitative evaluation on a separate validation set. The study focused on evaluating how well disentangled attributes could be flipped in generated images. They used a multiplier to exaggerate attributes and verified the flipping using an external classifier. Results showed that the student with Jacobian supervision outperformed the student without it in flipping attributes. The study found that the student with Jacobian supervision excelled in flipping attributes in generated images compared to the student without it. The Fader Networks BID19 model is considered state-of-the-art in face image generation with continuous control of facial attributes. Training Fader Networks models with different dimensions did not converge, possibly due to the adversarial discriminator affecting reconstruction and optimization stability. Comparisons with these models are detailed in Table 2 and FIG4 in the appendix. The study compares the disentanglement and reconstruction performance of different models in facial attribute manipulation. Results are shown in Table 2 and FIG4 in the appendix, demonstrating the ability to flip specified attributes by manipulating latent variables. The multiple-attribute model performs similarly to single-attribute Fader Networks models. Manipulating 32 attributes for eight subjects is shown in FIG1 using the student model with Jacobian supervision. In this work, the study explores the limitations of learning image representations with autoencoder architectures. They found that certain attributes are difficult for the model to manipulate due to poor representation in the dataset or complexity. To overcome this, they propose a method of using a teacher model for disentanglement and imposing its Jacobian on a student model for better reconstruction. This approach allows the student model to excel in both disentangling and reconstruction tasks. Two applications of this idea are demonstrated, including unsupervised learning of principal factors of variation and a generative model.

The resulting model can manipulate more facial attributes than state-of-the-art methods, with similar or superior visual results, and without requiring adversarial training. The encoder and decoder architectures consist of Convolution-BatchNorm-ReLU layers with stride 2 for spatial reduction. The encoder takes a 256x256 image as input and uses 4x4 convolutional kernels with Leaky ReLU. The decoder includes deconvolutional blocks for upsampling. Training was done with Adam optimizer, batch size of 128, and specific learning rates. A comparison chart with related methods is provided, and the method was applied to the SVHN dataset for unsupervised learning of disentangled representations. The experiment focused on learning disentangled representations on the SVHN dataset using specific encoder and decoder architectures. The latent code was progressively grown from k=2, d=0 to k=2, d=16, with each stage trained for 25 epochs. Different parameters and optimization techniques were used to achieve reconstruction MSE values for the teacher and student models.

The latent code was progressively grown from k=2, d=0 to k=2, d=16, with each stage trained for 25 epochs. The model achieved a reconstruction MSE of 4.06e\u22123. The two principal factors of variation learned were related to shading of the digit, not the digit class. Factors of variation related to lighting, contrast, and color were also discovered. The student model was able to control the digit class while maintaining the style of the digit, with control over the main factors of variation. The student model with Jacobian supervision and d = 16 can manipulate the digit class while maintaining the style of the digit by varying latent units.
