    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Answer Africa's Call Act\". The Congress finds that African poverty and stagnation require a strong response from the United States. The world, including the U.S., has unprecedented wealth, while Africa faces high child mortality rates due to easily treatable illnesses like malaria. In Africa, over 250,000 women die annually from pregnancy complications. Additionally, 40,000,000 children in Africa cannot attend school daily. Despite advancements in AIDS treatment, 25,000,000 people in Africa are infected, with 2,000,000 deaths expected in 2005 due to lack of access to antiretroviral drugs. In rich nations, excessive subsidies for food production amount to almost $1 billion daily, while in Africa, hunger causes more deaths than infectious diseases. Disparities in government subsidies are evident, with European cows receiving $2 daily compared to the average African daily income of $1. The stark contrast between the lives of rich and poor is highlighted, as one in six African children dies before age 5. African children under 5 face high mortality rates due to preventable diseases like vitamin A deficiency and intestinal worms. Lack of access to safe water and sanitation is a significant issue, with a large portion of the population affected. HIV prevalence is high among young people in Africa, and the continent has a large number of orphans, many of whom are orphaned due to AIDS. In Zambia, a majority of child prostitutes are orphans. The Congress supports implementing the recommendations of the Commission for Africa to increase foreign assistance, provide debt relief, eliminate agricultural subsidies, and remove trade barriers in sub-Saharan Africa.
