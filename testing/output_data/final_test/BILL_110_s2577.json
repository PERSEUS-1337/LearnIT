    "content": "The Gun Show Background Check Act of 2008 may be cited as the \"Gun Show Background Check Act.\" It pertains to background checks at gun shows. Congress finds that approximately 5,200 traditional gun shows are held annually in the United States, attracting thousands of attendees and involving Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers. These events play a significant role in the national firearms market and impact interstate commerce. Gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events provide a centralized location for the sale or exchange of firearms, often without background checks or records for tracing. Criminals and prohibited persons can easily obtain guns at these events, leading to potential misuse in later crimes. Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993, over 70 million background checks have been conducted, stopping 1.36 million illegal buyers. Gun shows and organized events facilitate interstate transportation of firearms, contributing to the national issue of gun violence. Firearms from these events have been illegally transferred to residents of other states. Congress has the power to prevent criminals and prohibited persons from obtaining firearms at gun shows and organized events with the enactment of this Act. Gun show is defined as an event where 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, transfer, or exchange. The term 'gun show promoter' refers to a person who organizes, plans, promotes, or operates a gun show. A 'gun show vendor' is someone who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, or exchanges firearms at a gun show. Gun shows involve the sale, transfer, or exchange of firearms and must meet certain criteria such as having at least 20% firearm exhibitors, 10 firearm exhibitors, or offering 50 or more firearms for sale. The regulation of firearms transfers at gun shows includes the requirement for gun show promoters to register with the Attorney General and pay a registration fee. Gun show promoters are responsible for organizing, planning, promoting, and operating gun shows. Gun show promoters must verify the identity of vendors, have them sign a ledger and notice, and notify attendees of the regulations. Gun show promoters are required to maintain records as prescribed by the Attorney General and ensure that firearm transactions at gun shows are only conducted through licensed individuals. Non-licensed individuals are prohibited from transferring firearms to other non-licensed individuals at gun shows unless done through a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer in compliance with regulations. The section specifies that firearm transfers at gun shows must be conducted through licensed individuals, and non-licensed vendors are not subject to recordkeeping requirements imposed by the Attorney General. At gun shows, nonlicensed vendors must transfer firearms through licensed individuals to comply with criminal background check requirements. Nonlicensed vendors at gun shows must transfer firearms through licensed individuals to comply with background check requirements. Licensed importers, manufacturers, or dealers assisting in the transfer must enter firearm information as required by the Attorney General into a separate bound record. Nonlicensed vendors at gun shows must transfer firearms through licensed individuals to comply with background check requirements. The Attorney General requires the transfer to be recorded in a separate bound record and on a specified form. The licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer must also comply with section 922(t) and notify the nonlicensed transferor and transferee of the compliance. The licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer must submit a report of the transfer to the Attorney General within 10 days, following the requirements of section 922(t)(1). The report should not include identifying information of non-licensed individuals involved in the transfer. Licensed importers, manufacturers, or dealers must report multiple transfers of 2 or more pistols or revolvers to the same nonlicensed person within 5 consecutive business days. The report must be submitted to the Attorney General and the appropriate State law office on a specified form by the close of business on the transfer date. Licensed importers, manufacturers, or dealers must retain records of firearm transfers as part of their permanent business records. If a firearm transaction occurs at a gun show, they must submit a report to the Attorney General within 10 days, without including identifying information about the transferee. The section defines a \"firearm transaction\" as including the sale, transfer, or exchange of a firearm, but not the mere exhibition of a firearm. Penalties are outlined for knowingly violating the regulations, including fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years. Penalties for violating firearm transaction regulations include fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years, with escalating penalties for repeat offenses. Penalties for violating firearm transaction regulations include fines up to $10,000 and potential registration suspension or revocation for up to 6 months. Technical and conforming amendments are made to Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code. The amendment allows the Attorney General to inspect gun show promoters' businesses and show locations to ensure compliance with firearm transaction regulations. The amendment allows the Attorney General to inspect gun show promoters' businesses and show locations to ensure compliance with firearm transaction regulations.

The amendment increases penalties for violations of criminal background check requirements under section 922(t) of title 18, United States Code. Offenders can face fines, imprisonment up to 5 years for certain offenses, and up to 10 years for others.
