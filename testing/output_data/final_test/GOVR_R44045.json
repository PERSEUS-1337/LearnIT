    "content": "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the inclusion of renewable fuels in the nation's transportation fuel supply. Obligated parties like refiners or importers must comply with the requirements administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The RFS, established in 2005 and expanded in 2007, increases renewable fuel volume annually until 2022, with EPA having the authority to waive requirements under certain conditions. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a complex policy initiative that deals with multiple sectors of the economy and requires advanced renewable fuel production technologies. It includes thresholds for greenhouse gas emission reduction and has multiple stakeholders with differing perspectives. Congressional debate on the RFS is ongoing, with a focus on how the EPA administers the program and the waiver authority granted to the EPA. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) established a program requiring transportation fuel in the US to contain renewable fuel. The mandate calls for increasing consumption of renewable fuel from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. The statute identifies two major categories of renewable fuels: unspecified biofuel (mainly cornstarch ethanol) and advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic biofuel). The RFS transitions from biofuels made from food and feed crops to nonfood and nonfeed crops over time. In 2022, the Renewable Fuel Standard requires advanced biofuels to make up close to 60% of the 36 billion gallon mandate, with unspecified biofuels at about 40%. The EPA Administrator has the authority to adjust renewable fuel volumes based on certain conditions. Standards must be set by November 30 of the preceding year. If the cellulosic biofuel volume is reduced, total renewable fuel and advanced biofuel volumes may also be reduced. Biomass-based diesel volumes are specified for four years, with announcements made 14 months in advance. The EPA issues annual biomass-based diesel volume standards 14 months before they apply. The Renewable Fuel Standard contains waiver provisions for the EPA Administrator to adjust renewable fuel volumes. Waivers expire after one year unless renewed. The EPA Administrator has the authority to waive overall RFS requirements if renewable fuel supply is inadequate or if implementation would harm the economy or environment. Waivers can be issued at the Administrator's discretion or if petitioned by a state or fuel provider, with a 90-day decision timeline after receiving a petition. The EPA Administrator can waive RFS requirements if renewable fuel supply is insufficient or if implementation would cause harm. Consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy is required for a general waiver, which applies nationally. However, for a cellulosic biofuel waiver, consultation is not mandatory, but the Administrator must base the decision on projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The EPA Administrator consults with various stakeholders before considering a cellulosic biofuel waiver. The required volume must be set by November 30 of the preceding year. If the cellulosic biofuel volume is reduced, the volumes of advanced biofuel and renewable fuel may also be reduced. Waiver credits are offered for obligated parties to purchase instead of actual cellulosic biofuel. The Administrator has the authority to reduce the amount of biomass-based diesel required for up to 60 days. The Administrator has the authority to reduce the amount of biomass-based diesel required for up to 60 days in case of significant market circumstances. If the circumstances persist, another 60-day waiver may be issued after consulting with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture. The Administrator can also reduce volumes of advanced biofuel and renewable fuel accordingly. EPA has not yet utilized this waiver authority. The EPA Administrator has the authority to modify the applicable volumes of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in future years if certain conditions are met, such as waiving the renewable fuel mandate by a certain percentage for consecutive years. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, will determine the modified volumes based on program implementation and environmental impact. EPA has the authority to reduce biomass-based diesel volumes in case of significant market circumstances. The EPA has used its authority to reduce the required volumes of cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel due to expected shortfalls. Waivers were issued for 2010 through 2018, with a general waiver for prior final rules and specific waivers for individual years. The EPA has not granted a biomass-based diesel waiver and has issued final rules for 2016 through 2019 according to the statutory schedule. Delays in issuing final standards under the waiver authority could cause difficulties for obligated parties and renewable fuel producers. The EPA has issued final rules for 2016 through 2019 according to the statutory schedule. Stakeholders with different views on waiver authority impacts include the advanced biofuel industry, conventional biofuel industry, and petroleum industry. Some advocate concerns about weakening confidence in renewable fuel markets, while others assert the waiver authority is necessary. The EPA's waiver authority in the petroleum industry addresses the use of excess ethanol, providing flexibility in setting volume requirements. The 2019 final rule triggered a reset for total renewable fuel, with upcoming rulemaking to reset volume targets for 2020-2022. Stakeholders have questions about how the EPA will implement the reset section of the Renewable Fuel Standard. The EPA Administrator has the discretion to modify the applicable volumes of the Renewable Fuel Standard starting in 2016 based on certain conditions. There is interest in how this reset may impact public and private investments in biofuels and the transition to advanced biofuels by 2022. Stakeholders are concerned about high compliance costs and the potential implications for the fuel industry if the EPA reduces volumes or maintains ambitious targets."
