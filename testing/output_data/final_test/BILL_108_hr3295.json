    "content": "The \"Neighbors in Need Act\" includes provisions for temporary extended unemployment compensation, federal unemployment benefit system reforms, and amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Neighbors in Need Act\" includes a 2-year suspension of tax on unemployment compensation, state collection of Federal unemployment tax, and required distribution of State-specific information packets. Additionally, it provides for additional weeks of benefits under temporary extended unemployment compensation. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is amended to provide additional weeks of benefits equal to 8 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. The amendment takes effect retroactively and applies to weeks of unemployment starting from the enactment date. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is amended to provide additional weeks of benefits based on exhaustion of amounts occurring after the enactment date. SEC. 102. PROGRAM EXTENSION IN STATES WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. This section applies to States with an extended benefit period in effect in December 2003. For qualifying States, the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is extended to March 31, 2004. In subsection (b)(1), the date is changed from December 31, 2003 to March 31, 2004. Subsection (b)(2) and (b)(3) also have date changes to March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004 respectively. Definitions for \"State\" and \"week\" are provided based on the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002. The Act does not affect unemployment benefits under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003. The amendments under section 4002 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 will take effect as if included in the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002. SEC. 201 of TITLE II amends the Social Security Act to adjust earnings credited to state accounts based on meeting or failing funding goals. If the average daily balance in a State account in the Unemployment Trust Fund exceeds the funding goal, the amount credited will be increased by an interest premium. If the balance is below the funding goal, the amount credited will be decreased by an interest penalty, with a limit of $2,500,000 per quarter. The interest premium or penalty for states with excess balances in the Unemployment Trust Fund is calculated based on a percentage of the difference between the average daily balance and the funding goal. The Secretary adjusts interest premiums if they exceed penalties for a quarter. The term 'interest penalty' is defined for each state based on funding goal differences in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The funding goal for a State is calculated based on the average of unemployment benefits paid over a 20-year period. The percentage value is determined by the ratio of the funding goal excess to one-half of one percent. The excess of the average daily balance in a State account in the Unemployment Trust Fund over the funding goal is calculated as a percentage. Conforming amendments are made to the Social Security Act regarding amounts credited to state accounts and the interest rate on repayment of advances. The amendments made by this section apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2007. The Secretary of Labor must submit a report to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of this Act, recommending funding sources for interest premiums under subsection (h) of section 904 of the Social Security Act. SEC. 202 amends the Social Security Act to restrict interest-free advances to state accounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund to states meeting funding goals. The amendment applies to calendar years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, TITLE III suspends tax on unemployment compensation for 2 years under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SECTION 301 suspends tax on unemployment compensation for 2 years starting in 2004 or 2005. SECTION 302 amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow states to collect federal unemployment tax. At the election of a certified State, employers paying contributions into an unemployment fund must submit the tax to the State instead of the Secretary. Payment to the State is considered timely if made alongside contributions to the fund. The tax imposed by this chapter must be paid by the employer to the State if the State elects to receive it instead of the Secretary. The State must transmit the tax amount to the Secretary along with employer tax returns. Additional information may be required by the Secretary through regulations. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 23 of the Code. The Code is amended by replacing the item for section 3311 with new items. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004. Required distribution of state-specific information packets is mandated. SEC. 303 amends the Internal Revenue Code to require states to distribute State-specific information packets to explain unemployment insurance eligibility conditions. This amendment applies to certifications of States for 2004, with a deadline of July 1, 2005, for compliance if the state legislature does not meet in a regular session closing in 2004."
