    "content": "The diversity immigrant visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1990 to promote new and varied migration. Diversity visas are allocated to countries with lower immigrant admissions in the past five years. The term \"immigrant\" is synonymous with legal permanent resident. The Immigration Amendments of 1965 replaced the national origins quota system with per-country ceilings. In response to concerns about skewed immigration admissions, the NP-5 visa lottery was introduced in 1986, benefiting natives of 36 countries. Over 1 million people applied, with Irish natives being the main winners. Congress extended the lottery for two more years, offering 15,000 immigrant visas annually in FY1989 and FY1990. The diversity immigrant category was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1990, making 15,000 visas available annually in FY1989 and FY1990. The program went fully into effect in FY1995 with an allocation of 55,000 visas per year. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 temporarily decreased the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas starting in FY1999. The diversity visa program was established in 1990, initially offering 15,000 visas annually and later increasing to 55,000 visas per year in FY1995. Starting in FY1999, the annual ceiling was reduced by up to 5,000 visas to accommodate certain unsuccessful asylum seekers from specific countries. To qualify for a diversity visa, an applicant must have a high school education or equivalent, or two years of relevant work experience. Spouses and minor children of the qualifying immigrant can also accompany them as legal permanent residents. The FY2012 Diversity Lottery registration began on October 5, 2010, and closed on November 3, 2010. Applicants will find out if they are selected on May 1, 2011. There are fees associated with the diversity visa lottery, including a $305 immigrant visa fee and a $440 diversity visa fee. Additional fees are paid to USCIS for processing. Diversity lottery winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors. The Diversity Visa lottery offers 50,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years. USCIS allocates visas based on global regions' populations, favoring under-represented countries. Approved applicants become Legal Permanent Residents of the United States. The Diversity Visa lottery offers 50,000 visas annually to countries with low immigrant admissions in the past five years, with allocation weighted in favor of under-represented regions. The regional distribution of diversity immigrants has shifted over time, with Europe, Africa, and Germany playing significant roles in receiving diversity visas. In FY1994, Congress allocated diversity visas, with Germany being the only country in the top 20 source countries for FY2009. The top 20 source countries for FY1999, FY2004, and FY2009 included Bulgaria, Nigeria, Albania, Ukraine, Ethiopia, Morocco, Ghana, Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, and Kenya. Diversity immigrants come from regions different from leading immigrant sending regions, with almost half coming from Africa in FY2009. In FY2009, Asia accounted for 35% of all LPRs and 28% of diversity immigrants, showcasing the complexities of the allocation formula. Key sending countries included China, India, and the Philippines, as well as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Turkey. In FY2009, Asia had 35% of LPRs and 28% of diversity immigrants. Diversity immigrants had more managerial and professional occupations compared to LPRs. They also included more children and youth and were more likely to obtain LPR status at a younger age. In FY2009, diversity immigrants were younger and less likely to be married compared to LPRs. Over half of diversity immigrants were single, with a higher percentage of males. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate the diversity visa category. The Legal Immigration and America's Security Act would eliminate the diversity visa category, a topic of debate in Congress due to fairness and security concerns. Policy questions surrounding the diversity visa category are likely to arise in future discussions. The issue of the diversity visa category is nested in the broader immigration debate, often seen as a \"zero-sum game.\" Some argue for reallocating diversity visas to reduce backlogs in other visa categories, while others believe comprehensive immigration reform is needed to address family-based and employment-based backlog issues. References to human trafficking involving diversity visas have also been made. Forced labor rings exploit diversity visas by listing trafficked women as family members on visa applications. Fraud investigations and arrests have occurred, prompting revisions to lottery procedures. The case of Hesham Mohamed Ali Hedayet, who obtained LPR status through the diversity visa program and committed a violent act, is often cited as a concern. Some argue for the elimination of the diversity visa lottery due to security concerns, citing vulnerabilities to national security and terrorism. However, others point out that immigrants from these countries are not restricted in other LPR visa categories and undergo background checks. Congress has enacted visa security reforms since the early 2000s, with no documented evidence of security risks from DV immigrants. Some argue for eliminating the diversity visa lottery due to security concerns, while others suggest alternative methods like a point system for allocating visas. Critics question if the diversity visa still serves its purpose after 20 years, pointing out overlap with top immigrant source countries."
