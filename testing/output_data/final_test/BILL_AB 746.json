    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 66703 of the Government Code is amended to establish a board of seven voting members for the authority, with specific representation from bayside cities or counties in the North Bay and East Bay regions. The board of the authority will consist of seven voting members, with representation from bayside cities or counties in the South Bay, West Bay, and other bayside areas. The Association of Bay Area Governments appoints members to a regional park district or open-space district along the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Vacancies are filled within 90 days. The authority has powers necessary to carry out its purposes. The authority appointed by the Association of Bay Area Governments has the power to levy benefit assessments, special taxes, or property-related fees consistent with California Constitution requirements until December 31, 2048. They may levy benefit assessments under specific acts such as the Improvement Act of 1911, Improvement Bond Act of 1915, and Municipal Improvement Act of 1913. The authority appointed by the Association of Bay Area Governments has the power to levy benefit assessments, special taxes, or property-related fees until December 31, 2048. They can also apply for grants, solicit gifts, issue revenue bonds, and incur general obligation bonded indebtedness for specific purposes. The general obligation bonded indebtedness must be paid off before January 1, 2049. The authority appointed by the Association of Bay Area Governments can levy assessments, taxes, and fees until December 31, 2048.

The authority appointed by the Association of Bay Area Governments has the power to sue and be sued, engage counsel, enter contracts, hire staff, and use interim staff. They can also enter joint powers agreements and define staff qualifications and compensation. Section 66704.05 of the Government Code is amended to require a special election for measures proposed by the authority that will generate revenues. The special election will be consolidated with the next statewide election and the measure will be submitted to the voters in the appropriate counties. The authority, defined as a district in the Elections Code, must submit any measure requiring voter approval to the voters in accordance with the Elections Code. The appropriations limit for the authority will be based on receipts from the initial revenue-generating measure, without constituting a change in appropriations limit for the authority. The authority must file a resolution with the board of supervisors of each county where the measure will appear on the ballot, requesting consolidation and providing the exact ballot question. The legal counsel for the authority will prepare an impartial analysis of the measure, subject to review by the county counsel of the county with the largest population among those where the measure will be voted on. (e) Each county included in the measure must use the provided ballot question, impartial analysis, and ballot language. The county with the largest population among those required to translate ballot materials into the same language will prepare the translation for all counties. (f) If a measure is voted on in multiple counties, they must agree on the same letter designation for the measure. The county clerk reports special election results to the authority. The authority reimburses counties for incremental costs related to submitting revenue-generating measures to voters. Incremental costs include preparing impartial analysis and translating ballot materials into languages other than English. The curr_chunk discusses additional costs for election races or ballot measures, including printing and mailing of ballot materials and canvassing votes. The subdivision is set to be repealed on January 1, 2019. Additionally, Section 66706 of the Government Code is amended to remain in effect until January 1, 2049, unless a later statute extends or deletes that date. The San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority has no associated appropriations limit and is affirmed to incur bonded indebtedness. No reimbursement required by this act as local agencies or school districts can levy charges to cover mandated services."
