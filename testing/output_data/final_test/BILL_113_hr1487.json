    "content": "The Act titled \"Improved Health Care at Lower Cost Act of 2013\" allows hospitals to make incentive payments to physicians under certain programs without federal sanctions. Congress finds that the Department of Health and Human Services has been approving gain-sharing arrangements on a project-by-project basis for nearly a decade. The Inspector General issued a bulletin in 1999 stating there is no general authority to waive sanctions for such arrangements between physicians and hospitals. Many hospitals face limitations due to lack of capitalization, size, and risk factors. The purpose of this section is to establish statutory authority for gain-sharing and incentive payment programs between hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and decrease costs while maintaining quality care. This includes an exception from the Physician Self-Referral Prohibition under the Social Security Act. The section establishes authority for incentive payment programs between hospitals and physicians to improve efficiency and reduce costs while maintaining quality care. The program aligns incentives through techniques like product standardization, lower cost products, and care coordination initiatives. The Safe Harbor provision under Section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act is amended to include monetary incentive payments from hospitals to physicians under incentive payment programs. The Safe Harbor provision under Section 1128B(b)(3) of the Social Security Act is amended to include monetary incentive payments from hospitals to physicians under incentive payment programs, with requirements established by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. Section 1128A(b)(1) is also amended to exclude such payments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Inspector General are required to publish guidance within 6 months of enactment. Human Services shall publish a solicitation of comments and guidance within specified timeframes to carry out amendments. The shared savings program under the Social Security Act is not affected by these amendments."
