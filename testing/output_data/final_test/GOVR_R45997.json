    "content": "This report provides an overview of seven federally-chartered regional commissions and authorities, including their structure, activities, legislative history, and funding. These agencies, such as the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Delta Regional Authority, integrate federal and state economic development priorities with regional and local considerations. They rely on congressional appropriations for their operations. Seven federal regional commissions and authorities, including the Appalachian Regional Commission, were authorized by Congress to address economic distress in multi-state regions. The Denali Commission was founded in 1998, Delta Regional Authority in 2000, and Northern Great Plains Regional Authority in 2002. The most recent commissions were authorized in 2008. The Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Denali Commission, and Northern Border Regional Commission are active federal regional commissions addressing economic distress. Their missions have remained consistent over time, focusing on economic development through various program areas such as infrastructure, energy, environment, workforce, and business development. The Appalachian Regional Commission was established in 1965 specifically for the Appalachian region. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was established in 1965 to address economic distress in the Appalachian region spanning 420 counties across 13 states. Its mission has evolved to include regional competitiveness in a global economic environment. The ARC is a federally-chartered, regional economic development entity led by a federal co-chair appointed by the President and 13 state governors. The ARC is a federal-state partnership with a federal co-chair appointed by the President and 13 state governors. The commission follows a Regional Development Plan (RDP) that integrates economic development priorities at the local, state, and federal levels. The RDP includes strategic plans, bylaws, member state development plans, annual strategy statements, program budgets, and implementation guidelines. The ARC is a federal-state partnership that integrates economic development priorities into a common regional agenda. States establish goals and priorities through state plans and work statements, consulting with local development districts (LDDs). There are 73 ARC-associated LDDs that advise on local priorities and may receive funding. State and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and federally and state-designated tribal entities are eligible for ARC investments. Non-federally recognized, state-designated tribal entities can also receive ARC funding. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) strategic plan, adopted in November 2015, prioritizes five investment goals: entrepreneurial and business development, workforce development, infrastructure development, natural and cultural assets, and leadership and community capacity. ARC's investment activities are divided into 10 program areas, which can be funded through five types of eligible activities including business development, education and training, health care, and physical infrastructure projects. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) prioritizes five investment goals: entrepreneurial and business development, workforce development, infrastructure development, natural and cultural assets, and leadership and community capacity. ARC's investment activities include economic development grants, with $50 million reserved for the POWER Initiative to address economic and labor dislocations in coal communities. ARC designates counties based on economic distress levels, influencing funding priority and grant match requirements. Distress designations by the ARC determine funding priority and grant match requirements based on economic indicators. Counties are classified into distress levels ranging from distressed to attainment, reflecting their ranking compared to national averages. The ARC determines funding priority and grant match requirements based on distress designations, ranging from distressed to attainment counties. Funding levels are tied to distress levels, with exceptions and allowances for matching grants from other sources. In 1960, Appalachian governors formed the Council of Appalachian Governors to address economic distress. President Kennedy established the President's Appalachian Regional Commission in 1963 to develop an economic program. The ARC was created in 1965 to implement the PARC's recommendations and included Ohio, New York, and Mississippi counties. The ARC was established in 1965 to implement the PARC's recommendations and included counties in New York and Mississippi. The ARC was directed to administer various initiatives such as the Appalachian Development Highway System, health facilities funding, land conservation programs, vocational education, and sewage treatment infrastructure. In 1975, amendments required state governors to serve as state representatives on the commission and expanded public participation in ARC plans and programs. The 1998 legislative reforms expanded public participation in ARC plans and programs. They introduced county-level distress designations and imposed limitations on funding for economically strong counties. The act also withdrew the ARC's legislative mandate for certain programs. The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 2002 expanded the ARC's support for LDDs, emphasized ecological issues, and increased its coordinating role in federal economic development activities. The amendments also introduced new stipulations for grant making, limiting funding to 50% of project costs or 80% in distressed counties. Additionally, the amendments expanded the ARC's efforts in human capital development projects, including vocational and skill training initiatives. The 2008 Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments introduced funding limitations for ARC grant activities, including restrictions on project funding amounts and commission contributions. It also established an economic and energy development initiative, expanded county designations to include \"at-risk\" areas, and increased the number of counties under the ARC's jurisdiction. The legislation specified that grants should not exceed 50% of administrative expenses, with exceptions for distressed and at-risk counties. The 2008 Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments introduced funding limitations for ARC grant activities, including restrictions on project funding amounts. Eligible activities could only be funded by the ARC at a maximum of 50% of the project cost, with exceptions for distressed and \"at-risk\" counties. Special project categories were introduced, such as demonstration health projects, low- and middle-income housing projects, telecommunications and technology initiative, entrepreneurship initiative, and regional skills partnership. The legislation also included an economic and energy development initiative to support energy efficiency and renewable technologies. Distress designations were expanded to include an \"at-risk\" category, increasing the number of distress levels to five. Additionally, the legislation expanded the ARC's service area by adding ten counties in four states. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has expanded its service area by adding ten counties in four states, representing the most recent expansion. The ARC is a federal-state partnership with administrative costs shared equally by the federal government and states. Its funding has increased significantly, reaching $165 million in FY2019, with a 126% growth from FY2008. This growth is attributed to incremental increases in appropriations and a $50 million increase in annual funds in FY2016 for the POWER Initiative, which aimed to support coal communities affected by industry decline. The House budget proposed to close the ARC and other federal regional commissions, but Congress continued to fund them. The Delta Regional Authority, established in 2000, aims to improve economic opportunities in the Mississippi River Delta region for 10 million people in 252 designated counties and parishes across eight states. Like the ARC, the DRA is a federal-state partnership with shared administrative expenses and federally funded activities. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) consists of eight state governors who appoint representatives to apply for funding for projects in 252 counties/parishes. Funding decisions are based on the DRA's strategic plan and state priorities, with the current plan, \"Moving the Delta Forward,\" in effect until 2021. The plan focuses on workforce competitiveness and economic development goals. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) has a strategic plan in effect until 2021 with three primary goals: workforce competitiveness, strengthened infrastructure, and increased community capacity. The DRA funds projects through 44 LDDs, which provide support and services for entities applying for funding. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) designates distressed counties based on unemployment and income criteria, with priority funding for these counties. At least 75% of funds are directed to distressed counties, with half targeting transportation and infrastructure. The DRA's main investment tool is the States' Economic Development Assistance Program (SEDAP). The DRA's States' Economic Development Assistance Program (SEDAP) provides direct investment into community-based and regional projects addressing four funding priorities: basic public infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, workforce development, and business development. SEDAP funding allocation is determined by a formula balancing geographic breadth, population size, and economic distress factors. Investments are awarded from state allocations, and applications are accepted through Local Development Districts (LDDs). The DRA awards investments from state allocations through the SEDAP program. Projects are sorted into tiers of priority based on federal eligibility criteria and adherence to the DRA's funding priorities. The DRA is mandated to allocate 50% of SEDAP dollars to basic public and transportation infrastructure projects. The Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission (LMDDC) was created in 1989 with a $2 million appropriation from the Appropriations Act (P.L. 100-460). Chaired by Governor Bill Clinton, the LMDDC studied economic issues in the Delta and released reports before its mandate ended in 1990. The Clinton Administration later supported federal involvement in Delta economic development, leading to the 1994 Lower Mississippi Delta Region Heritage Study Act. The 1994 act led to a study on cultural, natural, and heritage sites in the Mississippi Delta region. In 2000, the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) was authorized based on the LMDDC's recommendations, with the addition of Alabama and more counties. The 2002 farm bill amended voting procedures for DRA states and provided new funds for regional projects. The DRA was reauthorized and expanded to include additional counties in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi through various farm bills from 2008 to 2018. Funding authorizations for the DRA have been consistent at $30 million annually, although actual appropriations have varied. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, receives federal funding for rural economic development in Alaska. Its annual appropriations have increased from $5 million in 2004 to $25 million currently. The commission's mission includes providing economic assistance to distressed rural regions in Alaska, but it no longer engages in general economic development activities. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, focuses on coastal and energy infrastructure projects in Alaska. Its unique structure includes seven members appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the Alaska governor. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, has a unique model compared to other federal regional commissions. The federal co-chair is appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, allowing for quicker appointments. The Commission is required by law to create an annual work plan, reviewed by key stakeholders, with strategic goals focusing on facilities management, infrastructure protection, energy, and innovation. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, focuses on energy, infrastructure protection, and economic distress in rural areas of Alaska. It utilizes standards to assess distress in rural communities, with appeals possible only with evidence of erroneous data or analysis by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, focuses on energy, infrastructure protection, and economic distress in rural areas of Alaska. Appeals for erroneous data or analysis are accepted only for the same reporting year. Due to funding constraints, the commission shifted focus to rural fuel and energy infrastructure and coastal protection efforts. Projects have mainly centered around bulk fuel safety, energy reliability, transportation improvements, and healthcare, with only energy and fuel safety projects still active and funded. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, focuses on energy, infrastructure protection, and economic distress in rural areas of Alaska. Currently, bulk fuel safety and security projects are still funded, while traditional economic development programs like housing and workforce development are no longer funded. Village infrastructure protection, a newer program addressing erosion and flooding threats, is also still being funded. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 authorized the commission to carry out its purposes and set guidelines for fund usage. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, focuses on energy, infrastructure protection, and economic distress in rural areas of Alaska. Authorized activities include health projects and grants from the Department of Health and Human Services. The commission's Economic Development Committee was created by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, and the Denali Access System Program was established by SAFETEA-LU in 2005. The program was active from 2005 through 2009. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, focuses on energy, infrastructure protection, and economic distress in rural areas of Alaska. In 2012, MAP-21 authorized the commission to accept funds from federal agencies and gifts/donations for the U.S. government. The WIIN Act in 2016 reauthorized the commission through FY2021, established a four-year term for the federal co-chair, and clarified ethical issues. Funding authorizations for the commission were set at $20 million for FY1999 and \"such sums as necessary.\" The Denali Commission, established in 1998, received funding authorizations for $20 million for FY1999 and \"such sums as necessary\" for FY2000 through FY2003. Legislation in 2003 extended the commission's funding authorization through 2008. After 2008, reauthorizing legislation was introduced in 2007 but not enacted. The commission continued to receive annual appropriations for FY2009 and beyond. In 2016, legislation reauthorized the Denali Commission through FY2021 with a $15 million annual funding authorization. The Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) was created in 2008, along with the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC) and the Southwest Border Regional Commission (SBRC). All three commissions share common authorizing language modeled after the ARC. The NBRC is the only one of the three new commissions that has been both. The Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) was established in 2008 to alleviate economic distress in northern border areas of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. It aims to catalyze regional economic development through funding projects based on regional, state, and local priorities. The NBRC is led by a federal co-chair appointed by the President and four state governors, with no term limit. The NBRC is led by a federal co-chair appointed by the President and four state governors, with the state co-chair limited to two consecutive terms. Each governor appoints an alternate and a program manager for day-to-day operations. Program funding depends on congressional appropriations, with administrative costs shared equally. Projects are ranked by priority and approved based on grant funds availability, addressing the NBRC's four program areas and strategic plan. The NBRC's economic and infrastructure development (EID) program focuses on investing in projects related to infrastructure, telecommunications, energy costs, business development, entrepreneurship, workforce development, leadership, and regional strategic planning. Each state receives approximately $3.5 million for these activities, with eligible applicants including public bodies, organizations, Native American tribes, and state governments. Matching funds of up to 50% may be required for EID projects. Additionally, the NBRC assists states in developing comprehensive economic and infrastructure development plans for their counties. The NBRC collaborates with LDDs, localities, and institutions for infrastructure development plans in counties. LDDs receive fees based on project funds, with a 5% rate for the first $100,000 awarded. Vermont projects are exempt from this fee structure. The RFEP program addresses economic distress in rural communities caused by the decline of the forest products industry, providing funding for economic diversity and innovation. The NBRC received $7 million for this program. The NBRC received $7 million in FY2018 and FY2019 to address the decline in forest-based economies in the region. Their strategic plan focuses on modernizing infrastructure, creating jobs, and capitalizing on economic trends. Performance goals include job creation, infrastructure improvement, business benefits, skills training, and community engagement. The NBRC is unique in its obligation to assess distress in the northern border region based on economic and demographic factors. Distressed counties receive 80% maximum funding allowance, with 50% of total appropriations allocated to projects in these areas. The NBRC's strategic plan aims to engage communities and leaders in skills training, regional networks, and leverage investments. The NBRC assesses distress in the northern border region based on economic and demographic factors, categorizing counties into Distressed (80% funding), Transitional (50% funding), and Attainment (0% funding) levels. Distress is determined by factors like poverty rate, unemployment rate, and population changes. Counties must meet specific criteria to qualify for funding. The NBRC assesses distress in northern border counties based on economic and demographic factors. Counties are categorized as Distressed, Transitional, or Attainment based on specific criteria. The NBRC was proposed in 2007 to cover designated northern border counties in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont with $40 million in annual funding. The NBRC was proposed in 2007 to cover designated northern border counties in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont with $40 million in annual funding. H.R. 3246, introduced in 2007, authorized the NBRC, SCRC, and SBRC, and passed the House with 18 co-sponsors. The Senate included authorizations for these regions in the 2008 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill authorized annual appropriations of $30 million for the NBRC through FY2012. The 2018 farm bill expanded the NBRC to include additional counties in New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. The NBRC has consistently received appropriations since its creation. The NBRC, SCRC, and SBRC share common authorizing legislation and funding authorizations. The NBRC has received substantial annual appropriations since FY2010, with funding levels increasing over the years. The NGPRA was created in 2002 to address economic distress in certain states. The NGPRA was created in 2002 to address economic distress in Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Nebraska, and South Dakota. It featured a federal-state partnership with unique structural novelties, but its funding authorization lapsed in FY2018 and was not reauthorized. The NGPRA, created in 2002 to address economic distress in six states, had a tribal co-chair appointed by the President with Senate approval. The state co-chair had a minimum one-year term, and a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, Northern Great Plains, Inc., supported its mission. Despite being funded only once, the NGPRA concept was mainly represented by Northern Great Plains, Inc. The NGPRA, created in 2002 to address economic distress in six states, had a tribal co-chair appointed by the President with Senate approval. The federal government would initially fund all administrative costs in FY2002, which would decrease to 75% in FY2003, and 50% in FY2004. Funds were reserved for distressed counties and infrastructure improvements. Non-distressed communities were eligible for up to 25% of funds. The NGPRA included a network of designated LDDs for project implementation and reporting. The Northern Great Plains Rural Development Act (P.L. 103-318) established a commission to study economic conditions and provide development planning for the region. The commission included governors from Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and South Dakota, along with appointed members. Funding was provided through the Agricultural, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995 (P.L. 103-330) for a 10-year economic development plan. The Rural Development Act established a commission to address economic development in five states. The NGPRA, authorized by the 2002 farm bill, superseded the Commission and created Northern Great Plains, Inc. The 2008 farm bill extended NGPRA's authorization and expanded its authority to include areas of Missouri not covered by the DRA. The legislation expanded the authority of the NGPRA to include areas of Missouri not covered by the DRA and provided mechanisms for the NGPRA to operate without Senate confirmation of a federal co-chair or a confirmed tribal co-chair. The Agricultural Act of 2014 reauthorized the NGPRA and DRA until FY2018, with an annual budget of $30 million. The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC) was created by the 2008 farm bill to address economic distress in certain areas, but it is currently inactive. The SCRC was created to address economic distress in specific areas of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. It would share an organizing structure with the NBRC and the Southwest Border Regional Commission. The SCRC would consist of a federal co-chair appointed by the President and state governors, with a state co-chair appointed by state representatives. No federal co-chair has been appointed since its authorization, rendering the commission inactive. The SCRC concept was introduced in 1990 at Tuskegee University's Annual Professional Agricultural Worker's Conference. The Southern Rural Development Commission Act was introduced in 1994, leading to the authorization of the SCRC in 2008 with funding levels set until FY2019. The SCRC was authorized in 2008 with funding set until FY2019, receiving appropriations but no record of funds being spent. The SCRC remains unfunded according to government budget sources. The Southwest Border Regional Commission (SBRC) was created separately. The Southwest Border Regional Commission (SBRC) was created in 2008 under the 2008 farm bill to address economic distress in southern border regions but has not received funding or been active. It shares a similar structure with the NBRC and SCRC, with a federal co-chair appointed by the President and state governors participating. The SBRC, established in 2008, has not been operational due to lack of funding. The federal co-chair has no term limit, while the state co-chair is limited to two consecutive terms. The concept of an economic development agency for the southwest border region dates back to 1976. Executive Order 13122 in 1999 created the Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border. In 2003, a \"Southwest Regional Border Authority\" was proposed but not implemented. The SBRC, established in 2008, has not been operational due to lack of funding. Various bills were introduced in 2003, 2006, and 2007 to authorize the SBRC, along with other regional development organizations. The 2008 farm bill authorized annual appropriations of $30 million for FY2008 through FY2012 for the SBRC and other organizations. The SBRC, authorized in 2008 with annual funding of $30 million from FY2008 to FY2018, has never been active. Federal regional commissions and authorities play a significant role in economic development efforts, integrating federal funding with state priorities. This structure allows for flexible economic development initiatives at the federal level. The federal regional commissions and authorities are key in economic development efforts, aligning federal funding with state priorities and allowing for flexible initiatives. However, the varying functionality of these commissions raises questions about the effectiveness and fairness of federal economic policies. Further analysis on these issues is planned for future reports. Contact information for active commissions and authorities can be found in Appendix A. The contact information for active federal regional commissions and authorities is provided, including addresses, phone numbers, and websites. The commissions listed are the Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Denali Commission, and Northern Border Regional Commission. More details can be found in the appendices. The Denali Commission, Northern Border Regional Commission, and other regional commissions are listed with their contact information."
