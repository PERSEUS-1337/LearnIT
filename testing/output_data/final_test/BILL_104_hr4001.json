    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Liberian Peace and Democracy Act\". It includes findings and a statement of policy. The Congress of the United States finds that in the Liberian civil war, 150,000 people died, 1,000,000 were displaced, war crimes were committed, and the peace process was disrupted. In early April 1996, factional fighting disrupted a transitional arrangement in Monrovia, Liberia. ECOMOG, a West African peacekeeping force, intervened in August 1990 to stabilize the situation and has provided intermittent peace despite challenges. The US has supported ECOMOG with $5,000,000 and committed to an additional $30,000,000 in peacekeeping efforts. The United States has provided over $100,000,000 in humanitarian and development assistance to Liberia since 1994. Factional fighting erupted in the capital of Liberia in April 1996, leading to thousands fleeing to neighboring countries. ECOMOG's failure to contain the violence was criticized, and the US evacuated 2,300 American and foreign nationals. US troops entered Liberia on April 11, 1996, to evacuate citizens and protect embassy personnel and property. The governments of Cote d'Ivore, Burkina Faso, and Guinea have supported Liberian factions since 1989, leading to death, torture, and displacement of civilians. Despite international pleas, these governments continue their destructive activities. War crimes in Liberia warrant serious attention. The United States and the international community should hold those responsible for war crimes in Liberia accountable and prevent them from holding positions of power. The US aims to promote peace, stability, and democracy in Liberia. SEC. 3 REMOVING OBSTACLES TO PEACE AND STABILITY. The governments of Cote d'Ivore, Burkina Faso, and Guinea have supported violence in Liberia since 1989. The President is authorized to impose visa restrictions and deny loans to officials from these countries. The President is authorized to impose restrictions on countries supporting violence in Liberia, including visa restrictions and denial of loans. The President can also prohibit the export of defense articles or services to these countries, with the option of waiver if certain conditions are met. A report detailing these activities must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The report must be submitted to congressional committees detailing the activities of Cote d'Ivore, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, as well as the status of the Liberian civil war. SEC. 4. ENDING THE CIVIL WAR AND BRINGING WAR CRIMINALS TO JUSTICE. The policy of the United States is to support peace in Liberia through financial, logistical, and technical aid for peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and encouraging regional involvement. The President is authorized to take necessary measures to bring Liberian war criminals to justice. The President should also request the UN Security Council to investigate war crimes by Liberian faction leaders. The President is instructed to extradite or render Liberian faction leaders responsible for violence to the United States. Assets of persons suspected of war crimes in Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Guinea will be blocked. Cooperation with other countries is sought for asset blocking. The Congress recommends postponing Liberia's elections until demobilization and disarmament of faction leaders, recommitment to the Abuja Accords, ensuring free and fair elections without violence, providing technical assistance for good governance, and international support for democratic reforms."
