    "content": "The Act titled \"Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress passed the Duck Stamp Act in 1934, requiring migratory waterfowl hunters to buy a Federal stamp annually. The program has been successful, generating over $600 million in revenue and preserving 5 million acres of wetland habitats. The Duck Stamp Act, passed in 1934, requires waterfowl hunters to buy a Federal stamp annually, generating over $600 million in revenue. This revenue has helped preserve over 5 million acres of migratory waterfowl habitat in the United States through national wildlife refuges. The Duck Stamp Act, passed in 1934, requires waterfowl hunters to buy a Federal stamp annually, generating over $600 million in revenue. This revenue has helped preserve over 5 million acres of migratory waterfowl habitat in the United States through national wildlife refuges. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"actual stamp\" refers to a Federal migratory-bird hunting and conservation stamp required under the Duck Stamp Act, printed on paper and sold through existing means. The term \"automated licensing system\" is an electronic system used by State fish and wildlife agencies to issue licenses. The term \"electronic stamp\" is an electronic version of an actual stamp. An electronic stamp is a unique identifier issued through a State automated licensing system, compatible with the hunting licensing system of the State, and described in the State application approved by the Secretary. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a 3-year pilot program allowing up to 15 States to issue electronic duck stamps. The program must be implemented within one year after the first full Federal migratory waterfowl hunting season following the enactment of the Act and will run for 3 hunting seasons. The program will be carried out in consultation with State management agencies. The Secretary must approve State applications to participate in the pilot program for electronic duck stamps. The application must include details on the stamp format, licensee features, fees, and the process for transferring collected amounts to the Secretary. The Secretary will require States to provide details on transmitting electronic stamp customer data, delivering actual stamps, issuing duplicate electronic stamps, and any other necessary policies. Additionally, the Secretary will publish deadlines, eligibility requirements, and selection criteria for the pilot program. SEC. 6. STATE OBLIGATIONS AND AUTHORITIES. The Secretary mandates that states must provide actual stamps to individuals who purchase electronic stamps under the pilot program before the electronic stamp expires. States participating in the program must collect and transmit customer information and revenue to the Secretary, including names, addresses, and the value of electronic stamps sold. The Secretary requires states to transmit sales of electronic stamps by the 15th of the following month or as specified in the state's application. This section does not apply to fees collected by states. States in the pilot program can charge a fee for issuing electronic stamps and issue duplicate electronic stamps if needed. The pilot program allows for the issuance of duplicate electronic stamps to replace lost or damaged ones. States cannot require the purchase of a State hunting license to issue an electronic stamp under the program. SEC. 7. ELECTRONIC STAMP REQUIREMENTS; RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC STAMP. Electronic stamps issued under the pilot program must have the same format as other licenses and specify identifying features of the holder. These electronic stamps grant the same privileges as physical stamps, are nationally recognized, and authorize hunting of migratory waterfowl. The electronic stamp issued by a State under the pilot program allows hunting of migratory waterfowl in any State following their laws, valid for 45 days. SEC. 8. TERMINATION OF STATE PARTICIPATION. Participation in the pilot program may be terminated by the Secretary if the State violates approved terms, with a 30-day notice. Participation can also be terminated by the State with a 30-day notice to the Secretary. SEC. 9. EVALUATION. The Secretary will evaluate the pilot program to determine its effectiveness in issuing migratory-bird hunting and conservation stamps. The evaluation will focus on increased availability of stamps, assisting States in meeting customer service objectives, and maintaining stamps as a conservation tool. A report on the findings will be submitted by the Secretary."
