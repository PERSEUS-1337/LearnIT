    "content": "Following leadership changes in the United States and Israel in early 2009 and the Israel-Hamas Gaza conflict in December 2008-January 2009, peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization have not resumed. President Barack Obama appointed George Mitchell as his Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, showing commitment to a two-state solution. Obama's speech in Cairo in June 2009 reiterated the goal of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel based on UN resolutions. Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 call for a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians live in peace. The Obama Administration has faced challenges in securing agreements on issues like Israeli settlements and Arab states' relations with Israel before final-status negotiations resume. In September 2009, Obama urged for immediate negotiations to begin between Netanyahu and Abbas at the United Nations General Assembly, emphasizing the need for flexibility and compromise to achieve peace. The current diplomatic discourse is guided by Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, advocating for a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. The current diplomatic discourse is influenced by the Performance-Based Roadmap and the Arab Peace Initiative. While Israel and the PLO have agreed to the Roadmap, the Arab Peace Initiative is seen as a starting point for negotiation. The Obama Administration or the Quartet may introduce a new framework for resolving the conflict soon. The potential introduction of a new framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is uncertain. Despite 16 years since the Oslo Accord, core issues remain unresolved. Doubts exist on the viability of a negotiated two-state solution. Observers doubt the survival of a negotiated two-state solution due to geopolitical changes, demographics, violence, factionalism, settlements, and other obstacles. Decreased hope in this solution has led to consideration of alternative pathways. The willingness among policymakers and analysts to explore alternative pathways, such as Palestinian statehood prior to a final-status agreement or a \"borders first\" deal, has led to openness among Israelis and Palestinians to non-negotiated outcomes like a \"one-state solution\" or a \"regional\" option. The failure to reach a two-state solution may result in the continuation of the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza. Polls show that a collapse in prospects for a two-state solution could lead to intense conflict for years to come. The report reviews the prospects of a two-state solution amid doubts in U.S., Israeli, Palestinian, and international circles. It analyzes policy challenges for promoting a two-state solution, including implications for Congress on foreign aid, security assistance, Israeli settlements, and Hamas. President Obama's 2009 Cairo speech set markers for evaluating parties' readiness for negotiations before presenting a framework. Failure to reach a two-state solution could lead to intense conflict in the future. In his 2009 Cairo speech, President Obama called for an Israeli settlement freeze and emphasized the need for Palestinian progress on security and governance. He also acknowledged Hamas' potential role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations but conditioned their involvement on the Quartet Principles. Concerns arose over the Obama Administration's debates with Israel on a settlement freeze and with Arab states on the prospect of gradual normalization with Israel. The Obama Administration's debates with Israel on a settlement freeze and with Arab states on gradual normalization with Israel could overshadow the goal of resuming final-status negotiations. Concerns exist that compromising on settlements may undermine U.S. leverage and Arab confidence in the U.S. as an \"honest broker.\" Some suggest Obama should explain his policies directly to an Israeli audience to address these concerns. The Obama Administration aimed to address concerns about U.S. interests in the Middle East in the Cairo speech. Special Envoy George Mitchell emphasized the lack of preconditions for negotiations, signaling potential changes in direction. This comes amid debates with Israel on settlements and Arab states on normalization with Israel, potentially overshadowing final-status negotiations. The Obama Administration's diplomatic approach may be shifting towards a more endgame-focused strategy, with efforts to prioritize Israeli-Palestinian final-status negotiations over other measures. This has been perceived by many Palestinians as showing pro-Israel bias and insensitivity to Mahmoud Abbas's standing. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton praised Israel's temporary moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank in 2009, but later acknowledged it fell short of expectations. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed the possibility of a demilitarized Palestinian state with Israeli military presence in the West Bank and control over airspace. He welcomed negotiations with the PLO without preconditions. Netanyahu welcomed negotiations with the PLO without preconditions, insisting on PLO recognition of Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people. Abbas initially rejected Netanyahu's conditions for a two-state solution, demanding a complete settlement freeze before resuming negotiations. Abbas expressed willingness to return to negotiations if settlements are halted for six months without public announcement and if the Green Line is used as the reference for border negotiations. PA Prime Minister Fayyad unveiled a plan for Palestinian self-determination, aiming for de facto statehood within two years with donor support. The plan does not address Gaza's involvement without border crossings opening. Fayyad's plan for Palestinian self-determination does not address Gaza's involvement without border crossings opening. There are doubts about his ability to rally Palestinians around the plan due to his lack of a significant domestic political base. Some fear the plan may align too closely with Netanyahu's \"economic peace\" concept in the West Bank. Netanyahu's \"economic peace\" concept in the West Bank involves giving the PA more governance responsibility without sovereignty transfer. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal expressed willingness to be part of the peace process, proposing a two-state solution with Israeli withdrawal to pre-1967 borders. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal proposed a 10-year truce with Israel in exchange for a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. He also suggested cooperation with the US if Israel freezes settlements and lifts the blockade on Gaza, hinting at implicit recognition of Israel's right to exist. Some view Hamas's new approach as a sign of potential growth towards recognizing Israel, while others believe it is a strategic move to appear more reasonable in the current diplomatic climate. Critics argue that Hamas's recent conciliatory tone does not change their existing positions, pointing to ongoing military build-up and attacks on Israelis. Hamas's efforts to build up military capabilities and plan attacks on Israelis, along with the rise of extremists within the group's governing councils, are seen as evidence by skeptics. They argue that a proposed 10-year hudna would only allow Hamas to strengthen its position for a future takeover of Israel. During 2008 negotiations, Israel's then-Prime Minister proposed a \"shelf agreement\" for a Palestinian state to PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, including sovereignty over the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Olmert's proposal offered Palestinian sovereignty over the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem with modified borders and land swaps. It included a symbolic return of a limited number of Palestinian refugees and administration of the Holy Basin of Jerusalem by a multinational group. Abbas turned down the offer citing wide gaps in negotiations. Abbas initially turned down Olmert's offer in May 2009 due to wide gaps in negotiations. However, in December 2009, Abbas indicated that the PLO continued to negotiate, planning a meeting in Washington. Debate ensued over whether Olmert was reasonable and if Abbas was unwilling to make necessary compromises for peace. Some see the Annapolis process as a sign of international support for a two-state solution, while others believe it did not make significant progress. Some believe the Annapolis process did not make significant progress for Israeli-Palestinian peace, with parties stalemated on core issues like Jerusalem and settlements. It is argued that the talks may have served other geopolitical goals, such as supporting stability in Iraq or isolating Iran. Some critics argue that the weakness of the Annapolis negotiations was the lack of third-party mechanisms to bridge differences and rectify power imbalances between Israelis and Palestinians. They suggest involving the United States, European Union, Arab states, and Turkey in future talks. Proponents of the two-state solution believe it is better to strengthen existing political will rather than seek alternative solutions. Opponents of the two-state solution argue that recycling a framework that has failed for over a decade is unwise. Former U.S. Special Assistant Robert Malley and Hussein Agha suggest that support for a two-state solution may be more symbolic than indicative of progress. The unanimous consensus indicates that the two-state solution has lost its meaning, with past attempts failing to address key issues fueling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While two states may seem necessary for resolution, ignoring the root causes of the clash may render it ineffective. The 1967 borders are likely to be the territorial outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. President Obama emphasized the importance of building on past negotiations and principles for a sustainable resolution. Despite the historical complexities, taking risks for peace is essential in addressing conflicting worldviews. The likelihood of reaching a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians has been altered by various factors since the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993. Uncertainty remains on how conflicting worldviews can be addressed or transcended, and whether new approaches to resolving the conflict will gain momentum. Geopolitical changes, demographics, violence, factionalism, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to Palestinian movement have all impacted the peace process. Geopolitical conditions in 1993 were favorable for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Cold War had ended, the US had defeated Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and key actors accepted US influence in the region. Both the PLO and Jordan sought to regain influence, while Bill Clinton and Yitzhak Rabin showed willingness to advance the peace process initiated at the 1991 Madrid Conference. The Oslo process with the Palestinians faced delays. After the Oslo process with the Palestinians, Israel made peace with Jordan in 1994 and negotiated with Syria. Hamas and Hezbollah grew in influence during the 1990s, with Hamas disrupting the peace process and Hezbollah gaining power. Iran's nuclear program and the US-led removal of Saddam Hussein challenged US supremacy in the Middle East. Iran's profile in the region has grown due to its nuclear program and the US-led removal of Saddam Hussein. This has led to Sunni-led Arab states scrambling to counter Iranian influence in military, political, economic, and ideological aspects. The changing Middle East environment has made the Israeli-Palestinian peace process less predictable and raises questions about the incentive for Israel to engage in peace talks with the Sunni-led Arab world. Some foreign policy analysts believe Sunni-led Arab states support the two-state solution to counter rising Iranian influence in the Middle East. Israel agreed to the Oslo Accord in 1993 partly due to demographic projections showing Arab population growth. The sustainability of resolving Israeli-Palestinian issues remains uncertain. According to CIA estimates, Arabs may outnumber Jews in the region, leading to concerns about ruling as a minority. Rabin and Olmert sought agreements with Palestinians to avoid this dilemma. Netanyahu's stance on this issue is less clear. The likelihood of a two-state solution has been hindered by ongoing violence and tensions. The Oslo process has increased tensions between Israelis and Palestinians despite optimistic expectations. Violence peaked during the second intifada and the 2008-2009 Gaza conflict. Security measures have been implemented, but this could hinder the peace process as Israelis may not want to upset the security equilibrium. The Israelis may be hesitant to take diplomatic risks that could disrupt the security balance they have established. Palestinians in Gaza still feel insecure despite improvements in law and order in some parts of the West Bank. Resentment over Israeli security measures could lead to future violence. Factional violence involving Hamas and PA authorities in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as periodic clashes between Hamas and jihadist groups in Gaza, raise concerns about potential military or political strength of these movements. Israeli settler violence against Palestinian civilians in Hebron and other West Bank areas is also a ongoing concern. During the Oslo era in the 1990s, Palestinians largely supported Yasser Arafat and the PLO as their legitimate representatives. However, with Arafat's passing, the failure of the peace process, and the emergence of Hamas, internal divisions and corruption have escalated. Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's successor, lacks comparable legitimacy, and Fatah, the party he leads, is viewed as too divided to govern effectively. The rise of Hamas has raised doubts about Fatah's ability to pursue a two-state solution. The pragmatic secular nationalistic positions Fatah takes, including support for a two-state solution, have a political future. Hamas has greatly increased in power and influence since the 1990s, controlling the Gaza Strip, maintaining a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council, and commanding a well-armed fighting force supported by Iran. Without a political arrangement integrating Hamas into the governing Palestinian order, Abbas may lack legitimacy to conclude and implement agreements. A Palestinian unity arrangement could delay the peace process due to objections to Hamas' legitimacy and actions. Changes in realities on the ground may impact the likelihood of a two-state solution. Access restrictions for Palestinians in the West Bank are complex. Access restrictions for Palestinians in the West Bank are complex, including restrictions on main roads, the separation barrier, closed military zones, nature reserves, and Israeli settlements. Senator John Kerry highlighted the issue of Palestinian rights and access during a hearing on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The presence of Israeli settlements divides the West Bank into separate enclaves. The presence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank divides the area into separate enclaves, hindering the development of a future Palestinian state. Israeli construction of settlements and infrastructure aims to establish facts on the ground that could impact negotiations or lessen Palestinian control under a two-state solution. The question remains whether these settlements and infrastructure will remain post a final-status agreement. The presence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank divides the area into separate enclaves, hindering the development of a future Palestinian state. Concerns over lack of contiguity within the West Bank are exacerbated by the control of two different regimes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Reconciliation between Hamas and Abbas's Fatah party is crucial for Palestinian unity. The presence of Israeli settlements in the West Bank divides the area, hindering the development of a future Palestinian state. Reconciliation between Hamas and Abbas's Fatah party is crucial for Palestinian unity. The different patterns of life in Gaza and the West Bank could make it difficult to bring the territories under a single governing structure in the future. Significant restrictions on the crossing of people and goods between Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza have been imposed, affecting the economy. The Palestinian economy suffered a significant decline after the second intifada, with restrictions on entry into and exit out of Israel impacting the private sector. The closure of border crossings, construction of the West Bank separation barrier, and increased security measures have brought the formal Gazan economy to a standstill, leading to thriving illicit smuggling activities. The Palestinian economy in Gaza has been severely impacted by restrictions on movement and the closure of border crossings, leading to a standstill in industrial operations. Even if Israel agrees to Palestinian sovereignty, there are no guarantees of access to Israeli jobs and markets. Palestinians may need to seek economic integration with neighboring countries or build a self-sufficient economy in the long term. In summer 2009, discussion intensified on different pathways towards a two-state solution, emphasizing intermediate steps to confer sovereign characteristics on the PLO/PA. Skeptics question if these steps would hinder a final-status agreement. PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's plan aims to develop the PA's infrastructure into a de facto state. Fayyad's plan aims to develop the PA's political, economic, and security infrastructure into a de facto state over the next two years. This strategy seeks to encourage Palestinian compliance with the Roadmap's rules to gain recognition and sovereign prerogatives, potentially bypassing the need for serious negotiations with Israel. Fayyad's strategy aims to reshape the Palestinian national narrative by promoting compliance with obligations to develop society and institutions, in hopes of achieving statehood without relying on traditional guerrilla or victimhood narratives. Fayyad's plan for Palestinian statehood focuses on self-governance, self-policing, and economic self-sufficiency to achieve political progress. Some Palestinian and Arab observers are skeptical of this strategy, fearing it may facilitate Israeli occupation. Progress would require reducing Israeli control and allowing Palestinians more freedom to demonstrate their ability to manage their own affairs. The Palestinians aim for self-governance and statehood, questioning sovereignty if obligations are not reciprocated. Mahmoud Abbas asserts the right to legitimate resistance while rejecting terrorism and stigmatization of their struggle. The Palestinians reject stigmatizing their struggle as terrorism and aim for statehood on the 1967 borders if negotiations fail. International support for a unilateral statehood strategy is considered, similar to Kosovo's independence declaration. Saeb Erekat has discussed the possibility of Security Council intervention since November 2009. In November 2009, Saeb Erekat proposed a Security Council resolution to delineate the Green Line as the border of a future Palestinian state, instead of declaring independence. The idea of a unilateral declaration of statehood is not new, as the PLO declared independence in 1988 without practical effect. Yasser Arafat also considered unilateral statehood in the 1990s but never followed through. Some Israeli analysts are considering upgrading Palestinian autonomy by granting certain sovereign privileges to the Palestinian Authority, such as issuing currency and establishing foreign embassies. This approach aims to bring the PA closer to a sovereign state status according to international law. Some Israeli analysts suggest granting the Palestinian Authority certain sovereign privileges, like issuing currency and establishing foreign embassies, to enhance their autonomy. This could potentially lead to discussions about establishing a Palestinian state with provisional borders and attributes of sovereignty before a final-status agreement, as outlined in Phase 2 of the Roadmap. However, the extent of limited sovereignty may not significantly improve the negotiating dynamic, as key aspects like militarization and full control over territory and borders would likely remain out of reach for the Palestinians. The presentation of a proposal for immediate Palestinian sovereignty in a state with provisional borders within 60% of the West Bank by prominent Kadima Party leader Shaul Mofaz is unlikely to have improved the credibility of this idea with Palestinians and third parties. Israelis fear Palestinian statehood before a formal end to conflict through a final-status agreement due to concerns about security. The potential creation of a de facto state in the West Bank raises concerns about Israeli security, with Gaza's political status being a key factor. Suggestions include promoting Fatah-Hamas negotiations for PA control over both territories, hoping for progress in the West Bank to weaken Hamas in Gaza, and considering a \"three-state solution.\" The potential \"three-state solution\" for Gaza faces challenges due to lack of consensus among key parties and the difficult humanitarian and economic conditions in the region. In 2009, there were discussions about a \"borders first\" deal to address settlement and border issues in the West Bank. The \"borders first\" deal proposed in 2009 aims to address settlement and border issues in the West Bank. Israel could keep some settled areas while Palestinians receive compensation. The Obama Administration supports negotiating borders first to defuse settlement tensions. The Obama Administration is interested in having parties negotiate borders first to defuse settlement tensions. PLO leaders have traditionally resisted this approach, but the Administration is testing their readiness. The Green Line would be the expected basis for border negotiations. The biggest challenge with a borders first approach is Jerusalem, as Israelis claim sovereignty over the whole city while Palestinians seek control over its eastern half. The status of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount/Haram al Sharif and Western Wall, remains a source of tension due to complex arrangements. The presence of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem complicates the territorial situation in the West Bank. Negotiating borders without including Greater Jerusalem would be challenging for Palestinians due to its impact on territorial contiguity and access to key population centers. Agreement on borders elsewhere could easily unravel if distrust over Jerusalem remains. Proposals for addressing the future of Palestinian territories have surfaced from both sides, some existing before a two-state solution. Raising alternatives may jumpstart negotiations, reflecting a shift in public discourse on the peace process. The discourse on the peace process suggests a shift towards considering a one-state solution as a possible alternative to the two-state solution. Palestinian support for this option remains in the minority, but could increase significantly with mainstream leadership endorsement. Some Palestinian leaders are considering a one-state solution as an alternative to the two-state solution, with the possibility of mainstream leaders endorsing this approach. The idea of a \"unified democratic state\" has been preserved as a strategic alternative, with calls for \"smart resistance\" to pressure Israel into accepting a one-state solution. Some Palestinian leaders are considering a one-state solution as an alternative to the two-state solution, with calls for \"smart resistance\" to pressure Israel into accepting it. Israeli objections to the one-state argument stem from concerns about the fundamental nature of Israel and its Jewish character. Many Israelis fear that a one-state solution would lead to Arab domination and the end of Israel, while some Palestinians advocate for a single democratic state for Jews and Arabs. The idea differs from Hamas' one-state solution, which aims to eliminate Israel. Israelis are opposed to a one-state outcome, and Western governments may not support the Palestinian strategy. Some proponents of a one-state solution believe it can resolve core issues dividing Israel and the PLO by removing borders, but analysts doubt this outcome. Nathan Brown, a specialist in Palestinian politics, questions the feasibility of solving security, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem's status, and water rights within a single state. Nathan Brown, a specialist in Palestinian politics, questions the feasibility of a one-state solution, highlighting the challenges of creating a state with entrenched adversaries. Hussein Ibish of the American Task Force on Palestine has published a book refuting the one-state argument. The \"Jordanian option\" is proposed as an alternative to the two-state solution. The regional option suggests that Palestinian territories should unite with Jordan and/or Egypt for historical, cultural, and geographical reasons. Jordan administered the West Bank and East Jerusalem from 1948-1967, while Egypt administered the Gaza Strip during the same period. However, a major obstacle to this option is the opposition of Jordan and Egypt. The regional option for Palestinian territories faces opposition from Jordan and Egypt due to concerns about assuming responsibility. Both countries have interests in stabilizing the West Bank and Gaza and advancing the peace process but are hesitant to take a direct role. In a 2009 article in the New York Review of Books, Robert Malley and Hussein Agha proposed a Jordanian-Palestinian entity involving Jordan, the West Bank, and possibly Gaza as an alternative to a two-state solution. They suggested that Israel might consider withdrawing from the West Bank if Jordan shared power on the other side. This concept faces obstacles, including Palestinian resistance to ties with Jordan. Another option is unilateral Israeli imposition of a solution, as seen during the second intifada. In response to the futility of Israeli occupation, Ariel Sharon ordered the withdrawal of settlers and forces from Gaza in 2005. Ehud Olmert planned to withdraw from most of the West Bank after constructing a separation barrier for security. However, these plans lost momentum due to threats from Hamas and Hezbollah. The threat of Hezbollah emerged during Israel's 2006 conflict from the southern Lebanese buffer zone left by Israeli forces in 2000. Some Israelis are concerned that the separation barrier may not be enough to ensure security if there is a withdrawal from the West Bank. Unilateralism, though less popular recently, could resurface as a more efficient path to a two-state solution. The default option of maintaining the current system of Israeli occupation and limited Palestinian self-rule is also considered by security-minded Israelis and some Palestinians. The status quo in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be supported by some Palestinians and the international community, leading to a potential \"one-state reality\" with significant consequences. This could include solidifying the dominance of a Jewish minority over an Arab majority, making future separation of Israelis and Palestinians more difficult, and maintaining the West Bank/Gaza split. Some analysts believe that a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may become increasingly difficult to achieve, leading to the possibility of a permanent West Bank/Gaza split. There are differing opinions on the timeline for such a scenario, with some advocating for urgent U.S. engagement to push the peace process forward, while others suggest a more incremental approach due to current conditions. An incremental U.S. posture could potentially increase the chances of aligning U.S., Israeli, and Palestinian leaders for a final-status agreement. The Obama Administration seeks to play a more proactive role in the peace process to achieve a mutually beneficial final-status agreement, despite concerns over possible resistance from Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Obama views solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as critical to U.S. national security interests and insists on the linkages between peace and other issues in the Middle East. The Obama Administration aims to prioritize the peace process despite challenges from Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Critics question if peace remains a top concern for the U.S. given other pressing issues. Obama's approach, including appointing Special Envoy George Mitchell, emphasizes key points from the Roadmap, signaling a commitment to peace efforts. The Obama Administration prioritizes the peace process by appointing Special Envoy George Mitchell to emphasize key points from the Roadmap, signaling a commitment to peace efforts. Mitchell's approach aims to give the Roadmap a genuine chance to succeed by entrusting policy to one of its antecedents. The Obama Administration has appointed Special Envoy George Mitchell to prioritize the peace process and bridge differences between parties. Mitchell aims to start negotiations with a proper basis and hopes they can be completed within two years. The Administration is supporting Mitchell's team to assist in the peace process. The State Department, National Security Council, Department of Defense, and USAID all play significant roles in the Middle East region. Questions arise regarding lines of authority and decision-making processes with the change in personnel and Mitchell's appointment as Special Envoy for Middle East Peace. The appointment of Mitchell as Special Envoy for Middle East Peace raises questions about lines of authority, decision-making processes, and the involvement of key officials in diplomatic exchanges. The role of Hamas, efforts to assist Palestinians, and the environment shaping Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are key factors with implications for Congress. Possible implications for Congress include the role of Hamas in peace negotiations, efforts to assist Palestinians, Israeli settlements, and potential involvement of Arab states. The inclusion of Hamas in the peace process may require its integration into existing Palestinian leadership structures. U.S. aid restrictions currently prohibit direct aid to any Palestinian government with Hamas members unless they recognize Israel's right to exist. The Obama Administration has not deviated from the Bush Administration's stance on Hamas, conditioning their participation in peace talks on acceptance of the Quartet Principles. However, there are speculations about the possibility of indirect or secret talks with Hamas, as indicated by a meeting between Thomas Pickering and Hamas leader Mahmoud al Zahar. Columnist David Ignatius suggests that the United States should consider secret talks with Hamas, taking advantage of possible concerns within Hamas due to Iran's internal turmoil. This comes at a time when Tehran's reliability as a patron is in question, making it an ideal moment for the U.S. to explore alternatives through diplomatic openings with Syria and secret contacts with Hamas through Saudi, Egyptian, and Syrian channels. Despite the Quartet Principles, other Quartet members have engaged with Hamas, with analysts believing that Hamas is seeking acceptance from the EU and possibly the U.S. through media overtures. Following Obama's speech, media overtures aimed at gaining EU acceptance of a Hamas role in Palestinian affairs without committing to Quartet Principles could trigger heated debate over potential U.S. policy shifts. Critics argue that legitimizing Hamas could strengthen its political hand at the expense of Abbas and other moderate Palestinians, potentially emboldening the movement and other militants. Hamas could be emboldened to mount attacks on Israel if included in Palestinian leadership. The US may need to choose between trusting Palestinian support for Abbas or preparing for containment of Hamas. Both options carry risks. Both courses of action, entrusting the fate of a final-status peace agreement to a divided Palestinian public or using military action against Hamas, come with risks. The unpredictable outcome of public support for Abbas, potential nullification by Hamas, and the risk of Hamas gaining more control in Gaza and the West Bank are concerns. Military success against Hamas could be costly due to their entrenched position and attack capabilities. The US supporting force against Hamas may lead to criticism. The United States risks eroding its international credibility by using force against Hamas, potentially leading to increased requests for economic and security assistance. The Obama Administration has increased aid to support Palestinian reform and development priorities, which have fluctuated over the years based on Palestinian leadership and circumstances. Since 2007, the United States has provided nearly $2 billion in support for Palestinian security and economic reform programs, including direct budgetary assistance to the PA and funding for strengthening security forces and criminal justice systems in the West Bank. Additional assistance goes towards humanitarian aid, economic development, democratic reform, infrastructure improvement, healthcare, education, and vocational training. The effectiveness of U.S. assistance for Palestinian security and economic reform programs is challenged by various factors, including logistical and strategic challenges, conflicting interests among Palestinian factions, and the need to coordinate international assistance from multiple countries. It is unclear if the progress made in PA security capacities and West Bank economic development can be sustained and contribute to a broader political solution. Israeli cooperation is also a key factor in the success of these programs. Assisting Palestinian development and reform can be challenging, as it may inadvertently strengthen Hamas. There are concerns that Hamas could potentially take over the West Bank through elections or force, jeopardizing the future of the PA and its security forces. Security forces funded by U.S.-sponsored programs could face uncertainty if emphasis on Palestinian development and reform is opposed. This could lead to a lack of progress in the peace process, potentially escalating conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Additionally, efforts to strengthen anti-Hamas groups in the West Bank may deepen divisions between Palestinian territories. Residents of Gaza, heavily reliant on humanitarian aid and illicit activities under Hamas rule, may feel neglected or left behind. The construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Oslo has complicated the prospects for a two-state solution. Settlement construction tends to increase during negotiations, leading to Palestinian and Arab complaints directed at Israel and the United States. Arab critics argue that U.S. support of Israel indirectly supports the settlements, despite official U.S. policy opposing them as \"obstacles to peace.\" The Obama Administration prioritized a settlement freeze as a key element in restarting peace negotiations, despite ongoing disagreements between the U.S. and Israel. President Obama emphasized the need for \"real action\" to restrain settlement activity, leading to debates over which construction projects should be included in a potential freeze. Israel sought to exclude certain types of construction from any freeze, complicating the issue further. Israel seeks exceptions for settlement construction, including \"natural growth\" and construction in East Jerusalem. There were differing accounts of U.S.-Israel talks during the Bush Administration regarding adding homes in settlements. The Obama Administration does not feel bound by any previous understandings on settlement construction. Some observers, particularly Arabs, believe Israel should halt settlement construction as per the Roadmap agreement. The Obama Administration accepted a partial moratorium on settlements in 2009 to avoid damaging U.S.-Israeli relations. In response to calls from Members of Congress and Senators, President Obama was urged to work closely with Israel on areas of disagreement. Democratic Congressman Robert Wexler suggested a settlement freeze should only apply to areas outside Israel's security fence. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer noted more acceptance of Jewish construction in east Jerusalem than in the West Bank among Congress members. Maintaining a settlement freeze in Israeli society and politics may prove challenging. Settlers in Israel, constituting about 6% of the population, have significant influence on politics and diplomacy. Their actions, including public protests and violence, impact government decisions on settlement activity. The Netanyahu government's stance on construction plans reflects sensitivity to outside pressure. The Israeli government's sensitivity to domestic concerns and reluctance to comply with U.S. demands for a settlement freeze may lead to pressure from the Obama Administration and Congress. Past diplomatic standoffs over settlements have involved loan guarantees, but analysts doubt their practical impact on Israel's finances. The role of Arab actors in the situation remains uncertain. The Obama Administration and Congress may pressure Israel to halt settlement building, but analysts doubt it will have a significant financial impact. The role of Arab states in Israeli-Palestinian affairs is complex, with differing views on how to support a positive solution. Arab states are encouraged to normalize relations with Israel in exchange for Israeli concessions on settlements. Some Gulf Arab and North African states were willing to renew ties with Israel in 2009 if settlement building halted, but other Arab states were not open to normalization under these conditions. Saudi Arabia emphasized the need to focus on final peace as outlined in the Arab Peace Initiative. Observers suggest Arab states could support the peace process by providing financial and political aid to the Palestinian Authority and refugees through organizations like UNRWA. Arab states could support the peace process by investing in West Bank industry, facilitating talks for Palestinian unity, and encouraging final-status negotiations without preconditions. Egypt has been active in brokering unity talks, but progress has been limited. Gulf states provided aid to the Hamas-led PA government in 2006-2007. Following the reinstitution of U.S. and EU aid in mid-2007, most countries reduced contributions to aid for Palestinians. Despite generous pledges, aid is often fulfilled only partially and with delays. Gulf states may feel less historically responsible for the Palestinian situation compared to Israel, the U.S., and Europe. However, West Bank investment projects like housing developments and industrial parks are ongoing. Investment projects in Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jericho, and the northern West Bank over the past three years have been supported by Gulf states. Palestinian mobile phone providers, Jawwal/Paltel and Wataniya, are majority-owned by Gulf state investment companies."
