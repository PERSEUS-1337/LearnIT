    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Access to Indemnity and Reimbursement Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions from the National Labor Relations Board and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The Equal Access to Justice Act has been ineffective in leveling the playing field for these entities. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions from the National Labor Relations Board or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration due to the high costs involved. It aims to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise between these entities and the government agencies. The Act aims to make the National Labor Relations Board and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration more accountable by awarding fees and costs to small businesses and labor organizations when they prevail against these agencies. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section allowing for awards of attorneys' fees and costs. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for the award of fees and expenses to employers or labor organizations who prevail in administrative or court proceedings, based on specific criteria related to the size and financial status of the party involved. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for the award of fees and expenses to parties with less than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $7,000,000 who prevail in civil actions brought by or against the Board. Appeals of fee determinations will not consider whether the position of the United States was justified. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow for the award of fees and expenses in agency and court proceedings.
