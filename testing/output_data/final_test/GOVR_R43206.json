    "content": "Energy tax policy in the United States is shaped by political influences and compromises between economic and political goals. It aims to address concerns related to the environment and energy usage. Energy tax policy in the United States aims to address concerns regarding the environment and energy security. Incentives for renewable energy production, energy efficiency, and alternative technology vehicles are used to tackle these issues. Tax incentives for domestic fossil fuel production also aim to reduce reliance on imported energy sources. Policymakers have turned to energy taxes and subsidies due to recurrent energy-related problems since the 1970s. Energy tax policy in the United States has evolved over the years to promote energy efficiency, renewable energy production, and energy security. The 114th Congress extended expired energy tax incentives through 2016, with longer-term extensions for wind and solar incentives. The President's FY2017 budget proposed changes to energy tax policy, including repealing existing incentives for fossil fuels and introducing new incentives for carbon reduction. The FY2017 budget proposes changes to energy tax policy, including repealing existing incentives for fossil fuels and introducing new incentives for carbon sequestration, alternative vehicles, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and advanced energy manufacturing. The economic rationale for interventions in energy markets informs the debate surrounding energy tax policy. The report discusses market failures in energy production and consumption and possible interventions, concluding with an analysis of the current status of energy tax policy. Tax policy in the U.S. can be used for various goals beyond revenue generation, such as economic stimulus and correcting market failures. Energy tax policy specifically addresses market failures in energy production and consumption, aiming to improve market outcomes through government intervention. Externalities are a significant market failure in the energy sector. Market failures in energy production and consumption, including externalities, principal-agent problems, and information failures, lead to inefficient levels of production or consumption. Externalities, such as spillover effects not accounted for in energy transactions, result in prices that do not reflect the full societal cost. National security concerns are often cited as a reason for government intervention in energy markets. Energy production and consumption activities often result in negative externalities, such as environmental damage from air pollution, water contamination, and land degradation. Economic theory suggests imposing taxes on activities with external costs and subsidizing activities with external benefits to achieve allocative efficiency and a more efficient allocation of resources. The use of fossil fuels in energy production and consumption leads to environmental damages and health problems. Market failures may occur due to external benefits from learning-by-doing in energy-efficient technologies. Market failures in energy use can arise from the principal-agent problem, where one party's incentives differ from another's, leading to inefficient outcomes. This problem is common in energy markets when one party makes equipment choices while another pays for energy costs. In residential rental properties, landlords and tenants may not align on energy-saving practices, creating a principal-agent issue. In rental housing, the principal-agent problem arises when landlords under-invest in energy-saving technologies because tenants pay for utilities. Tenants lack incentive to invest in energy-saving technologies due to short tenures. When tenants pay utilities, energy-saving practices are more common, highlighting inefficient energy use in apartments where utilities are included in rent. Landlords under-invest in energy efficiency in rental housing, leading to inefficient energy use by tenants. In newly constructed homes, homebuilders may prioritize cost over energy-efficient products, resulting in a lack of alignment between incentives. Homebuilders may not effectively communicate the value of energy-efficient devices to prospective buyers, leading to less energy efficiency in new homes. Informational problems, such as lack of knowledge about payback or rate of return, contribute to underinvestment in energy-efficient technologies. The \"energy paradox\" shows that consumers require a high rate of return for energy-efficiency investments. Additionally, national security concerns have been cited as a reason for intervention in energy markets, despite a decline in the proportion of imported petroleum in the United States. The proportion of imported petroleum in the United States has declined, with about 24% imported in 2015, the lowest level since 1970. There are external costs associated with petroleum importation, including national defense vulnerabilities and opportunity costs. Market failure may occur if importers do not consider these costs. Market failure can occur when external costs are not taken into account, such as with unstable energy supplies leading to economic costs like unemployment and inflation. Correcting these distortions with taxes or subsidies can improve economic efficiency, but historically, such measures have been politically unpopular. Taxes should be set equal to the damages imposed by an activity, increasing its price and reducing quantity, while subsidies reduce the price. The production and consumption of fossil fuel energy can have negative externalities via detrimental environmental impacts. Economists tend to favor an emissions tax to address this externality due to its efficiency advantage. Policy discussions have shifted towards a carbon tax or emissions fee approach, with concerns about using subsidies to stimulate demand for alternative fuels as an alternative to fossil fuels. Subsidies to stimulate demand for alternative fuels may not be economically efficient due to various reasons. Subsidies can reduce the average cost of energy, leading to increased energy demand and countering conservation efforts. Additionally, funding subsidies with distortionary taxes can be inefficient. Instead, placing a tax on undesirable activities may be more economically efficient. Positive externalities are associated with early adopters of energy-efficient technologies and R&D activities, which can enhance economic efficiency. Positive externalities are linked to R&D activities that drive technological innovations, with incentives provided in the tax code for energy R&D. Market failures due to principal-agent problems can be corrected by measures that increase the quantity of underprovided goods, such as energy-efficient technologies. Taxpayers can exclude subsidies from public utilities for energy-saving devices, promoting energy efficiency across different property types. The exclusion of subsidies for energy-saving devices can help address market failures in energy efficiency for rental properties. Market interventions like energy-efficiency labeling and tax incentives for energy-efficient devices can also improve information dissemination and market efficiency. The text discusses the challenges of addressing negative external costs associated with imported oil consumption. One proposed solution is imposing a tax, but this may violate trade agreements and not insulate consumers from global oil price fluctuations. Energy taxes may still impact the US economy due to global market dynamics. The federal excise tax on gasoline is seen as a user fee for the federal highway system, aiming to charge individuals based on their benefit from the public good. Gas taxes, however, do not always reflect user costs accurately, as they depend on vehicle fuel efficiency. The federal gas tax serves as a user fee for the highway system, but its accuracy is affected by vehicle fuel efficiency. US energy tax policy includes incentives for energy production, consumption, oil and gas sector support for domestic energy production, renewable energy incentives for diverse energy supply, and energy efficiency incentives to reduce consumption. The current list of energy-related tax expenditures and incentives for fossil fuel energy production is detailed in Table 1. These incentives aim to enhance capital cost recovery, subsidize high-cost fossil fuel extraction, and promote investment in cleaner energy options. The incentives, estimated to reduce federal tax revenues by $21.5 billion between 2015 and 2019, include support for coal and the oil and gas sector. The allowance of the percentage depletion method is a significant capital cost subsidy costing $8.8 billion during the same period. The percentage depletion method allows for a fixed deduction based on mineral revenue, exceeding project investment and becoming a production subsidy. Other provisions include expensing intangible drilling costs and reducing amortization for geological and geophysical expenditures, costing the government $7.5 billion in revenue losses over 2015-2019. The reduced amortization period for G&G expenditures in the 2015-2019 budget window is estimated to cost $0.7 billion. Tax expenditures to offset high extraction costs are small compared to capital cost recovery provisions. Credits for enhanced oil recovery and production from marginal wells were phased out due to high oil prices. The phaseout thresholds were exceeded, leading to the elimination of these credits. If oil prices remain low, these incentives could potentially become available again. The tax provisions for coal include production credits, tax credits for clean coal facilities, and amortization for pollution control facilities. These provisions are estimated to cost $1.0 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.5 billion respectively between 2015 and 2019. Between 2015 and 2019, tax incentives for renewable energy production are estimated to cost $50.7 billion, with $4.2 billion allocated to Section 1603 grants. The total cost of tax expenditures and excise tax incentives for renewables is projected to be $46.5 billion during this period. Tax incentives for renewable energy production are estimated to cost $46.5 billion between 2015 and 2019. The primary incentives include the production tax credit (PTC) for wind projects and the renewable energy investment tax credit (ITC) for various technologies. The PTC is set to phase out after 2016, while the ITC varies between 10% and 30% depending on the technology. Property must be placed in service by December 31, 2016, to qualify for these credits. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) modified renewable energy incentives, allowing projects eligible for the renewable PTC or ITC to claim a one-time grant in lieu of the tax credits. The grant was available for projects under construction before the end of 2011, with outlays continuing through 2017. The cost of the grant program will be offset by reduced PTC claims over time. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act modified renewable energy incentives by allowing investors to choose a one-time grant instead of future tax credits. This was to address uncertainty regarding future tax positions. Other tax expenditures related to renewable energy include the residential energy-efficient property credit, which provides a tax credit for renewable electricity generating property installation. The credit is set to expire for non-solar technologies in 2016, while it is available for solar property until 2021, phasing out after 2019. The residential energy-efficient property credit is expected to reduce federal revenues by $4.9 billion between 2015 and 2019. Accelerated depreciation benefits certain renewable energy property with a five-year cost recovery being a permanent part of the tax code. The tax code includes incentives for renewable energy, such as income and excise tax credits for renewable fuels. These incentives are temporary and set to expire in 2016. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, and second-generation biofuels qualify for tax credits, costing $4.5 billion from 2015 to 2019. Additionally, $2.3 billion in tax credits were provided for advanced energy manufacturing under ARRA, with most allocated in 2009. Extending these incentives will increase costs and result in revenue losses for the federal government. Between 2015 and 2019, tax expenditures related to energy efficiency are estimated to cost $3.1 billion, with the majority of revenue loss coming from incentives for property owners to make energy-efficient upgrades. Certain residential energy-efficiency improvements made before the end of 2016 may qualify for a 10% tax credit of up to $500. Energy-efficient improvements for commercial property, including upgrades to a building's envelope, heating, cooling, or lighting, are also eligible for incentives. Tax incentives for residential and commercial energy efficiency, including upgrades to building systems, are eligible for a deduction of $1.80 per square foot. These incentives, along with subsidies from utility companies, aim to encourage energy-efficient improvements. The projected cost of these incentives between 2015 and 2019 is $2.2 billion. Additionally, manufacturers of energy-efficient new homes may qualify for a tax incentive, with an estimated cost of $0.6 billion between 2015 and 2019. The estimated cost of Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) between 2015 and 2019 is $0.6 billion, with potential for increase if extended. These bonds support energy conservation projects and renewable energy projects. States allocate QECB funds and select qualifying projects. The primary tax incentive for alternative technology vehicles is a tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in electric vehicles, with a phase-out after 200,000 vehicles sold. Other eligible vehicles for tax incentives include fuel cell vehicles, hybrid vehicles, lean burn technology vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles. The tax credits for hybrid vehicles, advanced lean burn technology vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles expired at the end of 2010. Tax credits for qualified fuel cell vehicles and two-wheeled electric drive vehicles are set to expire at the end of 2016. Taxpayers installing alternative fuel refueling property may qualify for a tax credit through 2016. Other energy tax provisions, such as special tax treatment for energy-related publicly traded partnerships, are also significant. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended several expired energy tax incentives, with wind and solar incentives given longer-term extensions. The cost estimates for certain energy property depreciation, excluding interest from private activity bonds, and deferral of gains from electric transmission property sale are outlined for the period between 2015 and 2019. Energy-related tax incentives set to expire in 2016 will be extended, with wind and solar receiving longer-term extensions. Obama Administration budget proposals include energy tax policy changes, some of which may be considered by Congress. The PATH Act of 2015 retroactively extended provisions through 2016. The PATH Act of 2015 extended energy-related tax provisions through 2016, including longer-term extensions for wind and solar. P.L. 114-113 provided additional energy tax policy changes, such as the extension of the renewable electricity PTC and business solar ITC through 2019. The business solar ITC deadline for construction start dates is set at 26% for 2020 and 22% for 2021, with a return to 10% in 2022. Residential solar tax credit extended through 2021 with a phaseout starting in 2020. President's FY2017 budget proposed $41.5 billion in new energy tax incentives, including permanent extension of renewable PTC and ITC, new tax credits for carbon sequestration, advanced technology vehicles, biofuels, and energy-efficient buildings. The President's FY2017 budget proposed eliminating tax incentives for fossil fuels and adding new taxes on them to raise revenue for critical infrastructure and climate resiliency. This includes a new per-barrel fee on crude oil, phased in over five years, which would raise an estimated $273.4 billion between 2016 and 2026. The President's FY2017 budget proposed new taxes on fossil fuels to raise revenue for infrastructure and climate resiliency. This includes a per-barrel fee on crude oil, estimated to raise $273.4 billion between 2016 and 2026. Other proposed modifications include increasing the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund excise tax, reinstating Superfund excise taxes, and reinstating the corporate environmental income tax. The President's FY2017 budget proposed new taxes on fossil fuels, including a per-barrel fee on crude oil. Other proposed modifications include increasing the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund excise tax, reinstating Superfund excise taxes, and reinstating the corporate environmental income tax. JCT estimates the proposed modifications would raise significant revenue over a ten-year period. Additionally, the budget proposed repealing the LIFO inventory accounting method, which would impact firms holding inventories expected to increase in value over time. The President's FY2017 budget proposed tax modifications affecting oil and gas companies operating abroad. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 extended energy tax provisions through 2016 and provided longer-term extensions for wind and solar tax credits. The legislation also temporarily modified the Section 199 deduction for independent refiners and removed crude oil export restrictions. The 114th Congress reauthorized current law tax rates on motor fuels. The 114th Congress reauthorized current law tax rates on motor fuels, including funding for the Highway Trust Fund and Leaking Underground Storage Tank trust fund. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act changed excise taxes on LNG, propane, and CNG to be levied on an \"energy equivalent\" basis. Legislation was introduced to express opposition to a carbon tax. Legislation in the 114th Congress opposed a carbon tax, with S.Amdt. 350 proposing a point of order against carbon tax legislation. Similar resolutions were introduced in the 113th Congress, along with legislation prohibiting the implementation of a carbon tax. Bills in both the House and Senate have been introduced to impose a tax or fee on carbon or greenhouse gas emissions. For example, H.R. 309 in the House would tax CO2 emissions from highway fuels to replace the federal excise tax on fuels, while H.R. 972 would require emissions permits to be purchased from the Treasury and impose a tax on individuals. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed various approaches to address greenhouse gas emissions, including purchasing emissions permits, imposing taxes on individuals failing to obtain permits, excise taxes on emissions and carbon substances, and assessing fees on major emission sources. Additionally, there were proposals to repeal energy tax incentives and close loopholes for oil and gas companies. Legislation in the 108th through 113th Congresses shaped current energy tax policy. This included repealing the excise tax on medical devices, repealing certain tax incentives for oil and gas, and proposing that tar sands oil be subject to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund excise tax. Additionally, there were proposals to make incentives for renewables permanent and ensure all forms of unrefined petroleum are subject to the OSLTF excise tax. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended several energy tax incentives, including the Section 45 renewable energy production tax credit, suspension of the 100% net income limitation for oil and gas, $4,000 tax credit for electric vehicles, and deduction for clean fuel vehicles. These subsidies were retroactively extended through December 31, 2005, as part of a $146 billion package of tax breaks for middle class and businesses. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 suspended the phaseout of tax breaks through 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included energy tax incentives for renewable energy, alcohol, and biofuels. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided tax incentives for various energy sectors. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (P.L. 109-222) was enacted on May 17, 2006, reducing the value of subsidies for major integrated oil companies by extending the amortization period from two years to five years. This act followed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which allocated $9 billion in tax incentives over five years for renewable energy, conservation, and traditional energy sources. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 increased taxes on major integrated oil companies by $189 million over 10 years, rescinding 20% of the 11-year tax for oil and gas production under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The act also included extensions of renewable energy and excise tax provisions previously set to expire in 2007 or later. Energy tax policy in the 110th Congress shifted towards increased tax burden on the oil and gas industry, emphasizing energy conservation and alternative fuels. This change was influenced by high oil prices, industry profits, and political realignment after the 2006 elections. Legislation focused on increasing incentives for renewable energy production rather than reducing tax incentives for oil and gas industries. The 111th Congress continued to support renewables and energy efficiency through energy tax legislation, extending expired incentives and introducing new ones under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 aimed to boost energy efficiency and renewable energy availability. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-234) increased energy efficiency and renewable energy availability by raising fuel efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and energy-efficiency standards for appliances. It also included energy tax provisions promoting cellulosic biofuels and reducing the ethanol blender's tax credit. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343) included $17 billion in energy tax incentives, with provisions for renewable energy, cleaner vehicles, and energy conservation. The legislation was funded by raising taxes on the oil and gas industry. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) modified incentives for renewable energy production and energy conservation. The ARRA (P.L. 111-5) modified incentives for renewable energy production and conservation, lowering costs and extending tax credits for investments in renewable energy. It also expanded incentives for small wind property and allowed taxpayers to receive direct grants in lieu of tax credits. Additionally, ARRA increased funds for clean renewable energy bonds and expanded residential incentives for renewable energy property. The ARRA expanded residential incentives for renewable energy property by removing credit caps and increasing tax credits for energy-efficient improvements to existing homes. It also increased funds for clean renewable energy bonds and removed property-specific caps on tax credits. The ARRA increased funds for qualified energy conservation bonds and modified tax credits for alternative fuel vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles. It also introduced tax credits for advanced energy manufacturing projects. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 addressed issues related to energy tax policy, including concerns about \"black liquor\" as an energy source in pulp mills. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 addressed concerns about \"black liquor\" as an energy source in pulp mills, clarifying tax credit eligibility to prevent unintended loopholes. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley emphasized the need for consistent application of the law. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 addressed concerns about \"black liquor\" as an energy source in pulp mills, clarifying tax credit eligibility to prevent unintended loopholes. Black liquor was made ineligible for certain tax credits under this act, reducing revenue losses by $23.6 billion between 2011 and 2019. Additionally, The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 further restricted black liquor's eligibility for tax credits. Taxpayers may still be claiming unused credits for black liquor, as they can be carried forward. Tax credits for alcohol fuels, including ethanol, cost $4.9 billion. Extending the Section 1603 grant program for one year cost $3.0 billion. Retroactive extension of tax incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel cost $2.0 billion. Other provisions extended included tax credits for energy efficiency improvements, appliance manufacturers, and new homes. Legislation in the 112th Congress extended energy tax incentives, but some provisions were not renewed. Several energy tax incentives were not extended, including tax credits for ethanol and Section 1603 grants. The suspension of the 100%-of-net-income limitation on percentage depletion was also not extended. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 temporarily extended some expired and expiring energy tax incentives, with changes made to the renewable energy production tax credit. The expiration date for the PTC was changed to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC for wind was extended for one year. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended various energy tax incentives, including wind PTC, biodiesel credits, and incentives for energy efficiency. The cost was estimated at $12.2 billion over 10 years. Algae-based fuels were included in the modified cellulosic biofuels credit. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expired energy tax incentives, preserving provisions across multiple energy sectors. Certain provisions related to alternative vehicles and energy efficiency were allowed to expire."
