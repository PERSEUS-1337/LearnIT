    "content": "On January 2, 2013, across-the-board reductions in non-exempt programs are set to take effect through a sequestration process unless Congress and the President act to cancel the cuts. The cuts will impact FY2013 and remain the same in dollar amount between FY2014 and FY2021, but will be implemented differently. Congress can target specific programs for discretionary spending cuts in later years, rather than through non-discriminatory cuts via sequester. The automatic spending reductions totaling $1.2 trillion over FY2013-FY2021 will impact discretionary programs in addition to cuts from the Budget Control Act. The reductions will be larger for non-exempt programs compared to if the cuts were spread evenly across all programs. For example, in FY2014, total spending would be reduced by about 2.5%, while defense and non-defense discretionary caps would be reduced by 9.8% and 7.4% respectively. The automatic process would reduce discretionary caps for defense by 9.8% and non-defense by 7.4% in FY2014. It would also reduce non-exempt mandatory outlays by 2% for Medicare, as stipulated by the BCA, and by 7.4% for other non-defense, non-exempt mandatory accounts in FY2014. The deficit reduction from the BCA and replacement proposals will be distributed across discretionary and mandatory spending categories. There is a lag in the time a cut to budgetary resources would result in a reduction in outlays. Some proposals recommend raising revenues to achieve the desired deficit reduction. Some proposals aim to replace automatic spending cuts by raising revenues for deficit reduction. Various measures have been suggested, including the President's FY2013 budget proposal and the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act (H.R. 5652). These proposals seek to eliminate or modify automatic spending reductions in different fiscal years to reduce the deficit. In his FY2013 budget, President Obama proposes replacing the BCA automatic cuts with prescribed spending cuts and tax increases, totaling $2,221 billion more in deficit reduction. The House-passed FY2013 budget resolution proposes to replace the Budget Control Act's automatic cuts with spending cuts to be achieved elsewhere. The Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act of 2012 aims to cancel approximately $98 billion in discretionary defense, discretionary non-defense, and mandatory defense FY2013 funding sequester, while leaving the FY2014-FY2021 automatic cuts in place. H.R. 5652 proposes to reduce the FY2013 cap on discretionary budget authority to $1,028 billion and make cuts to mandatory non-defense programs, including changes to SNAP benefits, housing and financial authorities, health insurance exchanges, retirement contribution rates, and Medicaid and CHIP. This measure would reduce the deficit by $262 billion more than the Budget Control Act's automatic spending reductions over the FY2012-FY2022 period. H.R. 6684, a modified version of H.R. 5652, was passed by the House as a companion measure to extend current tax rates for those earning under $1 million. It aims to reduce the deficit by $237 billion over the FY2013-FY2022 period, differing from H.R. 5652 due to enactment date changes and removal of provisions. Representative Chris Van Hollen proposed a substitute amendment to H.R. 5652, aiming to replace the FY2013 sequester with revenue increases and spending reductions. The proposal included ending the direct payment program for agricultural producers and implementing measures such as a new minimum tax for high-income taxpayers and limits on tax deductions for oil and gas companies. If enacted, this measure would reduce the deficit by $30 billion more than the BCA's FY2013 automatic spending reductions over the FY2012-FY2022 period. The House passed the National Security and Job Protection Act (H.R. 6365) introduced by Representative Allen West, canceling the FY2013 sequester on discretionary defense, discretionary non-defense, and mandatory defense. The legislation also lowers the FY2013 cap on discretionary spending and combines separate measures to achieve outlay reductions. The Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 (STA; P.L. 112-155) signed by President Obama requires a detailed report on uniform percentage reduction and dollar amount reductions for each account under sequestration scheduled for January 2, 2013. The report must also list exempt discretionary and mandatory spending accounts. The STA report released on September 14, 2012 detailed preliminary estimates based on FY2012 funding levels. Classification of exempt accounts and potential changes to reductions were highlighted. OMB noted uncertainties regarding exempt classifications and the impact on sequestrable base size. OMB stated that due to time constraints imposed by the STA, reductions in the report are shown at the budget account level, which can contain multiple PPAs. The BCA requires OMB to submit a report on calculations and reductions under the automatic process, including FY2013 sequestration, with the President's budget submission each year. OMB has responded to Congress on sequestration implementation issues. In a series of letters, the Administration confirmed that VA programs, including Veterans' Medical Care, were exempt from sequestration. OCO funds were not exempt, and military personnel accounts were exempted from FY2013 sequestration."
