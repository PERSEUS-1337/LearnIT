    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement being negotiated between the United States and 11 other countries. The agreement's ability to attract new members will impact its global significance. Congress plays a major role in overseeing and influencing the development of the final TPP. The United States aims to achieve a comprehensive regional free trade agreement through the TPP, reducing trade barriers and increasing opportunities for trade and investment. It also seeks to establish new rules on emerging trade issues and play a role in trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region. The report focuses on U.S. economic interests in the TPP agreement, providing a comparative economic analysis of the countries negotiating the TPP. It describes U.S. trade flows with these countries and their economic linkages with the rest of the world. The Asia-Pacific region, including all 12 current TPP participants, holds significant global economic importance. The Asia-Pacific region, home to 40% of the world's population and nearly 60% of global GDP, is experiencing rapid economic growth. In 2014, six economies in the region had GDP growth above 5%, outpacing the United States. These economies are also increasing their share of world trade, with Asia's share of world imports growing from 18.5% in 1983 to 31.8% in 2013. The region is not only a growing market but also plays a crucial role in global value chains, particularly in East Asia where complex production networks involve the United States. The Asia-Pacific region is a significant source and destination for U.S. trade and investment, representing nearly 60% of overall U.S. trade and a quarter of foreign direct investment. There is potential for further U.S. economic engagement in emerging Asia and Latin America. The United States is involved in regional trade negotiations like the TPP and T-TIP, plurilateral initiatives such as TISA, and multilateral negotiations at the WTO, showing continued interest in opening markets. The Asia-Pacific region is a key area for U.S. trade and investment, with potential for more economic engagement in emerging Asia and Latin America. The TPP involves 12 diverse countries, with the U.S. being the largest in terms of economy and population. GDP per capita varies significantly among TPP countries, ranging from Vietnam to Singapore. These countries also differ in geography, from Australia to Singapore. The potential TPP FTA offers the United States an opportunity to expand trade and investment with a large and fast-growing regional market. Non-U.S. TPP partners collectively represent a market with a population 50% larger than the U.S. U.S. trade and FDI flows with these countries have increased significantly, with exports to TPP countries growing by over 90% and imports increasing by nearly 60% since 2004. The United States has seen a significant increase in trade and investment with TPP countries, with goods imports reaching $882 billion in 2014. The flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) between the U.S. and TPP countries has also grown, with U.S. FDI abroad totaling $86 billion in 2013. Despite running a goods trade deficit, the U.S. has a services trade surplus with TPP countries. The U.S. trade deficit fell sharply during the recession and has not yet returned to pre-recession levels. The trade surplus in services with TPP countries has increased, while the trade deficit in goods has decreased. Excluding crude oil, the U.S. had an overall trade surplus with TPP countries in 2013. The U.S. is interested in expanding the TPP to include other Asia-Pacific economies. The TPP trade ministers agreed to consider the membership of APEC members who meet the high standards of the agreement. Canada, Japan, and Mexico expressed intent to join the negotiations, with Canada and Mexico becoming official participants in 2012 and Japan joining in 2013. South Korea, Costa Rica, and Colombia have also shown interest in joining. Ambassador Froman welcomed South Korea's interest but stated that current members would prioritize concluding existing negotiations before considering new members. South Korea has been consulting with existing TPP negotiating parties about joining the agreement. The recent entry of Canada, Japan, and Mexico significantly increased the TPP's size in terms of U.S. trade. Japan's participation is particularly important as it is the third-largest economy globally and the fourth-largest U.S. trading partner. The potential expansion of the agreement to all APEC members could increase its share of U.S. trade to 57%. Japan's participation in the TPP has attracted other Asia-Pacific countries and may complicate the negotiation process with the United States. Bilateral negotiations with Japan on autos and agriculture are major sticking points in the overall TPP. The TPP negotiations involve sensitive issues like autos and agriculture. Participants have various trade agreements, including WTO membership. The US has FTAs with 6 TPP countries. There are over 180 trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, with the TPP seen as an opportunity for the US to address this. The TPP FTA presents an opportunity for the United States to address the rapid rise in preferential trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region. Supporters believe that influencing the strength and coverage of the agreement at the beginning stage is advantageous, especially with potential future expansion in TPP membership. The TPP participants are part of a broader network of international partnerships within the Asia-Pacific, with the APEC forum serving as a primary vehicle for regional cooperation on trade and economic issues. APEC aims to address regional trade barriers and promote economic integration through non-binding commitments. It supports the TPP as a step towards the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific. APEC's members include major economies and top U.S. trading partners. ASEAN, another regional partnership, has already established a free trade area among its members. ASEAN is removing tariffs on intra-ASEAN trade at varying rates based on economic development levels. The group aims to enhance economic integration and promote the free flow of goods, services, investment, capital, and labor within its membership. ASEAN has formed FTAs with non-ASEAN countries like Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. Discussions are underway for a potential trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), involving ASEAN and its six FTA partners. This agreement could serve as an alternative to the TPP for promoting freer trade in the Asia-Pacific region. ASEAN economic partnerships, excluding the United States, pose a challenge to US economic influence in the region. A study suggests merging RCEP and TPP into one FTA could benefit China and the US. TPP countries have varying FTAs with different tariff reduction levels and trade rules. The TPP countries have multiple FTAs in place throughout the Asia-Pacific and the world. Nine of the twelve TPP countries have agreements with China, while ten TPP countries, including the United States, have agreements with the European Union. TPP countries are well connected through their existing trade agreements, with varying levels of FTAs among them. The TPP countries have multiple FTAs in place, with interconnectedness through existing trade agreements. The United States has FTAs with 20 countries, and the potential TPP agreement is seen in context with these existing agreements. The potential T-TIP FTA being negotiated with the European Union would be the largest U.S. FTA in terms of total goods trade. U.S. trade with TPP partners surpasses trade with South Korea by a significant margin. Existing U.S. FTAs already cover much of the U.S.-TPP trade. Japan, a key partner in the TPP negotiations, does not have an existing FTA with the U.S. The TPP would exceed any existing U.S. FTA in terms of foreign direct investment. The proposed T-TIP would be larger than existing U.S. investment linkages with the European Union. International trade and economic relations involve investment flows between nations, which can be subject to negotiated disciplines in bilateral investment treaties (BITs) or FTAs. The United States includes investment provisions in its FTAs, but currently has no BITs in place with the other five TPP countries. Malaysia has been the most proactive in negotiating BITs, with 50 in force as of June 2015, while New Zealand has the lowest number with only 2 in force. The United States had 40 BITs in force as of June. The United States had 40 BITs in force as of June 2015. Trade and investment flows vary among TPP countries due to differences in geography, population, and economic development. Existing tariff structures highlight the diversity in openness to trade. Trade between the United States and other TPP countries accounts for about 40% of overall U.S. goods trade, with a deficit in merchandise trade with TPP countries in 2014. In 2014, the United States had a deficit in merchandise trade with TPP countries, mainly due to energy imports from Canada and Mexico, and vehicle imports from Japan. Trade with Canada, Mexico, and Japan accounted for the majority of U.S.-TPP trade, with these three countries making up nearly 87% of trade with TPP partners. U.S. imports from Canada, Japan, and Mexico were larger than imports from the other eight TPP countries combined, while exports to Canada and Mexico exceeded exports to Japan. In 2014, the United States had a trade deficit with TPP countries, mainly due to energy imports from Canada and Mexico, and vehicle imports from Japan. Trade with Canada, Mexico, and Japan accounted for the majority of U.S.-TPP trade. U.S. imports from these three countries were larger than imports from the other eight TPP countries combined. Over the past decade, there have been significant increases in trade between the United States and smaller economies like Peru, Chile, and Vietnam. Vietnam has become the largest supplier of U.S. imports among the eight TPP countries, surpassing even recent FTA partners like Peru and Chile. The United States trade balance with TPP countries has fluctuated over the past decade. The trade deficit grew from 2004, peaked in 2006, and then fell to a surplus in 2008. The surplus grew until 2012 and then fell becoming a small deficit again in 2014. Imports from Malaysia fell from 2004 to 2009 and then recovered by 2014, while imports from Vietnam rapidly rose from 2009 to 2014. Exports have grown consistently, with the largest increases to Singapore, Australia, Chile, and Peru, who are U.S. FTA partners. The top U.S. import categories from Asia-Pacific countries include motor vehicles, oil and gas, semiconductors, computer equipment, and communications equipment. The top export categories are motor vehicle parts, petroleum products, aircraft, computer equipment, and basic chemicals. Supply chains and production linkages play a significant role in these trade flows. The top U.S. import categories from Asia-Pacific countries are motor vehicles, oil and gas, semiconductors, computer equipment, and communications equipment. U.S. exports include motor vehicles, aircraft, and high-tech products. U.S. imports from TPP countries reflect dominant industries and strengths in each country, such as agriculture and natural resources from Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and Peru, and manufactured products like computers and chemicals from Malaysia and Singapore. The United States imports a variety of goods from Canada, Mexico, and Vietnam, including raw materials, manufactured goods, apparel, and footwear. Japan exports advanced manufacturing products like motor vehicles and aircraft to the U.S. Agriculture is a significant sector for U.S. exports. The TPP negotiations involve complex dynamics due to import sensitivities and export interests across different products and countries. Other TPP participants like Australia and New Zealand are major agriculture exporters. The TPP negotiations involve complex dynamics due to import sensitivities and export interests across different products and countries. Major agriculture exporters like Australia and New Zealand, as well as large consumer markets with high agricultural tariffs such as Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are included in the agreement. The United States has an overall surplus in trade in agriculture products with TPP countries, primarily with Japan. The proposed TPP FTA focuses on emerging issues in international trade, particularly in services such as digital trade, where the U.S. is considered competitive. Services, unlike goods, are typically intangible. In 2013, the United States had a collective services trade surplus of over $83 billion with eight TPP countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, and Singapore. Trade in services is more complex to measure than goods, as services are typically intangible. The analysis covers only the TPP countries included in U.S. services trade statistics. In 2013, the United States had a services trade surplus of over $83 billion with eight TPP countries. Canada, Japan, and Mexico are the largest U.S. services trade partners among TPP members. U.S. services trade with other TPP countries, especially Australia, has grown rapidly, surpassing trade with Mexico. Services exports to these countries have more than doubled in the past decade, with exports to Australia nearly tripling. The United States had a significant services trade surplus with all TPP countries in 2013. The United States has a trade surplus in various categories of services imports with TPP countries. U.S. exports exceed imports in financial services, royalties, charges for intellectual property use, travel, and transport services. Business services trade, insurance, telecommunications, and other private services show relatively balanced exports and imports. Countries also offer services to foreign residents by establishing a commercial presence in local markets. The BEA collects data on services provided to foreign residents by majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs. In 2012, over $1.2 trillion in services were supplied through foreign affiliates of U.S. companies, compared to $600 billion through trade in services. Services supplied through U.S. MOFAs to TPP countries grew rapidly from 2004-2012, with Canada receiving over half of the services. In 2012, services supplied to TPP countries through U.S. MOFAs went mainly to Canada (34%) and Japan (20%). The value of services supplied to the U.S. through foreign MNCs was only 60% of services supplied abroad through U.S. MNCs. Japan's services supplied to the U.S. through its MOUSAs are larger than U.S. services supplied through MOFAs in Japan, reflecting Japan's higher investment in the U.S. Japan's investment in the United States exceeds U.S. investment in Japan. Japan and Canada dominate services supplied through MOUSAs among TPP countries. Goods trade among TPP partners surpassed $2 trillion in 2014, with U.S. trade accounting for a significant portion. U.S. trade with NAFTA countries and Japan makes up a large portion of intra-TPP trade. The TPP countries have significant trade with other APEC members, especially with China. Including China and other APEC members in the TPP would result in more trade than expanding the agreement to other regions like the European Union and Latin America. The proposed TPP FTA is expected to include investment provisions, similar to existing FTAs with six TPP countries. The TPP countries have significant trade with other APEC members, especially with China. Including China and other APEC members in the TPP would result in more trade than expanding the agreement to other regions like the European Union and Latin America. The proposed TPP FTA is expected to include investment provisions, similar to existing FTAs with six TPP countries. Investment data through 2013 shows that most top U.S. investment partners in the TPP have existing FTAs, with Japan being an exception. Japan has more than double the stock of Japanese investment in the U.S. compared to U.S. investment in Japan. Japan and Canada were the largest U.S. investment partners in 2013, accounting for 34% and 30% of total inward and outward U.S. FDI with TPP countries. In 2013, outward U.S. direct investment in TPP countries slightly declined, while inward U.S. FDI nearly doubled. TPP negotiating partners aim for a high standard FTA addressing trade barriers. Tariffs remain a challenge among TPP members, impacting trade expansion. All TPP members are WTO members, with MFN tariffs being a key consideration. The MFN concept is a WTO principle that requires non-discriminatory tariff rates among member countries. The average applied MFN tariff is the actual tariff rates applied, which can be lower than bound rates. The proposed TPP FTA aims to reduce and eliminate tariffs at both applied and bound levels. TPP countries have varying average applied MFN tariffs, with Vietnam at almost 10% and Singapore at 0%. The average MFN tariffs for TPP participants vary based on per capita GDP, with more developed countries having lower tariff levels. Some sectors, like Canadian dairy products, have high tariffs despite the overall average being below 10%. Each TPP country has specific product categories with the highest tariff rates, such as dairy, clothing, beverages/tobacco, sugar, and electrical machinery. Chile stands out among TPP members for its unique tariff situation. Chile and Singapore have uniform tariff structures, with Singapore having an average tariff of 0% in most categories except beverages and tobacco, while Chile has a 6% average tariff. Singapore's high trade-to-GDP ratio of over 366% reflects its role as a regional shipping hub and in international supply chains. Singapore's low average applied tariff level is due to its significant reliance on international trade, with a high trade-to-GDP ratio. The United States, despite having one of the lowest average applied tariff rates among TPP countries, has a lower trade-to-GDP ratio, indicating less reliance on trade for economic activity. This diversity among TPP countries may be reflected in their trade policies. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership FTA would be a significant FTA for the United States and could eventually become the platform for a broader Asia-Pacific free trade area, encompassing 40% of the world's people and over half of global production. TPP would be the largest U.S. FTA based on trade flows, with challenges in achieving a comprehensive agreement due to the diversity among the TPP participants in terms of population, economic development, and geography. Canada, Mexico, and Japan are top U.S. partners in goods and services trade within the TPP countries. In 2013, Japan was the largest U.S. partner in FDI flows among TPP countries. Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore were also top U.S. partners in merchandise trade. Vietnam, with its growing economy, shows potential for increased economic relations with the United States. Malaysia, Mexico, Chile, and Peru are other growing economies with populations above 20 million. Chile, Peru, and Mexico's potential for increased U.S. economic exchange through the TPP may be limited due to existing FTAs with the United States."
