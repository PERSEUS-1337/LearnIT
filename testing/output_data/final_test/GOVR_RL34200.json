    "content": "The Supreme Court's decision in Black v. Virginia reminds us of the First Amendment implications of statutes outlawing displays like burning crosses and hangman's nooses. Many states have laws explicitly prohibiting cross burning with the intent to intimidate, but the scope of these laws varies. Some states include cross burning in their civil rights or harassment laws. Several jurisdictions have laws condemning symbols or exhibitions intended to intimidate or threaten, such as cross burning. Some states have specific statutes against cross burning, while others rely on coercion, terroristic threat, harassment, or civil rights laws to prosecute such misconduct. Coercion as a crime dates back to the Nineteenth Century Field Code. Criminal coercion, originating from the Nineteenth Century Field Code, prohibits threats to compel someone to do something they are legally entitled to do. It includes threats of confinement, physical harm, or damage to property or reputation to induce unlawful acts or prevent lawful ones. Some states also consider intimidation as a form of coercion, where symbolic threats like cross burning are used to deter others. State terroristic threat statutes are diverse, encompassing threats of serious crimes against person or property, hoaxes, and false alarms. Prosecution of intimidation by symbolic threats may be difficult in some states where fear of imminent harm is not a requirement. However, in states where threats of death, serious injury, or property destruction are prohibited, especially with a hate crime element, prosecution may be more feasible. In states with hate crime elements, prosecution for harassment involving threats like cross burning may be possible under certain statutes, such as Nevada's harassment law which includes threats of bodily harm causing reasonable fear. In states with hate crime elements, prosecution for harassment involving threats like cross burning may be possible under certain statutes that enhance penalties for crimes motivated by discriminatory animus. Some states also have statutes criminalizing the deprivation of civil rights through force or threat of force. The First Amendment implications of cross burning statutes must be considered, as they must only prohibit expressive conduct outside of First Amendment protection. The Constitution prohibits laws abridging freedom of speech, including state laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. The First Amendment allows restrictions on certain forms of expression like obscenity, \"fighting words,\" and \"true threats.\" The Supreme Court recently ruled on the constitutionality of a cross-burning statute. The Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of a Virginia statute that banned cross-burning \"with the intent to intimidate.\" The cases involved Mr. Black burning a cross on a fellow Klan member's property and Mr. Elliot burning a cross on an African American family's lawn. The statute prohibited burning a cross with the intent to intimidate. The Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of a Virginia statute banning cross-burning with the intent to intimidate. The Court emphasized the history of cross-burning as a threat of bodily harm by the Klan and stated that it could be considered a \"true threat\" if done with the intent to intimidate. The Court defined a true threat as a serious expression of intent to commit unlawful violence to an individual or group, even if the speaker does not intend to carry it out. This prohibition aims to protect individuals from fear and potential violence, including intimidation with the intent to cause fear of bodily harm or death. The Court recognized that burning crosses can be intimidating and create fear of violence, falling within constitutionally proscribable speech. While historically protected by the First Amendment, the majority did not find laws discriminating based on this content unconstitutional. The First Amendment allows for some content discrimination within proscribable speech areas. The Court upheld a Virginia statute that banned all cross burning done with the intent to intimidate, regardless of the underlying animus. The statute did not discriminate against individuals based on their motivation for cross burning. The Court upheld a Virginia statute that banned cross burning with the intent to intimidate, regardless of motivation. The statute did not discriminate based on the message conveyed and fell within permissible bounds of content discrimination. Cross burning is seen as a virulent form of intimidation, and the Court held that criminalizing it with intent to intimidate is consistent with previous rulings. The Court compared it to obscenity cases, where states can regulate the most obscene content, and can choose to prohibit forms of intimidation likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. Justices O'Connor, Rehnquist, Stevens, and Breyer struck down the statute due to a provision making cross burning prima facie evidence. The Supreme Court upheld a Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate, but struck down a provision that made cross burning prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. The provision was deemed unconstitutional as it allowed for arrest and conviction based solely on the act of cross burning. The Supreme Court upheld a Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate but struck down a provision that made cross burning prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. The plurality found the provision unconstitutional as it risked suppressing ideas, while Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented, arguing that prima facie evidence did not hinder a factual contest. The Supreme Court upheld a Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate but struck down a provision that made cross burning prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. Scalia argued that burning a cross creates an issue for the intent element of the offense but does not establish an irrebuttable presumption of intent to intimidate. He emphasized that a statute regulating expressive conduct is not unconstitutional unless its overbreadth is substantial. Scalia believed that instances of burning a cross without intent to intimidate and refusing to present a defense would be rare and not substantial enough to render the statute unconstitutional. The Supreme Court upheld a Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate but struck down a provision that made cross burning prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. Justice Scalia believed that instances of burning a cross without intent to intimidate and refusing to present a defense would be rare and not substantial enough to render the statute unconstitutional. Justice Thomas argued that the prima facie evidence provision created an inference, not a presumption, and should not raise concern for the Court. Justice Thomas dissented from the Court's decision on a Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate. He argued that banning cross-burning did not implicate the First Amendment as it only banned conduct, not speech. Thomas also compared the statute to possession with intent laws regarding drugs, stating they operated similarly. He highlighted the history of the cross-burning statute, noting its origins during a time of segregationist control in Virginia. Justice Thomas dissented from the Court's decision on a Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate, arguing that it did not implicate the First Amendment as it only banned conduct, not speech. He believed the statute was intended to prohibit terrorism, not expression of white racial superiority. Justice Souter disagreed with the Court's interpretation of R.A.V. and the application of the \"particular virulence\" exception to cross-burnings, finding the statute unconstitutional. Justice Souter disagreed with the Court's interpretation of R.A.V. and found the Virginia statute banning cross burning with the intent to intimidate unconstitutional, as it skewed jury deliberations towards conviction and suppressed ideas to an unacceptable degree. The law may proscribe cross burning and similar exhibits intended to convey \"true threats,\" but it is unclear if it can only proscribe true threats with a hate crime element like in R.A.V. The Supreme Court may strike down a governmental regulation if it is overly broad and impinges on First Amendment protected speech. Statutes that proscribe conduct rather than pure speech are less likely to be invalidated on overbreadth grounds, especially if the conduct falls within the scope of valid criminal laws like harassment or terroristic threats. The further the prohibited conduct moves from pure speech, the less likely the statute will be invalidated. Statutes regulating expressive conduct must show substantial overbreadth to be deemed unconstitutional on its face. Courts have used statutory construction canons to narrow the scope of statutes to only proscribe \"true threats\" as defined by the Court. Statutes challenged under the First Amendment should only punish expression outside of its protection. Courts have interpreted statutes to prohibit only constitutionally proscribable forms of expression, avoiding applying them to protected speech. If statutes are interpreted to only prohibit intimidation or serious threats of harm, they would likely be constitutional. Impermissible vagueness may arise if standards are not established to protect against arbitrary deprivation. Laws should only punish expression outside of First Amendment protection, avoiding applying them to protected speech. Statutes outlawing threats must be clear to prevent arbitrary deprivation of liberty interests. Cross burning and similar acts may provoke anger and fear, but laws condemning threats have been upheld as they fall outside the protection of the First Amendment. The \"fighting words\" doctrine, which prohibits certain types of speech, has uncertain boundaries and has been analyzed in various court cases. In Chaplinsky, the Supreme Court upheld a statute prohibiting offensive speech that incites immediate violence, ruling it did not violate the First Amendment. The statute targeted expressions causing acts of violence and did not proscribe protected speech. In Cohen v. California, the Supreme Court ruled that profane words on a t-shirt do not constitute \"fighting words\" unless they incite immediate violence. The Court emphasized the value of expression in conveying emotion, even if it includes expletives. This form of expression is protected by the First Amendment. In Brandenburg v. Ohio, the Supreme Court struck down an Ohio statute criminalizing advocating violent means for social and economic change. The Court distinguished between protected advocacy and unprotected incitements to imminent lawless action. The context determines what speech is proscribable, as seen in cases like R.A.V. and Black involving laws on cross burning with different intents. The Court found one impermissible and the other offensive due to a provision excluding the intent to threaten. Statutes banning expressive conduct outside First Amendment protection generally pass constitutional muster. If laws encompass protected expression along with criminal conduct, they must significantly chill protected conduct to be invalid. Courts may interpret broadly written statutes to only cover constitutionally proscribable expression."
