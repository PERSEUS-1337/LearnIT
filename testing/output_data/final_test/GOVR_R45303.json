The 2014 election of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) raised concerns about Hindu majoritarianism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, leader of the BJP, faced criticism but was later welcomed in the U.S. with a Joint Session of Congress address. In 2005, Modi was denied a U.S. visa over concerns about his role in anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat. Some Members of Congress supported the visa denial. Ahead of Modi's 2016 visit to Washington, DC, some Members criticized India's human rights record. In 2017, BJP won in Uttar Pradesh and appointed a controversial Hindu cleric as chief minister, raising fears of Hindu chauvinism among minorities. After four years of BJP rule in India, there are increasing indicators of Hindu chauvinism and bigotry, leading to mounting repression against minority religious communities. Reports by the U.S. government and international human rights watchdogs highlight deteriorating conditions for religious minorities, including acts of violence, loss of political power, and feelings of disenfranchisement. In 2018, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom stated that Hindu-nationalist groups have been targeting religious minorities for the past decade. Five U.S. Senators urged President Trump to address India's religious freedom during Prime Minister Modi's visit to Washington, DC. Modi remains popular in India, but there is growing skepticism about his government's performance. Despite BJP's chances of winning in 2019, nearly half of respondents believe Modi's government does not deserve reelection. India, as the world's largest democracy, plays a dominant role in South Asia. India, the world's largest democracy, is seen as a potential counterweight to China. The US and India have a strategic partnership with a focus on defense cooperation and trade. Indians receive a significant number of US visas and many Indian students attend US universities. The influence of the Indian-American community is reflected in U.S. Congress caucuses. India is viewed as an important economic partner, but faces challenges in ease of doing business. Concerns have grown over trade barriers under the Modi government. India also faces human rights violations. India faces numerous human rights violations, including police and security force abuses, corruption, political prisoners, censorship of media outlets critical of the government, restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, and legal restrictions on religious conversion in certain states. Legal restrictions on religious conversion in eight states, lack of accountability for cases related to violence against women, discrimination based on religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and caste or tribe, and widespread impunity for government misconduct were serious ongoing issues in India. International human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch have also highlighted widespread abuses in the country. Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights serious human rights concerns in India, including vigilante violence targeting religious minorities and critics of the government. The government's failure to investigate attacks, promotion of Hindu supremacy by BJP leaders, and crackdown on dissent have led to a chilling effect on free expression. Foreign funding regulations are used to target NGOs critical of the government, and there is impunity for Indian security forces. HRW and Amnesty International criticize India for human rights violations, including demonization of religious minorities, attacks on human rights defenders, mob violence by cow protection groups, and erosion of press freedom and free speech in universities. India failed to uphold its human rights commitments and impunity for abuses persists. Abuses of religious freedom in India attract international attention, particularly with the Modi government's Hindu nationalist initiatives. This has caused friction in the U.S.-India relationship and concerns among Indian business leaders about economic interests being harmed. The BJP's 2014 victory has empowered extremist groups, impacting India's international standing. Intolerance in India has led to occasional fatal lapses in religious tolerance, with a Hindu majority of 80% and a Muslim minority of 14%. The country has also seen demographic shifts since independence, with Hindus decreasing from 85% to 80%. Major incidents of communal violence have targeted different religious groups, such as Hindus in Hyderabad in 1948 and Sikhs in Delhi in 1984. In 1948, Hindus in Hyderabad (up to 40,000 killed); Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 (more than 3,000 killed); Muslims in Mumbai in 1993 and Gujarat in 2002 (up to 3,000 deaths); and Christians in Odisha in 2008 (up to 100 deaths). Distribution of India's Muslim and Christian minorities in 640 districts, with Muslims majority in 32 districts, 12 having at least 90% Muslim residents. Jammu and Kashmir has half of Muslim-majority districts, with 8.6 million Muslims. Assam has eight Muslim-majority districts, and Uttar Pradesh has over 38 million Muslims, the most in any Indian state. The state of West Bengal has the highest Muslim population in India, with over 38 million Muslims. Other significant Muslim populations are found in Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Murshidabad district. Christians are the majority in 35 Indian districts, with the largest concentrations in northeastern states and southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In Kerala's Ernakulam district, over 1.2 million Christians make up more than one-third of the population. The East Khasi Hills in Meghalaya has a Christian majority, with two-thirds of residents being Christian. The 2006 \"Sachar Report\" highlighted the challenges faced by India's Muslim community in terms of development and infrastructure. The Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion for all citizens, with special minority status given to six religious groups. There is a focus on Muslims, with concerns about communal anxiety affecting India's response to the Rohingya crisis in Burma. The Indian Supreme Court rejected a petition to declare the Commission unconstitutional in 2013. India's constitution protects the rights of religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Zoroastrians, and Sikhs. The government aims to safeguard their existence and promote their identities. Majority of minority concentration districts are in Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The U.S. State Department highlights India's commitment to freedom of religion but notes ongoing issues, such as anti-conversion laws in five states. Authorities often did not prosecute violence by vigilantes against persons suspected of cow-related offenses, mostly Muslims. Religious minority communities in India felt increasingly vulnerable due to Hindu nationalist groups engaging in violence against non-Hindu individuals and their places of worship. Local political leaders often did not speak out against incidents of violence, and at times made remarks that could be seen as condoning violence. India was designated as a \"Tier 2\" country by USCIRF in its 2018 annual report. In 2017, religious freedom conditions in India continued to decline, with Hindu-nationalist groups promoting violence and harassment against non-Hindus and Hindu Dalits. Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned mob violence, but his party members have ties to extremist groups and use discriminatory language against religious minorities. The Modi Administration in India has not addressed the sharp increase in communal violence against religious minorities. Despite attempts by USCIRF to assess religious freedom conditions on the ground, the New Delhi government has refused visas for their delegation multiple times. In 2017, there were 111 deaths in 822 incidents of communal violence, with a significant increase linked to \"cow protection\" vigilantism. The Ministry in India administers the National Foundation for Communal Harmony to assist children/youth affected by violence. Positive developments in 2017 include the judiciary protecting minority rights and efforts by the Ministry of Minority Affairs and National Commission for Minorities to address security, education, and employment issues. The National Commission for Minorities in India received a 12% budget increase in 2018 to address security, education, and employment issues for religious minorities. Hindu nationalists claim that Hindu traditions were suppressed during the Muslim-dominated period before British rule. Secularism is a valued principle in independent India, but its interpretation varies. The term \"Hindu fundamentalist\" is not accurate for those promoting \"Hindutva\" or Hindu identity. India's linguistic diversity adds complexity to its cultural landscape. The BJP and its antecedents view Hinduism as concurrent with nationalism, believing India is inherently Hindu. Hindutva ideology asserts Hindus are rightful rulers, Christian and Muslim minorities are seen as threats, and caste divisions undermine Hindu unity. Modi's 2014 national political campaign focused on development and good governance, downplaying Hindutva themes. However, he has emphasized that \"Hinduism is a way of life and not a religion.\" Hindutva forms an exclusionary national narrative, seeking to rewrite social order to benefit Hindus. The Sangh Parivar is an umbrella organization for Hindu nationalist groups. The BJP is the political wing of the hardline Hindu nationalist group RSS, with Prime Minister Modi being a lifelong member. The RSS aims to protect India's Hindu identity from perceived threats of Islam and Christianity, established in 1925 to unite Hindus and resist foreign rule. The RSS is a male-only group with daily regimens of physical exercise, patriotic songs, and Hindu literature. It claims up to 5 million members but the actual number may be closer to 2 million. Its goal is to protect Hindu Dharma and organize society. Narendra Modi joined as a child and saw growth in RSS participation during his prime ministership. The RSS has seen a growth in membership to about 57,000, attributed to India's economic development and urbanization. It has a controversial history, including connections to Gandhi's assassination and involvement in domestic terrorism incidents like the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings. Former RSS activist Swami Aseemanand confessed to some attacks, implicating high-level RSS leaders. The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), an international entity of the RSS, is a service-oriented organization with over 7 million members worldwide. It includes militant youth wing Bajrang Dal and organizes \"ghar wapsi\" ceremonies for religious reconversion. The VHP also advocates for a nationwide ban on religious conversions. The RSS and other Hindutva extremist groups are expanding educational efforts to teach their intolerant ideology to millions of students. The U.S. CIA labeled VHP and Bajrang Dal as militant religious organizations, causing anger in India. VHP threatened a national agitation in response, expressing disbelief at the CIA's disregard for their administration of schools and social development activities. In a 2002 report by Human Rights Watch, BJP, VHP, and Bajrang Dal were implicated in organized attacks on Muslims in Gujarat. Concerns persist over obstacles faced by victims seeking justice, internal displacement of families, and uninvestigated criminal cases. Critics accuse Narendra Modi of not addressing questions about his actions during the 2002 riots. BJP has been a key promoter of Hindutva ideology. The BJP, a key promoter of Hindutva ideology, has seen a surge in national popularity under Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Despite historically low Muslim support, the party's share of the Muslim vote increased to 8% in 2014. Muslim representation in BJP-led state assemblies remains low, with only 4 out of 1,400 members being Muslim. In Uttar Pradesh, where Muslims make up 19% of the population, they only hold 6% of seats in the state assembly. Muslim representation in the Lok Sabha dropped from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 2014. A study found that Muslims were underrepresented in BJP-controlled states, with only one Muslim state minister out of 151. The BJP had the highest proportion of politicians facing criminal charges for inciting religious violence, with 1.3% compared to less than 0.5% for other parties. These politicians were nearly five times more likely to win elections. Hindu nationalists, including RSS leaders, had key political goals outlined in the BJP's 2014 manifesto. Despite past tensions, the RSS supported Modi's campaign in 2014, seeing the BJP victory as crucial to their existence. This support led to increased participation in the election. Hindutva and RSS goals in 2014 included scaling back laws benefiting religious minorities, establishing a Uniform Civil Code, repealing Article 370, redrafting textbooks, building a Ram temple, and preventing cow slaughter through legislation. In India, several states have anti-conversion laws, with fines and imprisonment for using force or fraud to convert citizens. BJP chief ministers govern most of these states. In India, there are anti-conversion laws with penalties for using force or fraud to convert citizens. These laws have created a hostile atmosphere for religious minorities, particularly Christians, leading to harassment and violent attacks. The USCIRF recommends advocating for the repeal or amendment of these laws to align with international human rights standards. India's anti-conversion laws aim to protect vulnerable populations from forced conversion, not restrict freedom to convert. Reports of \"love jihad\" campaigns have led to violent attacks on Muslims. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill of 2016 excludes Muslims, potentially violating equal protection provisions of the Indian Constitution. The BJP-led Assam government is divided over the bill's impact on Bengali Hindus. The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill of 2016 is a controversial issue in Assam, with proponents claiming it will help Bengali Hindus from Bangladesh and opponents denouncing it as religious discrimination. The Assam government's National Register of Citizens draft faced criticism for targeting the Bengali population. India's cow protection laws, upheld by the Supreme Court, reflect the cow's significance in Hindu culture and can lead to prison sentences for violators. The RSS has called for a nationwide ban on cow slaughter, with the federal government issuing new rules banning sale of cows for slaughter in May 2017. Some state governments opposed the ban, which was later struck down by the Supreme Court due to its potential impact on livelihoods. Enforcement of cow protection laws economically marginalizes Muslims and Dalits, leading to violence and mob attacks. Accusations of violations leading to violence by extremist Hindu groups affiliated with the ruling BJP against minority communities, especially Muslims, continued in 2017. Police often filed complaints against victims under cow slaughter laws instead of taking legal action against attackers, showing official sympathy towards them. The 2015 lynching of a Muslim man in Uttar Pradesh sparked a national debate on religious intolerance, with criticism directed at Prime Minister Modi for his delayed and half-hearted condemnation. This incident highlighted concerns about the government's alleged inattention to the killing of Muslims. The 2017 seating of a hardline Hindu cleric as chief minister of India's largest state led to a rise in \"cow protection\" vigilantism in Uttar Pradesh, resulting in the closure of slaughterhouses and meat-selling shops. This caused a 15% drop in India's beef export industry. Despite condemnations from Prime Minister Modi, the RSS announced plans to recruit 5,000 \"religious soldiers\" to combat cow smuggling and love jihad. In August 2018, Modi reiterated that mob lynching is a crime and called for effective measures to prevent such violence. The government is taking effective measures to prevent mob violence and lynching, protect innocent citizens, and take action against perpetrators. Hindu nationalists are trying to impose a vegetarian culture and restrict Muslims' access to meat. Human rights groups are calling on Indian authorities to end impunity for instigators of hate crimes. Human rights watchdogs express concerns about Modi's government's constraints on their activities and commitment to minority rights. The United States is the top foreign donor to Indian NGOs, with India's regulations governing foreign donations. India's Home Ministry revoked licenses of nearly 9,000 charitable organizations in 2015 for non-compliance with reporting requirements. In 2015, India revoked licenses of nearly 9,000 NGOs for non-compliance with reporting requirements. In the following years, U.S. government officials faced difficulties arranging visits to India due to divergent policy perspectives. In 2016, U.S. researchers were denied visas for a planned visit, leading to disappointment. In 2017, India blocked the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation from accepting foreign donations, impacting their public health operations. Since Modi took office, over 11,000 NGOs in India have been barred from accepting foreign donations, impacting the operations of a major nonprofit public health organization. Concerns about Dalit conversion by Christian missionaries led to the shutdown of Compassion International in 2017, despite efforts by U.S. officials to prevent it. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on obstacles faced by American charities in India. Witnesses at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing criticized New Delhi's crackdown on NGOs in India as religious discrimination. The State Department's report highlighted instances of government pressure on media critical of the government, with online harassment of female journalists being prevalent. India ranked 138th out of 180 countries in press freedom, with concerns raised about Modi's Hindu nationalism. Many analysts warn of a growing threat in Modi's Hindu nationalism, comparing it to the Emergency period under Indira Gandhi. Disenchantment with the BJP is rising among its supporters due to the government's disregard for concerns and suppression of dissent. Hate speech on Indian social media is also on the rise, indicating a shift towards privileging the dominant Hindu community. The incidence of \"religio-cultural hate speech\" on Indian social media is increasing, particularly targeting Indian Muslims. Topics inciting hate speech include opposition to interfaith marriage, universal human rights, cow protection, and beef consumption. Indian figures from various fields have expressed concern over the Modi government's alleged distortion of history and calls for protection of India's secularism and diversity. In 2016, the BJP government appointed a commission under its Minister of Culture. The BJP government in 2016 appointed a commission to prove modern Hindus descended from the region's original inhabitants, aiming to revise India's history towards a more Hindu-centric narrative. Hindu extremist groups use intimidation and violence to silence non-Hindu viewpoints, while also targeting movies that challenge their beliefs. The Human Rights Watch (HRW) report highlighted the use of vague laws by Indian authorities to silence critics, with journalists facing pressure to self-censor. Gauri Lankesh, a critic of militant Hindu nationalism, was shot dead in 2017, indicating organized efforts to silence dissenting voices. Indian journalists face increasing pressure to remove critical stories of the Hindu nationalist government, leading to self-censorship in media organizations. Modi's supporters engage in aggressive social media tactics, likened to Nazi stormtroopers, with the BJP accused of cultivating a cyber warrior army to promote Hindu chauvinism and attack opponents. \"Modi's troll army\" targets critics on social media, whether officially sanctioned or not. Some of Modi's Twitter followers openly celebrate the murder of critics for exercising free speech. The Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan has been ongoing since 1989, with both countries claiming the territory. Jammu and Kashmir is India's only state with a Muslim-majority population. The Kashmir conflict in the Muslim-majority Valley region of Jammu and Kashmir continues to disrupt daily life for citizens. After 1989, 250,000 Kashmiri Hindus fled the Valley and remain internally displaced. Article 370 of India's Constitution was meant to provide extra governance space for Jammu and Kashmir's leaders. The special autonomy granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 has been eroded over the years by executive actions. BJP leaders, including Modi, argue that this autonomy has fueled separatist elements in the region. The BJP has sought to remove Jammu and Kashmir's special status from the Constitution, with a focus on the return of Kashmiri Pandits to their homeland. The BJP's agenda includes ensuring livelihood for Kashmiri Pandits, but little action has been taken, leading to accusations of hollow claims. This issue has the potential to energize Hindu nationalists."
