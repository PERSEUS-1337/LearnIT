Definitions from the Immigration and Nationality Act apply. TITLE I--LEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\nSEC. 101. WORLDWIDE LEVELS OF IMMIGRATION.\n\nBeginning fiscal year 2006, family-sponsored immigrants will be zero, employment-based immigrants will be 5,200, and diversity immigrants will be zero.\n\nSEC. 102. ALLOTMENT OF VISAS. Beginning in fiscal year 2006, family-sponsored immigrant visas will be zero, while employment-based visas will be limited to 5,000 for priority workers and 200 for certain other workers. The number of visas allotted to other aliens for employment-based immigrants is zero. Special immigrants under subsection (b)(4) are limited to 1,000 visas per fiscal year, and diversity immigrants are allotted zero visas. There is no numerical limitation on special immigrants described in section 101(a)(27) of the Act. Effective October 1, 2006, limitations are placed on sponsorship by certain aliens for immigrant visas based on specific petitions. Preference categories for family and employment-based immigrants are eliminated, except for certain exceptions. Effective October 1, 2006, the Secretary of Homeland Security cannot approve immigrant status petitions under section 204 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, except for specific family relationships or priority worker/investor statuses. SEC. 103. HUMANITARIAN IMMIGRATION. Annual Limitation of 50,000 refugees admitted under various immigration acts starting from fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year, the number of aliens whose status is adjusted under specific acts, aliens whose removal is cancelled, and aliens granted lawful permanent resident status based on a private bill passed by Congress are reported. Spouses or children of U.S. citizens and those admitted under certain limitations are exempt from the count. SEC. 104. SUNSETTING ADJUSTMENTS UNDER VARIOUS PROVISIONS. An alien may not acquire permanent residence under certain amnesties unless they filed an application before the enactment of this Act, including IRCA, agricultural worker amnesty, registry, and Amerasian immigration. An alien may not acquire permanent residence under specific amnesties unless they filed an application before the enactment of this Act, including provisions from HRIFA, NACARA, and the Cuban-Haitian Adjustment. Effective immediately upon enactment, the Lautenberg-Morrison provisions in the Foreign Operations Act of 1990 are repealed for aliens seeking permanent residence under specific amnesties. SEC. 105 requires Congressional approval to extend the designation of foreign states for Temporary Protected Status. SEC. 106 establishes new nonimmigrant classifications and allows for the conversion of certain existing immigrant classification petitions. Effective October 1, 2006, the Secretary of Homeland Security will establish new nonimmigrant classifications for spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents, with a visa validity of 3 years and renewable indefinitely as long as the principal alien resides in the United States. The nonimmigrant alien can apply for permanent resident status for their spouse and child as immediate relatives if the principal alien becomes a naturalized citizen. Nonimmigrant classification for parents of adult US citizens, valid for 5 years and renewable indefinitely as long as the citizen child resides in the US. Limitations on employment and public benefits apply. The petitioning US citizen child is responsible for supporting the alien parent in the US, regardless of the alien's resources. Classification petitions filed before October 1, 2006, for family second preference conversions will be deemed as petitions for alien classification. The petition filed before October 1, 2006, for immediate relative status as a parent of a US citizen will be considered a petition for nonimmigrant classification under subsection (a)(2).

SEC. 202 mandates immigrants to provide an affidavit of allegiance to the United States. SEC. 203 mandates that no alien can receive an immigrant visa or permanent residence status without executing an affidavit of allegiance to the United States, effective within 60 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 203 requires an affidavit of support for employment-based immigrants, while SEC. 204 states that voting in foreign elections leads to automatic loss of citizenship. SEC. 205 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include voting in a foreign country as grounds for loss of citizenship. The amendments apply to voting after the enactment of this Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include provisions regarding good moral character requirements for individuals unlawfully present or gaining admission through fraud. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include provisions regarding good moral character requirements for individuals unlawfully present in the United States for 181 days or more. Effective Date: The amendments apply to determinations made after the enactment of this Act."
