    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\" is a heading that introduces the short title, findings, and table of contents of a document. The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009 is aimed at addressing musculoskeletal disorders among nurses and healthcare workers. In 2007, nursing aides and registered nurses experienced a high number of injuries due to patient lifting and transferring, leading to chronic back pain and high rates of nurses leaving the profession. The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009 aims to address musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers. Back injuries often lead to nurses leaving work, but mechanical lift programs can improve patient safety. The use of assistive patient handling equipment has reduced manual lifting in nursing care, leading to a decrease in injuries among nursing staff. The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009 has led to a significant decrease in work-related injuries and staff turnover by implementing patient handling equipment. Studies show that this technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders, emphasizing the importance of establishing safe patient handling standards for healthcare workers. The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009 has reduced work-related injuries and staff turnover by implementing patient handling equipment. This technology decreases workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders, highlighting the need for safe patient handling standards in healthcare. The Act includes provisions for protecting direct-care registered nurses and health care workers, applying standards to facilities not covered by OSHA, and providing financial assistance for equipment purchase. The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009 mandates the Secretary of Labor to propose a safe patient handling standard within a year and finalize it within two years. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders by requiring the use of engineering controls for patient lifting and eliminating manual lifting by direct-care registered nurses and other healthcare workers. The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009 mandates the use of mechanical devices to eliminate manual lifting of patients by healthcare workers. Employers must develop a safe patient handling plan and provide safe lift mechanical devices within 2 years. Each health care employer must involve direct-care registered nurses, health care workers, and employee representatives in developing and implementing a safe patient handling and injury prevention plan. They are also required to maintain a data system to track injuries related to the standard and provide this information to employees. Additionally, employers must document the use of safe patient handling equipment. Each health care employer must document instances where safe patient handling equipment was not used due to concerns about patient care. Reports must include the work task, reason for not using equipment, risk to workers from manual lifting, and steps taken to reduce manual lifting in the future. Reports must be available to OSHA compliance officers, workers, and their representatives within one business day. Each health care employer is required to provide annual training on safe patient handling and injury prevention policies to nurses and other health care workers. The training must cover hazard identification, assessment, and control of musculoskeletal hazards in patient care areas, and be conducted by knowledgeable individuals in an interactive classroom-based and hands-on format. Additionally, employers must post a uniform notice explaining the safe patient handling and injury prevention standard, policies, and training information. Each health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of their safe patient handling and injury prevention plan, including procedures, equipment selection, assessment of injuries, and new technology. The evaluation should involve nurses, healthcare workers, and their representatives, with corrective actions taken as needed. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with the safe patient handling and injury prevention standard under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF DIRECT-CARE REGISTERED NURSES AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS. The Secretary ensures direct-care nurses can refuse assignments violating safety standards or lacking proper training. Employers cannot retaliate against nurses for refusing lifting assignments. Whistleblower Protection: Health care employers cannot retaliate against nurses or health care workers who refuse lifting assignments. Employees are protected from retaliation if they report violations of the Act or safe patient handling standards, participate in investigations, or discuss violations with others. Employees are protected from retaliation for reporting violations of the Act or safe patient handling standards by filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 180 days of the violation. The Secretary will investigate the complaint to determine if a violation has occurred. The Secretary of Labor investigates complaints to determine violations of the Act and may issue orders for remedies. Direct-care nurses or healthcare workers can bring a cause of action in court if they have been discharged, discriminated, or retaliated against, and may be entitled to reinstatement, lost wages, benefits, attorneys' fees, court costs, and other damages. Direct-care nurses and healthcare workers have the right to file complaints with the Secretary against employers who violate safe patient handling standards. This is in addition to protections provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. SEC. 4. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES NOT COVERED BY OSHA. The Social Security Act is amended to include a safe patient handling and injury prevention standard for health care facilities, effective one year after issuance. The safe patient handling and injury prevention standard for health care facilities will apply one year after its issuance. Financial assistance is provided to needy health care facilities for the purchase of safe patient handling and injury prevention equipment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a grant program to provide financial assistance for purchasing safe patient handling and injury prevention equipment for healthcare facilities that require such equipment to comply with standards and demonstrate financial need. Assistance will only be provided upon application to the Secretary. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 is authorized for financial assistance, with $50,000,000 specifically allocated for home health agencies. Funds will remain available until expended. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Act, a direct-care registered nurse is licensed to provide bedside care or outpatient services, a health care worker is assigned to lift patients, employment includes service provision under a contract, and a health care employer includes various healthcare facilities. A direct-care registered nurse or other health care workers are employed in qualified health centers, nurse managed health centers, rural health clinics, or similar facilities."
