    "content": "The \"Child Care Protection Act of 2009\" requires criminal background checks for child care providers under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. The \"Child Care Protection Act of 2009\" mandates criminal background checks for child care staff members, including prospective ones, and prohibits their employment if they fail the checks. The checks involve searching the State criminal registry, previous state residences, and State-based child abuse and neglect records. The \"Child Care Protection Act of 2009\" requires criminal background checks for child care staff members, including searching State-based child abuse and neglect registries, the National Crime Information Center, FBI fingerprint checks, and the National Sex Offender Registry. Ineligible individuals cannot be employed by child care providers receiving state funds if they fail the checks. Individuals receiving funds under this subchapter in a State may be disqualified if they refuse a criminal background check, provide false information during the check, are on a sex offender registry, or have been convicted of specific felonies like murder or child abuse. Child care providers may be ineligible for funds if they or their staff members have been involved in crimes such as child abuse, child pornography, spousal abuse, rape, sexual assault, kidnapping, arson, physical assault, battery, or drug-related offenses within the past 5 years. Requests for background checks are required for child care providers covered by this subchapter. Child care providers covered by this subchapter must request criminal background checks for all child care staff members, including prospective ones. Existing staff members need to undergo checks before a specified deadline and at least once every 5 years thereafter. Child care providers must request criminal background checks for all staff members, including prospective ones, before they start working and at least once every 5 years thereafter. States must promptly provide the results of the checks and establish an appeals process. The State must allow child care staff members to appeal the results of a criminal background check for accuracy. Fees for background checks should not exceed the actual costs to the State. States can disqualify individuals based on convictions not listed in the section if it affects their ability to provide care. In this section, definitions for 'child care provider' and 'child care staff member' are provided, specifying the types of individuals involved in providing child care services. The section outlines the requirements for criminal background checks for child care staff members, including those employed by child care providers or family child care providers. States receiving funds must comply with these requirements within two fiscal years of the enactment of the Child Care Protection Act of 2009. The Secretary may grant a State a one-year extension to meet the requirements of criminal background checks for child care staff if a good faith effort is demonstrated. Failure to comply may result in a 5 percent withholding of funds for the following fiscal year."
