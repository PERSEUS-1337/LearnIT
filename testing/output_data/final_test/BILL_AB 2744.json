    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 650 of the Business and Professions Code prohibits licensed individuals from receiving any form of compensation for referring patients, clients, or customers to any person, except as allowed by specific codes. The Business and Professions Code prohibits receiving compensation for patient referrals, except as permitted by specific codes. Payment based on a percentage of revenue is allowed if it reflects the value of services provided or fair rental value of premises/equipment. The Business and Professions Code prohibits compensation for patient referrals, except as allowed by specific codes. Consideration between a federally qualified health center and individuals/entities must comply with federal law to enhance services for underserved populations. It is not unlawful for licensed individuals to refer patients to certain healthcare facilities in which they have a financial interest, as long as the return on investment is not based on the number of patients referred. Referrals must be based on valid medical needs to avoid legal consequences. Nonmonetary remuneration in the form of hardware, software, or information technology and training services can be provided to healthcare facilities, excluding certain exceptions. \"Health care facility\" refers to various licensed health facilities under the State Department of Public Health. The payment or receipt of consideration for advertising by a licensee offering services through a third-party advertiser does not constitute a referral of patients. The fee paid to the advertiser must match the service provided. If the service is not suitable for the purchaser or if the purchaser requests a refund, they shall receive a full refund as per the advertising service agreement. The advertisement must disclose that a consultation is required. The licensee must disclose in advertisements that a consultation is required and offer a refund if the purchaser is not eligible for the service. This requirement does not apply to basic health care services or essential health benefits. The licensee must also disclose the regular price of services when offering a discounted price. The entity providing the advertisement must have written consent from the licensee. A violation of this section is a public offense and is punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for up to one year, or by a fine not exceeding $50,000, or both. Subsequent convictions may result in imprisonment or a fine of $50,000."
