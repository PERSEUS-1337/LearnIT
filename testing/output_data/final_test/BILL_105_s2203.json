    "content": "The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 may be cited as the Act. It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that 74% of employed adults use illegal drugs, small businesses employ over 50% of the workforce, and the majority of families with children have at least one working parent. Employees who abuse substances increase costs and risk safety due to higher absenteeism, health benefit utilization, workplace accidents, and disciplinary actions. The Act aims to educate small businesses on the benefits of a drug-free workplace, provide support for creating such environments, and help parents keep their children drug-free. Drug users in the workforce have higher disciplinary actions and turnover rates compared to non-users. The Act emphasizes the importance of maintaining drug-free workplaces and keeping children drug-free. Congress encourages businesses to adopt drug-free workplace programs and suggests that states provide incentives for businesses to do so. These incentives may include financial benefits like reduced workers' compensation and unemployment insurance premiums, as well as tax deductions for expenses related to employee assistance programs, treatment, or drug testing. Other incentives, such as liability limitations, are also recommended by the President's Commission on Model State Drug Laws. SEC. 32. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Small Business Act is amended to include a program encouraging businesses to adopt drug-free workplace programs. The term 'drug-free workplace program' includes a written policy, alcohol and drug abuse prevention training, and employee drug testing conducted by a certified laboratory. The drug-free workplace program includes employee access to an employee assistance program, continuing alcohol and drug abuse prevention assistance, and review of positive test results by a licensed medical review officer. Eligible intermediary organizations must meet specific criteria under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 outlines criteria for eligible intermediary organizations involved in drug-free workplace programs, including having at least 2 years of relevant experience, a drug-free workplace policy, and being located in a specific geographic area. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 establishes a drug-free workplace demonstration program to provide financial and technical assistance to small business concerns through grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts with eligible intermediaries. The term 'employee' includes supervisors, managers, officers, and owners actively involved in managing the small business concern. The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 requires the Administrator to evaluate drug-free workplace programs established with assistance and submit a report to Congress. The Administrator has the authority to contract with entities to provide assistance for the program. The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 authorizes the Administrator to provide assistance to entities and allocate $10,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. Employers attending programs offered by intermediaries are not required to contract for their services. SEC. 5. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. Amends the Small Business Act to provide information and assistance to small businesses on establishing drug-free workplace programs."
