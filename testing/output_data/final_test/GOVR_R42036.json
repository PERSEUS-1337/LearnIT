    "content": "The 112th Congress has not focused much on comprehensive immigration reform legislation, but has taken action on some immigration-related measures. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 includes provisions on border security, visa security, and other immigration issues. P.L. 112-176 extends the authorization for four immigration programs for three years. Legislation has also been enacted on military service-based immigration benefits and border tunnels. The 112th Congress has passed various immigration-related legislation, including bills on service-based immigration benefits, border tunnels, the BEST initiative, E-2 treaty investor visas, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, reform of employment-based and family-based admissions, creation of new visa categories for STEM graduates, reauthorization of the H-1C temporary worker category for nurses, border security, and student visa reform. The 112th Congress has passed various immigration-related legislation, including bills on service-based immigration benefits, border tunnels, the BEST initiative, E-2 treaty investor visas, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, reform of employment-based and family-based admissions, creation of new visa categories for STEM graduates, reauthorization of the H-1C temporary worker category for nurses, border security, and student visa reform. Other subjects of immigration-related legislation before the 112th Congress include victims of trafficking, immigrant detention, and diversity visas. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for protecting U.S. borders from various threats. Border security is a key issue for Congress, with focus on whether DHS has enough resources for its mission. CBP patrols U.S. borders and coastal waters to prevent illegal entries. Some argue against considering other immigration reforms until border security is addressed. The 112th Congress is urged to focus on border security before considering other immigration reforms. Administration officials claim progress has been made in securing the border, but further investments are needed. Key provisions regarding staffing and enforcement at ports of entry are being discussed, with a focus on preventing unauthorized migrants and terrorists from entering the US while facilitating legal migration flows. Funding for CBP screening and enforcement programs is a policy question that needs to be addressed. Funding for CBP screening and enforcement programs has increased, with the number of CBP officers at POEs growing from 17,881 in FY2005 to 21,186 in FY2012. Additional officers were funded in FY2012, and bills in the 112th Congress aim to address further staffing increases. For example, the Secure Border Act of 2012 (H.R. 1299) and the DHS Authorization Act of 2011 (S. 1546) focus on developing metrics for security at ports of entry and ensuring CBP staffing levels are adequate. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program, active at all ports of entry, collects biometric and biographic data on foreign visitors to the U.S. However, it has been criticized for not collecting biometric data from all visitors entering the U.S. and not collecting any data from visitors leaving the country, potentially reducing its effectiveness. The U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program collects biometric data from visitors entering the U.S. but not from those leaving, potentially weakening its effectiveness. Congressional bills aim to implement a biometric exit system to address this issue. Increased border enforcement has led to smugglers using cross-border tunnels to move illegal drugs into the U.S. Congress has focused on border patrol staffing, surveillance technology, and physical barriers to combat this trend. The Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-127) created a new federal crime for unlawful construction or use of underground tunnels between the U.S. and another country. Congress also passed the Jaime Zapata Border Enforcement Security Task Force Act (P.L. 112-205) to provide statutory authority for the Border Enforcement Security Task Force. The new border patrol national strategy emphasizes staffing, surveillance, infrastructure, intelligence, and risk management to efficiently allocate enforcement resources. Congress has taken action to increase border patrol staffing along the Southwest and northern borders, with total staffing increasing from 9,821 in FY2001 to 21,370 for FY2012. Additional proposals are being considered to broaden DHS authority for enforcement activities on federal lands and address concerns about measuring border security. Bills in the 112th Congress aim to further grow the border patrol and potentially deploy National Guard troops to the Southwest border. Guard troops are being deployed to the Southwest border as part of DHS programs for border situational awareness. The SBInet program was terminated in 2011 due to cost overruns and technical issues, leading to a new Arizona Border Technology Plan. This plan includes a mix of off-the-shelf surveillance technology and continued investment in integrated surveillance towers. The new plan has faced scrutiny, with $400 million allocated for border security fencing and technology in FY2012. The Arizona Border Technology Plan includes $400 million for border security fencing and technology in FY2012, with concerns raised about the justification of specific technologies, lack of defined metrics, and robust cost estimates. Congress has supported DHS's use of surveillance aircraft, including unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Over 400 miles of fencing and barriers have been installed along the Southwest border since the Secure Fence Act of 2006. DHS has installed over 400 miles of fencing and barriers along the Southwest border, representing 99.8% of the planned total. Legislation in Congress may authorize more fencing. ICE's BEST initiative promotes coordination among law enforcement officials in border communities. The Jaime Zapata Border Enforcement Security Task Force Act fosters coordination among law enforcement officials in border communities to disrupt criminal organizations. The act was passed by the House in May 2012 and authorized program funding until 2016. The Senate version of the bill was approved by the House and signed into law in December 2012. The 112th Congress passed a bill into law (P.L. 112-205) on December 7, 2012, addressing challenges of immigration enforcement on federal lands along the Southwest and northern borders. Cooperation between DHS, DOI, and USDA has improved, and legislation between 1996 and 2006 gave DHS authority to waive environmental statutes for border security measures. The 112th Congress passed a law addressing immigration enforcement challenges on federal lands along the Southwest and northern borders. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress would waive certain environmental laws for border enforcement activities near the border. Some Members of Congress question the metrics used by the Obama Administration to measure border security. DHS has used apprehensions by the border patrol as a proxy measure of illegal entries for many years. CBP plans to introduce a new \"border conditions index\" in 2013 to provide a more comprehensive description of security, trade, tourism conditions, and quality of life on the border. Some Members of Congress are skeptical about this index and frustrated that DHS stopped publishing annual estimates of border control in 2010. The Border Security Act of 2012 aims to achieve operational control of the border as defined in the Secure Fence Act of 2006. H.R. 1299 directs DHS to develop metrics for border security at ports of entry and work on preventing unlawful entries into the United States. Employment eligibility verification is a key issue in reducing unauthorized immigration, with bills like the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 2885) being introduced in Congress. Under \u00a7274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, employers are prohibited from hiring unauthorized aliens and must participate in the I-9 employment eligibility verification system. Violations may result in civil or criminal penalties enforced by DHS's ICE. Employers can also use the E-Verify system administered by USCIS for electronic verification. E-Verify, administered by USCIS, electronically verifies new hires' employment authorization through SSA and DHS databases. P.L. 112-176 extends its authorization for three years. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress aim to make E-Verify permanent or introduce a new electronic employment eligibility verification system. Concerns have been raised about labor shortages in sectors known to employ unauthorized aliens. H.R. 2885 proposes a new electronic verification system modeled on E-Verify, making it mandatory for all employers in hiring, recruitment, and referral. Verification requirements would be phased in by employer size, with the largest employers required to participate six months after enactment. The bill also addresses concerns about labor shortages in sectors employing unauthorized aliens. The bill H.R. 2885 proposes a new electronic verification system for all employers, with phased-in requirements based on employer size. Special provisions apply to agriculture, with reverification phased in three years after enactment. The bill also allows for electronic verification not currently permitted under E-Verify. H.R. 2885 proposes a new electronic verification system for all employers, with increased penalties for violations of unauthorized employment provisions. It allows electronic verification before hiring and imposes penalties for misuse of social security numbers. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to oversee the system. The bill proposes a biometric employment verification pilot program that is voluntary for employers. It includes provisions related to E-Verify and restrictions on new hires in the DHS appropriations. Some states and localities require the use of E-Verify to deter unauthorized aliens. The Supreme Court upheld the Legal Arizona Workers Act in a 2011 decision. The Supreme Court upheld the Legal Arizona Workers Act in 2011, which was not preempted by federal immigration law. Business groups are now lobbying for a national electronic verification regime, with H.R. 2885 proposing to establish such a regime while preempting state and local E-Verify measures. This bill would allow states to revoke licenses of employers who fail to electronically verify their workers' employment eligibility. The 112th Congress introduced bills to preempt state and local measures prohibiting employers from verifying workers through E-Verify. Illinois had a prohibition overturned by federal immigration law. Certain removable aliens cannot be removed due to lack of travel documents or risk of torture. The Supreme Court ruled in Zadvydas v. Davis (2001) that such aliens can only be detained for a reasonable time post-removal. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Zadvydas v. Davis (2001), new regulations were implemented by ICE to limit post-removal-period detention to six months, with exceptions for dangerous individuals like terrorists. ICE can only detain an alien beyond 90 days if they are likely to abscond or pose a danger, or if travel documents are imminent. Special circumstances, such as contagious diseases, may also warrant extended detention. The House Judiciary Committee has reported the Keep Our Communities Safe Act of 2011 (H.R. 1932), which would allow DHS to detain indefinitely, subject to six-month reviews, aliens under orders of removal who cannot be removed for various reasons, including public safety threats, foreign policy consequences, security concerns, and dangerous criminal behavior. The Keep Our Communities Safe Act of 2011 (H.R. 1932) allows DHS to detain aliens indefinitely if they pose public safety threats, have contagious diseases, or if their release would have adverse foreign policy consequences or threaten national security. The bill limits habeas corpus reviews to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and permits unlimited detention of certain aliens during removal proceedings. DOS and DHS are responsible for administering the law. The Department of State (DOS) and DHS are key in administering laws and policies on alien admission to the United States. DOS issues visas, while USCIS approves immigrant petitions, ICE operates the Visa Security Program, and CBP inspects all entering individuals. Foreign nationals undergo admissibility reviews by DOS consular officers abroad to ensure eligibility for entry based on specified criteria. The Consolidated Database (CCD) automates visa application records dating back to the mid-1990s, storing photos and 10-finger scans since 2001 and 2007 respectively. It links to security databases to flag issues affecting visa issuance. The Visa Security Program (VSP) operated by ICE Office of International Affairs sends agents to high-risk consular posts for security activities. The Visa Security Program (VSP) provides law enforcement resources for screening visa applicants to determine their risk profiles. An evaluation by GAO in 2011 identified shortcomings, including tensions between consular officials and VSP agents, lack of standard operating procedures, and failure to expand to key high-risk posts as planned by ICE. Despite implementation problems, some believe DHS should have a larger role in visa security to address concerns about DOS's power over visa issuances and consular officers prioritizing tourism and trade over thorough scrutiny of applicants. The Visa Security Program (VSP) is being considered for greater responsibility in scrutinizing visa applicants, as it does not have competing priorities like diplomatic relations. The House Committee on the Judiciary has proposed the Secure Visas Act (H.R. 1741) to give the Secretary of Homeland Security exclusive authority over visa regulations. Congress has also addressed exclusion and inadmissibility issues. The Visa Security Program may gain more authority in vetting visa applicants, as proposed by the Secure Visas Act. The law prohibits issuing visas to aliens who have supported illegal armed groups in Colombia or violated human rights, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the Immigration and Nationality Act imposes a per-country limit on U.S. immigrant admissions to prevent any single country from dominating admissions. The per-country limit on U.S. immigrant admissions aims to prevent any single country from dominating admissions. It applies to legal permanent resident admissions in family-sponsored and employment-based classes. India and China have been oversubscribed in certain employment-based preference categories. Employers in the U.S. continue to seek skilled workers from around the world to stay competitive. Despite high unemployment levels, there is a demand for the \"best and the brightest\" workers in various industries. Supporters argue that increasing employment-based immigration is crucial for economic growth, while opponents claim there is no evidence of labor shortages and recruiting foreign workers during high unemployment is not justified. The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (H.R. 3012) aims to eliminate per-country ceilings on permanent employment-based admissions and increase the per-country ceiling on permanent family-based admissions. The bill would not change the total number of LPRs admitted but would be implemented over four years. The House passed H.R. 3012 by a wide margin, and a similar bill (S. 1983) was introduced in the Senate. Some policymakers propose creating a separate visa category for STEM graduates to address oversubscribed countries in the employment-based system. The STEM Jobs Act of 2012 aimed to reallocate Diversity Visas to foreign STEM graduates with job offers, but it failed to pass in September 2012. The House passed a revised version of H.R. 6429 in November 2012, including an expansion of the nonimmigrant visa for family members with approved or pending LPR petitions, known as the \"V\" visa. Spouses and minor children of LPRs would be eligible to live in the US on V visas while waiting for their petitions or visa applications to be processed. The diversity immigrant category was added to the INA by the Immigration Act of 1990 to stimulate new migration from other parts of the world. To be eligible for a diversity visa, the foreign national must have a high school education or equivalent, or two years of experience in a qualifying occupation. Winners of the diversity visa lottery undergo reviews before coming to the United States. The diversity visa lottery provides 50,000 visas annually to eligible immigrants from countries with low immigration rates in the past five years. There are debates on whether to eliminate the diversity lottery and reallocate its visas to reduce backlogs in other visa categories. Supporters argue that the diversity visa brings new immigrants to the U.S. immigration system. Critics argue that the diversity visa lottery is vulnerable to fraud and misuse, potentially allowing terrorists to enter the country. Supporters claim that background checks are performed on all prospective immigrants, including diversity visa winners. Legislation has been proposed to eliminate the diversity visa lottery, with the House passing a bill that includes its elimination. The H-1C nonimmigrant category for nurses was established in 1999 to address nursing shortages in medically underserved areas. The authority to issue H-1C visas expired in 2009, but H.R. 1933 aims to reauthorize the category for three years with amendments, allowing for the issuance of 300 visas annually and limiting a nurse's stay to three years. The bill aims to reauthorize the H-1C nonimmigrant category for nurses, allowing for the issuance of 300 visas annually and limiting a nurse's stay to six years. It also provides portability for H-1C nurses to work at another approved hospital while their new employer's petition is being processed. Refugee admission to the United States is authorized by the INA for individuals facing persecution based on various factors. Refugees are processed and admitted to the United States from abroad by the Department of State and DHS/USCIS. After one year, refugees must apply to adjust to LPR status. Proposed bills in Congress aim to reform the refugee admissions process and resettlement assistance programs. The Lautenberg amendment, enacted in 1989, facilitates relief for certain refugee groups by requiring less evidence to prove refugee status for former Soviet and Indochinese nationals. The Specter amendment, added in P.L. 108-199, extends this provision to Iranian religious minorities. The Lautenberg amendment was regularly extended until FY2010, and in FY2011, Congress extended it until June 1. The Lautenberg amendment, enacted in 1989, facilitates relief for certain refugee groups by requiring less evidence to prove refugee status for former Soviet and Indochinese nationals. The Specter amendment, added in P.L. 108-199, extends this provision to Iranian religious minorities. The Lautenberg amendment was regularly extended until FY2010. For FY2011, Congress extended the amendment only until June 1, 2011, in P.L. 112-10 (Div. B, \u00a72121(m)), and it temporarily terminated on that date. It was re-enacted for FY2012 by P.L. 112-74 (Div. I, \u00a77034(r)). FY2013 extension language is included in the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2013 ( S. 3241 ). Two of ICE's main programs designed to identify and remove certain aliens from within the United States are Secure Communities and the 287(g) program. Under Secure Communities, participating law enforcement agencies submit fingerprints of arrestees to the FBI for criminal background checks, which are also checked against DHS databases. When an arrestee appears subject to removal, local ICE officials may issue an immigration detainer to request that the arresting jurisdiction hold the person. ICE can issue an immigration detainer to hold individuals for up to 48 hours and transfer them to ICE custody for removal proceedings. Secure Communities is seen as an efficient way to identify and prioritize the removal of criminal aliens. The program is active in the majority of law enforcement jurisdictions and is planned to expand further. Despite some controversy over non-convicted individuals being removed, Congress has consistently supported and funded Secure Communities. Some states and localities have sought to limit their participation in Secure Communities due to concerns about racial profiling and strained police-community relations. DHS has stated that communities may not \"opt out\" of the program since 2010. Under the 287(g) program, state and local law enforcement agencies can enter agreements with ICE for training and immigration enforcement activities. Programs allow for migration screening during jail bookings or as part of task force activities. The 287(g) program allows law enforcement to conduct migration screening outside of the booking process. Concerns about racial profiling and strained police-community relations have been raised. The program's oversight has been criticized, and funding may be reduced in certain jurisdictions. Legislation related to Secure Communities and the 287(g) program has been introduced in Congress. Several bills in Congress aim to expand Secure Communities by denying funding for DOJ programs to jurisdictions not fully participating. Proposed legislation addresses concerns about racial profiling and police-community relations. Congress may address changes to Secure Communities and 287(g) funding through appropriations. Senate-reported S. 3216 would provide reduced FY2013 funding for the 287(g) program, while House-passed H.R. 5855 would fund the program at the higher FY2012 level and prohibit termination of existing agreements. Several states and localities have implemented measures to deter unauthorized aliens, with Arizona's S.B. 1070 being a notable example. The Supreme Court ruled on the legality of certain aspects of S.B. 1070, finding some provisions preempted by federal law. Other state and local measures aimed at deterring unlawfully present individuals have also faced legal challenges. Some state and local measures to deter unauthorized aliens are facing ongoing litigation. Legislation in the 112th Congress addresses the authority of state and local officers to enforce federal immigration law. The Obama Administration acknowledges limitations in deporting all potentially removable aliens identified by DHS. ICE updated guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement to prioritize high-priority cases due to limited resources. DHS and DOJ established a working group to review pending removal cases and consider closing certain cases administratively. As of May 29, 2012, about 7% of cases reviewed. Some Members of Congress object to the Administration's prosecutorial discretion policies, arguing it amounts to an \"administrative amnesty.\" The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, FY2013 (H.R. 5855) would prohibit funding for the 'Morton Memos'. Proposed legislation in the 112th Congress aims to tighten standards for executive branch discretion. The INA includes provisions to assist foreign national victims of domestic abuse, allowing them to self-petition for LPR status independently. VAWA 2000 created the nonimmigrant U visa for foreign national victims of certain crimes. The VAWA reauthorization in 2005 expanded protections for abused aliens and added eligibility for the U visa. The Senate Judiciary Committee has reported a bill to reauthorize VAWA, which includes provisions to conduct additional background checks for sponsors of foreign national fianc\u00e9es, prohibits marketing information about minors by international marriage brokers, extends coverage to derivative children, and includes \"stalking\" in the definition of criminal acts. The bill would expand protections for abused aliens and include \"stalking\" in criminal activity under the U visa. It exempts certain petitioners from being classified as inadmissible for LPR status based on financial concerns and temporarily increases the U visa cap. The House passed a similar VAWA reauthorization bill in 2012 with additional provisions on background checks and inadmissibility protections for abused aliens. The bill aims to enhance protections for abused aliens by including \"stalking\" in criminal activity under the U visa, exempting certain petitioners from inadmissibility for LPR status based on financial concerns, and temporarily increasing the U visa cap. It also requires USCIS to consider law enforcement investigations or prosecutions of alleged abusers when adjudicating petitions. The VAWA reauthorization legislation raises concerns for Congress regarding relief for abused foreign nationals and potential immigration fraud. Advocates call for additional provisions to help abused immigrants, while others worry about expanding eligibility and costs to taxpayers. Allegations of immigration fraud through VAWA are also a concern, but empirical evidence is limited. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA) was passed by Congress in 2000 to combat trafficking in persons (TIP) internationally and domestically. It created nonimmigrant visa categories for trafficking victims and grant programs to aid victims and train law enforcement. The current program authorizations expired in FY2011, and a reauthorization bill, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2830), has been ordered reported by the House. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has ordered the reported Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2830) and the Senate Judiciary Committee has reported the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S. 1301). H.R. 2830 extends authorizations for FY2012 and FY2013, while S. 1301 extends authorizations through FY2015 and increases funding for victim service grant programs. Both bills criminalize the destruction or concealment of another person's identification documents in the context of fraud in foreign labor contracting or alien smuggling. The Senate bill (S. 1301) and the House bill (H.R. 2830) aim to combat fraud in foreign labor contracting and alien smuggling. They also address the custody and care of unaccompanied alien children, with S. 1301 providing services for child victims of sex trafficking. The EB-5 visa category benefits the U.S. economy by attracting foreign investors. The LPR investor visa aims to benefit the U.S. economy through employment creation and foreign capital influx. To qualify for the EB-5 visa, the investor must invest $1 million, create at least 10 jobs, and maintain the business for two years. The Regional Center Pilot Program encourages investment in specific regions to achieve economic activity and job creation goals. The Regional Center Pilot Program for EB-5 immigrant investors was reauthorized through September 30, 2015. There are bills in Congress to amend EB-5 visa requirements or create a new EB-6 preference for alien entrepreneurs. Special immigrants, including ministers of religion and religious workers, fall under the fourth preference category in the employment-based immigration system. The special immigrant religious worker program has been extended for three years until September 30, 2015. Congress is interested in promoting international tourism to the United States, with provisions in P.L. 112-74 aimed at increasing tourism by reducing visa wait times in China, Brazil, and India. The pilot program for processing B visas using videoconferencing technology is being considered. The Secretary of State must conduct a risk and benefit analysis for extending the expiration period for a B visa before requiring an interview. Currently, visa applicants aged 14-79 require an in-person interview by a consular officer, with some exceptions. Hearings have been held to promote tourism to the United States, including discussions on S. 2233. The JOLT Act, S. 2233, would allow premium processing for B visas and lower fees in select countries during low demand periods. H.R. 3039 aims to set a visa processing standard of 12 days in China, Brazil, and India, and hire more officers using visa fees. The bill H.R. 3039 aims to set a visa processing standard of 12 days in certain countries and authorize longer visa validity periods. It also includes a pilot program for B visas using videoconferencing technology and extends the H-2A nonimmigrant visa program for foreign agricultural workers in the U.S. The H-2A program allows employers to extend an H-2A worker's stay for up to three consecutive years. Employers must apply for certification from the Department of Labor to import H-2A workers, showing a need for foreign workers and no adverse impact on U.S. workers. The program is administered by the Department of Labor and USCIS. The H-2A program requires employers to cooperate with DOL-funded state workforce agencies for recruitment efforts and hire qualified U.S. workers until 50% of the work contract has elapsed. Employers must pay H-2A workers the highest wage rate, provide housing and transportation, and offer benefits. The proposed H.R. 2847 aims to establish a new H-2C visa for temporary agricultural workers as an alternative to the H-2A visa, allowing for more flexibility in the type of work and duration. The proposed H.R. 2847 aims to establish a new H-2C visa for temporary agricultural workers as an alternative to the H-2A visa. The H-2C program would not be limited to seasonal work, with a 10-month stay limit and an annual cap of 500,000 workers. Administered by USDA, it would not require the same labor certification process as the H-2A visa. Employers would attest to meeting recruitment, wage, and benefit requirements, with different rules from the H-2A program. Wages for H-2C workers would be based on prevailing or minimum wage rates, not the adverse effect wage rate. The H-2C program would have fewer U.S. worker recruitment requirements compared to the H-2A program. The H-2C program would have fewer U.S. worker recruitment requirements, no \"50 percent rule,\" and could offer housing vouchers. Unauthorized alien students face obstacles in pursuing higher education and legislation like the \"DREAM Act\" aims to provide them with educational opportunities and immigration status. The DREAM Act bills aim to provide unauthorized alien students with access to educational opportunities and a path to legal status in the United States through a two-stage process. These bills also seek to repeal a provision that restricts states from offering postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens. Previous attempts to pass the DREAM Act in Congress have been unsuccessful, but bills have been reintroduced in the 112th Congress. In the 112th Congress, DREAM Act bills were reintroduced to provide unauthorized alien students with educational opportunities and a path to legal status. In June 2012, DHS issued a memorandum for relief from removal for certain individuals brought to the US as children. USCIS began accepting requests for deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) in August 2012. There has been a reexamination of birthright citizenship due to concerns about illegal immigration. The concept of birthright citizenship is codified in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the INA. The case of Yaser Esam Hamdi, a U.S.-Saudi dual national captured in Afghanistan, raised concerns about restricting automatic birthright citizenship. Some Members of the 112th Congress supported revising the Citizenship Clause to address issues related to children born to unauthorized aliens. Several bills have been introduced to amend the Constitution and/or the INA to exclude persons born in the United States from citizenship at birth if their parents were unlawfully present in the United States or were nonimmigrant aliens. State legislators have voiced support for state legislation that would define state citizenship as excluding persons born to undocumented aliens. Title VII of P.L. 110-229 extended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), establishing federal regulation over the admission of foreign workers. Legislation introduced in some states aimed to challenge the Citizenship Clause but has not been enacted. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 1466 aimed to address the status of long-term foreign residents in the CNMI who may face challenges staying in the territory after November 28, 2011. Some residents have U.S. citizen family members but are unable to sponsor them for U.S. immigrant status due to various reasons. H.R. 1466 addresses the status of long-term foreign residents in the CNMI who may face challenges staying in the territory after November 28, 2011. Some residents have U.S. citizen family members but are unable to sponsor them for U.S. immigrant status due to economic conditions. The bill would authorize admission of these residents as immigrants to the CNMI only, with a path to adjust later to regular LPR status. Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and certain persons born in the CNMI who did not receive U.S. citizenship, along with their spouses and unmarried children under 21, would be eligible for parole on a discretionary basis to stay lawfully in the CNMI. USCIS guidelines allowed parole grants backdated to November 27, 2011, if applied for by January 31, 2012. Unlawful presence would accrue if parole is denied after the CNMI permit expiration. Discussions on H.R. 1466 are ongoing. The discussions on H.R. 1466 continue, with critics and supporters debating the inclusion of foreign parents of minor U.S. citizen children as beneficiaries. The 112th Congress is focusing on foreign temporary workers in professional occupations, considering revisions to immigration laws to expand temporary visas for STEM graduates and addressing potential misuse of other temporary visa categories. Since 2003, Congress has enacted measures to facilitate naturalization and LPR status for military service members and their families. In the 112th Congress, bills have been introduced to address issues resulting from military service, including H.R. 398 which extends the time to qualify for non-conditional LPR status for military service. Under the INA, spouses must jointly satisfy requirements to have conditions removed from LPR status obtained through marriage to a U.S. citizen or LPR. In order to remove conditions from LPR status obtained through marriage, both spouses must meet specific requirements, including a joint personal interview with DHS. P.L. 112-58 tolls the time for meeting these requirements if either spouse is serving abroad in the U.S. Armed Forces. The new law eliminates the need for discretionary waivers by tolling the time periods. Additionally, P.L. 112-74 allows for reimbursement of USCIS fees for processing military-service-based naturalization applications. The INA provides for temporary investors through E-1 and E-2 visas for treaty traders and investors. Israeli nationals are now eligible for E-2 status under P.L. 112-130 if Israel offers a similar status to U.S. citizens. The F visa is the most common nonimmigrant visa for foreign students. The F visa is the most common nonimmigrant visa for foreign students pursuing education at accredited institutions. H.R. 3120, passed by the House, would require colleges and universities to be accredited to accept foreign students on F visas, with the possibility of waiver by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Other institutions may also need accreditation if certain criteria are met. The bill passed by the House requires colleges and universities to be accredited to accept foreign students on F visas. It also prohibits individuals convicted of certain offenses from being involved in a position of ownership, authority, or management with an institution allowed to accept F students. The visa waiver program allows nationals from certain countries to enter the U.S. as temporary visitors for business or pleasure without a visa. Countries must meet specific criteria to be designated as visa waiver program countries. The bill S. 3216 would allow the Secretary of DHS to use visa overstay rates instead of nonimmigrant visa refusal rates to determine eligibility for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Countries with refusal or overstay rates less than 3% in the previous fiscal year could be admitted to the VWP, with the option for waivers under certain conditions. The bill also includes provisions for security cooperation and a probationary period for countries in the program. The bill S. 3216 proposes changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), including using visa overstay rates to determine eligibility for the program. It also establishes procedures for terminating a country's participation in the VWP if they fail to comply with requirements. Additionally, the bill addresses the entry of foreign medical graduates (FMGs) on J-1 visas for medical education, requiring them to return to their home countries for two years before applying for other visas or LPR status. States can request waivers for FMGs through the Conrad State Program. The H-2B visa program has been extended multiple times, most recently by P.L. 112-176, allowing aliens with J status before September 30, 2015 to qualify. It permits foreign workers to temporarily work in the U.S. for nonagricultural labor if no local workers are available. Employers must pay workers the highest of prevailing wage or minimum wage. A 2011 DOL rule to change prevailing wage rates has been blocked by Congress through various enactments.
