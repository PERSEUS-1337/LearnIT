Congress finds that the Enterprise Rancheria is a Federally recognized tribe of Maidu Indians in California with a government-to-government relationship. The Maidu people have a long history in the Feather River drainage area. In 1916, land was purchased for Enterprise Rancheria under Federal laws for homeless Indians. Enterprise Rancheria, a federally recognized tribe of Maidu Indians in California, has a constitution, governing body, and 664 enrolled members.

Public Law 88-453 authorized the sale of Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel to the State of California for $12,196 for the construction of Oroville Dam. The parcel is now mostly underwater within the dam reservoir, with $11,175 paid for the land and $1,020 for personal property. After the sale of Enterprise Rancheria No. 2 parcel to the State of California for the construction of Oroville Dam, 4 individuals received payment while the remaining heirs and Tribe members received no compensation. The loss of their homes and community forced the Enterprise Rancheria members to scatter, leading to a decay of their culture and traditions. Resolving compensation claims for the inequitable taking of the parcel is expected to take many years.
