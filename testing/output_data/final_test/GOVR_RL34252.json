This change, effective since November 22, 2005, was estimated to have an insignificant impact on federal foster care spending by the Congressional Budget Office. The Fair Access to Foster Care Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-113) allows states to claim reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act for eligible foster children in for-profit foster care agencies. The Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program was reauthorized and received $12 million in funding for FY2007 under P.L. 109-162, with additional funding for training and a new grant program for children exposed to violence. The Fair Access to Foster Care Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-113) allows states to claim reimbursement under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act for eligible foster children in for-profit foster care agencies. P.L. 109-162 reauthorized the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) program with $12 million in funding for FY2007, allowing state and local CASA programs to request criminal background checks for volunteers from the FBI. It also prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying and requires a report on CASA activities funded by the National CASA Association. Additionally, P.L. 109-162 added a new authorization of $7.5 million for grants to the American Prosecutors Research Institute to improve prosecution of child abuse cases. The American Prosecutors Research Institute (APRI) received $7.5 million in funding under P.L. 109-162 to provide technical assistance and training for prosecuting child abuse cases. This funding is separate from the previous authorization under Section 214A of the Victims of Child Abuse Act, which expired in FY2005. The Department of Justice administers these funds, with just over $2 million appropriated in FY2007. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers competitive grants for training to improve community responses to families experiencing child maltreatment and domestic violence. Eligible entities must include a child welfare agency, agency for domestic violence victims, and law enforcement. Funding for this grant program is authorized under HHS's Family and Youth Services Bureau. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA, P.L. 109-171, Title VII, Subtitle D) made legislative changes to clarify eligibility for federal foster care and adoption assistance support. It also imposed limitations on states' ability to claim federal reimbursement for administering Title IV-E foster care programs. This included restrictions on the length of time a child can be considered a foster care candidate and new rules for claims related to foster children in unlicensed relative homes. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA, P.L. 109-171, Title VII, Subtitle D) clarified federal foster care and adoption assistance eligibility. It increased funding for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program and mandated collaboration between courts and child welfare agencies. Additionally, it authorized new grants for court improvement in child welfare proceedings.

P.L. 109-239 amended Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to expedite foster children placement into safe and permanent homes across state lines, making additional changes to child welfare policy. The law amended Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act to expedite foster children placement across state lines, establishing deadlines for interstate home studies and authorizing incentive payments to states. It also prohibited states from restricting state agencies to contract with private agencies for home studies. P.L. 109-239 encourages identification of in-state and out-of-state placement options for children in foster care, requires courts to notify foster parents of proceedings, and mandates maintenance of health and education records for children in foster care. Youth leaving foster care custody at 18 must receive free copies of their health and education records. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-248) includes federal requirements for criminal background checks of foster and adoptive parents. States must now check child abuse and neglect registries for information on prospective parents. National registry of child abuse cases is required. Criminal records checks for parents must include FBI checks before placement of foster children. Under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, states must conduct criminal background checks on prospective foster or adoptive parents, including FBI checks. If certain felony convictions are found, the state cannot claim Title IV-E foster care or adoption assistance for a child placed in their home. However, the state child welfare agency can still place a child in the home if they determine it is safe, but the child would be disqualified from federal assistance. Under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, states must conduct criminal background checks on prospective foster or adoptive parents, including FBI checks. If certain felony convictions are found, the state cannot claim Title IV-E foster care or adoption assistance for a child placed in their home. However, the state child welfare agency can still place a child in the home if they determine it is safe, but the child would be disqualified from federal assistance. Some states had until FY2009 to comply with the federal criminal records check procedures. As of FY2007, states are required to check their child abuse and neglect registries before approving foster or adoptive placements. Information from other states' registries must also be requested for prospective parents or adults living in their household. Federal stipulations do not dictate how states should use this information. P.L. 109-248 mandates the creation of a national registry of substantiated cases of child abuse or neglect, accessible only to authorized government entities. Additionally, HHS is required to study the feasibility of establishing data collection standards for a national child abuse and neglect registry. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-288) authorized funding for a feasibility study on establishing a National Registry of child abuse cases. However, no funds were appropriated for the study, delaying the establishment of the registry. The Acting head of HHS emphasized the need for completing the feasibility study before proceeding with the National Registry. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-288) amended and reauthorized various child welfare programs under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program received funding of $434 million in FY2007, with an annual authorization of $545 million extended through FY2011. Program funding has never reached the full authorization. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program received $434 million in FY2007. P.L. 109-288 allocated $40 million annually for caseworker visits and improving outcomes for children affected by substance abuse. $95 million was designated for monthly caseworker visits, while $145 million was for competitive grants to regional partnerships. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families program received increased funding under P.L. 109-288, with grants ranging from $1.5 million to $3.7 million over three to five years. Tribal funding for child and family services also grew from $5 million to $12 million, benefiting over 130 tribes. The law amended the program to require states to report actual fund usage and limited administrative spending. The Child Welfare Services program (CWS) was amended under P.L. 109-288 to limit funding authority to FY2007-FY2011, aligning it with the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. The program's funding authorization remained at $325 million since FY1990, with administrative spending capped at 10% of state funds. The Child Welfare Services program (CWS) funding authorization has never reached the full $325 million level since FY1990. In FY2007, the program received $287 million. P.L. 109-288 emphasized funding for community-based agencies to develop child and family services. The program aims to protect children, prevent neglect and abuse, support at-risk families, promote safety in foster care, and provide training for a qualified workforce. The Child Welfare Services program under P.L. 109-288 included new state plan requirements such as disaster response procedures, consultation with medical professionals for children in foster care, and standards for caseworker visits to ensure monthly visits focused on case planning and service delivery. The Child Welfare Services program under P.L. 109-288 requires states to provide data on monthly caseworker visits to children in foster care, with a goal of 90% of children being visited monthly by October 1, 2011. States failing to meet this goal will need to allocate more of their own funds to receive full CWS funding. Additional changes were made to the use of CWS funds starting in FY2008. Beginning in FY2008, changes were made to the use of Child Welfare Services (CWS) funds. The law now limits administrative expenses to 10% of program funds and prohibits using federal CWS funds for adoption assistance payments or child care above FY2005 levels. Additionally, both federal and state/local CWS funds cannot exceed FY2005 levels for foster care maintenance payments. P.L. 109-288 extended grants for state highest courts to improve child welfare proceedings and reauthorized the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program for five years. P.L. 109-288 extended grants for state highest courts to improve child welfare proceedings and reauthorized the Mentoring Children of Prisoners program for five years. It also required courts to consult with children in foster care in an \"age-appropriate manner\" regarding permanency plans. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432) exempted foster children from citizenship documentation requirements for Medicaid eligibility. It also mandated states to verify the citizenship or immigration status of all children in foster care. Section 1123A of the Social Security Act now requires state compliance with federal requirements to be checked during periodic reviews, effective June 20, 2007."
