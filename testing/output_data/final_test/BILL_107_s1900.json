    "content": "The Act titled \"Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002\" provides a grant for a program to protect information infrastructure against disruption. The Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology to award grants to qualifying nongovernmental entities for cybersecurity best practices, research, and development to protect the US information infrastructure. Qualifying entities must be nonprofit consortia with expertise in cybersecurity from academic and private sectors. The Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 authorizes grants to nonprofit consortia with expertise in cybersecurity from academic and private sectors. These consortia must have a board of directors with senior administrators and managers in cybersecurity, operated by individuals with demonstrated expertise in cybersecurity, and have rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest. The entity applying for a grant under the Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 must have a detailed plan for the program and meet all requirements set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The selection of the grantee will be done through open competition among qualifying nongovernmental entities. The grant amount will be dispersed according to the authorization of appropriations. The grant amounts authorized in section 5 will be dispersed over five fiscal years starting from 2003. The National Institute of Standards and Technology must consult with relevant federal entities in carrying out activities under this section. The entity awarded a grant must have a detailed program plan. The entity awarded a grant under this section will carry out a national program to protect the information infrastructure of the United States against disruption. The program includes research and development to identify cybersecurity best practices, improve cybersecurity through long-term research, and fulfill required activities. Research and development activities under the grant must be conducted using funds provided by the grantee to qualified entities selected through competition. The grantee can also conduct research using up to 15 percent of the grant amount in any fiscal year. The grantee must provide funds for research and development activities to qualified entities selected through competition. They can use up to 15 percent of the grant amount in any fiscal year. Within 18 months of selection, the grantee must prepare a report with cybersecurity best practice recommendations, updating them every six months or more frequently if needed. The grantee must review current cybersecurity best practices from NIST and consult with various entities when making recommendations. The grantee must disseminate reports on cybersecurity best practices to government, private, and academic entities. Within two years, they must submit a report assessing the advisability of certain practices. The report will assess the advisability of requiring federal contractors and grantees to use cybersecurity best practices and provide recommendations for achieving widespread adoption of effective practices. It will also evaluate if such a requirement would impose undue burdens or inefficiencies on contractors and grantees. The report will evaluate the advisability of requiring federal contractors and grantees to use cybersecurity best practices, considering potential exceptions or limitations for specific types of contractors or grantees. The National Institute of Standards and Technology may permit the entity awarded the grant under this section to utilize grant competition and management systems. Specified bodies and officials involved include appropriate committees of Congress, the President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the interagency entity designated by the President. The entity awarded the grant can use the National Institute of Standards and Technology's systems for efficient administration. Rules and procedures will be established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, including ownership of intellectual property. The Institute will ensure activities are not supplanted. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will ensure that activities funded by the grant supplement, not replace, other efforts to protect the US information infrastructure. SEC. 3. APPROPRIATE CYBERSECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is required to submit a report within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, identifying cybersecurity best practices for federal departments and agencies to adopt over a 24-month period. Proposed demonstration projects for the adoption of these best practices are also included in the report. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will consult with relevant government departments, academic centers, and private sector experts in cybersecurity to update the report as needed. The President will initiate demonstration projects for implementing the cybersecurity best practices recommended in the report within 90 days of receiving it. The President will carry out demonstration projects based on the report's recommendations, with updates to be incorporated as needed. A report on the projects' progress will be submitted to Congress within nine months of their commencement. The assessment of cybersecurity best practices adoption by Federal Government departments and agencies under demonstration projects includes evaluating improvements in cybersecurity, impact on mission capabilities, and cost descriptions. The President shall implement a program for the adoption of appropriate cybersecurity best practices government-wide within six months of the report. Any recommendations received during the program development must be incorporated. The President must modify the cybersecurity program based on recommendations from specified bodies and officials, including Congress committees, the President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the interagency entity designated by the President. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House. \"Cybersecurity\" encompasses information assurance, disaster recovery, and privacy. A \"cybersecurity best practice\" is a method that effectively protects computer systems from harm. The curr_chunk discusses protecting network elements from various cyber attacks through appropriate cybersecurity best practices, which include customization for hardware and software, balancing security protection with cost considerations. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity measures that protect network elements from cyber attacks, considering the evolving nature of computer technology. Authorization of appropriations for the National Institute of Standards and Technology under this Act: $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2004 through 2007."
