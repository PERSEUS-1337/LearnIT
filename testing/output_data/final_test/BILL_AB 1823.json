    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges health disparities among socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, and regional groups in California, as highlighted in a 2016 report by the Public Policy Institute of California. African Americans and individuals with lower education levels have lower life expectancies, while certain regions and communities face significant health challenges. The ability to translate medical findings from research to practice relies on robust and diverse patient participation in clinical trials. Low participation rates and homogenous participant groups create uncertainties over the applicability of research findings. Ancillary costs like transportation, child care, and lodging can hinder diverse patient participation, with households making less than $50,000 annually being less likely to participate. This disparity threatens the ethical requirement that research benefits be made available equitably among all eligible individuals. California is home to 10 National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers for cancer clinical trials research, including institutions like University of California, Irvine, City of Hope, and Stanford Cancer Institute. Cancer is a significant cause of death in California, accounting for nearly one in four deaths. It is the second leading cause of death for Californians and the primary cause of death among Asian/Pacific Islanders in the state. African American Californians experience disproportionately higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality compared to other racial and ethnic groups. The California Dialogue on Cancer, established in 2002, recommends strategies to address barriers for medically underserved individuals in cancer trials and improve access to survivorship resources. The National Cancer Institute identifies financial and personal costs as barriers to participation in clinical trials. The Legislature aims to establish a program allowing donations from various stakeholders to support programs assisting patients in participating in cancer clinical trials, addressing concerns about inducements for healthcare services. The Legislature aims to establish a program to support clinical research participants with low access to health services or financial barriers, to participate in clinical trials. This program aims to eliminate barriers for all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status. The California Cancer Clinical Trials Program, established by the Board of Trustees, supports eligible cancer clinical trials in the state. The program is funded by a clinical trials fund and administered by the University of California. Program grant recipients receive support to carry out the program's purposes. The University of California is requested to establish an institute or office to administer the cancer clinical trials program. A board with at least five members will be appointed to represent institutions and individuals involved in eligible trials in California. Members of the board must have diverse backgrounds and expertise to address barriers to participation in clinical trials. The board for the cancer clinical trials program in California will consist of representatives from various research institutions, healthcare providers, foundations, and patient advocacy organizations. Board members must be interested in increasing access to clinical trials and be willing to solicit funds for this purpose. They will serve without compensation but can be reimbursed for necessary expenses. The program administrator can adjust administrative costs based on program size and funds received. The program administrator for the cancer clinical trials program in California can use up to 20% of funds for administrative costs, with the option to exceed this in the first year for program establishment. The university can participate as the program administrator, beneficiary, or both, and must publicize grant availability to eligible organizations. The university has the option to pursue necessary approvals before establishing a cancer clinical trials program and can choose not to participate or terminate the program if deemed unviable. The program administrator can solicit funds from various sources to administer the program and award grants, with only federal or private funds allowed for use. The university can use state funds for start-up costs of the program, but must be reimbursed from federal or private sources. All resources allocated to the program must be reimbursed before grants are distributed. Upon receiving $500,000 in funding, the program administrator will establish the Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program to increase patient access to cancer clinical trials in underserved communities. The board will determine criteria for awarding grants to research institutions, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations conducting eligible trials. The Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program aims to increase patient access to eligible cancer clinical trials through various activities such as patient navigator services, education, counseling, well-being services, and payment of ancillary costs for patients and caregivers. The Cancer Clinical Trials Grant Program covers expenses such as airfare, lodging, rental car, meals, and dependent child care for patients participating in clinical trials. Recipients must have experience in improving enrollment in trials, especially for underserved populations. Grantees must submit reports to ensure funds are used appropriately. The university may require the board to submit reports on funds collected and program evaluation. If funds are insufficient, the program may be terminated. If the fund does not reach $500,000 by January 1, 2021, or if administrative costs exceed 20%, the program may be dissolved. All remaining funds in the fund will be allocated to organizations described in Section 101994.5 before dissolution. The university can establish similar programs for clinical trials as defined in Title 42 of the United States Code."
