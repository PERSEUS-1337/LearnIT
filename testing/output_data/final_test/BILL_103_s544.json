The Federal Power Act is amended to allow the Commission to review and disallow costs associated with transactions between a public utility and an affiliated company for determining a just and reasonable rate.

There is a rebuttable presumption that such costs are just and reasonable. The Commission must give substantial deference to the allocation of charges among associate companies. The Federal Power Act allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allocate charges among associate companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, overriding any previous allocations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The new allocation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be effective after twelve months and binding on the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Multistate Utility Consumer Protection Act of 1994 overrides previous allocations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. It does not apply to costs incurred before July 15, 1994, or uncontested settlements approved before the enactment of the Act. The Act does not impact FERC Docket No. FA89-28 and exempts costs incurred and recovered before its enactment from Section 318(b) of the Federal Power Act. The Multistate Utility Consumer Protection Act of 1994 exempts costs incurred and recovered before its enactment from Section 318(b) of the Federal Power Act, specifically related to contracts with Windsor Coal Company or Central Ohio Coal Company approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission."
