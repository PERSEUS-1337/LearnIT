    "content": "The Act titled \"Low Income Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003\" regulates income tax return preparers and refund anticipation loan providers. The Act \"Low Income Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003\" defines an income tax return preparer as an individual who prepares at least 5 tax returns per year and excludes federally authorized tax practitioners. It also defines a refund anticipation loan provider as a person who lends money or other value to a taxpayer. The \"Low Income Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003\" defines an income tax return preparer as someone who prepares at least 5 tax returns annually and excludes federally authorized tax practitioners. It also defines a refund anticipation loan provider as a person who lends money or value to a taxpayer in anticipation of a Federal tax refund. The Secretary of the Treasury is referred to as the \"Secretary\" in the Act. Regulations require the registration of income tax return preparers and refund anticipation loan providers within 120 days of the Act's enactment, prohibiting the payment of tax refunds to these entities. The regulations for income tax return preparers and refund anticipation loan providers require registration without including registration numbers, no disciplinary actions allowed for applicants, and minimizing burden and cost on registrants. The regulations for income tax return preparers and refund anticipation loan providers include rules of conduct, guidance on fees and interest rates, renewal requirements, and fees. The Secretary may require reasonable fees for registration and renewal under regulations, with fees intended to reimburse administration costs. Section 6695 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to prohibit actions on a taxpayer's behalf by a non-registered person. Under the Low Income Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003, tax preparers and loan providers linked to tax refunds may face a $500 penalty for noncompliance. The Secretary will determine if registration requirements replace the need for tax return filings. Efforts will be made to reduce paperwork for tax preparers and loan providers. SEC. 3. IMPROVED SERVICES FOR TAXPAYERS. The Secretary will focus on electronic filing efforts to benefit taxpayers by reducing time and cost, improving services for low and moderate income taxpayers, providing tax software at low cost, and offering electronic filing for all taxpayers directly. A report must be submitted within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will conduct a study on expanding the volunteer income tax assistance program for low-income taxpayers and submit a report to Congress within 120 days. Tele-filing will be available for all taxpayers in 2003, and the Debt Indicator program will be terminated. The Secretary will establish a pilot program for mobile tax return filing offices with electronic filing capabilities in communities with a high incidence of taxpayers claiming the earned income tax credit. At least one office will be located on an Indian reservation. At least one mobile tax return filing office will be located on or near an Indian reservation. SEC. 4. Assistance program to improve access to federally insured financial institutions for taxpayers. Congress finds that approximately 40 million Americans are unbanked, with many relying on refund anticipation loans with high interest rates, some exceeding 2000 percent. This results in a significant portion of earned income tax credits being used to pay for tax assistance and loans from commercial tax preparers and national banks. Approximately 45 percent of earned income tax credit recipients pay for check cashing services, reducing EITC benefits by $130,000,000. Individuals with bank accounts can receive tax refunds faster without needing refund anticipation loans. Establishing a grant program aims to provide unbanked low- and moderate-income individuals access to mainstream financial services. Establish a grant program to provide unbanked low- and moderate-income taxpayers with tax preparation services, establish accounts at federally insured institutions, and offer financial education. The Secretary can award demonstration project grants to eligible entities for this purpose. Eligible entities include organizations exempt from section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The section defines eligible entities for a grant program, including federally insured depository institutions, state or local government agencies, community development financial institutions, Indian tribal organizations, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian organizations, labor organizations, and partnerships comprised of these entities. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as insured depository institution, insured credit union, community development financial institution, Alaska Native Corporation, and Native Hawaiian organization. These definitions are important for understanding the eligibility criteria for a grant program outlined in the prev_chunk. The curr_chunk defines \"Native Hawaiian organization\" as an organization serving and representing Native Hawaiians' interests and providing services to them. It also defines \"labor organization\" as an organization where employees participate to deal with employers on various work-related issues. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this section. The Secretary requires eligible entities to submit grant applications with specified information. Recipients are limited to using 6% of the grant for administrative costs. The Secretary must report on funded activities, amounts distributed, and results annually. $10,000,000 is authorized for the grant program, with additional funds if needed. The Secretary can establish regulations for the program. The Secretary can promulgate regulations for the grant program. SEC. 5. Matching grants to low-income taxpayer clinics for return preparation. New section added for return preparation clinics for low-income taxpayers. The Secretary may make grants for qualified return preparation clinics that assist low-income taxpayers with filing their Federal income tax returns. Qualified return preparation clinics assist low-income taxpayers with filing their Federal income tax returns. These clinics must ensure that at least 90 percent of the taxpayers they assist have incomes below 250 percent of the poverty level. The term 'clinic' includes clinical programs at eligible educational institutions and organizations described in section 501(c). The Secretary shall not allocate more than $10,000,000 per year to grants for qualified return preparation clinics, with rules similar to section 7526(c) applying. The amendments made by this section apply to grants for return preparation clinics for low-income taxpayers after the enactment of this Act."
