Shared equity mortgage modifications are proposed as alternatives to foreclosures, benefiting both homeowners and mortgage investors through pilot programs. The term \"covered mortgage\" refers to a mortgage secured by real property that is the primary or secondary residence of a homeowner and is greater than the appraised value of the property. The term \"covered mortgage\" refers to a mortgage secured by real property that is the primary or secondary residence of a homeowner and is greater than the appraised value of the property. The mortgage must be approved for participation in the pilot program, the homeowner must not be delinquent for fewer than 60 days or at risk of imminent default, must have a documented financial hardship preventing mortgage payments, and may be subject to discretion of relevant authorities. The term \"equity value of the real property\" is defined as the difference between the property's value at the time of sale or refinance and the initial mortgage amount, minus any transaction costs. If the equity value is negative, no payment is required. The term \"enterprise\" has the same meaning as in the previous context. The term \"enterprise\" has the same meaning as in the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. \"Homeowner\" refers to the mortgagor under a covered mortgage. \"Investor\" can be the mortgagee or trustee for an asset-backed security. A \"pilot program\" is established under subsection (b), and a \"shared equity mortgage modification\" is a modification of a covered mortgage according to subsection (c). The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Federal Housing Commissioner will establish pilot programs for shared equity mortgage modifications to increase investor returns compared to foreclosure. Shared equity mortgage modifications aim to reduce the loan-to-value ratio of a covered mortgage to 100 percent or less within 3 years. The shared equity mortgage modification program aims to reduce the loan-to-value ratio of a covered mortgage over 3 years by adjusting principal, interest rates, and periodic payments to ensure affordability for homeowners. The shared equity mortgage modification program allows homeowners to pay a percentage of the equity value of their property to the investor upon refinancing or selling, capped at twice the principal reduction achieved through the program. The cap is adjusted for inflation annually. The shared equity mortgage modification program allows homeowners to pay a percentage of the equity value of their property to the investor upon refinancing or selling, capped at twice the principal reduction achieved through the program. The cap is adjusted for inflation annually, and the investor can structure the equity-sharing interest to be transferrable for future sale to other investors, aiming to deliver maximal net present value by considering principal reduction and interest rate reductions. The shared equity mortgage modification program allows homeowners to pay a percentage of the equity value of their property to the investor upon refinancing or selling, capped at twice the principal reduction achieved through the program. The program factors in interest rate reductions, expected cost reductions, and the value of the equity sharing interest. The determination of the property value is done by an independent licensed appraiser. The value of real property securing a covered mortgage is determined by an independent licensed appraiser, paid for by the investor. Up to half of the appraisal cost can be added to the amount paid by the homeowner. The cost of an appraisal for refinancing or sale of real property must be reasonable and may be added to the amount paid by the homeowner. A second appraisal, at the expense of the investor, may be requested by a licensed appraiser independent of the investor. Each pilot program for shared equity mortgage modification must ensure that the sale price or claimed value at the time of refinancing reflects the fair market value of the property. Homeowners are ineligible for principal reduction if they are delinquent on more than 3 payments during any 1-year period after participating in the program. The Federal Housing Finance Agency requires servicers to participate in a pilot program offering shared equity mortgage modifications to homeowners with covered mortgages. Annual studies and reports on the program's results are to be conducted and submitted to Congress. The Federal Housing Finance Agency mandates a pilot program for shared equity mortgage modifications. Reports on the program's results are to be submitted to Congress annually, with data made publicly available."
