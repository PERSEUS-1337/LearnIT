    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhancing Military and Police Operations through Women's Engagement and Recruitment Act of 2016\". The United States National Action Plan On Women, Peace and Security emphasizes integrating women's perspectives into diplomatic, defense, and development efforts. Priorities include supporting women's participation in the security sector and increasing their involvement in training programs for foreign police, judicial, and military personnel. The United States promotes gender integration in partner nations' armed forces through various initiatives, emphasizing the unique roles of women in conflict prevention and response. Gender equality is a core element in policy development, strategy, budget planning, program implementation, and evaluation. The United States provides security sector assistance to foreign partners to professionalize their police and militaries, shape security sector policies, and promote human rights and the rule of law. This assistance includes funding for training programs for military forces, police, and other security forces. Women are underrepresented in security forces worldwide, with less than 1 percent in Pakistan, less than 5 percent in Bangladesh, and less than 7 percent in India. Female soldiers, as shown by US Female Engagement Teams in Afghanistan, can enhance operational effectiveness and engage with local populations that all-male units cannot. (7) Female military and police play a crucial role in providing security, as seen in Afghanistan where 13,000 females were recruited and trained for the 2014 elections. They conducted searches at checkpoints and polling stations, facilitating women's participation. (8) The IMET program, funded by the US Department of State, offers professional military training to foreign leaders, enhancing interoperability with US forces and building relationships among international military students. (9) IMET funding has been provided to 141 countries. United States international police training programs focused on women have been effective in increasing female participation. For example, in Lebanon, a Department of State-funded course helped increase the number of female police officers significantly. Security assistance for peacekeeping also enhances partner countries' capabilities and deployment support for peace operations. Studies show that having more female peacekeepers and personnel from countries with better gender equality records reduces allegations of sexual abuse. Female peacekeepers are effective in assisting female survivors of sexual violence, increasing reporting of abuse incidents, and encouraging recruitment of women in national police forces. Despite the importance of increasing women in peacekeeping operations, the United Nations reported a lack of progress as of February 2016. The Global Peace Operations Initiative, a US program, aims to increase female participation in UN peacekeeping missions. As of February 2016, women made up only 3% of military forces and 9% of police forces in peacekeeping missions. With US assistance, countries nearly doubled the number of female military peacekeepers in the last five years. The Global Peace Operations Initiative, with US assistance, doubled the number of deployed female military peacekeepers from 1,396 to 2,539. Women make up 4% of total military forces and 7% of formed police units in peace operations. The United States policy aims to address the shortage of women in foreign military and police forces by prioritizing their identification, engagement, support, recruitment, retention, and promotion. It also focuses on including women in security operations and expanding training opportunities for them. The Department of State, in coordination with the Department of Defense, aims to increase female participation in military training programs globally by doubling the number of women by September 30, 2019. This includes the International Military Education and Training program and the Anti-Terrorism Assistance programs. Additionally, there is a focus on increasing the involvement of women in peacekeeping operations. The Department of State, in coordination with partner countries, prioritizes the integration, training, and deployment of qualified female peacekeepers in peace operations. They also aim to increase the recruitment, retention, and leadership roles of female personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Additionally, there is a goal to double the number of qualified women deployed to peace operations within 5 years. The goal is to double the number of qualified women deployed to peace operations within 5 years. SEC. 7. LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\nThe Department of State must establish female participation requirements for police training programs, ensuring women make up at least 10% of nominees for U.S.-funded programs. The Department will prioritize increasing women's participation in program design and implementation.\n\nSEC. 8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION.\n\nThe Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and relevant Federal agencies will create a plan to monitor and evaluate programs under this Act.\n\nSEC. 9. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense will designate officials to brief congressional committees on training, diplomatic actions, guidelines for personnel engagement, progress towards targets, and addressing barriers to women's recruitment in security sector assistance. The appropriate congressional committees for United States security sector assistance include the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations, Armed Services, and Appropriations, as well as the House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Appropriations."
