    "content": "In November 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), with Islamist roots, won a majority in parliament and formed the first single-party government in Turkey in over a decade. Deputy leader Abdullah Gul initially served as prime minister before Recep Tayyip Erdogan took over in March 2003. Despite initial divisions within the AKP, the party has maintained its parliamentary majority and passed its legislative program. The AKP, led by Erdogan, is stable due to his strong personality and popularity with the grassroots. The party positions itself as center-right, rejecting the Islamist label and preferring to be known as \"conservative democrats.\" Erdogan emphasizes the importance of religion as a social value but believes politics should not be conducted through religion. The AKP, led by Erdogan, prioritizes beginning EU accession talks to reposition politically. EU reforms would promote equal freedoms for all believers, challenging AKP's more passionate Islamists. Erdogan's attempt to distance AKP from its Islamist roots is undermined by some party officials. The AKP's attempt to distance itself from its Islamist roots is challenged by party officials and Members of Parliament raising religio-political issues that clash with the secular establishment. Tensions arise over headscarves, which are banned in public buildings like parliament and universities, leading to discord with the military. In 2003, armed forces' commanders refused to attend a reception because the Speaker's wife wears a headscarf. In 2003, there were controversies surrounding the attendance of officials' wives at receptions, with President Sezer excluding AKP deputies' wives who wore headscarves. Erdogan avoided the issue, attending briefly to prevent tension. The European Court of Human Rights upheld Turkey's ban on headscarves in state schools to protect secularism. The AKP government in Turkey faced controversies regarding its alleged Islamist agenda, including support for Islamic organizations abroad and attempts to increase positions in the Directorate of Religious Affairs. Despite government promises to the IMF, Finance Minister denied plans for new appointments. Prime Ministers and Defense Minister expressed concerns about expelling soldiers labeled as fundamentalists from the armed forces. The Supreme Military Council (YAS) expelled soldiers labeled as fundamentalists, sparking debates on secular identity and education in Turkey. The AKP government's attempts to control the Higher Education Board and grant equal access to universities for graduates of religious vocational schools raised concerns about undermining the republic's principles. Military involvement in the debate raised worries about political stability. The military command raised concerns about political stability in Turkey and differences in civil-military relations compared to Europe. President Sezer vetoed bills related to education, citing concerns about the constitution. Erdogan's political decisions have been generally strategic, despite tensions with the armed forces. Erdogan has navigated political challenges with the Turkish armed forces, who have historically intervened in civilian governments. He accommodated Chief of Staff General Ozkok's request to delay civilian leadership of the National Security Council in 2004. Ozkok, a moderate figure, supports Turkey's EU ambitions and emphasizes the military's non-involvement in all public matters. (11) Ozkok supports Turkey's EU ambitions as part of Ataturk's vision for a modern, European state, despite potential conflicts with the armed forces and the current government. The imam hatip bill led to rare public criticism from the military. Erdogan and the AKP often clash with President Sezer, a staunch secularist who frequently uses his veto power. (12) Sezer's vetoes have delayed parts of the government program and blocked AKP appointees, but the party has placed them in non-presidential positions. (13) AKP won 41.6% of the vote in the 2004 municipal elections. In the March 28, 2004 municipal elections, AKP won 41.6% of the vote, surpassing its rivals. They won 57 out of 81 mayoral races, including in major metropolitan areas. AKP's victory was attributed to economic stability, EU membership pursuit, energetic campaigning by national leaders, and favorable media coverage. They also appealed to their Islamist base by selecting 80% of their mayoral candidates. AKP made significant gains in the 2004 municipal elections by winning 41.6% of the vote and securing 57 out of 81 mayoral races. They appealed to their Islamist base by selecting 80% of their mayoral candidates from the National View movement. The opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) failed to make electoral headway, receiving only 18.2% of the vote and losing support from the working class and middle class voters. The CHP party failed to attract working class and middle-class voters, becoming known as a party of secularists, the upper middle class, and Alevis. CHP leader Deniz Baykal maintained his position through political maneuvering rather than policy achievements. The AKP won 37% of the vote in the southeast, showing that conservatism trumped Kurdish nationalism. Despite this, the opposition did not see a decline, with the True Path Party and Nationalist Action Party making gains in the 2004 elections. The far-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP) and True Path Party made gains in the 2004 elections due to their dissent from AKP's compromises on Cyprus. Turkey recovered from the severe recession of 2000-2001, meeting economic targets for 2003 with a 5.9% GNP growth rate, inflation below 18.4%, and a 6.5% budget surplus. Targets for 2004 are expected to be met with a 12.4% GNP growth rate and 9.5% inflation rate. The growth rate for the first quarter of 2004 was 12.4%, with inflation falling to 9.5%. IMF reviews of Turkey's economic performance have been positive, but challenges persist such as high unemployment and underemployment. The goal of earning $4 billion from privatization was not met in 2003, with only $2.2 billion gained. Government expectations of $3 billion in revenues from privatization in 2004 may be unrealistic. The sale of Turkish Oil Refinery Corporation (TUPRAS) was halted, and other privatization efforts have faced delays. Corruption scandals involving the Uzan family have also emerged. The Uzan family corruption scandals have affected sales to Western investors. Despite privatization difficulties, the government increased pension payments and the minimum wage, prompting IMF budget cuts and tax revenue increases. Turkey plans to sign a new three-year stand-by agreement with the IMF. Public debt is high at 75% of GDP. IMF encourages tax administration improvements and social security reforms to boost policy credibility. Turkey's high public debt, standing at 75% of GDP, is a concern due to much of it being short-term and rolled over at fluctuating interest rates. The IMF demands a 6.5% budget surplus to pay down the debt, especially the portion with high interest rates. Foreign investment in Turkey is low due to bureaucratic hurdles, lack of transparency, and rule of law issues. The country ranks poorly on corruption perception indexes, prompting the passing of a new foreign investment law in 2003 to attract foreign investors. The Turkish parliament passed a new foreign investment law in 2003 to attract foreign investors and ease company establishment procedures. Investors are likely to wait and see how the law is implemented before investing in Turkey. The government believes that economic stability from reform programs and potential EU accession talks in 2005 will also attract more investors. Terrorism in Turkey has historically been linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which fought for autonomy or independence from 1984-1999. The PKK has weakened since its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured in 1999. The PKK transformed into KADEK and then KONGRA-GEL, claiming to be a political organization for Kurds in Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. The military wing, People's Defense Forces, remained active. The U.S. State Department still considers them terrorist organizations. The PKK/KADEK/KONGRA-GEL, a terrorist organization, was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Department on January 13, 2004. Despite allegations of 4,000 PKK members in northern Iraq, the group's strength may be lower or different. KONGRA-GEL experienced a schism in 2004, potentially affecting its activities. Support for the Union of Democratic Forces in the March 2004 elections indicated a decline in PKK's influence. The PKK/KADEK/KONGRA-GEL terrorist organization ended a five-year cease-fire in 2004, leading to an upsurge in incidents in southeast Turkey. Turkish Kurds in the region, benefiting from reforms, do not want a return to war. Former Turkish Kurdish parliamentarians called for the cease-fire to continue, but the Turkish military still views the PKK as a major threat. In November 2003, Turkish terrorists linked to Al Qaeda carried out suicide bombings in Istanbul, targeting synagogues, the British consulate, and an HSBC office. The attacks resulted in 62 deaths and over 700 injuries. The Turkish government accused the terrorists of having connections to Al Qaeda, with some being former members of extremist groups like IBDA-C and Hezbollah. Former members of domestic fundamentalist terror groups, trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 1990s, returned to Turkey as \"sleepers.\" Some had met Al Qaeda leaders Ayman al Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden. The attacks in Istanbul showed increased operational capabilities and financial resources of domestic terror groups, suggesting foreign assistance with intelligence, explosives, and finances. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey noted the sophistication and timing of the attacks were consistent with foreign involvement. The attacks in Istanbul were consistent with previous Al Qaeda patterns. Suspects captured at the Iranian border and handed over by the Syrian government were linked to the bombings. A group claiming to be Al Qaeda took responsibility for the attacks. The trial of 69 men connected to the bombings was postponed due to the absence of state security courts. The indictment alleged direct contacts with Osama bin Laden and training at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. The Istanbul bombings were linked to Al Qaeda, with suspects trained in Afghanistan and receiving funds from the organization. A Masonic lodge was targeted, with ties to Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LT) also suspected. Arrests were made in Bursa and Istanbul, with individuals charged for plotting a bomb attack at the NATO summit. Islamist radicals viewed the Masons as supporters of the United States and Israel. In June, more Al Ansar suspects were detained in Istanbul with bomb-making materials, linked to an illegal organization. Prime Minister Erdogan denied the association of Islam with terrorism, stating it is a perversion detached from beliefs. The November 2003 Istanbul bombings targeted Jews, Britain, and possibly Turkey due to its secular identity and ties to the West. The AKP needed to identify and focus on Islamist terrorists to combat terrorism effectively. On June 24, 2004, bombings in Istanbul and Ankara killed four and injured over 20, with various groups claiming responsibility including a Marxist-Leninist group, Al Qaeda-linked Abu Hafs al Masri Brigades, and the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks. Police suspect Kurdish involvement. Turkey's efforts to join the EU include passing reforms to align with EU standards, such as legalizing Kurdish broadcasting and education, abolishing the death penalty, and improving human rights. The legislative package passed in August 2003 aimed to address EU concerns about civilian control over the military in Turkey. It reduced the power of the National Security Council (MGK), transforming it into an advisory board with civilian oversight. The budget for the MGK was cut by 60% for FY2004, and subsequent reforms in May 2004 removed military influence from national broadcasting. The May 2004 reforms in Turkey removed military designees from national broadcasting and higher education boards, potentially transforming the political system. New laws aimed to improve cultural rights and included a limited amnesty for prisoners, excluding PKK leaders. The PKK denounced the law and demanded total amnesty, but it mainly benefitted imprisoned members of other domestic terror groups. The European Commission and Council highlighted Turkey's progress towards EU membership but noted shortcomings in political criteria and reforms. DHKP-C made more amnesty applications than PKK members. Kurdish MPs, including Leyla Zana, were released pending appeal after serving time for PKK membership. Foreign Minister Gul met them post-release. EU called for further efforts in judiciary independence, freedom of expression, and civil-military relations alignment. The European Commission and Council praised Turkey's progress towards EU membership but noted political criteria and reform shortcomings. Prime Minister Erdogan tasked ministers to implement reforms, with a COE report acknowledging human rights progress but highlighting remaining deficiencies. The European Parliament approved a report praising the AKP government's political will in passing reforms, emphasizing the need for effective implementation. The EP report criticized Turkey's military involvement in politics and human rights deficiencies, suggesting a new constitution. Erdogan advocated for Turkey's EU accession, highlighting the benefits of Islamic culture reconciling with democracy for the EU's image. Turkey's ability to address reform implementation and European concerns about its membership remains uncertain. Many Europeans have qualms about Turkey's EU membership due to issues with integrating Muslim immigrants and concerns about identity. They doubt Turkey's European compatibility and fear its potential political influence if admitted. The European Commission will consult member countries before issuing a progress report in October 2004. Cyprus settlement is not a requirement for EU membership. The Cyprus settlement is crucial for Turkey's EU membership. Without it, Greece and Cyprus may veto Turkey's accession. However, Greece supports starting accession talks, and Cyprus won't veto if there is consensus among other EU members. The absence of a settlement could hinder Turkey's EU aspirations. Cyprus has been divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots since 1974. Turkish intervention in Cyprus, divided between Turkish and Greek Cypriots since 1974. UN efforts to reunify the island, with a new settlement plan presented by Kofi Annan in 2002. Erdogan accepted the plan for further negotiations, emphasizing the need for a solution. Joint reassessment of policy with Turkish Cypriots after pro-settlement forces came to power in northern Cyprus in 2003. Parliamentary elections in northern Cyprus brought pro-settlement forces to power. Erdogan secured support for a new initiative from the National Security Council. Talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders on a Cyprus settlement resumed in mid-February. The Greek Cypriot President and Turkish Cypriot leader failed to agree on revising Annan's plan. Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat negotiated for the Turkish Cypriots. Turkey accepted the revised plan presented by Annan. The Plan was put to referenda on the island, with Greek Cypriots rejecting it and Turkish Cypriots accepting it. Cyprus entered the EU on May 1, despite the failed referendum. Blame for the failure shifted to the Greek Cypriot leadership. EU no longer views a Cyprus settlement as a precondition for negotiations with Turkey. The Turkish parliament's refusal to authorize the deployment of U.S. forces for opening a northern front against Iraq in 2003 changed the U.S. view of Turkey as a strategic partner. The vote, seen as a statement of national independence, shook the AKP government and strained the bilateral relationship. Various reasons were cited for the vote, including concerns about U.S. arrogance and media portrayals of Turkish officials. The economic costs of the Iraq war for Turkey were minor and transitory. Bilateral trade between Turkey and Iraq is returning to pre-war levels. Turkey's tourism and export sectors recovered quickly, and there was no refugee crisis. Iraqi Kurds deferred their dream of independence to participate in a federal Iraqi state and did not take over oil facilities in the north. After the war began, U.S. officials cautioned Turkey against sending more forces into northern Iraq, where about 5,000 Turkish troops have been posted to act against PKK remnants and safe havens. There have been tensions between the U.S. and Turkish militaries, with incidents involving the arrest of Turkish soldiers and special forces soldiers by U.S. troops in northern Iraq. The U.S. took action against Turkey for allegedly planning to assassinate the Kurdish governor of Kirkuk and supporting Turkomen. The incident led to outrage in Turkey, requiring involvement from Prime Minister Erdogan and Vice President Cheney. After a joint military investigation, both sides expressed regret. To appease Turkey, the U.S. agreed to remove PKK guerrillas from northern Iraq, but this promise has not been fulfilled. Turkish troops remain in the north, and bilateral military ties have not recovered. The Turkish government considered sending peacekeeping troops to Iraq at the request of the U.S. Foreign Minister Gul emphasized the peacekeeping, humanitarian, and developmental aspects of sending troops to Iraq, while Chief of Staff General Ozkok supported the mission to prevent instability. U.S.-Turkish negotiations focused on command, location, and supply routes for Turkish troops, with the PKK presence in northern Iraq being a key topic. Despite U.S. commitment to deal with the PKK, 65% of the Turkish public opposed sending troops to Iraq. The bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 further fueled opposition. U.S. officials lobbied for Turkish deployment, but did not press for a rapid decision as openly as before. On October 7, the Turkish parliament approved sending troops to Iraq for one year. The motion emphasized clearing out PKK-KADEK elements and preventing Iraq from becoming a terrorist asylum. Turkey stressed the importance of Iraqi territorial integrity and national unity, as well as establishing a new democratic Iraq. The Turkish army would also focus on humanitarian missions. The Turkish army aimed to improve humanitarian aid and economic structure in addition to security and stability missions. Iraqi opposition to Turkish military presence stemmed from fears of undermining autonomy, political agendas, and historical tensions. Iraqi Kurds and Shi'a resisted Turkish troops, citing concerns of occupation and control over oil-rich areas. The Iraqi Governing Council opposed Turkish troops, with U.S. authorities reportedly intervening. The Iraqi Governing Council opposed Turkish troops, with U.S. authorities preventing its release. Analysts warned of dangers in Iraq and doubted U.S. promises to act against the PKK. Turkish officials sought to discount IGC views but were discouraged by the lack of U.S. influence. Events escalated with a suicide bombing at the Turkish Embassy in Baghdad. On October 14, a suicide bombing at the Turkish Embassy in Baghdad wounded about 15. Despite initial authorization, Turkey decided not to deploy troops into Iraq due to doubts about the situation. Turkish officials openly criticized the United States for incompetence in handling the matter. Foreign Minister Gul contacted Secretary of State Powell to discuss Turkey's contribution to Iraq. The Turkish government decided not to deploy troops to Iraq due to doubts about the situation. Despite initial authorization, they criticized the United States for incompetence. Turkey pledged $50 million in aid for Iraq and provides electricity, water, and fuel. They aim to export over $1.6 billion in goods to Iraq in 2004. The Turkish government aims to export over $1.6 billion in goods to Iraq in 2004, but this goal is threatened by terrorists who have targeted Turkish truck drivers in Iraq. In response, the Turkish trucking association has halted deliveries to U.S. forces in Iraq. Despite this, the Turkish government is determined to continue trading with Iraq and has taken measures to minimize risks. Ankara granted a concession to the U.S. by allowing the use of Incirlik Air Base for troop rotations from Iraq. There has been no U.S. military action against PKK/KADEK/KONGRA-GEL in northern Iraq. The U.S. is considering various approaches to address the PKK/KADEK/KONGRA-GEL threat in northern Iraq, including diplomatic, law enforcement, financial, and military measures if necessary. Turkish officials express disappointment in U.S. efforts and insist on eradicating the PKK before withdrawing troops from northern Iraq. President Bush assured Prime Minister during a meeting at the White House in January 2004. During a meeting at the White House in January 2004, President Bush assured Prime Minister Erdogan of the United States' ambition for a peaceful, democratic, and territorially intact Iraq. However, concerns arose as discussions did not cover Iraq's governmental structure, Kirkuk, oil revenues, or the Turkomen. Ankara supported the transfer of political sovereignty to Iraqis and NATO's decision to train Iraq's security forces but opposed a federation based on ethnic or religious identity. Turkey opposes a federation based on ethnic or religious identity in Iraq, expressing concerns about potential divisions in the future. Ambassador Osman Koruturk stated that Turkey would not oppose Kurdish status in an Iraqi constitution as long as it respects Iraq's territorial integrity. Turkey is particularly sensitive about Kirkuk, with Foreign Minister Gul warning against changing the city's demographic situation. Tensions persist as Ankara aims to limit Kurdish sovereignty in a future federal structure to protect its national interests. Turkish-Israeli relations are cooling due to various reasons, including the fading Oslo peace process and the AKP government's shift towards better relations with Arab and Muslim countries. Ankara communicates its reservations through dialogue with Kurdish leaders and Iraqi officials to protect its national interests. Turkish-Israeli relations are deteriorating due to Israel's actions against Palestinians and its proposed disengagement from Gaza. Criticism of Israel in Turkey is not limited to Islamists, with a majority of Turks expressing a lack of interest in cooperating with Israel. Turks also share common interests with Iran and Syria in opposing Kurdish actions. Turkey's relations with Israel are deteriorating due to Israel's actions against Palestinians and its proposed disengagement from Gaza. Turkey shares common interests with Iran and Syria in opposing a Kurdish state in northern Iraq, as all three fear the potential impact on their own Kurdish populations. Meanwhile, Turkey is strengthening ties with Iran by conducting operations against the PKK in border regions. Bilateral trade and high-level visits between Turkey and its neighbors are increasing, contrasting with Turkey's growing suspicions about Israel's intentions in northern Iraq. Turkey's suspicions about Israel's intentions in northern Iraq have increased. Reports suggest Israel aims for a decentralized Iraq with Kurdish help, while Turkey seeks a strong central government to curb Kurdish nationalism. Media reports, including a controversial article by Seymour Hersh, claim Israeli involvement in training Kurdish militias and covert operations in the region. Turkish newspapers allege Israeli Kurds are buying land with Mossad's assistance, posing a threat to Turkomen. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom has addressed these concerns. Turkey's suspicions about Israel's intentions in northern Iraq have increased, with reports suggesting Israeli involvement in training Kurdish militias and covert operations. Turkish newspapers allege Israeli Kurds are buying land with Mossad's assistance, posing a threat to Turkomen. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom denied these claims, but they are not widely believed in Turkey. Turkey may be aligning its foreign policies with major EU members to gain accession talks, appealing to Europeans critical of Israeli conduct towards Palestinians. Iran may appeal to Europeans concerned about instability along Turkey's borders. Prime Minister Erdogan criticized Israel for the assassination of Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmed Yassin, labeling it as \"state terrorism.\" Erdogan questioned Israel's actions, offered to mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, and emphasized the importance of upholding international law.

Israel continues to upgrade Turkey's weapons systems, and a water purchase agreement was signed in 2004. However, some agreements, such as Israeli participation in the Southeast Anatolia Project, have not been implemented yet. Despite tensions, Turkey's relations with Israel remain positive. Bilateral trade is valued at $1.7 billion annually, with Israel upgrading Turkey's weapons systems. Some agreements, like Israeli participation in the Southeast Anatolia Project, have not been implemented due to financial constraints. In July, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister visited Turkey to mend relations, reassuring Israel's interest in a unified Iraq and denying any involvement in setting up a Kurdish state. Turkey's strategic importance to the United States is highlighted by its proximity to crisis areas in the Middle East, Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Balkans. Despite difficulties in the relationship, Turkey remains a key ally, hosting U.S. and allied planes at Incirlik Air Base for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gul reiterated Turkey's offer to contribute to the Arab-Israeli peace process but stated he had no plans to visit Israel, reflecting the country's stance similar to the U.S. position. Turkey's strategic importance to the United States is highlighted by its proximity to crisis areas in the Middle East, Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Balkans. Despite difficulties in the relationship, Turkey remains a key ally, hosting U.S. and allied planes at Incirlik Air Base for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States has utilized Turkish ports, overland routes, and airspace for resupplying coalition forces in Iraq, as well as for reconstruction efforts. NATO's southern air command headquarters was moved from Naples to Izmir, indicating NATO's increasing focus on the east. Turkey's role as a transit route for energy resources is being realized with the construction of the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and a gas pipeline from Azerbaijan. The completion of the oil pipeline from Iraq to Turkey is crucial for Iraq's economy, despite sabotage in Iraq. Turkey cooperates closely with the US in counterterrorism efforts, leading to arrests of Al Qaeda operatives. Turkey's experienced army has participated in peacekeeping missions worldwide, including leading ISAF in Afghanistan. Turkey suffered casualties in Afghanistan, including soldiers and civilian workers being kidnapped. Turkey reduced its forces in Afghanistan after suffering casualties, with only 161 soldiers remaining as of June 15, 2004. Former Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin became NATO's Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan in November 2003. Turkey dispatched helicopters and personnel to assist ISAF in May 2004. Deputy Chief of Staff General Ilker Basbug mentioned the possibility of Turkey commanding ISAF again from February to August 2005. Turkey also participates in various international military initiatives and provides NATO Partnership for Peace training. Additionally, Turkey serves as a democratic Muslim country, aligning with US efforts to promote democratization in the Muslim world. Turkish officials align with US efforts to promote democratization in the Muslim world. Foreign Minister Gul emphasized good governance, transparency, and gender equality at a conference in Teheran. Prime Minister Erdogan supported the Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative at the G-8 Summit. Turkish officials stress that reforms should be internally driven and tailored to each country's needs and pace. Turkish officials support US democratization efforts in the Muslim world, emphasizing internal reforms tailored to each country's needs. President Sezer highlighted Turkey's secularism to President Bush, stating that religion is separate from state affairs. Gul acknowledged that Turkish reforms show integration of Islam and modernism, rejecting the idea of Turkey as a model for Islamic countries. President Bush praised Turkey as an example of a Muslim country embracing democracy and the rule of law. However, some doubt the sincerity of the AKP's commitment to democracy, fearing a transformation into an Islamic republic. Opposition to the war in Iraq and US actions against Turkish soldiers have led to an unfavorable image of the United States in Turkey. According to polls conducted in 2003 and 2004, a majority of Turks had unfavorable views of the United States, with many seeing it as a danger to the world and unjustified in its military intervention in Iraq. Only a small percentage desired to be close to the United States, while a significant portion supported resistance and attacks against US forces in Iraq. Turkish nationalists on both the far-right and leftist sides promote antipathy towards US policies. The Turkish government does not actively counter anti-American sentiments promoted by nationalist groups. Despite efforts to emphasize the importance of the U.S.-Turkish relationship in the United States, this message is not conveyed effectively in the Turkish press. Foreign Minister Gul even thanked those who protested against President Bush, suggesting a lack of government response to anti-Americanism at home. This has raised concerns about the sincerity of the AKP government towards the United States. U.S.-Turkish trade relations have not progressed as planned since 2002. A proposed initiative to establish qualifying industrial zones in Turkey, similar to the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement, has not materialized. Legislation in the 107th Congress aimed to exclude Turkish textiles and apparel from the program, disappointing Turks who wanted textiles included. Turkish officials were reminded that global textile quotas would end in 2005. In April 2004, there was a shift in Turkey's stance on the qualifying industrial zones. State Minister Kursad Tuzmen acknowledged a shift in Turkey's perspective on Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZs), indicating a willingness to focus on high-tech products instead of textiles. A U.S.-Turkey Economic Partnership Commission, led by officials from both countries, discussed various trade-related issues. Following the 9/11 attacks, Turkey received financial assistance from the U.S., including $20 million in Foreign Military Financing and $200 million in Economic Support. The Administration provided Turkey with $200 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) and $28 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to address financial difficulties caused by economic crises and support their leadership in ISAF. Additional funds were requested and appropriated in subsequent fiscal years. Turkey was also allocated $1 billion in ESF to support direct loans or loan guarantees as part of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act. The Conference Report, H.Rept.108-76, provided $1 billion for Turkey until September 30, 2005. Funds may not be available if Turkey does not cooperate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The President will determine terms for assistance, considering Turkey's reforms. A loan agreement signed in 2003 has a 10-year maturity with a four-year grace period. Funds may be disbursed in four installments over 18 months, but none have been disbursed yet. Minister of State Babacan says they are not needed, while Prime Minister Erdogan suggests otherwise. For FY2004 and FY2005, the Administration requested funds for Turkey, with reductions in assistance proposed for FY2005 due to unexpended funds from previous appropriations. Erdogan suggests political conditions are hindering fund disbursement, while Babacan states the funds are not needed. H.R.4818, Sec. 578 would prohibit Turkey from using funds to lobby against H.Res. 193 reaffirming support for the Genocide Convention. The Administration opposes the measure, stating existing laws already prohibit the use of U.S. aid for lobbying. House leaders plan to remove the provision, emphasizing Turkey's importance as a reliable ally."
