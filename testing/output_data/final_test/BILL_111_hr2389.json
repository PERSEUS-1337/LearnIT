The Act establishes registries for members and former members of the Armed Forces exposed to chemical hazards, requiring the Secretary of Defense to register and collect information on those exposed in the line of duty. The Secretary must notify and inform members or former members of the Armed Forces exposed to hazards, including notifying commanding officers and the Adjutant General of the State for National Guard members. Additionally, the Secretary must provide examinations to those exposed within 30 days of awareness and annually thereafter. The Secretary must provide exposed members with physical and medical examinations, consultation, counseling, and documentation of exposure in their medical records. The term \"occupational and environmental health chemical hazard of particular concern\" is defined as a hazard determined by the Secretary of Defense to be of particular concern based on exposure guidelines. The January 2002 Chemical Exposure Guidelines for Deployed Military Personnel include standards from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for assessing chemical hazards during deployments. Scientific review of incidents of exposure to occupational and environmental health chemical hazards with health consequences. The Secretary of Defense aims to make an agreement with the Institute of Medicine to review scientific evidence for incidents of exposure to health hazards among Armed Forces members. This review includes summarizing evidence and assessing its strength. The Institute of Medicine will review incidents of exposure to health hazards among Armed Forces members to determine if there is a statistical association with acute and long-term health consequences, considering the strength of scientific evidence and appropriate research methods. The Institute of Medicine will review exposure incidents among Armed Forces members to assess if there is a link with health consequences, considering scientific evidence and research methods. Recommendations for additional studies on occupational and environmental health hazards will be made to address scientific uncertainties. The Institute of Medicine will consider scientific information and the value of potential additional studies in making recommendations. They are required to periodically review new evidence and base their determinations on these reviews. Reports will be submitted to Congress. The Institute of Medicine will submit reports to Congress every 2 years, including determinations, discussions, and recommendations based on scientific information and new evidence. The Institute of Medicine will submit reports to Congress every 2 years, including determinations, discussions, and recommendations based on scientific information and new evidence. The agreement under subsection (a) requires the Institute of Medicine to submit a report to the Secretary of Defense within 30 days of making any conclusive determination regarding exposure studied under subsection (b). The Secretary of Defense must notify members and former members of the Armed Forces listed in a registry for exposure to specific chemical hazards of any conclusive determinations made under subsection (c)(1). The agreement under this section is limited by available appropriations and will cease to be effective 10 years after the Institute of Medicine submits the first report to the Secretary of Defense. If an agreement cannot be reached with the Institute of Medicine, the Secretary of Defense will seek an alternative contract with a scientific organization. The Secretary will seek an agreement with a non-government, non-profit scientific organization with expertise similar to the Institute of Medicine. If an agreement is reached, references to the Institute of Medicine in this section will be replaced with the new organization. Definitions include the appropriate committees of Congress. The term \"occupational and environmental health chemical hazard of particular concern\" refers to hazards identified by the Secretary of Defense as significant after considering exposure guidelines and standards. The curr_chunk discusses military exposure guidelines for assessing field exposures to occupational and environmental health chemical hazards during deployments, including standards from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Revision in authorities for provision of health care for certain veterans exposed to occupational and environmental health chemical hazards. Revision in authorities for provision of health care for certain veterans exposed to occupational and environmental health chemical hazards. Amendment to Section 1710(e) of title 38, United States Code, allows veterans exposed to specific chemical hazards in the line of duty to be eligible for hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for any disability, even without conclusive medical evidence linking the disability to the exposure. The guidelines issued by the Under Secretary for Health pertain to health effects resulting from exposure to occupational and environmental health chemical hazards. The term 'occupational and environmental health chemical hazard of particular concern' refers to specific hazards identified by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Defense determines specific military exposure guidelines and occupational/environmental health chemical standards for assessing hazards during deployments. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration updates chemical exposure standards. A technical amendment is made to a specific section of the title."
