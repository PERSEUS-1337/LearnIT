    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Water Infrastructure Revitalization Act\" and defines terms like \"Secretary\" and \"State\". The Act establishes a program. The Secretary will establish a program to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal interests in the State, offering design and construction aid for water-related infrastructure projects like wastewater treatment, water supply, environmental restoration, and surface water protection. Assistance is contingent on projects being publicly owned, and a local cooperation agreement must be in place before assistance is provided. The Secretary will enter into a local cooperation agreement with a non-Federal interest for the design and construction of water-related infrastructure projects. The agreement must include the development of a facilities or resource protection plan and the establishment of legal and institutional structures. The Federal government will cover 75 percent of project costs under local cooperation agreements for water-related infrastructure projects, which can be in the form of grants or reimbursements. The non-Federal interest can receive credit for up to 6 percent of total construction costs for design work completed before the agreement. The non-Federal interest can receive credit for interest, land, easements, and rights-of-way towards the project costs under a local cooperation agreement with the Secretary. The non-Federal share of project costs under this Act can be reduced based on water rate impacts for local cost share, using national affordability criteria. The non-Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for projects under this Act shall be 100 percent, and the average affordability rates in the project area will determine the local share of project costs for multicounty projects. This section does not affect the applicability of other Federal and State laws. Authorization of $60,000,000 for projects under this section from fiscal year 2005 onwards, with no impact on other laws."
