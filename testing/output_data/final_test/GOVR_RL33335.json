    "content": "Starting in the 1990s, criminal organizations expanded globally due to the end of the Cold War and globalization. They took advantage of weakened government institutions, open borders, and ethnic conflicts. Crime networks exploited trade, technology, and international travel. International crime is hard to measure but is estimated to make up 2-5% of global GDP. Transnational organized crime thrives in countries with weak law enforcement and limited economic opportunities. Farmers often resort to drug cultivation. Transnational organized crime is fueled by weak government institutions and limited economic opportunities, leading to drug cultivation and human trafficking. Criminal organizations collaborate with terrorists, posing a threat to global security. There is no universal definition of transnational crime, but it is believed to originate in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, the former Soviet Union, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Transnational organized crime involves offenses spanning multiple countries, with varying structures and operations. The United Nations defines organized crime groups as three or more individuals working together to commit serious crimes for financial gain. Traditional crime organizations differ from modern networks in their hierarchical structure and continuous operation. Organized crime groups can have hierarchical or decentralized structures, with traditional groups often aligned with states for contracts and services. In contrast, modern networks thrive on weak governance and are less likely to profit from state contracts. Some top officials, like Vladimiro Montesinos of Peru, have been involved in major international criminal operations. Organized crime and terrorism can sometimes overlap in their operations, with both groups using similar tactics such as kidnapping and drug dealing. While criminals are driven by financial gain, terrorists are motivated by political or religious goals. However, distinguishing between the two groups' motives can be challenging, as terrorists are increasingly funding their activities through criminal means. For example, the funding for the March 2003 Madrid train attacks came from drug dealing, and some crime bosses have been known to support terrorist activities. Some foreign terrorist organizations engage in \"narco-terrorism,\" using drug trafficking to fund their activities. The term was first used in the 1980s to describe tactics by Shining Path rebels in Peru. Narco-terrorism is considered a subset of terrorism by the DEA. Narco-terrorism involves groups or individuals participating in drug-related activities to fund terrorism. The term is considered broad and can apply to various groups, from guerrilla organizations like FARC to small terrorist cells. The U.S. government assesses global criminal activities, including narco-terrorism, through the International Crime Threat Assessment. The largest international crime threats, according to the National Security Council (NSC) assessment, include smuggling of nuclear materials, drug trafficking, trafficking in persons, intellectual property crimes, and money laundering. Experts are concerned that organized criminals may assist terrorists in acquiring weapons of mass destruction, with the most menacing threat being terrorists developing and using a nuclear bomb. The security of nuclear material in regions like the former Soviet Union has been criticized as lax, leading to efforts by the State Department to prevent former Soviet scientists from being bribed by criminal networks. The risk of nuclear smuggling was highlighted in October 2003. The illicit drug trade is valued at $500 to $900 billion worldwide, with cocaine and heroin trafficking being the most profitable criminal activities. Trafficking in persons generates $9.5 billion annually, with an estimated 600,000 victims. Human trafficking is a significant issue, with an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 people trafficked across international borders annually. In the United States, 14,500 to 17,500 people are trafficked each year, mainly from Southeast Asia and the former Soviet Union. Human smuggling, where migrants pay to cross borders, is different from trafficking. There are concerns that human smugglers may assist terrorists in entering countries. Additionally, intellectual property violations distort international trade, with counterfeit goods trade growing faster than legitimate trade. U.S. businesses estimate that counterfeiting costs them between $200 and $250 billion annually. In the 1990s, U.S. businesses estimated that counterfeiting costs them between $200 and $250 billion per year in lost sales. In China, piracy levels in many sectors are around 90 percent. Criminal organizations hide their illegal activities by investing profits in legitimate financial institutions and engaging in bulk cash smuggling. Money laundering is valued at two to five percent of world GDP. The International Crime Control Strategy (ICCS) was created in response to Presidential Decision Directive 42 (PDD-42) and consists of eight broad goals. The International Crime Control Strategy (ICCS) was established in October 1995 with eight goals to integrate federal response to international crime. A Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) within the National Security Council (NSC) was formed in April 2001 to coordinate efforts related to transnational crime. Leading federal agencies like Justice, State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Defense, and Commerce run programs to combat transnational organized crime. The U.S. response to nuclear smuggling involves a \"layered defense\" strategy led by the State Department, with support from agencies like Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and Commerce. The Proliferation Security Initiative, coordinated by the State and Defense Departments, allows the U.S. and its allies to search for nuclear material on planes and ships. The U.S. response to nuclear smuggling involves programs managed by various agencies like DOD, State Department, and DOE to secure nuclear material and prevent proliferation. The FY2007 budget requests $1.12 billion for nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to Russia and former Soviet states. The FY2007 budget includes funding for DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction programs, Energy Department WMD threat-reduction efforts, and State Department funding for drug trafficking programs. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs advises on combating international narcotics and crime, with coordination from other agencies like Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense. U.S. counternarcotics efforts abroad focus on crop eradication and narcotics interdiction. The State Department, along with other agencies, supports foreign countries in eradicating crops and managing the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) with significant funding. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Justice Department officials work together to combat narcotics through extradition and cooperation with foreign governments. State Department leads interagency efforts against trafficking in persons. The State Department leads interagency efforts against trafficking in persons, with key roles played by other agencies like the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Labor. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 provide key anti-trafficking provisions and aim to assist foreign trafficking victims in the United States. The United States addresses the needs of child victims of trafficking and develops anti-trafficking programs in post-conflict situations and foreign humanitarian emergencies. It authorizes funding to combat human trafficking and leads efforts to combat intellectual property violations through the USTR. The USTR manages tariff preference programs and anti-piracy initiatives through international agreements, often involving the WTO. The USTR can initiate dispute settlement proceedings through the WTO against foreign governments. The Treasury Department leads U.S. anti-money laundering efforts, supported by agencies like the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. The Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) safeguards financial systems through various methods, including financial sanctions and law enforcement support. FinCEN and other Treasury affiliates assist in international financial crime investigations and provide global money laundering analyses. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) works with 32 foreign government institutions to improve international money laundering standards. The Justice Department's Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section guides agencies on money laundering investigations. The Criminal Division's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS) within the Justice Department provides prosecutors for transnational crime investigations. OCRS prosecutors collaborate with U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies to facilitate information flow and counsel on timing and strategy. The FBI Organized Crime program places Special Agents in domestic field offices to investigate criminal organizations within their jurisdiction. Joint task forces composed of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials allow the FBI to pool additional resources to combat organized crime. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigates crimes including alien smuggling, narcotics and contraband smuggling, and financial crimes through its Office of Investigations.ICE's Financial Investigations Division focuses on financial crime, the Smuggling/Trafficking Branch disrupts criminal organizations involved in human smuggling or trafficking, and the Contraband Smuggling Branch investigates organized smuggling groups. The FBI focuses on investigating organized smuggling groups internationally through various efforts led by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The FBI's Office of International Operations coordinates foreign investigations, and FBI agents in over 50 countries train foreign law enforcement while receiving cooperation in gathering evidence. The DOJ, in cooperation with DHS, leads U.S. participation in Interpol to promote international law enforcement cooperation and information sharing. Interpol's National Central Bureau in each member country serves as a key point of contact for overseas criminal investigations. The USNCB, under the DOJ and in conjunction with DHS, facilitates international law enforcement cooperation as the U.S. representative to Interpol. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs leads efforts to train and assist foreign officials in combating international crime through programs like INCLE Global Anticrime Programs and International Law Enforcement Academies. Some analysts question the priority given to international crime amidst the U.S. focus on terrorism post-9/11. The National Security Council has been criticized for delays in updating the International Crime Control Strategy. Experts suggest better coordination between law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat international crime and terrorism effectively. Criminals could potentially serve as witnesses or informants against terrorists. Many experts suggest enhanced cooperation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies to combat international crime and terrorism effectively. Terrorist cells in Europe are involved in various crimes such as smuggling, car theft, and selling pirated CDs. Analysts recommend a broader interagency mechanism to gauge anti-crime efforts and address the challenges of obtaining solid international crime data. The curr_chunk discusses challenges in accurately quantifying seized assets in international crime, including issues with data compatibility and definitional disparities. Experts suggest expanding U.S. efforts through multilateral institutions like the United Nations or working with small groups of trusted partners. Some believe multinational conventions can improve global law enforcement standards, while others are skeptical due to varying adherence and enforcement levels. Some experts suggest working with small groups of trusted partners like the Group of Eight (G8) for more effective decision-making and flexibility in combating transnational threats. They argue that large international organizations are hindered by bureaucracy and advocate for less structured partnerships such as the Proliferation Security Initiative. This loose organization of key partners has enabled faster and more effective actions in response to threats like nuclear smuggling activities. However, there are concerns about the effectiveness of the PSI and its oversight by Congress. Some experts suggest working with regional structures like the European Union's Europol or Southeast Asia's Aseanapol for better coordination in combating criminal activities. Concerns exist about potential damage to existing bilateral agreements by forming agreements with institutions such as the European Union. The Bush Administration has actively worked to enhance coordination with EU law enforcement agencies. The CIA and other agencies have improved coordination with EU law enforcement and intelligence counterparts through treaties and information sharing agreements. The private sector, particularly the American financial sector, plays a significant role in combating transnational organized crime. Some experts are concerned that further regulation of industries could hinder growth and increase government costs, while privacy concerns exist about government involvement in the private sector. Many experts advocate government/private-sector partnerships to combat illicit trade. Companies with transportation networks could take on contraband inspection responsibilities, reducing customs inspections. Technology development for crime detection is recommended, with Congress facing funding decisions. New software and data-mining tools have improved crime detection, with banks using money laundering software. Government agencies are also utilizing similar programs to detect and map criminal activities. Some agencies are turning to programs to detect and map criminal activities, aiming to fight illicit trade by improving product identification. Radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs) are increasingly used for this purpose. There are proposals to expand the use of biometric technology for identifying individuals through unique physical characteristics. The European Union and the United States are working on incorporating biometric indicators on passports and expanding biometric recognition requirements for foreigners entering the country. Some experts suggest easing certain laws to allow the government to focus on the most pressing criminal activities, such as decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana. Improved understanding of international organized crime dynamics can assist Congress in coordinating anti-crime policies. Data collection and assessing threats from various criminal activities are crucial. Scrutinizing the link between crime and terror can enhance government efforts. Stronger international law enforcement cooperation and partnerships with the private sector are key in combating transnational organized crime. The appendix details U.S. programs and legislation to combat transnational crime, including anti-nuclear smuggling efforts. The U.S. anti-nuclear smuggling efforts are coordinated by multiple government agencies, including the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and Commerce. These efforts involve international agreements and partnerships to search for nuclear material or technologies on planes and ships. The Cooperative Threat Reduction program works to destroy nuclear weapons, particularly in the former Soviet Union. The State Department funds projects in Russia and Ukraine to employ scientists in non-weapons-related fields. The Energy Department runs programs to secure nuclear weapons and materials. The International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program focuses on upgrading security at nuclear sites and improving nuclear smuggling detection capabilities. The FY2007 budget requests $1.12 billion for nonproliferation and threat reduction assistance to Russia and other former Soviet states, with allocations for DOD's Cooperative Threat Reduction programs and Energy Department WMD threat-reduction efforts. The Homeland Security Department also plays a role in anti-nuclear smuggling efforts. The Department of Homeland Security's Container Security Initiative aims to increase inspection of shipping containers entering the U.S. annually. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for protecting U.S. borders from nuclear material, while the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security implements export-control policy. Additionally, DHS leads interagency efforts to develop technology to protect the U.S. from WMD threats. The State Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) assists other countries in developing and enforcing export controls through workshops and training. Recent legislative activity includes proposals in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY2006 and FY2007, such as the Nuclear Black Market Elimination Act with components like sanctions and incentives for proliferation-interdiction cooperation. Additionally, there is a call for direct access to A.Q. Khan in Pakistan for further investigation into his nuclear smuggling activities. The State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) leads anti-drug programs, focusing on foreign crop eradication and global narcotics interdiction. They manage the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) with significant funding from FY2000 to FY2006. INL also coordinates training for foreign law enforcement through programs like the International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs). The International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) train foreign personnel and promote international legal cooperation, having trained over 13,000 officials from 68 countries. The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) funds anti-narcotics programs that focus on education, institutional development, and alternative employment for individuals involved in drug production. The Justice Department's Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) cooperates with law enforcement agencies in 58 countries for bilateral investigations and institution building. The Southwest Border Initiative (SWBI) led by the Justice Department combats trafficking groups along the Southwest Border. The DEA, FBI, U.S. Customs Service, and U.S. Attorneys' offices collaborate to track drug movements and extradite smugglers. The Defense Department leads efforts to detect drug trafficking and works with DEA in key countries. Recent legislative acts authorize funding for anti-narcotics programs. The Defense Department leads global drug interdiction efforts with $901.7 million authorized by Act P.L. 109-163. Interagency anti-trafficking efforts are coordinated by the State Department, with key roles played by other agencies. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 established anti-trafficking provisions, including the annual State Department Trafficking in Persons Report. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (P.L. 95-223), sanctions can be imposed on countries that do not meet anti-trafficking standards. The Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons was created in 2002, consisting of top officials from various departments. The Trafficking in Persons and Worker Exploitation Task Force, established by the Justice and Labor Departments, coordinates anti-trafficking investigations and prosecutions. A special \"T\" visa was implemented under P.L. 106-386 to assist trafficking victims cooperating with law enforcement officials, allowing them to remain in the United States if facing risks abroad. Recent Legislative Activity includes the Senate ratifying the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons in 2005. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 aims to assist foreign trafficking victims in the United States and authorizes funds to combat human trafficking. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) leads agencies in combating IP violations and managing tariff preference programs. USTR's \"Special 301 process\" identifies countries lacking IP protection, leading to investigations and potential trade sanctions. U.S. anti-piracy efforts involve international agreements through the World Trade Organization (WTO). The USTR leads efforts to combat IP violations and manage tariff preference programs. The WTO allows the USTR to initiate dispute settlement proceedings against foreign governments. Free trade agreements also help enforce tougher IP laws. The Administration launched STOP! to strengthen anti-piracy efforts, including a government IP complaint hotline. DHS seizes pirated goods at U.S. borders and ports, with Chinese goods making up a significant portion. The 109th Congress has taken legislative actions to address trade and IP violations, including the passage of the United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act (H.R. 3283) which increases funding for enforcement agencies. Other bills introduced include S. 1421, H.R. 4186, and S. 2317 aimed at enhancing trade enforcement priorities and compliance with trade agreements. The 109th Congress has passed legislation to address trade and IP violations, including the United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act. This act increases funding for enforcement agencies and establishes a Chief Enforcement Officer and Trade Enforcement Working Group within the USTR's office. U.S. anti-money laundering efforts are coordinated by multiple government departments, including the Department of Treasury and its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI). TFI and its bureaus work to safeguard financial systems through various methods, including financial sanctions, regulation, and international initiatives. FinCEN, a Treasury bureau, supports law enforcement agencies in international financial crime investigations and provides global money laundering analyses to policymakers. Additionally, FinCEN and other Treasury affiliates collaborate with foreign government institutions to enhance international money laundering standards. The government institutions, including FinCEN, Egmont Group, Department of Justice, and Homeland Security Department, collaborate to improve international money laundering standards. FinCEN participates in global anti-money laundering networks, while the Department of Justice guides law enforcement agencies on money laundering investigations and prosecutions. The Homeland Security Department's ICE manages money laundering programs investigating crimes involving drugs, human smuggling, fraud, and counterfeit goods. ICE's domestic and international money laundering operations are coordinated through its Money Laundering Coordination Center. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act contains significant language on money laundering, increasing penalties for financing terrorist activities and placing greater restrictions on certain money-transferring businesses. Signed by President Bush on March 9, 2006."
