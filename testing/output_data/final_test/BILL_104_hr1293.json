    "content": "The Act titled \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" introduces rules governing litigation involving retiree health benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" mandates that if retiree health benefits are terminated or reduced under an employee welfare benefit plan, and legal action is taken by a participant or beneficiary, the court must order the plan and sponsor to maintain the benefits at the previous level without requiring any additional showing or security from the participant. The \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" requires the court to order the maintenance of benefits if they are terminated or reduced under an employee welfare benefit plan, unless clear and convincing evidence shows the action is without merit. Exceptions include changes similar to those for current employees or related to the delivery system. The \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" allows courts to order the maintenance of benefits if terminated or reduced under an employee welfare benefit plan, with exceptions for changes related to the delivery system or major case management restrictions. Courts can modify plan obligations if retiree benefits are being paid by the plan sponsor. The \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" prevents the termination or reduction of retiree health benefits and payments unless specific conditions are met by the plan sponsor. The \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" requires clear disclosure of any termination or reduction of benefits after retirement or disability. An employee representative can take legal action on behalf of retired employees, spouses, or dependents. Retiree health benefits refer to health coverage for retired or disabled employees. The \"Retiree Health Benefits Protection Act\" ensures that retired or disabled employees, along with their spouses or dependents, who expect to receive benefits upon retirement or disability, are protected from any termination or reduction of benefits. Effective March 23, 1995, rules governing litigation involving retiree health benefits apply to pending or new actions related to benefit terminations or reductions."
