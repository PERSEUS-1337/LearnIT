The Water Infrastructure Improvement Act, also known as the Act, introduces the concept of Integrated Plans in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's framework. Integrated plans may integrate various requirements under the Act, including those related to combined sewer overflow, sanitary sewer collection systems, municipal stormwater discharge, and municipal wastewater discharge. The Integrated Plan incorporated into a permit may include projects for water reclamation, recycling, and green infrastructure. Compliance schedules in the permit can span multiple terms for meeting water quality-based effluent limitations. The permit may include a schedule of compliance that spans multiple terms, meeting water quality-based effluent limitations. The schedule can be reviewed and modified at permit renewal. The permit renewal may involve modifying the compliance schedule without affecting existing obligations or flexibility under the Act. State authority to revise water quality standards is clarified. The text precludes a State from authorizing the issuance of a schedule of compliance in water quality standards to meet effluent limitations in permits that incorporate provisions of an integrated plan. It also states that any schedule of compliance issued pursuant to a State water quality standard may not be less stringent than a schedule in a judicial order or consent decree related to an enforcement action under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow municipalities to develop integrated plans in conjunction with enforcement actions related to municipal discharges. Municipalities with approved integrated plans may request modifications to administrative orders or settlement agreements. The Administrator is required to report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The Administrator must report to Congress on integrated plans developed under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, including control measures, costs, and compliance schedules. Additionally, an Office of the Municipal Ombudsman is established within the Administrator's office. The establishment of an Office of the Municipal Ombudsman within the Environmental Protection Agency aims to provide technical assistance to municipalities for compliance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and ensure agency policies are implemented. The Municipal Ombudsman will work with headquarters and regional offices to provide information on federal financial assistance and flexibility under the Act. The Municipal Ombudsman will publish information on technical and financial assistance, flexibility, and integrated plans under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act on the EPA website. Additionally, copies of permits, orders, or judicial consent decrees related to integrated plans will be made available. SEC. 5. GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. The term 'green infrastructure' refers to measures using plant or soil systems, permeable pavement, stormwater harvest, or landscaping to manage stormwater. The Administrator is tasked with promoting green infrastructure use. The Administrator is responsible for promoting and integrating green infrastructure into various aspects of the Environmental Protection Agency's activities, including permitting, enforcement, planning, research, and funding guidance. Coordination efforts with other federal departments, state, tribal, and local governments, as well as the private sector, are also required. Regional offices are directed to promote and integrate green infrastructure based on local factors. The Administrator promotes green infrastructure integration by providing outreach, training, and incorporating green infrastructure into regulatory programs. Information-sharing is facilitated through a website to assist in reducing water pollution and protecting water resources. The Administrator promotes green infrastructure integration to reduce water pollution, protect water resources, comply with regulations, and achieve environmental goals.
