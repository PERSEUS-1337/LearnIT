    "content": "The Act titled \"Social Security Caregiver Credit Act of 2016\" is referred to in this section. The Senate's findings and sense are also mentioned. Congress finds that caregiving is essential for family life, providing vital services for children, the ill, disabled, and elderly. Establishing a caregiver credit would improve economic prospects for unpaid caregivers and ensure retirement security. Policy options should be considered to extend OASDI solvency, such as eradicating the gender wage gap or increasing the minimum wage. Sense of the Senate is that Congress must address the exclusion of home care providers ineligible for Social Security or Medicare due to caring for a family member with a disability under state and local programs. SEC. 3. Deemed wages for caregivers of dependent relatives added to Title II of the Social Security Act. Sec. 235 defines a \"qualifying month\" as a month where an individual provided care to a dependent relative for at least 80 hours without pay, excluding months after retirement age. The individual can provide care to a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, parent, sibling, aunt, uncle, spouse, or domestic partner who is under the age of 12. A chronically dependent individual relies on assistance for daily activities and instrumental tasks. The activities of daily living include eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring. The instrumental activities of daily living involve meal planning, managing finances, shopping, performing household chores, and communication. For determining entitlement to benefits under this title, individuals are deemed to have been paid a certain amount per month, in addition to actual wages or self-employment income, based on certain qualifying months. This includes activities like communicating and participating in the community. The Social Security Act determines entitlement to benefits based on qualifying months and a percentage of the national average wage index. Only the last 60 qualifying months are considered, and the rules do not apply if a larger benefit would be payable without them. Regulations govern the application of these rules. The Commissioner of Social Security will establish regulations within a year to prevent fraud and abuse related to benefits. An individual must submit an application for benefits under this section to be considered for a qualifying month. The individual must provide documentation from the physician of the dependent relative explaining why the dependent relative is a chronically dependent individual, along with other required information to verify the status of the dependent relative for each qualifying month. The individual must certify that their application information has not changed after 12 qualifying months. Amendments are made to Section 209(k)(1) of the Act."
