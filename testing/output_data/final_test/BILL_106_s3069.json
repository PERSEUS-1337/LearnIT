    "content": "The \"Children's Protection Act of 2000\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that television is a pervasive presence in American homes, with the average household having 2.5 televisions and a television being on for 7 hours a day. Children spend an average of 21 hours a week in front of a television, which has a significant influence on their perceptions and behaviors. The harmful effects of television on development are acknowledged. Research shows a strong link between children's exposure to televised violence and behavioral issues. Numerous studies confirm that children who regularly watch violent TV programs are more likely to display aggressive behavior and become desensitized to real-life violence. Additionally, sexual content on television can also impact children significantly. Research suggests that heavy exposure to TV programs with strong sexual content can lead to early sexual activity among teenagers. The National Association of Broadcasters had a code of conduct emphasizing the responsibility of selecting program subjects carefully. Broadcasters have a special responsibility towards children, ensuring programs cater to their interests and contribute to their balanced development. Violence, whether physical or psychological, should be approached with caution in program content. (C) Violence, physical or psychological, should only be shown responsibly, not exploitatively. Programs should depict the consequences of violence without excessive or gratuitous details. (D) Marriage, family, and sexual content should be portrayed sensitively, not exploitatively. (E) Broadcasters must consider the family audience and avoid graphic depictions of sexual acts. The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned its code of conduct in 1983 after legal challenges on advertising restrictions. The programming standards of the code were never found to violate antitrust laws. Since the National Association of Broadcasters abandoned its code of conduct in 1983, programming standards on broadcast and cable television have deteriorated significantly. Public concern about the impact of television on children and society has increased, with polls showing over 80% of Americans worried about the graphic nature of content and glorification of criminal behavior. Congress has urged the television industry to address these concerns by taking steps to improve programming standards and content. The television industry agreed to adopt voluntary guidelines to limit violence in programming in 1992. Independent studies were conducted on violent content, and a rating system for harmful programming was implemented in 1999. Despite these efforts, many Americans, especially parents, are still unhappy with the declining standards of television. The Department of Justice ruled in 1993 that voluntary programming guidelines by the television industry would not violate antitrust laws. These guidelines could provide valuable information on program content to advertisers and viewers, potentially increasing demand and output. The Children's Television Act of 1990 mandates that US television broadcasters must cater to the educational needs of children, but analyses show they have not met this obligation. The popularity of educational video and PC games among children is on the rise. Violent video and computer games are popular among teenagers, with 64 percent regularly playing them. These games often glamorize violence, with players rewarded for \"kills\" and advertising highlighting graphic content. The increasing popularity and graphic nature of these games raise concerns about their negative influence on children. Music is a popular form of entertainment among American children and teenagers, with teens listening to an average of 10,500 hours of rock or rap music between 7th and 12th grades. Teens are heavy purchasers of music, often favoring genres that depict violence. Music has a powerful influence on perceptions, attitudes, and emotional states, with potential for both positive and negative effects on emotional, psychological, and physical health. The section discusses the purposes and construction of music's influence on children and teenagers. The Act aims to allow the entertainment industry to address concerns about the negative impact of television programming, movies, video games, Internet content, and music lyrics on children. It seeks to create voluntary guidelines similar to the Television Code of the National Association of Broadcasters and implement them to promote educational and informational programming for children in the United States. The Act aims to promote educational and informational programming for children without giving the Federal Government additional authority to restrict entertainment content beyond existing laws. SEC. 4. EXEMPTION OF VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ON GUIDELINES FOR CERTAIN ENTERTAINMENT MATERIAL FROM APPLICABILITY OF ANTITRUST LAWS. Exemption from antitrust laws for joint agreements in the entertainment industry to develop voluntary guidelines for appropriate content, excluding boycotts or advertising discussions. The curr_chunk discusses regulations on advertising in the entertainment industry, including restrictions on product advertisement, commercial interruptions, and consecutive commercials. Definitions for \"antitrust laws\" and \"Internet\" are also provided. The curr_chunk discusses the use of TCP/IP or successor protocols for transmitting information in the entertainment industry, defining terms like \"movies\" and \"person in the entertainment industry\" which includes various entities related to television, movies, video games, and music production. The curr_chunk defines \"telecast\" as any program broadcast on television or transmitted by a cable system, applicable to the entertainment industry and individuals involved in music production and distribution. After the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission must follow rulemaking procedures to establish, expand, or modify requirements for noncommercial educational television stations. Additional guidance from a previous memorandum opinion and order will no longer be effective unless prescribed in accordance with the new rulemaking process."
