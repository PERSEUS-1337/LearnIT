    "title": "AB 1594",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Beginning January 1, 2018, smoking or using tobacco products on California State University and California Community Colleges campuses is prohibited. The Trustees and governing boards have the authority to enforce this ban and educate employees and students about the policy. After January 1, 2018, fines of $25 for the first offense, $50 for the second, and $100 for subsequent violations of the smoking ban on California State University and California Community Colleges campuses. Proceeds from fines support campus educational operations, policy promotion, and tobacco cessation programs for students. Each college or university can establish policies for collecting fines for tobacco use violations, with possible assistance from campus law enforcement. If fines are imposed, signs must be posted to inform about the campus tobacco use policy. Fines are only issued if an educational campaign fails to ensure compliance with the smoking ban. The University of California is encouraged to enforce similar tobacco use policies. The definition of \"smoke\" or \"smoking\" includes inhaling, exhaling, or carrying any lighted tobacco product. A \"tobacco product\" is any product containing tobacco or nicotine intended for human consumption. An electronic device delivering nicotine or vaporized liquids, including e-cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or hookahs. Excludes FDA-approved tobacco cessation products. California State University and community colleges can enforce pre-2017 tobacco policies until the new prohibition takes effect. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be made for other mandated costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
