    "content": "Between FY1995 and FY2014, USPS's workforce decreased by 29.4%, from 874,972 employees to 617,877 employees. The workforce peaked in FY1999 with 905,766 employees and experienced the steepest decrease between FY2008 and FY2009. These changes were part of USPS's strategy to reduce costs and regain financial solvency. Between FY2008 and FY2009, USPS saw a significant decrease in its workforce by 53,006 employees, or 7.4%. This decline coincided with the Great Recession. In FY2013, USPS operated with its smallest workforce in at least 20 years. The workforce is divided into career and non-career employees, with career employees receiving full federal benefits while non-career employees do not. The number of career employees at USPS decreased by 35.2% from FY1995 to FY2014, while non-career employees increased by 6.6% during the same period. The proportion of non-career employees in the USPS workforce rose from 13.9% in FY1995 to 21.0% in FY2014, while career employees declined from 86.1% to 79.0%. The percentage of career employees at USPS decreased by 35.2% from FY1995 to FY2014, while non-career employees increased by 6.6% during the same period. The proportion of non-career employees in the USPS workforce rose from 13.9% to 21.0% between FY1995 and FY2014. Figure 4 illustrates the yearly percentage change in USPS workforce size, showing stable trends for career employees and greater variance for non-career employees. Between FY1995 and FY2014, USPS saw a 35.2% decrease in career employees and a 6.6% increase in non-career employees. Out of 13 career employment categories, 10 had fewer employees in FY2014 compared to FY1995. The \"Professional Administrative and Technical Personnel\" category had the largest decrease with a 60.4% decrease. However, three categories saw an increase in employment, with \"Headquarters\" experiencing the largest percentage increase at 60.8% and \"Rural Delivery Carriers\u2014Full-Time\" having the largest increase in actual numbers with 20,260 more employees. The increase in headquarters employees was due to centralizing certain functions at the headquarters level. The USPS centralized human resources functions at an HR Shared Services Center, leading to a shift of positions from field offices to headquarters. The percentage increase in headquarters employees slowed to 8.3% since FY2004, with decreases in remaining headquarters-related employment categories. USPS reported data in eight non-career categories since FY1995, with decreases in three of the four non-career employee categories remaining intact. The number of casuals and non-bargaining temporary employees at USPS decreased significantly from FY1995 to FY2014. The category of \"Rural Subs/RCA/RCR/AUX\" also saw a slight decrease. However, the \"PM Relieve/Leave Replacements\" category experienced a small increase. USPS introduced new non-career employee categories such as Postal Support Employees (PSEs), City Carrier Assistants (CCAs), and Mail Handler Assistants (MHAs) since FY2011. As of September 30, 2014, USPS had 24,781 PSEs, 36,081 CCAs, and 5,475 MHAs. The American Postal Workers Union (APWU), National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), and National Postal Mail Handlers Union (NPMHU) represent three positions eligible for raises, health benefits, and leave. Over the past 20 years, full-time rural delivery carriers grew by 43.9%, while city delivery carriers decreased by 31.4%. USPS noted that 65% of population growth occurred in rural areas, leading to increased mail volume and a greater need for delivery carriers in those areas. The number of USPS employees involved in mail transportation declined from FY1995 to FY2014, possibly due to decreased mail volume and increased automation. The USPS also faced significant financial challenges, losing $51 billion between FY2007 and FY2014. Between FY2005 and FY2014, USPS's debt increased to $15 billion, prompting the Government Accountability Office to flag its financial condition as high-risk. The drop in mail volume from 212 billion to 155 billion pieces between FY2007 and FY2014 led to a $7 billion decrease in operating revenues. To address financial challenges, USPS has focused on reducing workforce costs, with personnel expenses accounting for 78% of total operating expenses in FY2014. Between FY2007 and FY2014, USPS reduced workforce size through attrition and separation incentives, resulting in a reduction of 168,052 employees. Separation incentives ranged from $10,000 to $20,000 per person, with 55,473 employees accepting them between FY2010 and FY2014. USPS utilized separation incentives to avoid involuntary layoffs, but implemented a reduction in force for 249 postmasters on January 9, 2015. USPS implemented a reduction in force for 249 postmasters on January 9, 2015. 169 opted for Discontinued Service Retirement, while the remaining 80 received severance pay. USPS offered part-time career positions to all affected postmasters. The agency aimed to reduce its career workforce to 404,000 employees by 2017, representing a 17.3% decrease from FY2014 staffing levels. USPS was developing an updated five-year business plan in October 2015. The updated five-year business plan may include new strategies to increase cost efficiency by potentially altering or removing workforce reduction goals. USPS has increased the use of non-career employees, with a 28.1% increase from FY2007 to FY2014. Career employees decreased by 28.7% during the same period. The influx of non-career employees was mainly due to the creation of PSEs, CCAs, and MHAs between FY2011 and FY2014. The USPS increased the use of non-career employees, including PSEs, CCAs, and MHAs, to reduce costs and provide flexibility in agency functions. These employees can perform similar duties as career employees but at lower wages. For example, CCAs start at $15.00 per hour compared to $16.71 for city letter carriers. CCAs reduced costs by $120 million in FY2013, and PSEs were used in place of career employees. The USPS increased the use of non-career employees, such as PSEs, CCAs, and MHAs, to reduce costs and provide flexibility in agency functions. These employees can perform similar duties as career employees but at lower wages. CCAs reduced costs by $120 million in FY2013. The USPS OIG reported that PSEs could be used in place of career employees earning overtime, thus reducing compensation costs. Labor union contracts govern USPS's use of non-career employees, with recent contracts raising the limit on the number of non-career employees that can be used for certain functions. The USPS has reduced compensation expenses by increasing the use of non-career employees and decreasing employee work hours. This led to a $526 million decrease in total compensation costs from FY2013 to FY2014. However, a 2014 GAO report found that overall expenses did not decline alongside reduced workforce size, attributing the fluctuation to required annual Retiree Health Benefits Fund payments. The USPS's overall expenses declined at a slower rate compared to employee work hours, excluding annual Retiree Health Benefits Fund payments. USPS attributed this to increased wage and benefit costs, non-personnel expenses, and fixed costs. The agency's 2012-2017 business plan included legislative proposals affecting workforce size and cost, but these are no longer being pursued. USPS is now focusing on consensus building among stakeholders. The USPS employs various personnel in different administrative units overseeing postal operations in nine geographic areas across the United States. This includes maintenance personnel, clerks, city delivery carriers, headquarters staff, field units, postal inspectors, and inspector general employees.
