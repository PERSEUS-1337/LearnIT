    "content": "The Medicaid program, established under Title XIX of the SSA, is a cooperative effort between the federal government and states to provide medical assistance for low-income individuals. States must have an approved plan for medical assistance and comply with all conditions. The Medicaid statute identifies mandatory eligibility groups that must be covered, with costs shared by the state and federal governments. The federal government's share of Medicaid costs varies by state, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Failure to cover a mandatory eligibility group jeopardizes federal Medicaid funds. Work requirements in Medicaid have targeted the ACA Medicaid expansion group, added in 2014 for individuals under 65, not pregnant, not Medicare-eligible, and below a certain income threshold. The ACA Medicaid expansion group receives enhanced federal funding, starting at 100% and gradually decreasing to 90% by 2020. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot withhold existing Medicaid funds for failing to cover this group. The ACA Medicaid expansion group receives enhanced federal funding, starting at 100% and gradually decreasing to 90% by 2020. States can decline to cover the new ACA Medicaid expansion group without jeopardizing pre-ACA dollars. However, partial coverage of the ACA Medicaid expansion group may result in denial of federal assistance under the enhanced FMAP for medical services. The Medicaid statute does not clearly address work requirements for most beneficiaries, but states can terminate Medicaid eligibility for TANF recipients who fail to comply with work requirements. Imposing work requirements on Medicaid beneficiaries may violate the requirement to cover all individuals in an eligibility group, such as the ACA Medicaid expansion group. The House-passed version of H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), proposes significant changes to the Medicaid program, including phasing out enhanced matching for the ACA Medicaid expansion and implementing a per capita cap model for Medicaid financing. States would be allowed to impose work requirements on non-disabled, non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals seeking Medicaid coverage. The House of Representatives passed the AHCA, which includes work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries similar to those for TANF recipients. The Senate's BCRA also proposes changes to Medicaid, including terminating enhanced funding for the ACA Medicaid expansion and establishing per enrollee limits on federal payments to states. The BCRA proposes changes to Medicaid, including work requirements similar to the AHCA. States could impose work requirements without needing federal approval under SSA Section 1115. HHS Secretary and CMS Administrator affirmed a partnership with states to improve Medicaid through innovative demonstrations. Section 1115 demonstration authority allows states to seek waivers for Medicaid work incentives. The HHS Secretary can waive requirements to promote the objectives of Medicaid and other programs. The key limitation is whether the project will assist in promoting these objectives. The Section 1115 demonstration authority allows states to seek waivers for Medicaid and other covered programs to provide medical assistance to those in need. The Secretary has broad power to authorize projects that do not fit within standard public assistance programs, and courts can review the Secretary's decision to grant a waiver under the Administrative Procedure Act. The \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard in case law allows for reversal of agency action if factors not intended by Congress are relied upon, important aspects are not considered, explanations counter to evidence are given, or decisions are implausible. Reviewing courts assessing the HHS Secretary's waiver under Section 1115 will depend on the administrative record. Abuse of agency discretion is also examined. Courts have applied the arbitrary and capricious standard of review in challenges to cases involving the Secretary's waiver authority under Section 1115. In Aguayo v. Richardson, New York sought a waiver to impose work requirements in its AFDC program, leading to a legal dispute over the Secretary's authority to grant such waivers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the Secretary's Section 1115 waiver decision, stating that the goals outlined in the waiver program met the requirements of the law. The court upheld the validity of the Section 1115 waiver decision by the Secretary, supporting the waiver granted to the state. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit discussed work incentives in the AFDC program under a Section 1115 waiver in Beno v. Shalala, addressing objections raised by beneficiary groups. The Ninth Circuit upheld the Secretary's decision on a Section 1115 waiver, requiring projects to have research or experimental value to further program objectives and benefit program beneficiaries. The court reviewed the administrative record before the Secretary and found a lack of evidence that plaintiffs' objections were considered. Factors such as the risk of benefits cuts on program recipients and the impact on vulnerable individuals were not taken into account. The court concluded that the Secretary's decision could not be sustained, even under deferential review of the APA. Judicial review may rely on examining the administrative record to assess the legality of a waiver. The court may rely on the administrative record to assess the legality of a waiver under Section 1115. Beno and Aguayo focused on work incentives in AFDC, a program different from Medicaid, created for providing medical assistance to those with inadequate income. AFDC aims to support dependent children and their families, promoting self-support and family stability. The AFDC program emphasizes self-support and personal independence for beneficiaries, while Medicaid focuses on financial need. The Supreme Court has noted differences between the objectives of pre-ACA Medicaid and the ACA Medicaid expansion, which could impact the evaluation of work requirements in Section 1115 waivers for both programs. Other courts have reviewed Section 1115 waivers for Medicaid but not specifically in the context of work requirements. In Newton-Nations v. Betlach, the Ninth Circuit reviewed a waiver allowing Arizona to increase co-payments for Medicaid beneficiaries. The court found that the waiver lacked necessary findings on research value and harm to beneficiaries to support the Secretary's approval. It was concluded that cost-savings alone couldn't justify the waiver without identifiable research or demonstration value. The Secretary's authority to waive Medicaid provisions for experimental projects under Section 1115 may be examined. Six states operate ACA Medicaid expansions through waivers, using private health insurance plans. The HHS Secretary has granted waivers for states to conduct demonstration projects involving voluntary work incentives under Medicaid. The permissibility of imposing work requirements on ACA Medicaid expansion beneficiaries through Section 1115 waivers may depend on specific proposal details and administrative records. A reviewing court's evaluation of the Secretary's consideration of relevant factors in approving a Section 1115 waiver for work requirements under Medicaid is crucial. The framework for legal analysis focuses on whether the proposed demonstration project aligns with Medicaid objectives, including research goals, impact on beneficiaries, and addressing objections. This analysis would guide the court in determining if the waiver promotes Medicaid's goals. The Secretary's approval of a Section 1115 waiver for work requirements under Medicaid is based on promoting program objectives and sufficient evidence in the administrative record. If challenged in court, the decision will be reviewed for arbitrariness or capriciousness, with deference given unless a clear error of judgment is evident."
