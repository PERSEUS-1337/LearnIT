    "content": "The 110th Congress is addressing concerns about the use of private contractors for security in Iraq and other military operations. Private firms are being relied upon heavily in Iraq due to a shortage of Diplomatic Security agents and U.S. troops. Congress has accepted the use of unarmed contractors for support functions, but there are concerns about costs and favoritism in contract issuance. Private security contractors are seen as crucial for protecting Iraqi and U.S. officials, contractors, and government facilities. Concerns exist regarding transparency, accountability, legal issues, and long-term effects of using armed civilians for security tasks previously done by the military. The report covers information on private contractors in Iraq, relevant laws, and issues surrounding their use. It also discusses the need for contractors, costs, oversight, and potential foreign policy implications. The United States and other entities use private security contractors in Iraq for various functions, including security, stabilization, and reconstruction efforts. There is debate over the definition of private security contractors, with some including activities like intelligence analysis and security training. This reliance on contractors has led to the growth of the private security industry. Private security contractors in Iraq provide armed and unarmed services, including static security, convoy security, security escorts, and personal security details. These services are defined by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 as guarding personnel, facilities, or properties, and may also include intelligence analysis and security training. Private security contractors in Iraq offer a range of services, including armed and unarmed security, such as convoy security and personal security details for high-ranking individuals. Around 50 private security contractors with over 30,000 employees work in Iraq for various clients, including governments, private industry, and international organizations like the United Nations. Employees come from around 30 countries, with many being security professionals from western countries with military or law enforcement experience. Private security contractors in Iraq come from Commonwealth countries, third-country nationals, and local Iraqis. They provide armed and unarmed security services for the U.S. government, including static security, personal security details, and intelligence analysis. Around 20 different PSCs employ 10,000 people in Iraq, with some contractors having extensive military training and experience. The U.S. government has a contractual relationship with private security contractors (PSCs) in Iraq, with estimated costs ranging from $3 billion to $4 billion between 2003-2007. Additionally, agencies have spent between $500 million and $1.2 billion annually on security services starting in 2005. The total cost of private security services acquired by government contractors in Iraq is unknown. Between 2003-2007, U.S.-funded contractors in Iraq spent $3 billion to $6 billion on security services. In 2007, House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman stated that almost $4 billion was paid for private security services in Iraq reconstruction efforts. Security costs for government contractors in Iraq represent a significant portion of available reconstruction funds, with some contracts exceeding 25% of total billings. U.S. contractors in Iraq incurred security costs ranging from 7.6% to 16.7%, while the State Department estimated costs at 16%-22% in 2005. There is debate on the cost-effectiveness of using private security contractors by the U.S. government. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that costs for private security contractors did not differ greatly from military units performing similar functions. Comprehensive cost-benefit analyses comparing private security companies with in-house resources are generally lacking. Pay scales for contractors vary based on experience, nationality, and government perceptions. Private security contractors' pay scales vary based on experience, nationality, and government perceptions. The highest amounts are paid to highly trained former military personnel from the US and British Commonwealth, while lower amounts go to personnel from developing countries. Contractors face risks of death and injury from insurgents in Iraq, with varying pay rates depending on their background. Private security contractors in Iraq face significant risks, with 32 employees killed and 46 wounded since 2004. Convoy-related deaths are a major concern, with 132 security employees and drivers killed and 416 wounded in attacks on supply convoys. Despite recent reports of decreased violence, the dangers for security personnel remain high. In the first six months of 2008, only about 1.5% of convoys were attacked, a significant decrease from late 2006 and early 2007. Private security contractors in Iraq still face risks of being killed or wounded, despite the overall decline in attacks. The State Department and DOD have increased transparency by disclosing information on contracts for security services, including the number of personnel involved. The office of the Assistant Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Program Support) oversees contractor oversight, including private security contractors, in forward areas of operation, established in response to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007. The State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) was established in response to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007. DS special agents are involved in deterring visa and passport fraud, anti-terrorism training, providing protective services for dignitaries, and ensuring the security of U.S. embassies worldwide. The State Department has increasingly utilized private security contractors for over 20 years. The State Department has relied on private security contractors for protection at overseas posts and missions for over 20 years, starting in 1983 after the U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security first used PSCs in 1994 to protect Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. PSCs have been used in Bosnia, Israel, Afghanistan, and Iraq, with DS taking over security responsibilities at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad in 2004 due to insufficient personnel. In response to a lack of personnel, the State Department signed a one-year contract with Blackwater USA to provide security for the new Baghdad embassy. Subsequently, the State Department opened the WPPS II contract for bids in 2005, a five-year $1.2 billion contract for security services in Iraq. The WPPS II contract was awarded on a best value basis, prioritizing technical merit over cost. Three private security companies, including Blackwater Worldwide, DynCorp International, LLC, and Triple Canopy, Inc., were hired under this contract to provide bodyguards and static guards in Baghdad and other areas of Iraq. Triple Canopy also holds a separate contract to provide guard services for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Blackwater Worldwide has been providing protective services in Iraq since 1997. Blackwater, founded by former Navy SEAL Erik Prince, is a private security company in Iraq. They provide protection for CPA chief Paul Bremer and other employees. The company has a large training center with various ranges and technology capabilities. Blackwater's primary area of operation is in Baghdad, and their WPPS contract was renewed for a fifth year in 2008. On April 5, 2008, the Department of State renewed Blackwater's WPPS contract for a fifth year, citing the ongoing FBI investigation into the Nisoor Square shooting. DynCorp International LLC, based in Falls Church, Virginia, has nearly 14,000 employees in 30 countries and operates primarily in the northern Kurdish area of Iraq under the WPPS contract. DynCorp and Triple Canopy are two companies operating in Iraq under State Department contracts. DynCorp operates in the northern Kurdish area, while Triple Canopy operates in southern Iraq. PSCs provide security services to the Department of Defense, with companies like EOD Technologies providing security in Baghdad. Aegis Defence Services coordinates movements for DOD and State Department. Aegis Defence Services Limited coordinates the movement of DOD and other PSCs in Iraq, gathering and disseminating security information. DOD uses American and foreign PSCs, with British companies like Aegis Defence Services Limited, Erinys International, and ArmorGroup Services Ltd. providing security services. The number of PSC employees working for DOD fluctuates based on factors like troop strength and operational need, with contracts with 32 PSCs employing almost 10,000 individuals in December 2007, and contracts with 18 PSCs employing over 7,000 individuals in March 2008. Aegis Defence Services Limited, a privately owned security and risk management company, coordinates the movement of DOD and other private security contractors in Iraq. The company, founded in 2002 by retired British lieutenant colonel Tim Spicer, has offices in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, and the United States. The number of PSC employees working for DOD in Iraq fluctuates, with approximately 4-6% of the contractor workforce being private security contractors. DOD officials anticipate an increase in the number of PSC employees in the near future to support military efforts. ArmorGroup International plc, founded in 1981 by Tim Spicer, won significant contracts with the U.S. Army in Iraq. The company, based in London, offers various security services and has 8,500 employees worldwide. ArmorGroup has faced criticism due to Spicer's past involvement in controversial activities. EOD Technologies, Inc. is an employee-owned firm providing security services such as armed security, guard force training, and counter IED response. The company has offices in the United States, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kuwait. Public awareness of private contractors for security was raised after the deaths of four Blackwater guards in Fallujah in 2004. In 2004, four Blackwater guards, including a former Navy SEAL, were killed while escorting trucks in Iraq. Their bodies were dragged through the streets and hung for display. This incident sparked congressional debate on the role of private contractors in military operations. In 2006, a lawsuit revealed allegations of a Triple Canopy employee firing at Iraqi civilians. Two Triple Canopy employees in Iraq fired at Iraqi civilians in 2005, possibly killing one person. They were fired for reporting their supervisor's actions. The Company claimed no evidence of harm but terminated the employees for not reporting the incidents. Blackwater was also involved in shooting incidents in Iraq, including the 2007 Nisoor Square incident where 17 civilians were wounded or killed. Blackwater guards in Baghdad's Nisoor Square felt threatened by an oncoming car, leading to a shooting incident where 17 civilians were wounded or killed. Concerns were raised about the guards' actions being unprovoked, trigger-happy behavior, and cultural insensitivity. Defense Secretary Gates suggested putting the contractors under his authority due to conflicting military goals. News reports questioned Blackwater's adherence to guidelines on the use of force. The Majority Staff memorandum for a House Committee hearing on Blackwater in Iraq highlighted the company's frequent and extensive use of force, resulting in casualties and property damage. Between 2005 and 2007, Blackwater employees were involved in 195 firearms discharge incidents, with 163 instances of firing first. Congress raised concerns about the State Department's oversight of its contractors in Iraq. Many believe that the State Department's failure to properly investigate alleged killings by Private Security Contractors (PSCs) has undermined U.S. foreign policy in Iraq. Concerns were raised about Blackwater's actions potentially damaging relationships with Iraqis, as their use of deadly force and disregard for Iraqi law and customs have fueled anti-American sentiment. The State Department's alleged protection of Blackwater, a Private Security Contractor (PSC), has raised concerns about U.S. foreign policy in Iraq. The actions of PSCs, who act above Iraqi law and kill Iraqis with impunity, have led to resentment towards the U.S. preaching about the rule of law. This has the potential to damage the perception of the United States as a country respectful of human rights and impact its foreign policy objectives. The events of September 16th in Iraq sparked an outcry by the Iraqi government due to assaults on civilians by Private Security Contractors (PSCs) who appear to be above the law. The incident has led to concerns about national sovereignty and the lack of accountability for PSCs, including cases of alleged sexual harassment and rape of female KBR employees. Congressional hearings have addressed the enforcement of federal criminal law to protect Americans working for U.S. contractors in Iraq. The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations conducted a hearing on legal accountability of Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in Iraq under international, U.S., and Iraqi law. Contractors working with the military are considered civilian non-combatants whose actions may implicate the duty to promote welfare and security in Iraq. Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in Iraq may face prosecution in U.S. federal courts or military courts under certain circumstances. The international law of armed conflict, particularly regarding belligerent occupation and non-international armed conflict, is relevant in Iraq. The status of armed contract personnel in such situations is unclear. In international armed conflict, civilians are considered non-combatants and cannot take part in hostilities. The status of contractors in such situations is unclear, as they may not qualify as combatants under the laws of war. This raises questions about their treatment if captured by the enemy. The Geneva Conventions do not explicitly prohibit the use of civilian contractors in a civil police role in occupied territory. Contractors in Iraq may be authorized to use force to defend persons or property in the fluid security situation. If their actions amount to combat, they could be targeted by enemy forces and prosecuted for hostile acts. Killing or injuring civilians could lead to liability, regardless of combatant status. In a non-international armed conflict, contractors are not distinguished as \"unlawful\" or \"lawful\" combatants under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Contractors in Iraq may be authorized to use force to defend persons or property in the security situation. The law no longer distinguishes between \"unlawful\" and \"lawful combatants.\" Contractors captured by enemy forces engaging in hostilities are entitled to minimum standards under CA3, but their right to engage in hostilities is determined by local law, such as Iraqi law. Mercenaries, not part of armed forces but fighting for personal gain, may be treated as \"unlawful combatants\" or \"unprivileged belligerents.\" Their allegiance is based on payment, not obedience. Mercenaries are individuals recruited to fight in armed conflicts for personal gain. They do not qualify for POW treatment under international law and may be tried and punished for their hostile actions, even if lawful under the law of war. Soldiers with a different nationality are not automatically considered mercenaries. Contractor personnel who are not U.S. nationals or residents of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict, and who are motivated by private gain to take part in hostilities, may be considered mercenaries under international law. Contractors in Iraq operate under the law of the government of Iraq, exempt from Iraqi laws for acts related to their contracts under CPA Order Number 17. Contractors in Iraq are not subject to Iraqi laws or regulations for their contracts but are subject to all relevant regulations for other business activities. They are immune from Iraqi legal processes for acts performed under their contracts. Iraqi legal processes can proceed against contract personnel with the Sending State's written permission, and the State's certification is conclusive evidence in Iraqi courts. CPA Order Number 3 governs the use of weapons in Iraq, restricting the authority to carry weapons to specific groups authorized by the CPA. Private security firms in Iraq may be licensed by the Ministry of the Interior to possess and use firearms and military weapons in the course of their duties. All others must apply for a license to possess a weapon. Unauthorized use or possession of weapons is penalized. CPA Memorandum Number 17 regulates private security companies, with rules for the use of force and a code of conduct that employees must follow. Private security firms in Iraq are regulated by CPA Memorandum Number 17, which allows licensed firms to use firearms and military weapons. PSC employees are prohibited from conducting law enforcement activities but can stop, detain, search, and disarm civilians for safety reasons or as specified in their contracts. They are subject to all applicable laws and may be held liable under criminal and civil legal codes. U.S. contractor personnel and other civilians in Iraq may be prosecuted in U.S. courts, while those accompanying armed forces overseas may be prosecuted under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000. Some contractor personnel in Iraq may not fall under U.S. criminal jurisdiction despite committing crimes, which could interfere with the Multi-National Forces' mandate. U.S. contractor personnel and civilians in Iraq can be prosecuted in U.S. courts under certain circumstances, with jurisdiction extending to U.S. nationals at U.S. facilities overseas. The United States has Special Maritime and Territorial Jurisdiction (SMTJ) for crimes involving U.S. nationals as perpetrators or victims, including diplomatic missions, residences, and land used by U.S. personnel in foreign States. Criminal statutes within SMTJ include assault, kidnapping, sexual abuse, murder, and manslaughter, with the Department of Justice responsible for prosecution. In 2007, a CIA contractor was convicted under this provision for assault. The War Crimes Act of 1996 and federal statutes prescribe criminal sanctions for offenses committed by or against U.S. nationals overseas. The prohibition on torture applies outside the United States regardless of the perpetrator's nationality. The War Crimes Act prohibits \"grave breaches\" of Common Article 3, including torture, murder, rape, and taking hostages. Federal jurisdiction is established for these crimes involving U.S. nationals. Extraterritorial jurisdiction is established for crimes committed by or against U.S. nationals or servicemembers. It does not cover foreign nationals committing war crimes in Iraq. Other criminal proscriptions with extraterritorial reach include assaulting, killing, or kidnapping an internationally protected person. Jurisdiction exists if the victim or offender is a U.S. national, or if the offender is later found in the United States. The federal prohibition on torture applies to acts outside the U.S. regardless of the perpetrator's nationality. There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over murder if both the perpetrator and victim are U.S. nationals, with prosecution requiring approval from the Attorney General or designee. Extraterritorial jurisdiction for crimes involving U.S. nationals requires approval from the Attorney General or designee, with conditions such as the suspect not being present in the foreign country where the crime occurred. Statutes may imply extraterritorial jurisdiction to protect federal interests or prevent obstruction of overseas activities. Conduct affecting foreign commerce alone may not be enough to show Congress intended to reach overseas conduct. Crimes involving only foreign nationals, even if connected to the U.S. government, may fall outside this jurisdiction. Persons employed by the U.S. government or a government contractor overseas may be prosecuted under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) for certain offenses. This includes civilian employees of the Department of Defense, DOD contractors, subcontractors, and employees from other federal agencies supporting DOD missions. MEJA may not cover civilian and contract employees broadly depending on DOD's mission scope. MEJA does not cover civilian and contract employees of agencies engaged in their own operations overseas, nor nationals or residents of the host nation. It may cover other foreign nationals under covered contracts but does not extend federal jurisdiction over crimes not defined within the SMTJ. However, DOD's interpretation allows prosecution for federal crimes prohibited nationwide, including areas outside the SMTJ. Regulations for implementing MEJA were issued in 2005. The Department of Defense Inspector General is responsible for informing the Attorney General of potential federal crimes under MEJA. The DOJ Criminal Division works with DOD to designate the U.S. Attorney's Office for cases. 12 individuals have been charged under MEJA since 2000, with ongoing investigations. Few successful prosecutions of DOD contractors in Iraq under MEJA have occurred. Very few successful prosecutions of DOD contractors in Iraq under MEJA have been reported. Cases include possession of child pornography, abusive sexual contact, assault with a knife, and a former U.S. soldier being prosecuted for rape and murder. Legislation was passed in 2007 to expand MEJA coverage during contingency operations. Contract personnel in the 110th Congress may face military prosecution under the UCMJ for conduct during hostilities in Iraq. The FY07 NDAA extended military jurisdiction to persons serving with armed forces in the field. There has been one reported use of this amendment involving an interpreter. If offenses by contractors are violations of the law of war, the UCMJ may extend jurisdiction to try suspects. The UCMJ may extend jurisdiction to try suspects for violations of the law of war, including civilians serving with the Armed Forces in the field during declared wars by Congress. Supreme Court cases have reaffirmed the need for due process standards for civilians tried in military tribunals. Former servicemembers who have severed ties to the military cannot be tried by court-martial for crimes committed while on active duty. The UCMJ allows for jurisdiction to try suspects for violations of the law of war, including civilians serving with the Armed Forces. Former servicemembers cannot be tried by court-martial for crimes committed while on active duty. Congress has the authority to make rules for courts-martial that differ from civilian trials. The Supreme Court has found implicit exceptions to fundamental rights for servicemembers. Statutes related to courts-martial have withstood objections based on due process. The UCMJ provides procedural protections for soldiers similar to civilian courts, but military jurisdiction over civilians is limited. The Covert Court distinguished civilian courts-martial from military commissions in occupied territories. If the US is considered an \"occupying power\" in Iraq, DOD contractors there may be subject to military jurisdiction. In Iraq, military jurisdiction over DOD contractors may be acceptable under the Constitution. The possibility of trying civilians who are part of the armed services by court-martial during wartime has been left open by the Covert plurality. Lower courts during World War II upheld courts-martial of civilian employees of the U.S. Army in Eritrea and merchant seamen by the Navy. The Constitution has not expressly forbidden military jurisdiction over civilians who are \"in\" the Armed Forces during war. Another court upheld the conviction of a merchant seaman for the military charge of desertion. To determine if a civilian contractor can be prosecuted under the UCMJ, it must be established if they are \"serving with or accompanying\" the armed forces in the field. Military jurisdiction over a civilian cannot be claimed based on convenience or necessity alone. The phrase \"in the field\" refers to serving in an area of actual fighting at or near the battlefront. Contractors in Iraq may not be subject to military jurisdiction solely based on their employment. However, they could be subject to jurisdiction if their conduct is connected to military operations. Other potential issues include prosecution for military crimes and the availability of non-judicial punishment for contract employees. The availability of non-judicial punishment for contract employees and the limitations on standard punishments in civilian cases under military jurisdiction are key considerations. Appellate review over civilian cases may be restricted, and misconduct leading to immediate dismissal by the contractor may cease military jurisdiction. DOD has issued guidance for implementing the new law. Secretary Gates instructed military leaders to exercise jurisdiction over civilians based on military necessity and justice interests, especially in cases where U.S. federal criminal jurisdiction does not apply or when conduct is adverse to a significant military interest. The Secretary of Defense has sole authority for conduct within the U.S. or involving offenders not outside the country. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to convene court-martial or initiate disciplinary proceedings for civilians outside the United States. Convening authorities must follow notification procedures outlined in DOD Instruction 5525.11 to allow the Department of Justice to take action within fourteen calendar days. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to convene court-martial or initiate disciplinary proceedings for civilians outside the United States. If DOJ does not exercise jurisdiction, DOD may authorize commanders to take disciplinary action. Military commanders can investigate violations by civilians while DOJ decides on jurisdiction. The use of private contractors in security and military operations raises concerns about entrusting traditional military and federal duties to private companies. Private contractors hired for potentially hostile situations, especially those carrying arms, raise sensitive issues related to the performance of inherently governmental functions. The definition of \"inherently governmental function\" as per the FAIR Act of 1998 is crucial in determining whether such tasks should be carried out by federal employees. The FAIR Act defines \"inherently governmental functions\" as activities that require discretion or value judgments for the Federal Government. These functions include activities that protect US interests, contract management, and functions that significantly impact private individuals. Congress can designate functions as inherently governmental or restrict the use of contractors for certain tasks. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide examples of such functions. The FAIR Act defines \"inherently governmental functions\" as activities requiring discretion for the Federal Government. Circular A-76 outlines guidelines for determining if activities should be done by government personnel or private sector. It allows contractors for certain protective services but agencies must consider the provider's authority. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) allows the use of contract personnel for security, with limitations on guarding military installations and mandatory provisions for contractors accompanying U.S. Armed Forces deployed overseas during contingency operations. Private security contractors accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces are authorized to use deadly force only when necessary to protect assets/persons, as per a 2006 DOD rule. Combatant commanders must ensure their mission statements do not include inherently governmental military functions to maintain law of war protections. Private security contractors accompanying the U.S. Armed Forces are authorized to use deadly force only when necessary to protect assets/persons. The DFARS-mandated clause limits military security provision for contractors in theater of operations to cases where effective security services cannot be obtained at a reasonable cost or threat conditions necessitate military security. Recent decisions shed light on private security services, with a contractor protesting armed security escort requirements for contracts involving cargo transportation in Iraq. The prospective bidder challenged security requirements for armed security escorts, citing the Anti-Pinkerton Act and DOD instructions. The protestor argued that the statements of work required civilian contractors to engage in combat, but the Comptroller General denied the protest, stating that providing guard services does not make a company a 'quasi-military armed force.' The decision also noted DOD regulations allowing the contracting of armed security services. The regulations and DFARS provisions allow contracting armed security services but prohibit direct combat or offensive operations. The Anti-Pinkerton Act may restrict hiring contractors acting as quasi-military forces. State Department and USAID regulations do not specifically address contractors in war zones. The recent FAR amendment imposes new requirements for contractors in designated operation areas or diplomatic locations. The State Department and Department of Defense have increasingly used private security contractors for services outside the United States. Both departments report benefits from using these contractors, with the State Department citing surge capability in Iraq and the military considering contractors part of the total force. However, analysts also note drawbacks in using private contractors. The Department of State utilizes private security contractors (PSCs) to quickly expand security capabilities without delays in recruiting and training direct-hire Diplomatic Security (DS) personnel. DS agents require two years to recruit, hire, and train, while contractors can be deployed in 90 to 120 days. PSCs provide already trained security professionals for surge needs and can be easily scaled up or down based on changing requirements. The State Department relies on private security contractors (PSCs) to quickly meet security needs, but there is debate on whether this reliance should be a long-term strategy or a short-term solution. Some argue that PSCs have been essential in supplementing military personnel, especially in non-military tasks, while others suggest increasing full-time DS agents instead. The U.S. government turned to private contractors for assistance in meeting security needs in Iraq, utilizing their cultural and linguistic advantages over U.S. soldiers. This also helped avoid criticism from taxpayers for using soldiers to protect profit-making companies involved in reconstruction efforts. Private contractors are essential for U.S. reconstruction efforts in Iraq, as they provide capabilities that the military lacks. Analysts suggest that without contractor support, the U.S. may need to increase troop numbers or reinstate the draft. However, some question the long-term benefits of using private security providers. Analysts warn that reliance on private security contractors (PSCs) for guard duties could harm military force structure and mission capabilities. Reports suggest that PSCs hiring military personnel with high salaries may deplete the military of highly trained specialists. The use of private sector security providers may not significantly affect U.S. military capabilities, as evidenced by lower attrition rates in preferred specialties during high demand periods. However, individual decisions to leave the armed services can be influenced by various factors. Recent reports highlight possible complications for military commanders when using private security guards, as their primary mission is to ensure security for individuals, transport convoys, and property. This focus on security may lead to a disregard for the sensitivities and consequences for the Iraqi public, which could be problematic for U.S. commanders aiming to win \"hearts and minds\" in Iraq. The incidents discussed mainly involve American contractors, with proponents arguing that having a sizable presence of Iraqi security personnel under U.S. contracts helps reduce potential friction. Private security contractors under U.S. contracts reduce potential friction compared to using U.S. soldiers. Some argue that military forces have advantages in hostile situations, as they can respond more quickly to changing circumstances. However, contractors lack command and control from military commanders and cannot be reallocated during operations. Proponents argue that contractors are not employed on the battlefield where flexibility is crucial. Private security contractors hired by U.S. companies are known for providing high-quality personnel, but concerns arise about maintaining standards as demand increases. While some believe that using contractors may lower the quality of recruits compared to former U.S. military personnel, others argue that private companies can sustain top-quality individuals in the field for longer periods. They can draw from a larger and more competitive pool of personnel, including elite military veterans. Private security contractors hired by U.S. companies utilize a diverse pool of personnel, including former elite military and police personnel from other countries. Concerns exist about the high number of non-U.S. citizens hired, especially from lesser-developed countries, making screening more challenging. Companies lack comprehensive criminal background screenings for employees, and there are no established standards for qualifications. Proponents argue that companies have incentives to maintain quality through observation during training sessions. Private security contractors hired by U.S. companies utilize a diverse pool of personnel, including former elite military and police personnel from other countries. Concerns exist about the high number of non-U.S. citizens hired, especially from lesser-developed countries, making screening more challenging. U.S. government agencies establish baseline standards in contracts, specifying performance standards, experience requirements, and qualifications. Changes are mandated under threat of penalties if contracted personnel are not up to standard. Companies may proactively address client complaints, with an industry association reviewing and sanctioning members for violations. IPOA members include companies like ArmorGroup, DynCorp International, Erinys International, and EOD. Private security contractors hired by U.S. companies, such as ArmorGroup, DynCorp International, Erinys International, and EOD Technologies, Inc., enforce high standards and professionalism. Employees can be fired for various inappropriate behaviors, and the State Department requires relevant experience, strict vetting, training, and supervision for contractors in Iraq. Potential employees undergo screening by their employer before the State Department conducts background checks. Private security contractors hired by U.S. companies must undergo background checks and training before deployment. Applicants need experience in protective security, law enforcement, or military service. Supporters highlight the contractors' professionalism and the successful completion of missions in Baghdad. Private security contractors in Baghdad have been involved in missions within the secured Green Zone. There were 77 incidents where PSC personnel used weapons, with over 30 Blackwater employees killed. Supporters claim no American diplomat or visitor has been harmed while escorted by Blackwater. Ambassador Satterfield praised Blackwater's professionalism. The selection, vetting process, and training of PSCs should be continually reviewed. Human rights and cultural sensitivity training became mandatory after the 2007 Blackwater firing incident. Human rights and cultural sensitivity training has become part of pre-deployment training for private security contractors in Baghdad, along with other standard training such as Terrorist Operations and Defensive Driver Training. Former Blackwater employee believes cultural sensitivity training is unnecessary as their mission is different from the military and State Department. Proponents argue that private security contractors are as responsible as military personnel, while skeptics raise concerns about their reliability in certain situations. Private security contractors may be less reliable than military personnel in some situations due to lower costs if they refuse tasks. Concerns exist about oversight and coordination of military contractors, with transparency issues hindering Congress's ability to oversee their performance. The lack of transparency in U.S. government contracts with private security contractors has hindered Congress's oversight efforts. The executive branch has not provided sufficient information on these contracts, but there have been calls for greater transparency, leading to DOD and the State Department providing more information to Congress. The oversight of private security contractors in Operation Iraqi Freedom was described as a \"nightmare\" by industry professionals. There were concerns about inadequate supervision of contracts by U.S. agencies, attributed to a lack of qualified contracting oversight personnel. Calls were made for an increase in personnel to match the rising number of contractors. The Blackwater shooting incident at Nisoor Square in 2007 highlighted the need for better oversight of U.S. government private security contractors in Iraq. The Department of Defense took steps to improve contractor oversight, including establishing an Armed Contractor Oversight Division and increasing personnel for oversight. MNC-I consolidated rules for private security companies and issued guidance on management. The role of CORs in contracting agencies was emphasized for effective oversight. The Department of Defense has issued an order emphasizing the importance of appointing contracting office representatives with the appropriate rank for overseeing private security contractors. Congress has the power to ensure that these representatives have sufficient resources and training for their oversight responsibilities. The DS Regional Security Officer provides general oversight of security contractors, while the DS High Threat Protection Program personnel in Washington meets regularly to discuss security matters. The DS High Threat Protection Program personnel in Washington conducts periodic program management/contract compliance reviews of task order operations at posts. PSCs at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad must follow a defensive firearms policy with a seven-step escalation of force continuum. Incident reporting requirements to the RSO are in place for weapons discharges, attacks, serious injury, or death. Contractors must report any incidents reflecting negatively on the United States, the Department, the Embassy, or the contractor. The oversight and management of PSC procedures in Iraq are in place, but there are reports of embassy officials dismissing Iraqi complaints about Blackwater employees' actions. Blackwater is seen as untouchable due to State Department's support, even allowing them to operate without an Interior Ministry license. After the 2007 shooting in Nisoor Square, investigations were conducted, including a review panel led by Ambassador Patrick Kennedy. State Rice formed a review panel led by Ambassador Patrick Kennedy to examine the shooting incident and make recommendations. The panel found that improvements are needed in coordination and oversight of security operations in Iraq. The U.S. military does not see it feasible for the Department of Defense to take on security responsibilities in Iraq. The U.S. military's drawdown in Iraq will increase the need for personal protective services. The State Department is implementing new measures to oversee contractors' activities in Baghdad, including having DS Special Agents accompany security details outside the Green Zone. Additional agents are being sent to Baghdad to ensure adequate coverage. The State Department is implementing new measures in Baghdad, including DS agents accompanying security details outside the Green Zone. Measures include video monitoring, Arabic language staff requirement, cultural training for PSC employees, and stricter rules on the use of deadly force. The State Department is implementing new measures in Baghdad, including DS agents accompanying security details outside the Green Zone. Measures include video monitoring, Arabic language staff requirement, cultural training for PSC employees, and stricter rules on the use of deadly force. An \"Go Team\" of embassy security officials will quickly proceed to the scene of any weapons discharge involving State Department PSCs to gather information and provide analysis. An Embassy Joint Incident Review Board will review all incidents involving contractor use of deadly force and recommend whether the use of force was justified. A working group was established between the Regional Security Office and Multi-National Force-Iraq to develop operational procedures and exchange information. A Memorandum of Agreement was signed by Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England regarding the management of Private Security Companies (PSCs) in Iraq. The MOA defined authority and responsibility for accountability and operations of U.S. PSCs in Iraq. The Secretary of Defense and Combatant Commanders are responsible for the security of DOD elements and personnel under their control. The Secretary of State is responsible for the security of U.S. government personnel in Iraq. Both Secretaries will develop core standards for Private Security Companies (PSCs), including personnel management, coordination of operations, legal accountability, and investigative jurisdiction. The MOA between the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State outlines the investigation of PSC personnel conduct, consultation on common threats, dispute resolution, and the designation of Washington representatives. ANNEX A details the operational aspects of the MOA, including a warning system for PSCs in threatening situations. Key elements include common definitions for Defense of Self. The MOA/Deliverables outline common definitions for Defense of Self or Others, Imminent Threat, Hostile Act, and Hostile Intent, as well as the authority to possess and carry firearms. It includes coordination of PSC details outside secure areas, immediate response steps to serious incidents, and an agreement for State and DOD collaboration. The GAO has issued reports on DOD contracting in Iraq, highlighting issues with private security contractors not coordinating with the military. Military commanders lack command and control over contractors, leading to challenges in promoting order in the theater of operations. In a 2006 testimony, GAO officials identified problems with coordination between private security providers and the military in Iraq. In March 2007, DOD implemented a new requirement for companies to enter data on their personnel into SPOT before deployment. The coordination between military and private security personnel was managed by the Reconstruction Operations Center (ROC), which is now handled by Contractor Operations Cells. The agencies have worked to coordinate the movement of PSCs throughout Iraq, including giving advance notification to MNC-I of details operating outside the Green Zone. The Department of Defense and State Department have implemented measures to better manage Private Security Companies (PSCs) in Iraq. PSC movements are now coordinated with MNC-I, leading to a 67% decrease in shooting incidents. The impact of these efforts on reducing violence in Iraq is unclear. The Government Accountability Office report found that steps have been taken to increase oversight and coordination over Private Security Companies (PSCs) in Iraq since the Nisoor Square incident. The report highlighted improvements in coordination between the Department of Defense (DOD), State Department, and the Government of Iraq, but expressed concerns about DOD's ability to sustain staffing and training efforts for PSC management. The State Department and Congress are monitoring the implementation of recommendations for overseeing Private Security Companies (PSCs) in Iraq. Changes in weapons discharge and complaints from Iraqi and U.S. government personnel may indicate the need for further oversight. Lessons learned in Iraq should be applied to other locations where PSCs are used for security. The use of private security companies in providing security has not been comprehensively analyzed by agencies. Cost comparisons between contractors, U.S. servicemembers, and State Department Diplomatic Security Agents lack detailed information on underlying assumptions and factors involved. The direct cost advantage of contractors can vary depending on circumstances and contract conditions, including salaries, benefits, and negotiated terms. Private security contractors are not paid for benefits like health insurance or long-term liabilities such as disability compensation and pensions by the U.S. government. Some analysts argue that the total costs of private security contracts are underestimated because they do not include the subsidy provided by the U.S. government to contracting companies. Proponents claim that using private security contractors is cheaper than using U.S. military forces because they can hire locals and third-country nationals at lower wages. Private security contractors in Iraq keep costs low by employing many Iraqis, but a congressional analysis found that the total cost can be higher than using U.S. military personnel due to markups and other charges. According to a State Department official, the fully loaded cost for an American diplomat or DS agent serving in Iraq is around $1 million, compared to $400,000 for a regular mission worldwide. In August 2008, a report by the CBO compared the costs of security contracts between Blackwater and the State Department to those of equivalent U.S. military forces. The report estimated that the costs of private security contractors did not differ significantly from military units. The report highlighted that maintaining a military unit in peacetime would incur carrying costs, while a contract with a private security contractor could be terminated. The use of private companies, including those employing non-U.S. citizens, to legally use force on behalf of the United States has foreign policy implications. Many analysts debate whether the sanctioned private use of force undermines the state's monopoly on force and its impact on U.S. foreign policy. The involvement of private companies in combat operations may hinder recognition of contractors' rights under the Geneva Conventions. The use of private companies could be seen as a weaker commitment compared to national military forces. Legislation addresses contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, with provisions affecting private security contracts. Section 808 mandates an independent review of service contracts. Section 841 of P.L. 110-181 establishes a special Commission on Wartime Contracting to investigate federal agency contracting for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Commission assesses reliance on contractors, waste, fraud, abuse, and the organizational structure of the Departments of Defense and State for contingency contract management. An interim report is due March 1, 2009, with a final report due later. The Commission on Wartime Contracting is required to submit an interim report by March 1, 2009, and a final report within two years of all members' appointment. Regulations must be established by the Secretary of Defense within 120 days for personnel performing private security functions in combat areas, including processes for registration, weapon authorization, investigations of incidents, and guidance for commanders. Section 861 mandates a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Administrator of USAID by July 1, 2008, for contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. It includes authorizing carrying weapons, setting qualifications for personnel, and rules on deadly force. The MOU also outlines responsibilities for investigating possible violations of MEJA by contractor personnel and establishes a common database for contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Section 862 requires revisions to Federal Acquisition Regulations for all contracts and subcontracts involving personnel. The Federal Acquisition Regulations now require contracts and subcontracts to comply with regulations for personnel. H.R. 1585 was introduced as a predecessor to H.R. 4986 on March 20, 2007, and went through various stages before being passed by the Senate with amendments on October 1, 2007. The Conference Report was filed on December 6, 2007, and the recommendations were agreed upon in both the House and Senate. President Bush vetoed H.R. 1585 on December 28, 2007, due to objections to provisions not relevant to the report. A modified version, H.R. 4986, was passed by both the House and Senate in January 2008. President Bush signed H.R. 4985 into law as P.L. 110-181 on January 28, 2008. Section 864 defines private security functions as guarding personnel, facilities, or property, or any other activity requiring contractors to be armed. The DOD lacks accountability and management of contracted services, with additional funding provided to the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Funding of $48 million has been allocated to the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency, and the Defense Inspector General to enhance staffing for contractor management and oversight. The Department of Defense is urged to improve contract services management by implementing clear accountability mechanisms, short chains of command, and better tracking of costs and performance. The Secretary of Defense is directed to establish uniform personnel standards for contracted personnel and penalties for noncompliance within 90 days. The House and Senate approved legislation to establish rules for contracted security personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. The legislation also mandates a government-wide definition for \"inherently governmental functions\" and prohibits contractors from performing these functions in combat areas. The House and Senate approved legislation to establish rules for contracted security personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, including prohibiting private security contractors from performing inherently governmental functions in combat areas. The legislation also requires reporting of weapon discharges and non-lethal countermeasures by private security contractors. The legislation approved by the House and Senate establishes rules for contracted security personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, prohibiting private security contractors from performing inherently governmental functions in combat areas. It also requires reporting of specified offenses and prohibits contractors from interrogating prisoners during or after hostilities. The Senate considered S. 3001 on August 1, 2008, with a Cloture motion failing to receive sufficient votes. S. 2147 expands the coverage of the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act to include all persons employed under a contract awarded by any U.S. department or agency in regions where the Armed Forces are conducting a contingency. The bill mandates the FBI to establish a \"Theater Investigative Unit\" for each contingency operation where contract personnel are working to investigate misconduct. The Department of Justice Inspector General must report to Congress within 30 days on alleged abuses by contract personnel. Introduced on October 4, 2007, the bill is similar to H.R. 2740 and has been referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. The bill requires the FBI to establish a \"Theater Investigative Unit\" for each contingency operation involving contract personnel working outside the United States. The Department of Justice Inspector General must report to Congress within 30 days on alleged abuses by contract personnel. Introduced on June 15, 2007. The bill introduced on June 15, 2007, addresses alleged abuses by contract personnel. It was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and later amended before being passed by the House on October 4, 2007. The amended version includes a new section to protect intelligence activities. The bill introduced on June 15, 2007, addresses alleged abuses by contract personnel, requiring information on U.S. government contractors and subcontractors in Afghanistan and Iraq. It includes provisions for tracking personnel, improving coordination with the U.S. Armed Forces, and clarifying the legal status of contract personnel. The bill introduced on February 16, 2007, aims to regulate private security contractors by setting hiring standards, equipment guidance, and cost reporting requirements. It also seeks to improve coordination between contractors and the U.S. Armed Forces and extend the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) to cover contractors employed under government contracts. The bill introduced on January 10, 2007, known as H.R. 3695, extends the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) to cover contractors working under government contracts outside the United States in regions where the Armed Forces are conducting contingency operations. It also includes provisions related to the support of the Department of Defense (DOD) mission overseas. H.R. 3695 introduced on June 19, 2007, prohibits increasing private security contractors in Iraq. H.R. 4102 and S. 2398 mandate U.S. government personnel for security at diplomatic missions in Iraq within six months. President must report on transitioning from private contractors by January 1, 2009, in conflict zones authorized for force use. Renewed contracts require presidential approval. The President must report to committees if agencies lack personnel for essential functions, certifying contract employees meet standards. Congressional access to contracts and reports on Iraq and Afghanistan contracts are provided. H.R. 4102 and S. 2398 were introduced in 2007, addressing security at diplomatic missions in Iraq. H.Res. 97 calls for reports on military and reconstruction funds in Iraq, U.S. contracts, and the creation of a \"Truman Commission\" for ongoing investigation. Introduced on January 24, 2007, referred to House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, with a hearing held on March 20, 2007."
