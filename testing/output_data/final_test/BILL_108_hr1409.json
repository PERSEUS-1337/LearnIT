    "content": "The Act titled \"Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Land Exchange Act of 2003\" is established for the purpose of facilitating a land exchange. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians proposes a land exchange with the National Park Service to acquire the Yellow Face tract, benefiting the public by adding 218 acres of land adjacent to the Blue Ridge Parkway. The National Park Service would benefit from acquiring the Yellow Face tract to preserve important views, habitat for endangered species, wetland seeps, and prevent residential development. The proposed land exchange would also allow the Eastern Band to acquire the Ravensford tract, adding 143 acres to their trust territory in Cherokee, North Carolina. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has a critical need to replace the current Cherokee Elementary School, which is overcrowded and in poor condition. They plan to build a new three-school campus to preserve Cherokee language and culture alongside the standard curriculum, benefiting the American public. The land exchange will reunify tribal reservation lands, preserving Cherokee traditions and fostering a modern Indian nation. The Ravensford tract has no threatened species, while the Yellow Face tract has listed species and a higher value. The Eastern Band commits to mitigating impacts on natural and cultural resources. The Congress and the Department of the Interior have approved land exchanges in the past when the benefits to the public and requesting party are clear. The purposes of this Act are to acquire the Yellow Face tract for protection by the National Park Service and transfer the Ravensford tract to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for an education facility. The Act aims to acquire the Yellow Face tract for protection by the National Park Service and transfer the Ravensford tract to the Cherokee Indians for an education facility promoting cultural integrity and reunifying communities. It also seeks to foster cooperative activities and partnerships between the Eastern Band and the National Park Service within the Cherokee's ancestral homelands. The Act includes a provision for a land exchange. The Act includes a provision for a land exchange where the Secretary of the Interior will exchange the Ravensford tract in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway for the Yellow Face tract near the Waterrock Knob Visitor Center.

The Yellow Face tract will include Parcels 88 and 89 of the Hornbuckle Tract, Yellow Face Section, Qualla. Upon completion of the land exchange, the Secretary will adjust the boundary of the Blue Ridge Parkway to include the Yellow Face Tract, consisting of approximately 218 acres.

The descriptions will be available for public inspection at the National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs offices. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. The Director of the National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians will collaborate on government-to-government agreements and protocols for reviewing construction on the Ravensford tract. The National Park Service can also enter into cooperative agreements with the Eastern Band for training, management, and preservation of natural and cultural resources on the tract. The National Park Service and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians will develop standards for construction on the Ravensford tract, focusing on size, impact, and design. The standards will prioritize environmental sustainability and minimize adverse impacts on natural and cultural resources. Development will be limited to a road, utility corridor, educational campus, and necessary infrastructure, with no new structures in designated areas.
