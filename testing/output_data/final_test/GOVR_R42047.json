    "content": "The federal government, states, and private agencies historically separated Indian children from their tribes and families to \"civilize\" them or provide better lives. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) was passed in 1978 to address the high rate of separation of Indian children from their families. Approximately 25-35% of Indian children were placed in foster homes, adoptive homes, or institutions, leading to a shocking disparity in placement rates between Indians and non-Indians. The committee expressed concern about Indian children traumatized by removal from their families and adjusting to a different social and cultural environment. Social workers often make inappropriate decisions due to ignorance of Indian cultural values, leading to unnecessary removals. The ICWA aims to protect the best interests of Indian children and promote fair processes in child welfare cases. The ICWA aims to protect the best interests of Indian children and promote the stability of Indian tribes and families. It recognizes Indian children as vital to tribal existence and gives preference to keeping them with their families or tribes. The ICWA establishes federal standards for child removal to achieve these policy goals. The ICWA establishes federal standards for child removal from Indian families, reflecting cultural values and providing procedural protections in custody proceedings. It applies to involuntary child custody cases, including foster care, termination of parental rights, preadoptive, and adoptive placements. It does not cover placements resulting from juvenile crimes or custody determinations in divorce proceedings. The ICWA applies to both involuntary and voluntary child custody proceedings, defining an \"Indian child\" as a member or eligible for membership in an Indian tribe. The BIA Guidelines require state courts to verify a child's status with the BIA or the tribe. Tribal determinations are conclusive, and some states use the \"existing Indian family\" doctrine to apply the ICWA. The \"existing Indian family\" doctrine is used by courts in seven states to determine ICWA applicability based on the child and parents' relationship with their tribe. Kansas Supreme Court formulated the doctrine to prioritize maintaining family and tribal relationships for Indian children. Alabama courts have specific limitations on its application. The Alabama courts have limited the existing Indian family doctrine to unmarried parents and non-Indian mothers placing children for adoption. The Kentucky Supreme Court applied the doctrine to a child under tribal court jurisdiction but living with a non-Indian family. The existing Indian family doctrine is applied differently in various states, with some courts rejecting it. Louisiana and Nevada have applied the doctrine to deprive Indian mothers of their rights under the ICWA, while Kansas and South Dakota have since rejected it. Other states like Washington, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Iowa have rejected it through legislation to protect the best interests of Native American children. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) provides standards for terminating parental rights, preferences for placing Indian children in Indian homes, and protections for parents and tribes in court proceedings. Parental rights can be terminated voluntarily or involuntarily for reasons like abandonment or abuse. ICWA limits involuntary termination of parental rights by state courts. Section 1912(f) of the ICWA sets a higher standard of proof for state courts to involuntarily terminate parental rights, requiring evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian would likely result in serious harm to the child. This standard aims to prevent biased evidence and protect Indian parents from unfair termination of their rights. The ICWA aims to end the removal of Indian children from their homes based on stereotypes. Section 1912 requires expert testimony to prevent bias against Indian families. The House Report highlighted the need for these standards with statistical evidence of physical abuse in just 1% of cases. The ICWA aims to limit the removal of Indian children from their homes to cases presenting a real danger. Expert testimony is required to prevent bias, especially in cases of physical abuse. In Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, the Supreme Court clarified that Section 1912(f) does not apply when a parent never had custody. The biological mother, a non-Indian, placed her child for adoption with a non-Indian couple in South Carolina without the biological father's knowledge. The father, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, contested the adoption when he found out, leading to a legal battle where the burden was on the adoptive couple to prove harm if the child was returned to the father. The Supreme Court reversed the state courts' decision regarding the custody of the Indian child, stating that Section 1912(f) did not apply as the father never had physical or legal custody. Section 1915 establishes the order of preference for placement of Indian children in adoption proceedings. In state court adoption proceedings, preference is given to placing Indian children with extended family, tribe members, or other Indian families. Section 1915 applies to all adoptions, voluntary and involuntary, and some view these preferences as a departure from federal policy on race matching. Good cause exceptions include the child's or parents' request, expert testimony on the child's needs, and diligent search for suitable families. The burden of establishing good cause falls on the party seeking to avoid the preferences. In state court adoption proceedings, preference is given to placing Indian children with extended family, tribe members, or other Indian families. The states are divided on whether the best interests of the child constitute good cause to depart from the placement preferences. State courts that find good cause based on the child's best interests generally prioritize permanent placement, while those that reject this basis focus on the child's identity as an Indian and the tribe's interest. The Supreme Court ruled in Adoptive Couple that ICWA placement preferences apply only when multiple parties seek to adopt the Indian child. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) provides procedural protections for parents, tribes, and Indian custodians in state court proceedings. Consent for voluntary placement or termination of parental rights must be in writing, recorded before a judge, and accompanied by a certificate. Congress found that states were coercing waivers of parental rights and obtaining consent from uninformed parents. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) requires written consent for voluntary placement or termination of parental rights, certified by a judge. Consent given within ten days after birth is invalid, and Indian parents can withdraw consent at any time before final decree. They have two years to withdraw consent after final decree if obtained through fraud or duress. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) allows parents to withdraw consent and petition the court to vacate the adoption if obtained through fraud or duress, providing incentives for knowing and free consent. This creates uncertainty about the finality of adoptions of Indian children and affords more procedural protections to Indian birth parents than non-Indian birth parents. Due process includes notice of the state's proposed actions, especially in the context of Indian children. The conflict between Indian and non-Indian social systems can hinder due process, especially in cases involving Indian children. The extended family's involvement in child rearing strengthens community commitment but may delay the nuclear family's response to outside agencies assuming custody. Section 1912(a) of the Indian Child Welfare Act mandates notification of parents and tribes in involuntary termination proceedings in state court. This ensures that parents are informed and have the opportunity for due process. Section 1912(a) of the Indian Child Welfare Act requires notification of parents and tribes in termination proceedings to allow for meaningful participation and challenge of parental rights termination or child removal. The Secretary of the Interior must be notified if the parent's identity or location is unknown, with a 15-day response window. State courts can grant up to 20 additional days upon request before proceeding, and Indian custodians or tribes have the right to intervene at any point in the process. The Indian Child Welfare Act allows tribes and Indian custodians to intervene in termination proceedings to ensure meaningful participation and challenge of parental rights termination. This right applies to both involuntary and voluntary terminations, with tribes more likely to intervene in involuntary proceedings. Family members without legal recognition can also intervene under section 1911(c) to protect their relationship with the child. Granting Indian custodians and tribes the right to intervene as parties under the ICWA increases the likelihood of Indian children staying in their communities. The ICWA also provides the right to counsel for indigent parents or custodians challenging child removal or parental rights termination. Section 1912(b) ensures court-appointed counsel for indigent parents or custodians, with the option for the court to appoint counsel for the child if deemed in their best interest. If state law does not provide for counsel, the Secretary of the Interior can pay fees upon certification from the judge. Section 1912(c) of the ICWA allows any party involved in a foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding to examine all reports and documents filed with the court. This ensures that decisions are based on evidence that all parties have had the opportunity to review. Additionally, Section 1912(d) requires the party seeking termination of parental rights to demonstrate efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian family through remedial services and rehabilitative programs. Section 1912(d) of the ICWA mandates active efforts to prevent the breakup of Indian families before terminating parental rights, including involving the extended family and tribe. In a case where no active efforts were made, the Supreme Court ruled that this provision does not apply when an Indian parent abandons a child before birth. The ICWA allows federal court review of state court decisions, with Section 1914 stating that a child, parent, or tribe can petition to invalidate actions violating the ICWA. Federal courts can review and invalidate state court decrees for improper jurisdiction or failure to allow intervention. The ICWA allows federal court review of state court decisions for violations such as failure to allow intervention, lack of full faith and credit to tribal court decrees, and lack of procedural rights for Indian custodians or tribes. Tribes or Indian parties seeking to invalidate state court decisions under the ICWA have faced mixed results in federal courts. Review of tribal court decrees in federal court is only allowed after exhausting remedies in tribal court. Foster care involves temporary placement of a child with a licensed caregiver when removed from home. When a child is removed from their home and made a ward of the state or tribe, the foster care giver takes on day-to-day responsibility while the state or tribe makes legal decisions. Section 1912(e) sets the standard of proof for removing an Indian child from their home and placing them in foster care, requiring \"clear and convincing evidence\" that continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian would likely result in serious harm to the child. This standard is higher than the usual \"preponderance of evidence\" required for due process in most states. The BIA Guidelines set a \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard for foster care placement of non-Indian children, requiring specific conditions in the home likely to result in harm to the child. Section 1915(b) mandates placement in proximity to home, in a family-like setting meeting the child's special needs. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) provides preferences for placement of Indian children in foster care, prioritizing placement with extended family members or within the child's tribe. These preferences aim to keep Indian children in their cultural environment. Parents and tribes have procedural rights in foster care placement proceedings similar to those in parental rights termination proceedings. Tribal courts have jurisdiction over custody proceedings. The ICWA recognizes tribal court jurisdiction over custody proceedings involving Indian children, both exclusive and concurrent, ensuring that tribal court orders are respected by other jurisdictions. Before Congress passed the ICWA, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized tribal courts' exclusive jurisdiction over adoptions involving tribal members on reservations. In Fisher v. District Court of the Sixteenth Judicial District of Montana, tribal members sought to adopt a child through a state court proceeding, but the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction. The Supreme Court established the test for state court jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed tribal courts' exclusive jurisdiction over adoptions involving tribal members on reservations, citing the Tribe's right to govern itself independently of state law. The Court noted that tribal courts were established under the Indian Reorganization Act, preempting any state jurisdiction over tribal adoptions. The Court also rejected claims of racial discrimination, stating that the tribal court's exclusivity is based on the Tribe's \"quasi-sovereign status\" under federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed tribal courts' exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings involving Indian children residing on reservations, based on the Tribe's \"quasi-sovereign status\" under federal law. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) grants tribes exclusive jurisdiction over such cases, preventing parents from bypassing tribal court by going to state court. Section 1911(a) grants tribal courts exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children who are wards of the tribal court, regardless of residence. Tribes in P.L. 280 states can seek approval from the Secretary of the Interior to reassume jurisdiction over child custody proceedings. The ICWA determines a child's domicile or residence based on the parents' domicile. In Mississippi Band of Choctaw v. Holyfield, the Supreme Court considered tribal court jurisdiction over voluntary cases. In ICWA, the Supreme Court ruled that tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the voluntary termination of parental rights and adoption of Indian children, even if the children were not born on the reservation. The Court determined that domicile or residence for Indian children is based on the parents' residence, not state law. Congress intended for a uniform federal standard to determine domicile for Indian children under ICWA. The ICWA ensures tribal jurisdiction over the voluntary termination of parental rights and adoption of Indian children, emphasizing the tribe's interest in the child's welfare. It mandates state courts to transfer child custody proceedings to tribal court upon petition, unless there are objections or good cause shown. The Supreme Court highlighted the tribal interest in Indian children as a core principle of the ICWA. The ICWA mandates state courts to transfer child custody proceedings to tribal court unless there are objections or good cause shown. Good cause is not defined by the ICWA, allowing state courts flexibility in making determinations. The BIA Guidelines outline circumstances constituting good cause, such as lack of tribal court, advanced stage of proceedings, objections from older children, undue hardship on parties or witnesses, or minimal contact with the tribe. Courts are divided on considering the child's best interest in determining good cause under the ICWA. Proposed amendments aim to ensure tribal notice, limited tribal intervention in adoptions, and criminal penalties for misrepresentation. Bills have clarified tribal court jurisdiction and extended it to tribes in P.L. 280 states and tribes without reservations. Only one bill has been introduced to limit the ICWA. The ICWA has had success in reducing the removal of Indian children from their homes and their placement in non-Indian homes. However, Indian children are still placed in foster care at a higher rate than non-Indian children. In 2008, Congress passed a law allowing tribes to receive direct funding for foster care and adoption assistance. It is too early to determine the impact of this increased funding. Increased funding for tribes may improve their ability to protect children while also safeguarding tribal interests."
