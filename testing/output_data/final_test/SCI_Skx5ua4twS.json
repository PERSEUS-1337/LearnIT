    "content": "The carbon footprint of NLP research is increasing due to large neural networks. Distillation compresses models for efficiency. Teacher-student distillation improves the Biaffine dependency parser's speed and accuracy. Compression to 20% of parameters only slightly decreases performance but is much faster. Compression to 80% even improves performance on some treebanks. Recent attention in NLP research has focused on the environmental impact of AI development, particularly in relation to deep neural networks. Efforts are being made to create more efficient and cost-effective models that are also accurate, allowing for easier deployment across different computational platforms. In contrast to the trend of making models bigger and better, this study explores teacher-student distillation to improve the efficiency of neural network systems for dependency parsing in NLP. The researchers use a state-of-the-art Biaffine parser and find that distillation maintains accuracy close to the full model while achieving better accuracy than equivalent model size reductions. The study explores teacher-student distillation for efficient neural network systems in dependency parsing. It achieves better accuracy than model size reductions, compressing a parser to 20% of its parameters with minimal loss in accuracy and faster speed. Dependency parsing encodes syntactic relations in a sentence as a tree structure, benefiting various NLP tasks. The Biaffine parser by Dozat & Manning (2016) offers a good balance between accuracy and speed in dependency parsing on the English Penn Treebank. Direct comparisons of parsing speed are complex due to various factors like hardware differences. Biaffine-D\u03c0, a distillation method, achieves high accuracy while compressing the model to a smaller size. The text discusses speed measurements of various parsers, including a PyTorch implementation of the Biaffine parser, the UUParser, a sequence-labelling dependency parser, and distilled Biaffine parsers. The measurements were conducted locally with a single CPU core and GloVe 100 dimension embeddings. The text discusses the Biaffine parser, a graph-based parser with a deep self-attention mechanism, used in experiments. Model compression techniques for neural networks have been studied, including weight pruning methods to reduce network size without significant performance impact. Model compression techniques for neural networks have been studied, including weight pruning methods to reduce network size without significant performance impact. Hagiwara (1994) and Wan et al. (2009) utilized magnitude-based pruning to increase network generalization. See et al. (2016) used absolute-magnitude pruning to compress neural machine translation systems by 40% with minimal loss in performance. Sparse tensors could be used for network layers to decrease computational complexity, but current deep learning libraries lack this feature. Anwar et al. (2017) introduced structured pruning for convolutional networks. Voita et al. (2019) pruned the heads of the attention mechanism in their neural machine translation system and found that the remaining heads were linguistically salient with respect to syntax. Model compression techniques for neural networks have been studied, including weight pruning methods to reduce network size without significant performance impact. Ba & Caruana (2014) and Hinton et al. (2015) developed distillation as a means of network compression, transferring knowledge from a large network (teacher) to a smaller one (student). This technique has been successfully used in NLP for various tasks like machine translation and language modeling. Other compression techniques like low-rank approximation decomposition and vector quantization have also been explored. Model distillation involves training a smaller model using patterns learned from a larger original model. The smaller model, known as the student, utilizes information from the larger model, the teacher, by comparing the distribution of their output layers. Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to calculate the loss between the teacher and student models. The student model learns from the teacher model's probability distributions for arc and label predictions, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of unlikely scenarios. In addition to the teacher's distributions, the student is trained using cross entropy loss on gold labels in the training data. The student model is trained using cross entropy loss on predicted head positions and arc labels, as well as the teacher's probability distributions. The Biaffine parser is trained on Universal Treebanks v2.4 and compressed using teacher-student distillation method. The model utilizes universal part-of-speech tags and gold sentence segmentation/tokenization for training and runtime. The data used is a subset of UD treebanks from v2.4, with some modifications for linguistic features and dataset sizes. Kazakh is exchanged with Uyghur, and Ancient-Greek-Proiel is also replaced. The study exchanged Kazakh with Uyghur and Ancient-Greek-Proiel with Ancient-Greek-Perseus to include more non-projective arcs. Wolof was added to represent African languages. Pretrained word embeddings were used from FastText, Ginter et al., and Heinzerling & Strube. Raunak's algorithm was used to reduce embeddings to 100 dimensions. Two baseline models were acquired for each treebank. The study involved training models with different compression techniques: Baseline 1 had no compression, Baseline 2 had equivalent sizes of distilled models (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% of original size), and Distilled models were created using the teacher-student method. Salient features statistics were also provided for each UD treebank used. The study compared the performance of models with different compression techniques on UD treebanks using unlabelled attachment score (UAS) and labelled attachment score (LAS) as evaluation metrics. Speed was evaluated using a single CPU core or GPU. Hardware used included an Intel Core i7-7700 CPU and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU. The study evaluated the performance of models with various compression techniques on UD treebanks using UAS and LAS as evaluation metrics. Speed was assessed on CPU and GPU in terms of sentences per second and tokens per second. The number of trainable parameters of each distilled model was compared to the baseline model. Average attachment scores across all treebanks for distilled models were shown relative to the size of the model compared to the original full model. The study compared the performance of distilled models to full models on UD treebanks, showing a clear gap in performance with distilled models having higher UAS and LAS scores. Distilled models can be compressed to 60% with no loss in performance, and even at 20% compression, only a slight decrease in performance is observed. Figures 3a and 3b illustrate the differences in UAS and LAS for models compressed to 20% and 80% compared to baseline models. Distilled models consistently outperform equivalent-sized baselines across all treebanks. The study compared the performance of distilled models on UD treebanks, showing a gap in performance with distilled models having higher UAS and LAS scores. Some treebanks suffer more when compressed to 20%, e.g. Finnish-TDT and Ancient-Greek-Perseus, due to non-projective arcs. However, smaller treebanks like Tamil-TTB and Wolof-WTB increase in accuracy with distillation, likely due to over-fitting with larger models. Most treebanks lose less than a point for UAS and LAS when distilled to 80%. The distilled models show a smaller increase in performance compared to the full baseline, especially for larger models. However, the Tamil-TTB and Wolof-WTB treebanks exhibit greater improvement with distillation. The number of trainable parameters for each distilled model is shown in Table 3, as there is no existing method to calculate FPO for neural network layers like LSTMs. These numbers are independent of hardware and closely related to memory usage. The number of trainable model parameters for distilled models is shown in Table 3, which is independent of hardware and correlates with memory usage. Parsing speeds on CPU and GPU for different batch sizes are compared, with the bottleneck being loading data onto the GPU for batch sizes less than \u223c1000 sentences. When using a batch size of 4096 sentences, parsing speed increases by 21% on GPU compared to the full baseline model. Smaller batch sizes are needed for speed increases on CPU, with even a batch size of 32 sentences doubling the speed. A distilled model compressed to 20% boosts parsing speed by 126% compared to the baseline at a batch size of 4096 sentences. The cost in accuracy is minimal compared to the significant increase in parsing speed. The teacher-student distillation technique maintains accuracy of the baseline model while achieving real compression and practical increases in parsing speed. Distilled models outperform the fastest parser using sequence labeling, with a 4x speed increase on CPU when compressed to 20%. However, there is a slight decrease in accuracy compared to sequence labeling accuracies. Distillation could be a more efficient way of finding optimal hyperparameters depending on available data. Distillation techniques can improve model efficiency by altering the structure of distilled models, making them more environmentally friendly. This technique can be expanded to other NLP tasks, such as compressing BERT into task-specific models for better performance. BERT can be made more efficient by compressing it into task-specific models, reducing environmental impact. The teacher-student distillation technique was used for dependency parsing, resulting in parsing speeds up to 2.26x faster on CPU and 1.21x faster on GPU with minimal loss in accuracy. The smallest model achieved these results with only 20% of the original model's parameters, significantly reducing its environmental impact."
