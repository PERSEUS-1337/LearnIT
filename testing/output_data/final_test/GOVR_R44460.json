    "content": "The 114th Congress is considering funding to control the spread of the Zika virus, which is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and sexual contact. Zika has been linked to severe birth defects and health concerns. Local transmission has occurred in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and south Florida, with travel-associated cases reported in nearly every state. Federal efforts include research, mosquito control, vaccine development, and public messaging to prevent infection, focusing on protecting pregnant women to prevent birth defects. The Administration and Congress are addressing the Zika virus outbreak to prevent birth defects. Funding concerns are raised as cases increase in the United States. The report discusses the Administration's actions on Zika response funding, including supplemental appropriations and reprogramming of existing funds. Congressional measures for Zika response funding are also covered, along with details on the Administration's supplemental request and unobligated Ebola funds. The Obama Administration requested over $1.89 billion in supplemental funding for the Zika outbreak on February 22, 2016. The emergency request included funds for HHS, USAID, and the Department of State, with the possibility of transferring appropriations to other federal agencies for flexibility. The Obama Administration requested over $1.89 billion in supplemental funding for the Zika outbreak on February 22, 2016, including funds for HHS, USAID, and the Department of State. The request aimed to provide greater flexibility and authority for direct hiring and contracting. $589 million was identified from existing Ebola resources for immediate Zika response efforts. USAID redirected $295 million from FY2015 unobligated Ebola Economic Support Funds to control the Zika virus. $158 million went to CDC for Zika and Ebola response, while $137 million funded USAID Zika response activities. HHS Secretary redirected an additional $81 million for Zika vaccine development, with $34 million from NIH. $34 million was drawn from NIH accounts, and $47 million from unspecified accounts at ACF, CMS, and SAMHSA. HHS Secretary repurposed $374 million for domestic Zika control activities, with $354 million distributed to CDC for various activities including field staff, state response teams, Zika virus testing, tracking of pregnant women infected with Zika, and grants for mosquito control and prevention. The Congress allocated $47 million to NIH for Zika vaccine development and $85 million to BARDA for private sector development of Zika vaccines and treatments. Additional funding was provided for continued clinical trials and private sector Zika vaccine development. Congress resolved its consideration of Zika funding on September 28, 2016, with the passage of H.R. 5325. Congress passed H.R. 5325 on September 28, 2016, which included $1.1 billion in FY2016 Zika supplemental funding. The bill also incorporated appropriations for Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, a short-term continuing resolution for FY2017, and rescissions. Various Zika supplemental funding proposals were considered before the passage of H.R. 5325. The House and Senate passed various acts related to Zika funding in 2016, including H.R. 2577 and H.R. 5325. The conference report included the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016. Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations for FY2017 and EPA regulations were not discussed in this report. The CRS report compares Zika response funding proposals in different legislative vehicles. The House introduced the Zika Response Appropriations Act, 2016, providing $622.1 million. The bill, known as H.R. 5243, allocated $622.1 million for Zika response efforts until September 30, 2016. It included provisions for domestic and international response, with a significant portion designated as an emergency requirement. The House passed the bill without amendment on May 18, 2016. Senate action on Zika funding was initially part of the FY2017 Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development appropriations bills. The Senate adopted H.R. 2577 on May 19, 2016, with $1.1 billion in funds for Zika response and preparedness. The bill included provisions for Zika funds available until September 30, 2017, with Global Health Funds available until expended. There were smaller rescissions of Ebola-related appropriations and no rescissions affecting HHS accounts. Provisions in H.R. 2577 were subject to the same requirements as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. On June 22, 2016, a conference agreement was filed by Harold Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. The conference agreement (Division B) accompanying H.R. 2577 provided $1.1 billion in Zika response funding, with allocations to HHS and State/USAID accounts similar to the Senate proposal. Provisions in the agreement were subject to the same requirements as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. Controversy arose over specific provisions, including the purposes of funding for the Social Services Block Grant and rescinding certain funds from the Affordable Care Act. The conference agreement accompanying H.R. 2577 allocated $1.1 billion in Zika response funding, with specific provisions for the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds. Concerns were raised about limiting funds to public health departments and hospitals, potentially excluding entities like Planned Parenthood. Some states or territories could still allocate funds to Planned Parenthood if they were eligible providers in a public health plan, but there were limitations, such as in the case of Puerto Rico's Profamilias not receiving Medicaid funding. Planned Parenthood Federation affiliate, Profamilias, does not receive Medicaid funding. The conference agreement on Zika funding was agreed to by the House on June 23, 2016, but the Senate did not invoke cloture on the measure. Subsequent discussions did not yield an alternative agreement, leading to concerns about the reprogrammed funds and the need for Zika supplemental funding. The Senate voted multiple times on Zika funding, with a substitute amendment offering $1.1 billion for Zika response in FY2016. The Senate passed a bill with $933.0 million for HHS and $175.1 million for the Department of State and USAID. $75 million is allocated to the PHSSEF for Zika-related health care costs. The $75 million allocated to the PHSSEF for Zika-related health care costs does not specify providers eligible for reimbursement. Funds are to be provided to states, territories, Indian Tribes, or Tribal Organizations with CDC-confirmed Zika cases or local transmission. $60 million is reserved for territories with the highest Zika transmission rates. Division B funding is subject to Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 requirements, including prohibitions on abortion funding. Division D rescinds $400 million in budget authority, with $231.9 million designated as an emergency. Division D of H.R. 5325 rescinds $168 million of unspent ACA funds intended for establishing exchanges in territories, a lesser amount than the conference report's proposal. The bill does not include provisions from the House-passed version of H.R. 2577 for waiving Clean Water Act permit requirements for pesticide use against Zika. Despite reported congressional agreement on Zika funding, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the measure. An agreement was reached to address assistance for Flint during congressional consideration of a different vehicle, H.R. 5303. H.R. 5325 passed in both chambers on September 28, 2016. For more information on the Zika virus outbreak, refer to CRS Report R44595 and websites like CDC, WHO, and PAHO. The Administration's emergency supplemental appropriations request for Zika response efforts includes a total of $1.509 billion for Health and Human Services. The request aims to prevent, prepare for, and respond to Zika virus and other infectious diseases. The emergency supplemental appropriations request for Zika response efforts includes $828 million for CDC-Wide Activities and Program Support. This funding would support research, surveillance, vaccine development, and domestic preparedness activities, with a portion allocated for international response efforts. The request proposes that all funds be designated as emergency spending and remain available until expended. The emergency supplemental appropriations request for Zika response efforts includes $828 million for CDC-Wide Activities and Program Support. This funding would support research, surveillance, vaccine development, and domestic preparedness activities, with a portion allocated for international response efforts. Grants and technical assistance are provided to Puerto Rico and U.S. Territories for monitoring pregnant women, expanding mosquito control activities, and enhancing laboratory testing capacity. Additionally, funds are allocated for domestic response activities in states with Aedes mosquitoes, as well as international response activities to support public health workforce and infectious disease surveillance in Zika-affected countries. The emergency supplemental request seeks $295 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) to support maternal and child health programs, health care workforce assistance, and compensation for persons harmed by tests or vaccines. The funds could be transferred to other agencies within HHS or across the federal government for flexibility in response to changing needs. The emergency supplemental request seeks $130 million for NIH NIAID to expand research on Zika and other diseases, and $10 million for FDA's role in reviewing medical countermeasures. No congressional notification requirement is included for fund transfers. The emergency supplemental request aims to increase federal Medicaid funding for territories by raising the federal matching rate to 65% for one year. Territories currently operate under capped annual allotments and receive additional funding from the ACA until September 30, 2019. The emergency supplemental request proposes increasing the federal Medicaid funding rate for territories to 65% for one year, with the additional funding not counting against annual spending caps or ACA funding. The estimated impact is a $246 million increase in federal Medicaid expenditures. There are concerns about how this provision would affect Puerto Rico if it exhausts its ACA funding before FY2019. The request proposes language allowing funds in the act to be used for Zika response expenses and transferred to other federal accounts for Zika prevention. It also includes an expanded definition of \"Security Countermeasure\" to support medical countermeasures against Zika virus through Project BioShield. The proposed expansion of Project BioShield aims to support countermeasures against any infectious disease that threatens public health, not just limited to Zika virus or vector-borne diseases. The Administration's emergency supplemental appropriations request includes funds for Zika outbreak response, such as disease control, prevention, surveillance, vaccine development, and diagnostic research. Specifically, there is a request for transfer authority within the International Assistance section of the request. The request includes transfer authority, reimbursement authority, hiring of personal services contractors, and use of unobligated Ebola balances to combat Zika and other infectious diseases. $41.1 million is requested for Department of State operations, multilateral assistance, and international security assistance. Diplomatic and Consular Programs account will receive $14.6 million, with $8.4 million for medical support and possible evacuation of at-risk U.S. employees. $6.2 million is allocated for regional coordination efforts and public diplomacy outreach in Zika-affected countries. $4 million is designated for response efforts, including potential evacuation of U.S. citizens. $1 million is set aside for repatriation loans for U.S. citizens in Zika-affected areas. $8 million is allocated for voluntary U.S. contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency for nuclear safety and security. The Administration is requesting funds to support Zika research and response efforts through nuclear techniques and international organizations like UNICEF, WHO, and PAHO. USAID is also allocated $335 million for health programs and implementation expenses related to the Zika virus. The Administration is requesting funds for Zika research and response efforts, including funding for vector control activities, private sector research, maternal and child health support, and access to family planning services. The Administration is requesting funds for Zika research and response efforts, including funding for vector control activities, private sector research, maternal and child health support, and access to family planning services. Additionally, there is funding allocated for personal protection, public health communication campaigns, and Global Health Security Grand Challenges to address Zika and other infectious diseases. Unobligated Ebola funds may also be used for these efforts. The request authorizes the use of unobligated Ebola funds for Zika virus response and other health outcomes. The Department of State/USAID has nearly $1.3 billion in unobligated Ebola funds, with $600 million available until September 30, 2016, and $694 million available until expended. Transfer authority allows funds to be moved among State Department and USAID-related accounts without congressional notification. The supplemental request includes notwithstanding authority to allow funds from prior acts to be used for the U.S. Zika virus response without restrictions. It also mentions support for family planning services. The request allows expedited hiring authority for staff during public health threats like Zika and contracts with Zika experts. This authority can be used for broader public health circumstances. Additionally, $5.4 billion in emergency funds was provided in 2014 to address the Ebola outbreak. The Obama Administration reprogrammed $510 million of unobligated FY2015 Ebola funding to address the Zika virus. Some debate exists on whether congressional action is needed for the Department of State and USAID to reprogram the funds originally designated for Ebola response. As of January 1, 2016, unobligated Ebola funds totaled $2.77 billion, with $1.46 billion for HHS, $1.29 billion for State/USAID, and $17.3 million for Defense. $652.9 million, mostly USAID funding, expires on September 30, 2016, while the rest expires on September 30, 2019, or is available until expended. The Administration plans to reprogram $510 million of unobligated Ebola funds."
