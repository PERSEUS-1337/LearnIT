    "content": "The \"Truth in Budgeting Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It addresses the budgetary treatment of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, Inland Waterways Trust Fund, and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The \"Truth in Budgeting Act\" exempts the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, Inland Waterways Trust Fund, and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund from being counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit for budget purposes. It also safeguards against deficit spending from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The \"Truth in Budgeting Act\" includes safeguards against deficit spending from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund by requiring estimates of unfunded aviation authorizations and net aviation receipts to be made annually. If the unfunded authorizations exceed the net receipts for a fiscal year, the excess amount must be determined. The Secretary determines the excess amount and adjusts authorizations if unfunded authorizations exceed receipts. The percentage of the excess is calculated and used to reduce appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for the next fiscal year. Amounts previously withheld are made available. After determining the excess amount, the Secretary adjusts authorizations if unfunded authorizations exceed receipts. Appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for the next fiscal year are reduced by a calculated percentage of the excess. Previously withheld amounts are then made available for apportionment. The Secretary reports estimates and determinations to Congress. Definitions for net aviation receipts are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the transfer of funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and defines \"unfunded aviation authorizations\" as the excess of authorized but unappropriated funds over available funds in the Trust Fund. This is a conforming amendment to chapter 471 of title. The curr_chunk introduces a conforming amendment to chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code, by inserting a new item after section 47134 in the analysis. SEC. 4 introduces safeguards against deficit spending from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, estimates unfunded inland waterways authorizations and net receipts annually. If there is excess unfunded inland waterways authorizations, the Secretary determines the amount of the excess. If there is excess unfunded inland waterways authorizations, the Secretary of the Army determines the percentage of the excess in relation to the total authorized amounts from the Trust Fund for the next fiscal year. This percentage is then used to reduce the amounts authorized to be appropriated from the Trust Fund for the following fiscal year. The Secretary of the Army determines the percentage of excess unfunded inland waterways authorizations to reduce the amounts authorized to be appropriated from the Trust Fund for the next fiscal year. If the amount does not exceed the specified limit, the reduced amounts will be increased by an equal percentage without exceeding the limit. The Secretary of the Army reports estimates and determinations to Congress. Definitions for Airport and Airway Trust Fund, Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, and Inland Waterways Trust Fund are provided. The curr_chunk provides definitions for net harbor maintenance receipts, net inland waterways receipts, and unfunded inland waterways authorizations related to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The curr_chunk defines \"unfunded harbor maintenance authorizations\" as the excess of unappropriated funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund over the available amount at a given time. The Act, along with its amendments, applies to fiscal years starting after September 30, 1999."
