    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Shielding Against Flood Emergencies Levee Act\" or \"SAFE Levee Act\". The Bureau of Reclamation has used the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta channels to deliver water to the Central Valley Project pumps, causing stress on levees. The Bay Delta Conservation Plan proposes a dual conveyance system to address this issue. The Bureau of Reclamation will rely on the Delta's levees for water deliveries until an isolated conveyance facility is built. The Department of the Interior has not addressed levee stability in the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. Financial assistance should be provided for levee maintenance to prevent disruptions in water deliveries. SEC. 3. SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA LEVEE STABILITY IMPROVEMENTS RELATED TO BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WATER DELIVERIES. Section 103 of the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act is amended to establish a program for levee stability maintenance and improvements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to facilitate Bureau of Reclamation water deliveries. The Secretary will prioritize levee projects in the Delta for financial assistance to improve water-supply reliability and maintenance, specifically for Bureau of Reclamation water deliveries. Assistance will only be provided for projects that directly facilitate levee stability. The Federal government will provide up to 50% of the total project costs for levee stability maintenance and improvement projects that facilitate water deliveries for the Central Valley Project. The assistance may be in the form of grants or reimbursements. The Federal government will provide financial assistance for levee stability maintenance and improvement projects in the Central Valley Project. Costs allocated to subunits south of the Delta for water conveyance will be repayable by water service contractors within those subunits. Authorization of appropriations is provided for necessary funds. SEC. 4. EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND COSTS OF CONVEYANCE ALTERNATIVES UNDER THE BAY DELTA CONSERVATION PLANNING PROCESS. The Secretary of the Interior will analyze costs and benefits of water delivery options for Central Valley Project contractors in the Bay Delta Conservation Planning process, including an option without water conveyance tunnels. Analysis will include total project costs, impacts on taxpayers and the Treasury, and methods of payment. The Secretary will analyze the costs and benefits of proposed projects to determine if the social and environmental benefits outweigh the costs. The analysis will be presented as a benefit to cost ratio or net benefits. Findings will be reported to specific committees by June 30, 2013."
