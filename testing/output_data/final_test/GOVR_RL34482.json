    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, P.L. 111-5, allocated funding to various agencies within DHS in response to the economic recession. This included significant amounts for CBP, ICE, TSA, the Coast Guard, and FEMA. H.Res. 1488 was reported for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2638, which served as a legislative vehicle for multiple appropriations acts. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2638, enacted as P.L. 110-329 on September 30, 2008, providing $41,225 million for DHS in FY2009. This was more than the President's request, with specific appropriations for agencies like Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, Secret Service, and National Protection & Programs. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2638, enacted as P.L. 110-329 on September 30, 2008, providing $41,225 million for DHS in FY2009, exceeding the President's request. The appropriations included funding for agencies like Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, Secret Service, and National Protection & Programs. Additionally, Division B of the Act allocated emergency supplemental funding for DHS agencies, including the Coast Guard, FEMA, and the American Red Cross. House-reported H.R. 6947 proposed a net appropriation of $41,137 million for DHS in FY2009, representing a $2,288 million increase. In FY2009, H.R. 6947 proposed $41,137 million for DHS, with allocations for CBP, ICE, TSA, Coast Guard, Secret Service, NPP, FEMA, USCIS, S&T, and DNDO. The Senate's S. 3181 suggested $41,314 million for DHS, with similar allocations for major components. The President's budget request for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2009 was $50,502 million, including allocations for various components such as the U.S. Coast Guard, Secret Service, NPP, FEMA, USCIS, S&T, and DNDO. The FY2008 enacted net appropriated budget authority for DHS was $38,747 million. The FY2009 DHS budget request was $50,502 million, compared to the FY2008 enacted budget of $38,747 million. Various components of DHS were included in the budget request, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, Secret Service, NPP, FEMA, USCIS, S&T, and DNDO. The report describes the President's funding request for DHS programs and activities for FY2009. The report to Congress on February 4, 2008, compares enacted FY2008 amounts to the request for FY2009 DHS appropriations. It tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to discretionary funding amounts. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles. Title IV Research and Development, Training, Assessments, and Services; and Title V general provisions. Title I includes appropriations for various offices within the Department of Homeland Security. Title II contains appropriations for agencies such as Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard, and Secret Service. The US-VISIT program was initially under Title II but was transferred to the National Protection & Programs Directorate in Title III in FY2008. The DHS Appropriations Act, 2008 reorganized the department, creating the National Protection & Programs Directorate (NPPD) in Title III. The FY2009 request reflects this reorganization, shifting programs and offices to eliminate the Preparedness Directorate and move them to FEMA. Title IV contains appropriations for USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. The budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among the appropriations committees. The discretionary funds are allocated to subcommittees for enactment in annual appropriations bills. The 302(b) allocations are crucial in enforcing budget discipline, as they must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation. These allocations can be adjusted as appropriations bills progress. The annual concurrent resolution on the budget outlines the congressional budget, with DHS' 302(b) allocations for FY2008 shown in Table 2. Federal government spending involves a process starting with budget authority enactment by Congress, followed by fund obligation and outlay payments. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year authority is only for a specific fiscal year, while multi-year and no-year authority allow spending over a range of time or indefinitely. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Outlays represent the actual funds spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded annually through appropriations acts, with gross budget authority comprising discretionary and appropriated entitlement programs. The budget authority for federal agencies includes discretionary and mandatory spending. In FY2009, DHS had $46.4 billion in gross budget authority, with 82% being discretionary and 18% mandatory. Discretionary spending is yearly appropriations by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs within DHS require annual appropriations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending. DHS net discretionary budget authority is the total funds appropriated by Congress each year, composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset it. Collections can offset either discretionary or mandatory spending, with some being entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget to calculate gross budget authority. The appropriations for FY2003 through FY2009 are presented in current dollars and not adjusted. Table 5 compares the enacted appropriations for FY2008 with the requested, recommended, and enacted appropriations for FY2009. Title I covers the general administrative expenses of DHS, including the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management. The Office of the Secretary and 12 entities report directly to the Secretary, including the Undersecretary for Management and its components, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, the Analysis and Operations Office, the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding, and the Office of the Inspector General. FY2009 requests show varied increases and decreases in appropriations compared to FY2008. The FY2009 budget requests for various departments within the DHS show mixed changes in appropriations compared to FY2008. The total request for Title I is $1,187 million, with the largest increase in funding for the USM for the consolidation of DHS executive program leadership on the West Campus of the Saint Elizabeth's Hospital grounds. Other areas of increased funding include department-wide program management teams, the acquisition intern program, and more. The FY2009 budget requests for various departments within the DHS show mixed changes in appropriations compared to FY2008. Increased funding is sought for department-wide program management teams, the acquisition intern program, and increased counterintelligence and security needs. A small increase in USM funding is also being requested to support the Deputy Under Secretary for Management during the transition process. DHS has not previously experienced a presidential transition, but its principal components have undergone transitions in the past. The Management Agency at DHS is responsible for developing a transition and succession plan before a Presidential election. Recommendations for transition preparation include threat awareness, leadership, and training. Implementation details are not disclosed for security reasons. House-reported H.R. 6947 recommended $1,049 million for DHS management. The House-reported H.R. 6947 recommended $1,049 million for DHS management and operations entities funded in Title I, with allocations for various entities showing decreases in funding compared to the amount requested. The Senate appropriators recommended $1,197 million for Title I accounts, with allocations for various entities showing decreases in funding. Key changes include a decrease in funding for OS&EM, USM, and AOO, while OCIO saw an increase. OIG also saw a decrease in funding but received a proposed transfer of funds from FEMA's Disaster Relief account. The final bill allocated $1,086 million for Title I, $99 million less than the Senate recommendation. The final bill allocated $1,086 million for Title I, with decreases in funding for various entities like OS&EM, USM, OCFO, and AOO, while OCIO and OIG saw increases. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $200 million for consolidating the DHS headquarters. The Security department, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services, must submit a spending plan to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations within 60 days of the act's enactment. $5 million is allocated to the Office of Inspector General for oversight and audits of programs funded under Title VI until September 30, 2012. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) oversees human resources at DHS, reporting to the Under Secretary for Management. The OHC within OCHCO designs and implements HR programs and strategies. The DHS budget for FY2009 requested $47 million and 86 full-time equivalent employees for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) and the Office of Human Capital (OHC). This is an increase from the $18 million provided in FY2008, with 33 more FTEs than the previous year. The budget did not include funding for the new human resources management system (MAX-HR) authorized in P.L. 107-296. The funding and staff allocations for OCHCO and OHC are detailed in Table 7. The DHS budget request for FY2009 included increased funding for training programs, modernization of human resources systems, implementation of a pay for performance plan, and diversity and recruitment initiatives. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer will monitor the performance management system and oversee diversity strategy implementation. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OHC) is focusing on diversity strategy implementation, outreach, training, and improving diversity among executives. They will conduct internal surveys, analyze results, address concerns, and determine staffing needs. The OHC will also analyze turnover and attrition, develop recruitment and retention strategies, and monitor policies to improve employee perceptions. DHS aims to achieve a 50% favorable response rate on the FHCS. In FY2009, DHS plans to convert 23 contractor positions to federal positions in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OHC) to enhance workforce stability and effectiveness. This conversion aims to support ongoing initiatives, diversity, veteran outreach, recruiting, retention, and employee morale. A challenge for the department in FY2009 is the transition to a new Administration, with concerns raised about political appointees transitioning to non-political career positions within DHS. Representative Thompson raised concerns about filling career non-political executive positions with political appointees without a competitive process. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer plans to convert contractor positions to federal positions to enhance workforce stability and fund various services. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding $8 million below the President's proposal. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended funding $8 million below the President's request and $20 million above the FY2008 appropriation. $10 million is recommended for human resource activities to improve employee morale and work environment. The committee denied the request to transfer the law enforcement accreditation board to the OCHCO, provided $2.5 million for new learning initiatives, and funded human resource information technologies at $17.1 million. The committee expressed concern about unclear budget details and directed future proposals to clearly outline program and funding transfers between offices. The Senate report expressed concern about delays in the department's hiring process and recommended funding $6.3 million below the President's request. The report directed the OCHCO to report monthly on vacancies and funding transfers between offices. The Senate committee recommended funding of $18.8 million for OCHCO's salaries and expenses, including $5.5 million for a learning and development strategy. The $10 million allocated for human resources is to address shortcomings identified in surveys, such as gap analysis, hiring strategies, diversity programs, and learning initiatives. The committee denied the transfer of $1.3 million and seven FTEs from FLETC to OCHCO. The House-reported bill requested $1.3 million and seven FTEs to be transferred from FLETC to OCHCO for the law enforcement accreditation board. Funding was reduced due to high unobligated balances in OCHCO. The law included provisions for monthly reports on filling vacancies within DHS and required the CFO to submit budget and staffing reports to Congress. Section 522 and Section 534 of the bill prohibit the use of funds for certain purposes within the Department of Homeland Security, including human resources management systems and new hires that are not verified through the basic pilot program. Collaboration between the DHS Secretary and employee representatives is required for planning and development. The OCHCO at DHS issued a memorandum to department employees regarding these provisions. The OCHCO at DHS announced the halt of the human resources management system development authorized by P.L. 107-296. No current salary adjustments or bonus decisions will be affected. Changes have been made to the information, intelligence analysis, and infrastructure protection functions at DHS. The Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate was established under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate (IAIP) at DHS. The IAIP Directorate has 19 functions, including assessing terrorist threats, developing a national plan for securing critical infrastructure, and improving information sharing policies within the federal government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the IAIP Directorate at DHS, which underwent changes in the DHS intelligence structure under Secretary Chertoff's Second Stage Review. The Office of Information Analysis became the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the Office of Infrastructure Protection was placed within the Directorate for Preparedness, and amendments were made to the Homeland Security Act related to homeland security intelligence. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the IAIP Directorate at DHS, which underwent changes in the DHS intelligence structure under Secretary Chertoff's Second Stage Review. The law provided statutory standing to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Infrastructure Protection. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis is headed by an Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, with a FY2009 budget request of $334 million, supporting integration and analysis of information for threat assessments and warning documents. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis's budget is classified, and the National Operations Center disseminates threat information and provides situational awareness. H.R. 6947 included $324 million for AOO, reflecting concerns over certain offices. The FY2008 DHS Appropriations Act required reviews by the Secretary and GAO. The FY2008 DHS Appropriations Act required reviews by the Secretary and GAO for the National Applications Office (NAO) and the NIISO to comply with all laws, including privacy and civil liberties standards. The House Committee included statutory prohibitions on NAO and NIISO operations until GAO completes its review. Senate-reported S. 3181 decreased funding for the AOO account by $16 million (-5%) compared to the President's request. The Committee directed the Secretary to submit a detailed expenditure plan for FY2009 within 60 days after enactment of the FY2009 DHS. The FY2008 DHS Appropriations Act required reviews by the Secretary and GAO for the National Applications Office (NAO) and the NIISO to comply with all laws, including privacy and civil liberties standards. The House Committee included statutory prohibitions on NAO and NIISO operations until GAO completes its review. Senate-reported S. 3181 decreased funding for the AOO account by $16 million (-5%) compared to the President's request. The Committee directed the Secretary to submit a detailed expenditure plan for FY2009 within 60 days after enactment of the FY2009 DHS Appropriations Act. Reflecting the Committee's concern with the I&A's reliance on contract staff versus federal full-time equivalents, the reporting requirements were geared to provide the Committee with staffing and expenditure data regarding all of I&A's programs. S.Rept. 110-396 also included language requiring the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer to continue to provide the Appropriations Committees quarterly updates on the Department's progress towards placing DHS intelligence professionals in state and local fusion centers. P.L. 110-329 included $327 million for AOO for FY2009, a decrease of $7 million (-2%) for the AOO account as compared with the President's request, and increase of $30 million or 10% as compared to the FY2008 enacted amount. The Congressional Record version of the DHS Explanatory Statement, required the Secretary to submit a FY2009 expenditure plan for the Office of Title II of the FY2008 DHS Appropriations Act includes appropriations for CBP, ICE, TSA, US Coast Guard, and US Secret Service. CBP's main mission is to prevent terrorists and terrorism instruments from entering ports-of-entry along the border. The DHS Explanatory Statement required the Secretary to submit a FY2009 expenditure plan for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and the Chief Intelligence Officer to provide quarterly updates on placing intelligence professionals in state and local fusion centers. CBP's responsibilities include inspecting people and goods at the border to prevent terrorists and contraband from entering the US. It comprises various inspection functions and agencies, enforcing over 400 laws. See Table 8 for agency details and Table 9 for CBP Salaries and Expenses. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,935 million in gross budget authority for CBP for FY2009, a $127 million increase over FY2008. House-reported H.R. 6947 proposed $11,142 million in gross budget authority, $207 million more than the Administration's request. The Administration requested $10,935 million in gross budget authority for CBP for FY2009, a $127 million increase over FY2008. Senate-reported S. 3181 proposed $11,189 million in gross budget authority, $254 million more than requested by the Administration. The Act provided $11,268 million in gross budget authority, a $333 million increase over the Administration's request. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $680 million for CBP in FY2009, including funds for salaries, non-intrusive inspection technology, tactical communications equipment, SBInet technology deployment, and port of entry construction. Congress considered issues such as border fence funding, Border Patrol staffing, WHTI, and CBP Officers retirement designation. The Administration requested $775 million for SBInet technologies in FY2009, a decrease of $450 million from FY2008. $275 million is allocated for technology and infrastructure on the southwest border, with an additional $410 million for operations and maintenance of cameras, sensors, and fencing. The Administration requested $775 million for SBInet technologies in FY2009 to fund operating and maintaining technologies deployed to the border, including fencing and vehicle barriers. Challenges include difficulties acquiring border land rights and estimating installation costs, leading to delays in deployment. The Senate and House Committees recommended fully funding the President's request for the SBInet program in FY2009, with a focus on oversight due to concerns about rapid growth in border technology potentially leading to expensive and ineffective systems. The House Committee also highlighted the low percentage of funding allocated to the northern border. In FY2009, $40 million was allocated for technology on the northern border. The House Committee directed $30 million for a border interoperability project and $50 million for regulatory and environmental assessments. P.L. 110-329 fully funded the President's request but withheld $400 million until an expenditure plan is approved. The plan should include 12 specific components, such as a detailed accounting of the program's implementation, allocation of funding for border security needs, certifications by DHS officers, analysis of fencing approaches, and a review by the Government Accountability Office. P.L. 111-5 provided $100 million for SBInet technologies, with a requirement for DHS to submit an expenditure plan within 45 days. The Administration requested $363 million to hire 2,200 new USBP agents. The Administration requested an increase of $363 million to hire 2,200 new USBP agents, bringing the total number of agents to 20,019 by the end of FY2009. CBP is proposing to transfer up to 440 veteran agents to the northern border in FY2009 to comply with the P.L. 108-458 mandate. Congress may consider offering incentives to recruit or retain agents, as the USBP experienced a 10% attrition rate in FY2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding the President's request and reiterated the desire for 20% of new Border Patrol agents to be assigned to the northern border. The Senate Committee directed CBP to report on challenges in transferring agents to the northern border within 60 days of the bill's enactment. The National Guard was withdrawing its troops from the border in FY2008, and CBP was urged to hire support personnel to allow agents to focus on enforcement. P.L. 110-329 fully funded the President's request for additional Border Patrol agents and allocated funding for up to 75 agents to be transferred to the northern border. The Administration requested an increase of $107 million for WHTI. The Administration requested an increase of $107 million for WHTI, which will require U.S. citizens and nationals from Canada, Mexico, and some island nations to present passports or other approved documents to denote identity and citizenship status. Despite legislative delays, DHS has already mandated passport requirements for air and sea entry points, and has ended the practice of accepting oral declarations of citizenship at land borders as of January 31, 2008. The FY2009 request for WHTI included funding for hiring CBP officers and deploying technology at busy land border crossings. Congress is concerned about DHS's disregard of legislative extensions, staffing increases, infrastructure modifications, and the development of enhanced state driver's licenses for border security. The Senate and House Committees fully funded the President's request for WHTI implementation in FY2009. They directed CBP to provide quarterly briefings on the program's status and expressed concerns about its readiness for enforcement. The House Committee also supported the Global Entry program for expedited clearance of low-risk travelers at three airports, with plans to expand it with $10 million. The House Committee provided $36 million in FY2008 for the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to screen travelers from visa-waiver countries. Congress extended federal law enforcement officer status to CBP officers for retirement purposes in FY2008. The Senate Committee supported CBP officers' new retirement status and included $200 million for funding. The House Committee recommended $217 million for CBP officers' new retirement status, rejecting the Administration's proposal to repeal it. P.L. 110-329 provided an additional $200 million for CBP officers' retirement. The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) aims to enhance supply chain security through three prongs: International Container Security project (ICS), Security Filing (SF), and Global Trade Exchange (GTX). The Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) involves scanning all U.S.-bound maritime containers at overseas ports before loading. It is currently operational in ports in the United Kingdom, Pakistan, and Honduras. The Security Filing (SF) initiative, also known as \"10+2,\" aims to collect additional data on U.S.-bound maritime shipments earlier in the supply chain to enhance risk assessment capabilities. CBP is in the process of developing the final rule for the SF initiative. The Global Trade Exchange (GTX) is proposed as a new business model for collecting data. The CBP decided not to move forward with the Global Trade Exchange (GTX) contract, a new business model for collecting international cargo data. The decision was made while implementing the 10+2 Security Filing initiative. The House Report expressed concerns about gaps in CBP's information on inbound cargo containers and directed CBP to report on their data collection by January 8, 2009. The CBP requested $149 million for the ICS in FY2009, including an $11 million reduction for Secure Freight. It is unclear what this reduction represented, as the goal was to expand the program. Both House-reported H.R. 6947 and Senate-reported S. 3181 would have funded ICS/CSI at the requested level for FY2009. P.L. 110-329 fully funded the Administration's request for ICS/CSI, with CBP describing the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) as the next phase of the Container Security Initiative (CSI). The International Container Security (ICS) project, including CSI and SFI, is facing a decrease in funding for FY2009. The requested $149 million for FY2009 covers CSI/ICS, SFI, Security Filing (SF), and Global Trade Exchange (GTX). This indicates a decline in funding for CSI, raising concerns for Congress about the reasoning behind the proposed decrease. The Administration's proposal to decrease funding for CSI in FY2009 raised concerns for Congress, particularly regarding CBP staffing levels at CSI and SFI port locations. The House Report required CBP to report on steps taken to improve staffing and host country relations by January 8, 2009. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and enforcing immigration laws. ICE is responsible for investigating and enforcing violations of immigration laws, locating and removing aliens who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally, and developing intelligence to combat terrorist financing and money laundering. Additionally, ICE oversees building security activities and enforces export laws. The Administration requested a 1% increase in gross budget authority for ICE in FY2009, totaling $5,663 million. This included a small increase in net budget authority to $4,748 million. Division E of P.L. 110-161 provided $200 million for the identification and removal of criminal aliens, not included in the FY2009 budget request. The FY2009 budget request for ICE included program increases for detention beds, national security investigations, 287(g) agreements, ICE facility co-location, Office of Professional Responsibility, Cyber Crimes Center, Commercial Fraud units, and Visa Security Units. The House-reported H.R. 6947 would have appropriated $5,728 million in gross budget authority, including funds for counterfeit merchandise, Visa Security Units in Istanbul and Beirut, ICE training and oversight activities, and outbound enforcement to prevent arms from leaving the United States. The House-reported H.R. 6947 would have allocated funds for various purposes, including promoting awareness of child exploitation, funding care for smuggled aliens, enforcing laws against forced child labor, and identifying and removing aliens convicted of crimes. Additionally, funds would have been designated for detention bed space, support personnel, national security investigations, and oversight of medical care for ICE detainees. The House-reported H.R. 6947 allocated funds for various purposes, including child exploitation awareness, care for smuggled aliens, and enforcement against forced child labor. It also included funds for detention bed space, national security investigations, and oversight of medical care for ICE detainees. Additionally, Senate-reported S. 3181 would have appropriated $5,928 million in gross budget authority for ICE, $265 million more than the President's request, with $4,989 million in net budget authority, representing a $241 million increase over the Administration's requested amount. The Senate-reported S. 3181 allocated funds for various purposes, including detention and removal operations, identifying and removing criminal aliens, special operations, informant compensation, child pornography awareness, anti-child exploitation activities, agreements under INA, care and repatriation of smuggled aliens, enforcement against forced child labor, and the Visa Security Program, totaling $2,478 million. Senate-reported S. 3181 fully funded the President's budget request for various increases in ICE programs, including additional detention beds, worksite enforcement investigations, and funding for the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate misconduct involving ICE. Total increases amounted to $74 million for detention beds and support personnel, $34 million for worksite enforcement investigations, and $2 million for misconduct investigations. The Senate-reported S. 3181 fully funded the President's budget request for various increases in ICE programs, including additional detention beds, worksite enforcement investigations, and funding for the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate misconduct involving ICE. This included $9 million and 39 FTE for investigating criminal and serious misconduct, $5 million for cyber crimes investigations, $3 million for the Visa Security Program, $5 million for Security Advisory Opinion Units, $5 million for textile transshipment enforcement, $3 million for Field Intelligence Groups, $4 million for Alternatives to Detention, and $160 million for Secure Communities. The total increase in budget authority for ICE was $5,928 million, with $4,989 million in net budget authority allocated for various purposes such as identifying and removing criminal aliens. The Senate-reported S. 3181 fully funded the President's budget request for various increases in ICE programs, including additional detention beds, worksite enforcement investigations, and funding for the Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate misconduct involving ICE. This included $9 million and 39 FTE for investigating criminal and serious misconduct, $5 million for cyber crimes investigations, $3 million for the Visa Security Program, $5 million for Security Advisory Opinion Units, $5 million for textile transshipment enforcement, $3 million for Field Intelligence Groups, $4 million for Alternatives to Detention, and $160 million for Secure Communities. P.L. 110-329 provided increases in appropriations over the President's request for the following programs: $150 million for the identification and removal of criminal aliens; $6 million for transnational gang enforcement; $8 million for the visa security program; $3 million for cyber crime investigations; $34 million for worksite enforcement investigations; $3 million for ICE field intelligence groups; $2 for the Law Enforcement Support Center (LESC) to fund the. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for various ICE programs, including alternatives to detention, training consolidation, field facility co-location, legal advisor office, and construction for maintenance at detention facilities. $20 million was designated for tactical communications equipment deployment, creating over 120 new jobs. The Act required a plan for fund expenditure by April 3, 2009. ICE is tasked with diverse activities related to civil and criminal law violations. Resource allocation for its mission is a continuous issue, including the detention of deportable aliens. There is ongoing debate about the involvement of state and local law enforcement in assisting ICE. The Office of Investigations focuses on various criminal and civil violations affecting national security. ICE special agents investigate a range of criminal activities including arms exports, financial crimes, human trafficking, and immigration fraud. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 merged the INS and Customs Service functions into ICE to enhance investigative capabilities. Concerns have been raised about resource allocation towards terrorism investigations over civil immigration violations. The House report highlighted a new investigatory budget structure for ICE in 2009, focusing on terrorism investigations and the types of investigations conducted by the former Customs Service. Funding for ICE's Office of Investigations (OI) was lower than requested, with concerns raised about detention space for aliens in removal proceedings. The DOJ's Inspector General found that almost 94% of detained individuals with final removal orders were deported, compared to only 11% of those not detained. Concerns have been raised about the decision-making process for releasing aliens based on detention space availability, leading to disparities in different geographic areas. Legislation authorized an increase in detention bed space, with funding allocated for additional beds and support personnel. The FY2009 detention beds were increased to 33,400 with additional funding allocated for identifying and removing criminal aliens. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of medical care for detained aliens. House-reported H.R. 6947 aimed to restrict funds for detention services with certain facilities. The FY2009 detention beds were increased to 33,400 with additional funding allocated for identifying and removing criminal aliens. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of medical care for detained aliens. Legislation restricted funds for detention services with facilities receiving poor performance ratings. ICE was directed to improve medical services for detainees and enhance the system for responding to complaints. State enforcement of immigration laws is limited, with INA \u00a7287(g) granting authority for state and local immigration enforcement activities. The enforcement of immigration by state and local officials has sparked debate over their role in enforcing federal immigration laws. Concerns include proper training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some argue that state and local entities should assist due to limited federal resources. House-reported H.R. 6947 would have restricted funds for 287(g) agreements if deemed ineffective by the DHS Inspector General. The DHS Inspector General would determine violations of 287(g) agreements, with ICE prioritizing agreements to identify criminal aliens. The President's budget requested a $12 million increase for these agreements, which P.L. 110-329 allocated $54 million for the 287(g) program. ICE was directed to prioritize agreements for deportable criminal aliens, with the Federal Protective Service overseeing enforcement. The Federal Protective Service (FPS), under ICE, is responsible for protecting federally owned buildings and personnel from criminal and terrorist threats. The FY2009 budget for FPS was $616 million, with Senate-reported S. 3181 allocating $640 million. In FY2007, there was a realignment reducing FPS law enforcement officers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that FPS's staff decreased by 20% from FY2004 to FY2007, resulting in reduced security at federal facilities and increased risk of crime or terrorist attacks. Elimination of proactive security patrols hindered law enforcement personnel from conducting security operations like inspecting suspicious vehicles and monitoring individuals around federal buildings. In FY2008, the Administration aimed to improve methods for identifying threats to federal facilities, enhance intelligence sharing, provide security at National Special Security Events, and strengthen security standards. In FY2009, the Administration planned to provide security at NSSEs, align security standards with intelligence, assess federal facility security, monitor agency compliance, manage contract security guards, and enhance business processes. P.L. 110-329 required full funding for FPS operations due to GAO findings and congressional interest. P.L. 110-329 mandated full funding for FPS operations through security fee collections to maintain staff levels. TSA, created by ATSA, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The TSA is responsible for deploying passenger and baggage screeners, detection systems for explosives and weapons, and other security technologies. They also assess the risk of terrorist attacks for non-aviation transportation assets, issue security regulations, and enforce them. Additionally, the TSA serves as the primary liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. Funding details for the TSA can be found in Table 8 for account-level detail and Table 11 for sub-account-level detail. The President's FY2009 requested funding level for the TSA is $7,102 million, comprising 14% of the DHS budget. Estimated offsetting collections for FY2009 are $2,360 million, with a net total requested amount of $4,065 million. New funding initiatives include $426 million for explosives detection equipment. Proposed discretionary funding for EDS and ETD equipment would be reduced by $140 million compared to FY2008 levels. The President's FY2009 requested funding level for the TSA is $7,102 million, with new funding initiatives including $426 million for explosives detection equipment. Proposed discretionary funding for Screening Technology Maintenance and Utilities would increase by $47 million, while a $32 million increase is proposed for the Secure Flight program. The Checkpoint Screening Security Fund would be replaced by a $128 million appropriation for Checkpoint Support, with additional funding for 800 full-time equivalent Transportation Security Officers, mainly for Behavioral Detection Officers. The President's FY2009 request for TSA includes funding for additional Behavioral Detection Officers and screeners for random screening of airport workers. The proposal also includes realigning TSA programs, such as placing the Federal Air Marshal Service under the Aviation Security account and consolidating regulatory functions and law enforcement programs. Additionally, a single Human Resource Services unit is proposed within the Aviation Security account. The House committee recommended $6,964 million for the TSA, $138 million less than the President's request, but $77 million more than the Senate-reported bill. The committee rejected some realignment proposals but agreed to consolidate human resources and information technology activities within the TSA. The House committee recommended $6,964 million for the TSA, $138 million less than the President's request, but $77 million more than the Senate-reported bill. House-reported H.R. 6947 requested $250 million for Checkpoint Support, $122 million above the President's request for FY2009, to expedite testing and deployment of checkpoint explosives screening technologies. The House report recommended $294 million for EDS/ETD purchase and installation, in line with the Senate-reported amount, and $110 million for air cargo security, $39 million above the FY2008 appropriated level. The House committee recommended $75 million for the Secure Flight program, $7 million below the request, citing schedule slips in the regulatory process and GAO reviews of the program. For surface transportation security, the House-reported measure specified $50 million for the deployment of additional security inspectors. The Senate-reported bill would have set total funding for the TSA at $6,887 million, $215 million less than the President's request. The committee supported some Administration-proposed realignments but disagreed on others, resulting in funding discrepancies for budget activities. They agreed to consolidate human resources and IT programs in TSA but not law enforcement activities under aviation security. The committee recommended $2,692 million for passenger and baggage screening personnel compensation, $24 million below the requested levels. They also suggested a recision of $7.3 million for pilot programs to screen airport employees. The committee recommended funding levels for various aviation security programs, including $200 million for checkpoint support, $294 million for EDS/ETD purchase and installation, and $123 million for air cargo security. They also proposed a recision of $7.3 million for pilot programs to screen airport employees. The committee recommended funding for aviation security programs, including expanding TSA air cargo screening technology pilots to meet the 100% screening mandate. They also proposed funding for implementing regulations and mandates of the 9/11 Act, as well as airport perimeter security pilot projects. The committee recommended funding for aviation security programs, including expanding TSA air cargo screening technology pilots to meet the 100% screening mandate. They also proposed funding for implementing regulations and mandates of the 9/11 Act, as well as airport perimeter security pilot projects. The committee proposed $799 million for FAMS, $13 million above the President's request, and recommends keeping FAMS separate from aviation security. Surface transportation security funding sought $64 million, $27 million more than the President's request, with additional inspectors and operations staff. The Act provided a total of $6,978 to the TSA, $91 million above the Senate-reported level and $14 million above the House-reported level, but $124 million less than the President's request. Funding for aviation security totaled $4,735 million, matching the House-reported levels. The Act consolidated Information Technology functions and Human Capital Services across the TSA. The Act allocated $544 million for checked baggage explosives detection systems, $123 million for Air Cargo Security, $391 million for specialized screening programs, $30 million for VIPR teams, and $12 million for surface transportation security inspectors. Total funding initiatives amounted to $1,119 million, with a focus on implementing requirements of the 9/11 Act. The Act allocated $20 million for Implementing P.L. 110-53 for vulnerability assessments and security training exercises for high-risk surface transportation systems. $18 million was designated for expanding test programs evaluating air cargo screening technologies. $250 million was provided for Checkpoint Support to deploy emerging passenger and carry-on screening technologies. The Act allocated funding for passenger and carry-on screening technologies, including whole body imaging (WBI) technologies at checkpoints. It also provided funds for the maintenance of screening technologies and Transportation Threat Assessment functions, with restrictions on the operational deployment of Secure Flight until certain conditions are met. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $1,000 million for aviation security, specifically for checked baggage and checkpoint explosives detection systems. The DHS must submit an expenditure plan within 45 days, prioritizing projects based on security risks. Contracts for spending these funds must be competitively awarded, with an estimated creation of 3,500 private sector jobs. The GAO reported that integrating and streamlining checked baggage explosives detection equipment could reduce TSA workforce requirements and result in significant federal savings. For example, in 2005, integrating EDS systems in-line with baggage conveyors at nine airports yielded a $1.3 billion savings over seven years compared to stand-alone systems. The TSA expected to recover its initial investment in in-line EDS projects in a little over one year. The Administration requested a temporary passenger surcharge to offset new budget authority for the Aviation Security Capital Fund in FY2009. The surcharge would be $0.50 per flight, not to exceed $1.00 per one-way trip, in addition to current security fees. These funds would finance the acquisition of security equipment. The Administration is seeking new budget authority to finance the acquisition of checked baggage explosives detection equipment. They recommend a $0.50 surcharge on passenger security fees to offset the increased budget authority for the Aviation Security Capital Fund. The Administration projects a $216 million increase in security fee collections in FY2009 and is requesting an additional $426 million for the ASCF. The current authorization for the ASCF is $250 million from passenger security fee collections. The Administration is proposing a $0.50 surcharge on passenger security fees to fund the acquisition of checked baggage explosives detection equipment. Congress is debating whether to directly appropriate $450 million annually through FY2011 for aviation security purposes. There is concern about the adequacy of the surcharge to offset the proposed funding increase, especially in case of economic downturn affecting passenger volume and fee revenue. Committees in the House and Senate have not considered legislation to raise security fees as requested by the President. The Senate and House proposed increased funding for EDS/ETD purchase and installation in FY2009. P.L. 110-329 allocated $544 million for baggage screening systems, matching both bills. TSA plans to deploy advanced technology at airports. The TSA plans to deploy advanced technology at airports, including scanners for liquids and screening systems for cast and prostheses. Congress is considering the adequacy of the $128 million requested for Checkpoint Support to address advanced screening technology initiatives. In FY2008, Congress provided $250 million for advanced checkpoint technologies. Congress may debate modifying the deployment strategy for advanced checkpoint screening technologies, with the House reporting $250 million for Checkpoint Support and the Senate specifying $200 million. P.L. 110-329 provided $250 million for Checkpoint Support in FY2008. The Act provided $250 million for Checkpoint Support, matching the FY2008 funding level. Funds were to be used for acquiring whole body imaging technologies as directed in the Senate report. There were discussions about realigning functions, particularly regarding air cargo security. Critics argue that air cargo security should remain a separate function due to its unique characteristics and statutory requirements. The TSA's budget justification emphasized aligning air cargo security under Aviation Regulation to provide flexibility in assigning regulatory inspectors. However, some in Congress believe the TSA's role should include testing screening technologies, acquiring equipment, deploying canine teams, and ensuring compliance with security regulations. The TSA plans to expand canine team involvement in air cargo screening to 42.5% by FY2009, up from 25%. A formal plan for meeting statutory cargo screening requirements has not been presented yet. The proposed alignment of the Federal Air Marshal Service into the Aviation Security function may raise questions during congressional debate. The TSA plans to increase canine team involvement in air cargo screening. The proposed alignment of the Federal Air Marshal Service into Aviation Security function may face scrutiny during congressional debate. Some question why FAMS is not aligned with the Law Enforcement program for better integration with other law enforcement functions. The Senate and House legislation did not support integrating FAMS into Aviation Security or realigning air cargo security operations. The committees did not endorse the Administration's proposals to realign law enforcement and regulatory functions, but agreed to realign human resources and information technology functions across the TSA. The FY2009 appropriations act reflected the realignment of these two areas, but did not restructure or realign any other TSA functional areas as proposed. The President's request included a $32 million funding increase for the Secure Flight program to achieve operational deployment by FY2010. This initiative for government prescreening of airline passengers against terrorist watchlists remains controversial. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) imposed restrictions on deploying Secure Flight until DHS certifies and GAO reports on privacy protection, data security, and redress procedures. The Administration views this as a violation of separation of powers. Legislation maintains these requirements and prohibits the use of commercial information for assessing passenger risk. P.L. 110-329 also includes language prohibiting certain actions. P.L. 110-329 prohibits operational deployment of Secure Flight until DHS certifies and GAO reports on privacy, data security, and redress procedures. During testing, TSA cannot deny boarding based on system-provided information other than government watch lists. TSA is restricted from using non-federal databases in Secure Flight, except for passenger name record data. The Coast Guard, under DHS since 2003, is responsible for maritime homeland security, search and rescue, environmental protection, and aids to navigation. The President requested $9,071 million for the Coast Guard in FY2009, accounting for 19% of DHS's budget. The President requested $9,071 million for the Coast Guard in FY2009, accounting for 19% of DHS's budget. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $9,206 million for the Coast Guard, $135 million more than requested by the President. Key differences include rejecting funding for a fourth National Security Cutter and a requested transfer of $82 million in personnel funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $9,216 million for the Coast Guard, $145 million more than requested by the President. The largest differences in funding concern the acquisition of response-boat medium and the missionization of C-130J aircraft. P.L. 110-329 provided $9,361 million for the Coast Guard, including $6,195 million for OE and $1,495 million for ACI. The Act provided more funding than requested by the President for response boats - medium, the Deepwater program, and other areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $240 million in emergency funding for the Coast Guard, including $142 million for the Alteration of Bridges program and $98 million for shore facilities, aids to navigation, and vessel improvements. Congress also provided $44 million for response boats, $18 million for Deepwater program, $30 million for a polar icebreaker vessel, and $98 million for Coast Guard headquarters relocation. The Coast Guard was prohibited from using funds for acquiring an additional polar icebreaker under the Act. Increased duties in the maritime realm related to homeland security have added complexity to the Coast Guard's obligations. Concerns have been raised by Congress regarding the agency's operational response to these demands, including plans to replace aging vessels and aircraft through the $24 billion Deepwater program. The program has faced criticism for management and execution issues, leading to hearings in 2007. The GAO and DHS IG have been actively reviewing Deepwater, prompting the Coast Guard to phase out an outside system integrator in 2007. In 2007, the Coast Guard decided to phase out an outside system integrator for the Deepwater program. The President requested $990 million for FY2009, with $541 million for vessels and $231 million for aircraft. Congress appropriated $651 million for Deepwater in FY2008, $137 million less than requested. Senate-reported S. 3181 largely concurs with the President's budget request for Deepwater. The Senate committee recommended $24 million for missionization of three C-130J aircraft under Deepwater, while the House report denied $3 million for UAVs and reduced funding for National Security Cutters by $54 million. P.L. 110-329 allocated $1,034 million for Deepwater, with $245 million for aircraft and $571 million for surface ships, withholding $350 million until an expenditure plan is approved. The Act provided funding for missionization of three C-130J aircraft, UAVs, and National Security Cutters as requested by the President. There is a proposed transfer of funds and FTEs from ACI to OE appropriation for oversight of major acquisition projects. Congress is concerned about the Coast Guard's management of the program, which is the largest acquisition effort. The Coast Guard's management of the largest acquisition effort in its history, the Deepwater Acquisition Program, is under scrutiny. Funding of $108 million has been allocated to purchase 36 response boats, with some Members of Congress expressing concerns about the Coast Guard's resources for its homeland security mission. The Coast Guard's resources for its homeland security mission are under scrutiny, with concerns raised about the lack of resources. The FY2009 budget request includes funding for the \"port, waterways, and coastal security\" mission, with $26 million allocated for the Automatic Identification System to track ships in U.S. harbors. The system is currently able to track ships in 55 ports and nine coastal waterways, with plans to extend tracking capability out to 50 nautical miles from shore. The funding request is to extend tracking capability to 50 nautical miles from shore and communicate with ships up to 24 nautical miles from shore for Coast Guard sectors Hampton Roads, Delaware Bay, and Mobile. The Senate reduced the President's request by $6 million, citing carryover funds and acquisition schedule concerns. Quarterly briefings were requested on the development of interagency operations centers (IOCs) for intelligence sharing and coordinated responses. The Senate report recommended denying a $15 million reduction in Coast Guard port presence and coastal security, instead suggesting adding 170 billets for various security measures. An unresolved issue is tracking smaller vessels like recreational boats to counter threats, with recreational boaters opposing tracking due to cost and privacy concerns. The Coast Guard has no immediate plans to require tracking based on a recent DHS strategy report. The Coast Guard does not plan to mandate AIS transponders for smaller vessels but will find other ways to identify them. Concerns have been raised about the agency's ability to maintain non-homeland security missions. Delays in rulemaking for oil spill response plans for non-tank vessels have been criticized. Witnesses in a congressional hearing complained about Coast Guard delays in documenting mariners and vessels. The Coast Guard is facing criticism for delays in documenting mariners and vessels, as well as a lack of technical expertise among marine inspectors. To address these issues, the Commandant plans to increase civilian positions in the marine safety program and strengthen career paths. The FY2009 budget request includes an additional $20 million for operating expenses to add 276 marine inspector positions, respond to LNG vessel calls, examine towing vessels, review oil spill response plans, and oversee ballast water management. Additionally, $2.6 million is requested for 25 rulemaking projects related to safety, security, and environmental concerns. The Coast Guard requested $2.6 million for 25 rulemaking projects related to safety, security, and environmental protection. Senate-reported S. 3181 recommended an additional $4 million for 67 more watchstanders, citing the Cosco Busan oil spill as justification. The House report suggested an extra $29 million for watchstanders, boats, marine inspection staff, and oil spill response exercises, requesting a detailed allocation plan from the Coast Guard. Congress expressed concerns about the management of the Rescue 21 program during the FY2007 appropriations process. The Coast Guard's Rescue 21 program, replacing the National Distress and Response System, faced cost overruns and delays according to a 2006 GAO audit. The program aimed to limit coverage gaps to 2% but now has a less than 10% coverage gap. Congress expressed concern over system outages and requested quarterly briefings on outage plans. The President's FY2009 budget requested $88 million for further deployment of the system's infrastructure. The Senate and House committees agreed to increase the overall acquisition cost of the Coast Guard's LORAN-C system to $1,066 million and extend the completion date to 2017. The system helps boaters and pilots determine their location using radio signals, but the Coast Guard argued it is no longer needed due to GPS technology. Congress funded the continuation of the LORAN-C system in FY2007, requiring the Coast Guard to notify the public before terminating it. The Coast Guard, along with other agencies, sought public input on the future of the LORAN system, considering decommissioning, maintenance, or upgrades. Supporters of LORAN argue its value as a GPS backup due to potential GPS signal blockages. Congress rejected the Administration's request to end LORAN-C in FY2008, awaiting a policy decision by March 2008. DHS announced the use of an enhanced LORAN system (eLoran) as a GPS backup, with a budget request for its administration transfer to NPPD. The President's request to transfer $35 million to the National Preparedness and Programs Directorate (NPPD) of DHS was denied by both the Senate and House Appropriations Committees. The bridge alteration program received $16 million in FY2008, with recommendations of $16 million from the Senate and $12 million from the House for FY2009. Additional emergency supplemental funding of $142 million was provided in P.L. 111-5. With the melting of arctic sea ice, a Trans-Arctic commercial shipping lane is predicted to develop, leading to increased commercial activity in the region. The Coast Guard is testing its vessels, aircraft, and personnel in the arctic due to increased commercial activity. Three polar icebreaker ships, funded by the National Science Foundation, are operated by the Coast Guard. The House committee directed the Coast Guard to negotiate with the NSF to return the budget of the icebreakers. $30 million was allocated to reactivate the Polar Star for 7 to 10 years of service life. The U.S. Secret Service has two main missions - criminal investigations and protection. The Secret Service's main missions include criminal investigations such as financial crimes and computer fraud, as well as protection duties for the President, Vice President, their families, and other designated individuals. They are also responsible for security at National Special Security Events. The NSSE designation by the President authorizes the Secret Service to coordinate security for events in the US. In FY2009, the budget requested $1,414 million for Secret Service missions, a $29 million increase from FY2008. The House proposed $1,371 million, a $14 million decrease, with cuts to White House mail screening. The House proposed reducing funding for White House mail screening in FY2009, stating it should be financed through routine expenses. The Senate committee included funds for this purpose, with a total appropriation of $1,413 million for the Secret Service, including $34 million for mail screening. In FY2009, Congress appropriated $1 million for National Special Security Events (NSSE) costs within the Secret Service. An additional $100 million was allocated for security at the 2008 presidential nominating conventions through the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs. Congress may address issues regarding funding for NSSE costs incurred by federal, state, and local entities. The Secret Service received $1 million in FY2009 for National Special Security Events (NSSE) costs, with an additional $100 million allocated for security at the 2008 presidential nominating conventions through the Department of Justice. State and local jurisdictions can use DHS grants for NSSE-related security activities, but the grant approval process is not flexible for unexpected NSSEs. States and localities are unable to plan ahead and cannot use certain funds to cover unexpected security costs. DHS authorizes states and localities to reprogram SHSGP and UASI funding with approval from the DHS Secretary, potentially affecting funding for other homeland security activities. Congress may need to consider better coordination of NSSE funding at the federal level, as different agencies have separate funding streams for NSSE components without an overarching coordinating mechanism. Title III includes appropriations for FEMA, NPPD, and OHA, with FEMA's authorities expanded post-Katrina. In response to statutory exclusions, DHS officials created the NPPD to house functions not transferred to FEMA, and the OHA was established for the Office of the Chief Medical Officer. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act expanded FEMA's responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security after Hurricane Katrina. Congress passed this act to address shortcomings identified in reports on FEMA's performance during the 2005 hurricane season. FEMA's FY2009 budget request focused on expanding its workforce, with a budget of $5,573 million, $4,153 million lower than FY2008. The discussion during the budget season included how FEMA's increased capacity aligns with congressional interests. The FY2009 budget request for FEMA included reductions in various program areas, such as the Office of Grant Programs. The request also proposed an increase in the Management and Administration account, with a focus on information technology and adding new positions. H.R. 6947 recommended $7,407 million for FEMA in FY2009, surpassing the Administration's requested level by 32%. In FY2009, FEMA received $7,407 million, exceeding the Administration's request by 32%. The Senate also allocated $7,328 million, surpassing the President's request by $1,755 million. Additionally, P.L. 110-329 provided $6,963 million for FEMA, an increase of nearly $1,400 million from the President's request. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $100 million for the Emergency Food and Shelter program within FEMA. Congress focused on improving FEMA's preparedness, response, and recovery from major disasters, particularly in the areas of temporary housing quality, logistics chain, and workforce depth. The quality and depth of FEMA's workforce are key concerns, along with funding for programs like Emergency Food and Shelter and Flood Map Modernization. Congress supported increased funding levels for these programs in FY2009, diverging from the Administration's request. Both the House and Senate agreed on the $1,900 million amount for the Disaster Relief Fund, despite a reduction from the previous year. The House and Senate committees did not endorse a separate Disaster Readiness and Support Account in the FEMA budget. They agreed to fund up to $250 million from the Disaster Relief Fund for disaster purposes without creating a new account. Both recommended transfers from the DRF to FEMA's Management and Administration account and the Office of Inspector General for disaster-related audits and investigations. The House bill proposed a $15 million transfer, while the Senate bill set it at $16 million. In FY2009, $1,400 million was provided for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with an additional $7,960 million in emergency supplemental funding from P.L. 110-329. $106 million was transferred from the DRF to FEMA's Management and Administration account, and $16 million will be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General for disaster-related audits and investigations. The House increased funding for the EFS program to $200 million, double the requested amount, citing the critical need for resources as more people rely on food banks and community support organizations. This is the largest appropriation in the program's 25-year history. The Senate disagreed with the President's request to decrease the EFS account to $100 million and recommended returning it to the 2008 level. P.L. 110-329 provided $200 million for the EFS program, the largest amount ever received. P.L. 111-5 further supplemented the program with an additional $100 million in FY2009, bringing the total funds available to $300 million. The Senate approved $185 million for Flood Map Modernization, $35 million above the Administration's request. The House increased funding for the Flood Map Modernization program to $220 million for FY2009, a 46% increase from the Administration's request. FEMA requested $184 million to support 118 new permanent positions and transition 149 temporary CORE positions into permanent slots. CORE positions can serve for up to four years with benefits, contrasting with Disaster Assistance Employees (DAEs) who work temporarily without benefits on renewable 30 to 90 day appointments. DAEs are recruited in large numbers and organized into expertise cadres for various disaster response functions. COREs and DAEs are separate entities. FEMA's CORE employees, serving for multi-year terms, have gained valuable experience and skills that the agency aims to retain. This retention is crucial for ensuring consistency in program policy interpretation and customer service for state and local partners. The FY2009 budget includes requests for additional employees to enhance various agency areas and improve program plans, with Congress historically supporting FEMA's expansion of skilled employees at regional levels. The House Appropriations Committee recommended transferring $90.6 million from the DRF account to support the conversion of temporary disaster employees to full-time positions at FEMA. The funds will not be available until an implementation plan is submitted, and the transfer is not at the full level requested by DHS/FEMA. Congress may want more specificity on how the new positions will be distributed throughout the agency. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended transferring $43.5 million for position conversion at FEMA to address concerns about employee turnover and reliance on temporary staff. They proposed increasing permanent personnel for Public Assistance. Additionally, P.L. 110-329 transferred $106 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to the Management and Administration account, increasing it to $943 million. The appropriations statute increased the account to $943 million, with funds not available for transfer until an implementation plan is submitted. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation program provides competitive grants annually and is not tied to disaster declarations. The House Committee agreed to reduced funding for the program in the FY2009 budget, while the Senate Committee recommended an increase from $75 million to $100 million. The House recommended increasing the PDM fund to $100 million for hazard mitigation planning and projects. They also supported other mitigation programs like the NFIP and HMGP. FEMA must report on how each program contributes to mitigation goals within six months. The House bill earmarks the PDM program for the second time with 51 projects totaling just under $25 million. The Senate report language directs FEMA to operate the PDM program competitively. The FY2009 bill appropriated $90 million for PDM, with an extension of authorization through September 30, 2009. Thousands of disaster victims from the Gulf Coast hurricane season of 2005 remain in temporary housing. Congress is interested in FEMA's implementation of new housing authorities provided in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act. Congress, particularly concerned about formaldehyde levels in travel trailers and mobile homes post-Gulf Coast disasters, directed FEMA in P.L. 109-295 to prepare a disaster housing strategy. Despite delays, the full National Disaster Housing Strategy is expected to be delivered to Congress by the end of 2009. The Administration's budget request for FY2009 aimed to improve and expand the agency's workforce for disaster assistance, without specific focus on temporary housing or related health and safety issues. FEMA's desire for a larger role for HUD in disaster housing was evident in their agreement to provide housing assistance to Hurricane Ike victims. Congressional hearings addressed ongoing issues with public housing rebuilding post-2005 hurricanes. The House Committee allocated an additional $50,000 to address conflicting views between HUD and FEMA on public housing repairs post-2005 hurricanes. They also noted progress in implementing the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, with funds supplementing mitigation measures for the \"Road Home\" program in Louisiana. The program deadline for applications was set for September 1, 2008. The House report urged FEMA to extend the deadline for applications post-2005 hurricanes. P.L. 110-329 included provisions for Gulf Coast rebuilding, such as single payments for infrastructure repair and reimbursement for debris removal costs in Mississippi. The Senate Appropriations Committee raised concerns about FEMA's grant distribution process, citing flaws in implementation. The Senate recommended withholding $10 million from FEMA until improvements in stakeholder input for grant guidance and transparency were certified. The House also expressed concerns about FEMA's lack of collaboration with states and localities in updating the National Response Framework. The House and Senate directed FEMA to submit budget requests by office, expressing displeasure with FEMA's failure to do so in the past. The Senate Committee agreed with the Office of Inspector General that FEMA has financial weaknesses due to reporting and accounting practices, requiring FEMA to address these areas of weakness. P.L. 110-329 mandated that FEMA officials report to the Committees on Appropriations on incorporating stakeholder input for grant guidance development. The House and Senate directed FEMA to submit budget requests by office and address financial weaknesses in reporting and accounting practices. They mandated FEMA to incorporate stakeholder input for grant guidance development. Both Committees disagreed with reducing funding for the Urban Search and Rescue Response System and recommended maintaining it at $32 million. The House report also directed FEMA to explore the feasibility of adding another team to the USAR program within six months. The FY2009 appropriations bill funded USAR at $32 million, with $5 million designated for North Carolina to address sea level rise impacts. The study's findings will assist other states in climate change mitigation efforts. P.L. 110-329 included the $5 million for North Carolina. FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate administers state and local assistance programs for homeland security capabilities. The Grant Programs Directorate administers state and local homeland security assistance programs, separate from FEMA training activities. DHS assistance programs include SHSGP, UASI, Port Security Program, Transit Security Program, and others. The Administration requested $2,200 million for FY2009 DHS assistance programs for states and localities, proposing reductions in funding for most programs except UASI, Citizen Corps, and bus security. This was $2,028 million less than Congress appropriated in FY2008. The House-reported version of H.R. 6947 proposed $4,171 million for FY2009 DHS assistance programs, $57 million less than FY2008. The Senate-reported version of S. 3181 proposed $4,079 million for FY2009 DHS assistance programs for states and localities, which was $149 million less than the previous year's appropriation. Some programs that were not funded in FY2009 included the Buffer Zone Protection Program, Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Grants, and Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grants. Additionally, the bill did not propose funding for the National Security and Terrorism Prevention Program. The Senate-reported bill for FY2009 DHS assistance programs did not fund the National Security and Terrorism Prevention Program. Congress appropriated $4,138 million, $90 million less than FY2008, mainly due to not funding the Real ID program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $510 million for selected DHS assistance programs. In addition to FY2009 appropriations, the Act of 2009 allocated $510 million for selected DHS assistance programs for states and localities. Congress appropriated $150 million for the Transit Security Grant Program, $150 million for the Port Security Grant Program, and $210 million for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. The main issues Congress faced in FY2009 were the reduction in state and local assistance funding, allocation methods for grant awards, and decreased appropriations for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. The dominant issue in DHS's assistance programs remains the overall funding reduction. In FY2009, Congress reduced funding for various state and local assistance programs, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program, Trucking Industry Security Program, and Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Grants. However, funding was increased for programs like Urban Area Security Initiative and Assistance to Firefighters. Overall, funding for states and localities was $90 million less than appropriated in FY2008, but still amounted to over $4 billion. In FY2009, Congress reduced funding for state and local assistance programs, including the State Homeland Security Grant Program. P.L. 110-329 requires GAO to report on DHS methodology for assessing risk in grant allocations. The Administration's budget proposals for FY2009 recommended significant cuts for fire grants, including zero funding for SAFER grants. Opponents argue that the reduced levels are inadequate for fire departments, while the Administration believes they are sufficient for critical capabilities in emergencies. The proposed budget included a 46% cut for fire grants and no funding for SAFER grants. Total request for Assistance to Firefighters Grants was 60% below the FY2008 level. The FY2009 budget proposal significantly reduced funding for fire grants, including eliminating grants for wellness/fitness activities and facility modifications for firefighter safety. The Senate-reported version of S. 3181 proposed $750 million for firefighter assistance, maintaining the same funding level as FY2008. In FY2009, $775 million was provided for firefighter assistance, with $565 million for fire grants and $210 million for SAFER grants. Funding applications were directed to follow local priorities and U.S. Fire Administration guidelines. FEMA was directed to grant funds directly to fire departments and maintain an all-hazards focus. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides an additional $210 million in firefighter assistance grants for modifying, upgrading, or constructing state and local non-federal fire stations. The Act also waives the matching requirement for SAFER grants funded in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The spending is estimated to create 2000 jobs. The DHS Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs oversees various programs including BioWatch, NBIS, Project BioShield, and occupational health and safety. Dr. Jeffrey Runge resigned in 2008, and Dr. Jon R. Krohmer is now the Acting Assistant Secretary. The Administration requested $161 million for OHA in FY2009, with allocations for BioWatch, NBIS, RDCDS, planning, and salaries. The bill proposed $134 million for OHA, $27 million below the request but $18 million above FY2008. The bill allocated $89 million for the BioWatch program, $8 million for NBIS, $3 million for RDCDS, $6 million for planning and coordination, and $29 million for salaries and expenses. The law provided $157 million for OHA, $4 million below the FY2009 request, and $41 million above the FY2008 level. The upcoming presidential transition may pose challenges for OHA, which has seen rapid budget and mission growth since its establishment three years ago. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) (OHA) was established in 2005 with a budget of $2 million, which increased to $117 million in FY2008. Most of the funding was for existing programs like BioWatch. OHA requested additional funding for planning, coordination, and administrative functions in FY2009. Congress has shown interest in the effectiveness of OHA programs, funding a study by the National Academy of Sciences in FY2008. In P.L. 110-53, Congress tasked the Comptroller General to evaluate the implementation of NBIS. The House Committee recommended BioWatch funding below the request in FY2009 and expressed concerns about deploying two different sensing systems concurrently. The Senate Committee supported the requested amount for BioWatch without further discussion. Congress provided the requested funding for BioWatch in P.L. 110-329 but outlined specific spending and reporting requirements for new system deployments. The House Committee also directed DHS's pandemic influenza planning activities to be based in OHA. The Senate Committee recommended allocating $10 million to expand OHA's efforts for national preparedness in nuclear incident planning. Both House and Senate Committees expressed concerns about medical care in ICE detention facilities and directed ICE to conduct a third-party review in consultation with OHA. Additionally, OHA and FEMA were directed to coordinate efforts in managing MMRS grants to cities. The formation of the National Protection and Programs Directorate was in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006. It includes various offices such as Infrastructure Protection, Cybersecurity and Communications, Intergovernmental Programs, Risk Management and Analysis, and US-VISIT. The Directorate's programs are supported through different programs like Management and Administration, Infrastructure Protection, and Information Security. The Office of the Undersecretary supports other offices within the Directorate through budget formulation, financial management, contract and program management, information technology, employee relations, and communications. The Office of Intergovernmental Programs advocates for State, local, tribal, and territorial officials within the department. The Office of Risk Management and Analysis was established post-Katrina to manage communications and coordinate activities among stakeholders. The Risk Management and Analysis office was established as part of the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006 and now reports directly to the Undersecretary. The office's responsibility is to develop and implement a common risk management framework and leverage expertise throughout the department. The President requested $54 million for NPPD Management and Administration, including funds for Directorate Administration, Intergovernmental Programs, and Risk Management and Analysis. The budget request included a programmatic increase for additional personnel to reduce dependence on outside resources. The House Committee recommended no funding for the Office of Intergovernmental Programs in the National Protection and Programs budget, citing its integration into FEMA. They also proposed cutting funding for hiring and retaining staff by $2 million. The Senate Committee also chose not to fund the Office of Intergovernmental Programs through the NPPD. Congress approved $42 million for Directorate Administration, slightly less than requested. They did not fully support the increase for hiring and retaining staff or transfer funding for the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs from FEMA to NPPD. The RMA request was fully supported. Concerns were raised about the quality of NPPD's budget requests in the FY2009 cycle, following criticism in FY2008 for lack of detail and clarity in budget justification documents. The Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated $5 million for NPPD Management. The Omnibus Appropriations Act ordered $5 million from the NPPD Management and Administration account to be put on hold until approved by Committees and reviewed by the Government Accountability Office. Concerns were raised about the location of the Office of Risk Management and Analysis and the Office of Intergovernmental Programs within the department. The budgeting of the Office of Intergovernmental Programs remains a contentious issue between Congress and the Administration. The funding for US-VISIT was kept in FEMA's budget. It was initially coordinated under BTS but later became a stand-alone office within DHS. In FY2008, it was transferred to the NPPD for program protection and management oversight. The Administration requested $390 million for US-VISIT in FY2009, a decrease of $85 million. The Administration requested $390 million for US-VISIT in FY2009, a decrease of $85 million from the FY2009 enacted level. The House Committee recommended fully funding the President's request for US-VISIT but withheld $90 million pending the submission and approval of an expenditure plan. The Senate Committee recommended $180 million for US-VISIT, $210 million less than the President's request. The Senate Committee reduced the FY2009 appropriation for US-VISIT by $210 million to $180 million due to delays in submitting the expenditure plan. They fully funded an additional $62 million for program operations and management within the CBP Salaries and Expenses Account. Congress provided $300 million for US-VISIT in the Act, $90 million below the President's request. Congress provided $300 million for US-VISIT in the Act, $90 million below the President's request, with $70 million withheld until an expenditure plan is approved. $20 million was designated for identity management, $66.4 million for the Unique Identity program, and $25.3 million for moving operations to a DHS data center. The remaining $188 million was allocated for operations and maintenance. In FY2008, $188 million was allocated for operations and maintenance, program management, and the development of biometric exit solutions under US-VISIT. Congress may face issues regarding the implementation of the system, including the deployment of the exit component at land and air ports of entry, and the infrastructure's ability to support a 10 fingerprint system. US-VISIT conducted a pilot program in FY2008 to assess the impact of the 10 fingerprint enrollment system on infrastructure and traveler wait times. In FY2009, US-VISIT plans to deploy 3,000 new 10 fingerprint scanners to operational ports of entry. The Senate and House Committees approved full funding for the transition to a 10 fingerprint entry system under US-VISIT. Key issues include whether the current infrastructure can support the enhanced bandwidth needed, the effectiveness of the technology, and the potential impact on travel times and airline connections. Deployment of 3,000 new fingerprint scanners to ports of entry is planned for FY2009. The implementation of the 10 fingerprint entry solution and deployment of a biometric exit system are key concerns for Congress. US-VISIT is requesting $56 million for the exit component in FY2009 to address visa overstays. DHS plans to finalize a biometric exit strategy by the end of 2008, but the House Committee expressed concerns about the system being behind schedule. The House Committee expressed concerns about the delayed implementation of the exit component and the lack of pilot tests for biometric collection by private industry. They withheld funding for the exit solution until pilot programs are conducted by US-VISIT and CBP. DHS was directed to provide a comprehensive strategy for implementing an exit solution at all ports of entry. The Infrastructure Protection and Information Security Program (IPIS) supports the activities of the Office of Infrastructure Protection (OIP) and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. OIP coordinates efforts to reduce risks to critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks or natural events through cooperation between the federal government, state, local, tribal governments, and the private sector. The IPIS supports OIP and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications in coordinating efforts to protect critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks or natural events. The NCSD and NCS focus on information networks and communication systems, respectively. The OEC promotes communication among emergency response providers. The President requested $841 million for IPIS in FY2009. The President requested $841 million for IPIS in FY2009, an increase of $186 million from FY2008. The funding increase includes $44 million for baseline changes and $142 million for programmatic activities, such as hiring additional personnel. The National Communication System request is $101 million above last year's enacted amount, with $35 million allocated for the Next Generation Network program to upgrade technology. In FY2008, Congress did not fully fund the President's request for a new IP-based packet technology program, citing lack of justification by DHS. A $57 million increase in the NCS request would support the National Command and Coordination Capability (NCCC) to integrate networks for classified and sensitive information sharing. The NCCC is overseen by the Secretary of DHS through the NCS, with funds allocated for setting up the NCCC Management Coordination Office and enhancing interoperable hardware and software. The NCS requested a $35 million increase in funding to take over the Coast Guard's LORAN system and an $83 million increase overall. The increase would support the expansion of the Division's Einstein program and its role in OMB's Trusted Internet Connections initiative. The funding would be used for acquiring and deploying hardware and software, expanding facilities, and hiring additional personnel and contractor services. The requested budget increase for IP is less than a million dollars, with increases for staff, chemical facility security compliance, and Protective Security Advisors. Proposed decreases include NIPP management, National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, and the Bomb Prevention Program. Congress had appropriated funds above the President's request for these programs in FY2008. The House Committee recommended $847 million for the IPIS program but voted to withhold $149 million from three programs until expenditure plans are received. The House Committee recommended additional funding for Infrastructure Protection and the National Cyber Security Division, but less funding for the National Communications System program. They also suggested transferring the $50 million REAL ID Hub program to NPPD from USCIS to focus on backlog applications. Additionally, an extra $16 million was included in the Infrastructure Protection PPA. The Committee recommended additional funding for Infrastructure Protection, including $16 million for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and $2 million for the Bombing Prevention Program. They also allocated $12 million for chemical plant security compliance and $2 million for video surveillance cameras in Philadelphia. Additionally, $3 million was designated for studying manhole cover locking systems for underground utilities security. Half of the $121 million U.S.-CERT budget was withheld pending an expenditure plan for the National Cyber Security Initiative. The Committee recommended additional funding for Infrastructure Protection, including $16 million for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and $2 million for the Bombing Prevention Program. They also allocated $12 million for chemical plant security compliance and $2 million for video surveillance cameras in Philadelphia. Additionally, $3 million was designated for studying manhole cover locking systems for underground utilities security. The Committee recommended $4 million more than the request for testing at Idaho National Laboratory the security of control systems. Within the National Communications System PPA, the Committee recommended $14 million for the National Command and Coordination Capability budget, about $47 million less than the request, and withheld all of this amount from obligation until it receives an expenditure plan for this program. The Committee also recommended $8 million less for the Next Generation Networks program, and withheld half of this amount from obligation until it receives an expenditure plan for the program. The House Committee did not support the transfer of the LORAN program to NPPD. The Senate Committee recommended a total of $809 million for the IPIS program. This included funding, above requested levels, for Infrastructure Protection (+$25 million), the National Cyber Security Initiative, and the National Command and Coordination Capability. The Committee recommended additional funding for Infrastructure Protection, including $25 million for Infrastructure Protection, $26 million for the National Cyber Security Division, and $10 million for the Office of Emergency Communications. They also recommended additional funds for the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center, the Bombing Prevention Program, and chemical plant security compliance. Additionally, they allocated funds to accelerate vulnerability assessments at Tier 1 and Tier 2. The Committee recommended additional funding for Infrastructure Protection, including $25 million for Infrastructure Protection, $26 million for the National Cyber Security Division, and $10 million for the Office of Emergency Communications to support international interoperability border demonstration projects. They also allocated funds for the National Command and Coordination Capability within the National Communications System, expressing concerns about the program's lack of strategic planning and operational capability. The funds provided are for conducting necessary planning. The Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to review the National Communications System program and did not support transferring the LORAN program. Congress approved $807 million for the IPIS program, with $152 million withheld until expenditure plans for specific projects were approved. This included funding for the National Cyber Security Initiative and the Next Generation Network. Additionally, $73 million was allocated for implementing chemical plant security within the IP program. Congress appropriated $73 million for implementing chemical plant security regulations and $5 million for regulating ammonium nitrate. It provided $11 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention, $31 million for NIPP management, $20 million for NISAC, and $6 million for vulnerability assessments. Additionally, funding was approved for the city of Philadelphia and studying protecting underground infrastructures. Congress also allocated $255 million for DHS's National Cyber Security Initiative and $50 million for the Next Generation Network. Congress appropriated $6 million for the National Command and Control Capability and $22 million for NCSD's activities to secure control systems of critical infrastructures. Congress did not support transferring LORAN to NPPD or the Real ID Hub from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to NPPD. There is disagreement between Congress and the Administration on the direction and pace of certain programs within the IPIS. The Administration wants to reduce funding in various areas, but Congress has not supported these reductions in the FY2008 and FY2009 budgets. The House and Senate are in basic agreement on supporting large increases for programs in the National Communications Systems PPA. The House recommended transferring the REAL ID Hub program to NPPD, while the Senate did not make a similar recommendation. Title IV includes appropriations for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and DNDO. USCIS focuses on adjudicating immigration petitions. USCIS handles various immigration petitions and benefits, funded mainly through the Examinations Fee Account. The agency has transformed its revenue structure and received appropriations for specific projects like backlog reduction initiatives. The USCIS agency's revenues primarily come from adjudication fees of immigration benefit applications and petitions. In the FY2009 budget request, $151 million in direct appropriations was requested, with the remaining $2,539 million to be funded by collected fees. The total USCIS budget requested for FY2009 is approximately $2,690 million, representing a $70 million increase from FY2008. The direct appropriation includes funding for programs like the Employer Eligibility Verification Program and REAL ID Act implementation. The USCIS budget request for FY2009 includes $1,979 million for adjudication services, with funds allocated for pay and benefits, district operating expenses, service center operating expenses, and business transformation initiatives. Additional funding is requested for information and customer services, administration, and the SAVE Program. House-reported H.R. 6947 would have provided USCIS with total appropriations of $2,641 million. The House-reported bill would have allocated $2,641 million to USCIS, with $2,539 million in mandatory appropriations from fees and $102 million in direct appropriations. The funds included $54 million for Customer Service Center operations, premium processing revenues for business and IT transformation, $100 million for E-Verify, $1 million for asylum/refugee expenses, and $1 million for citizenship education grants. Section 522 of the bill would have required background checks before granting immigration benefits. The House-reported bill allocated funds to USCIS, including $50 million for REAL ID implementation through NPPD. It also proposed citizenship education grants and addressed concerns over E-Verify system error rates. The House report urged USCIS to submit a detailed plan for a nationwide mandatory E-Verify program, expressed concerns over immigration benefit fee increases, refugee processing, and orphan identification issues in Vietnam. It also requested clarification on US policy regarding material support to extremist groups and funding levels for naturalization ceremonies. The Senate-reported S. 3181 would have provided USCIS with full funding of $2,690 million, including $2,539 million from fee collections and $151 million in direct appropriations. The report highlighted concerns about FBI background check backlogs and emphasized adherence to DHS privacy rules for the REAL ID program. The report urged USCIS to place personnel at the FBI name check facility to expedite information requests. P.L. 110-329 provided $102 million in direct appropriations, with $100 million specified for the E-Verify program. $1 million was allocated for citizenship education grants as per House-reported H.R. 6947. REAL ID funding from Senate-reported S. 3181 was included in Title V of the public law. The USCIS was directed to collect $2,539 million in fee collections for adjudication services. $54 million must be used for Customer Service Center operations, $28 million for converting immigration records to digital format. USCIS must inform Congress of resource requirements to prevent backlogs with the FBI Name Check Program. The USCIS experienced a surge in naturalization applications in FY2007, leading to a backlog and increased processing times. The agency received over 1.2 million more applications compared to FY2006, totaling over 3 million applications. Processing time for applications filed during the surge was estimated to be 16-18 months, compared to 6-7 months in FY2006. The USCIS faced a surge in naturalization applications in FY2007, resulting in a backlog and longer processing times. USCIS officials estimated it would take 13-15 months to process an application for naturalization as of April 2008. The surge in applications was largely attributed to a fee increase in July 2007, which raised application fees by an average of 96%. Critics raised concerns that applicants might not naturalize in time for the 2008 election. USCIS did not request additional funding to hire temporary personnel to address the backlog. In response to a backlog in immigration benefit applications, USCIS authorized granting benefits to 47,000 LPR applicants without completed FBI name checks, raising concerns about security threats. The USCIS ombudsman argued that the FBI name check process has limited value for public safety or national security, as most applicants are already living and working in the U.S. without restriction. The USCIS Ombudsman's 2008 Annual Report highlighted a backlog in name checks, with 81% pending for over 90 days and 28% for over a year. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides training for various law enforcement entities, focusing on developing skills for safe and effective law enforcement functions. FLETC has four training sites and over 1,000 employees. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in the United States requested $274 million in FY2009, a decrease of $14 million from the previous year. The Administration sought to increase positions for training additional law enforcement personnel. The House Committee recommended $286 million for FLETC in FY2009, allocating funds for improved training capabilities and additional instructors. The House Committee did not support the Administration's requests to transfer FLETA and close down its Washington D.C. office. The Senate Committee recommended $324 million for FLETC in FY2009, with $50 million increase over the President's request. This included funds for a new dormitory in Charleston, South Carolina, completing construction in Artesia, New Mexico, and law enforcement accreditation. The Senate Committee also prohibited the transfer of FLETA and closing or transferring the Washington D.C. office. Additionally, $5 million was recommended for a Rural Policing Institute. Congress provided $339 million for FLETC in the Continuing Resolution, $65 million more than the President's request. $40 million is allocated for construction of a replacement dormitory in Charleston, South Carolina, and $3 million for construction in Artesia, New Mexico. Congress also denied FLETC's request to close its Washington D.C. office, provided $4 million for the creation of a Rural Policing Institute, and allocated $6 million above the President's request for the training needs of additional CBP and ICE personnel. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary DHS organization for research and development, headed by the Under Secretary for Science and Technology. The Science and Technology Directorate of DHS conducts R&D in its own labs and funds R&D in national labs, industry, universities, and government agencies. The Administration requested $869 million for FY2009, a 5% increase from FY2008. Proposed increases include $18 million for countering IEDs, $43 million for Laboratory Facilities, and a $27 million reduction in the Infrastructure and Geophysical program. The House committee recommended a total of $887 million for the Science and Technology Directorate of DHS for FY2009. Increases included funding for the National Institute for Hometown Security, ongoing construction at PNNL, first responder technologies, homeland security industrial base, and University Programs. Decreases were seen in funding for new maritime technologies and the Infrastructure and Geophysical program. The Senate committee recommended a total of $919 million for the Science and Technology Directorate of DHS for FY2009. Increases included $25 million for cyber security research, $27 million for the Infrastructure and Geophysical program, and $15 million for Laboratory Facilities. Decreases included $12 million for Innovation and $4 million for Human Factors. The committee also recommended $5 million for the Homeland Security Institute as a separate item. The final appropriation for the Science and Technology Directorate of DHS for FY2009 was $933 million. Increases included $10 million for cyber security research, $11 million for the National Institute for Hometown Security, $27 million for the Southeast Region Research Initiative, $15 million for construction at PNNL, and $6 million for University Programs. Decreases included $12 million from Innovation due to concerns raised by the DHS Inspector General. Funding for the Homeland Security Institute was provided separately. The Science and Technology Directorate of DHS received a final appropriation of $933 million for FY2009. This included increases for cyber security research, the National Institute for Hometown Security, the Southeast Region Research Initiative, construction at PNNL, and University Programs. Decreases were seen in funding for Innovation. The directorate announced new university centers of excellence in February 2008, with plans to terminate or merge existing centers to align with its division structure. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for all DHS nuclear detection research and activities. The Administration requested $564 million for DNDO in FY2009, a 16% increase from FY2008. The House committee recommended $544 million, with reductions in various areas including new headquarters employees and the Radiation Portal Monitoring Program. The House continued the prohibition on full-scale procurement of ASPs until certification. The Senate committee recommended a total of $541 million for DNDO in FY2009, with a reduction of $23 million in the Radiation Portal Monitoring Program due to delays in ASP performance certification. The Senate continued the prohibition on full-scale ASP procurement until secretarial certification and prohibited high-risk concurrent development of software and hardware components. The committee urged DNDO to prioritize programs based on risk and directed it to contract with the National Academy of Sciences. The final appropriation for DNDO in FY2009 was $514 million, with reductions in new initiatives and the Radiation Portal Monitoring Program. Congressional attention focused on DNDO's testing and analysis for ASP procurement. The prohibition on full-scale ASP procurement and high-risk concurrent development continued. The ASP procurement has been included in appropriations acts since FY2007, with a current target certification date of November 2008. Congressional interest remains in the global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO and the roles of DNDO and the S&T Directorate. The President's FY2009 budget request included nearly $992 billion in discretionary budget authority. The House and Senate Budget Committees reported budget resolutions in March 2008. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 70) passed in March 2008 assumes funding above the President's requested level for 2009 in key budget functions for nondefense homeland security activities. The final agreement reached in June 2008 aims to strengthen the security of the nation's transportation system, especially in ports with security shortfalls. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided emergency funding to DHS components, including $200 million for consolidating the DHS headquarters and $5 million for oversight and auditing by the Office of Inspector General. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for DHS oversight and auditing. $160 million for CBP Salaries and Expenses, $100 million for NII systems, $60 million for tactical communications. $100 million for border security technology on the Southwest border. $420 million for CBP Construction for land ports-of-entry. $20 million for ICE's Automation Modernization. $20 million allocated for ICE's Automation Modernization account for tactical communications equipment and radios. $1,000 million for TSA's Aviation Security account for explosives detection systems. $98 million for Coast Guard for shore facilities, aids to navigation, and vessel repairs. $142 million for Coast Guard Alteration of Bridges account.

A DHS expenditure plan is required within 45 days of enactment of P.L. 111-5. $300 million to FEMA's State and Local Program account, with $150 million for Public Transportation Security Assistance, Railroad Security Assistance, and Amtrak security, and $150 million for Port Security Grants. $210 million for FEMA's Firefighter Assistance Grants account for the modification, upgrade, or construction of non-Federal fire stations. $100 million for FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter account. Title VI of H.Rept. 111-16 includes \"buy American\" requirements for DHS funds. The DHS funding provided in FY2008 included $8,260 million in emergency supplemental funding, with $300 million allocated to the Coast Guard for facility reconstruction. The Act also outlined restrictions on the procurement of fabric or fiber-related items not produced in the United States, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $7,960 million to FEMA for disaster relief and $3,000 million for border security. Division E of the Act included $2,710 million for border security purposes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $2,710 million for emergency border security funding, distributed among various DHS accounts including CBP, ICE, US-VISIT, State and Local Programs, U.S. Coast Guard, USCIS, and FLETC. In FY2008, emergency border security funding of $1.5 billion was allocated for CBP, with $323 million for Salaries and Expenses. This included funding for additional CBP officers at international airports, terrorist prevention system enhancements, electronic travel authorization program, Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, and ground transportation vehicle contract.

This funding is part of the Financial Services portion of the legislation to support anticipated immigration enforcement actions. In FY2008, emergency border security funding includes $225 million for construction at land ports of entry under GSA. Additionally, $25 million is allocated for border security initiatives within Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services to address increased immigration enforcement workload along the Southwest border. $11 million allocated for Defender Services to address increased workload of attorneys due to immigration enforcement along the Southwest border. Homeland security funding has been a focus since 9/11, with annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism including analysis on homeland security funding. The Department of Homeland Security funding is not the only federal spending on homeland security efforts. DHS funding for FY2009 accounts for 49.5% of total federal funding, with the Department of Defense at 26.6%, Department of Health and Human Services at 6.7%, Department of Justice at 5.7%, and Department of State at 3.7% rounding out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. The top five agencies in federal spending on homeland security are Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, Department of State, and Justice. These agencies collectively account for nearly 92.2% of all spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security related, as legacy agencies also conduct other activities. The FY2009 request included a total homeland security budget authority of $32.8 billion for DHS, with a requested total gross budget authority of $46.8 billion."
