The Federal Government is prohibited from selling or disposing of designated sites for 2 years, unless the Governor objects. The Governor of the State can object to a refinery site designation within 60 days, which can be overridden by Congress. Redevelopment plans for closed military installations must consider the feasibility of siting a refinery on the site. The Secretary of Defense must consider recommendations from the redevelopment authority regarding the siting of a refinery on a closed military installation. SEC. 3.

All relevant agencies must cooperate and comply with deadlines set by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to establish a schedule for all Federal refinery authorizations to ensure timely completion. The Secretary, in coordination with Federal and State agencies, maintains a consolidated record of decisions and actions related to Federal refinery authorizations. If agencies fail to meet approval schedules, applicants can seek remedies under subsection (d).
