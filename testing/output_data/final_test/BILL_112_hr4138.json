    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium Act\". Congress finds that Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neurologic disease affecting an estimated 11,000 patients in the United States. Women are disproportionately affected, with a large proportion of African-American patients. The average age at diagnosis is 41 years, but it can occur in children as young as 2 and adults as old as 89. NMO is believed to be autoimmune in nature, with over 90 percent of patients experiencing recurrent disease and neurologic disability. Orphan diseases like NMO, with low incidence rates, often lack attention and research funding. No single institution has enough patients to conduct comprehensive research on NMO. There is a lack of studies analyzing all aspects of NMO to identify risk factors and biomarkers. Understanding NMO can help in studying other autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and lupus. The sense of Congress is to establish a multicenter research effort to study the causes of NMO and identify biomarkers. Collaboration between regional consortia and academic medical centers is encouraged to investigate environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors related to NMO. Additionally, the National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium is to be established. Establishment of the National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium under section 409K of the Public Health Service Act to study the causes of NMO and identify biomarkers. Collaboration between regional consortia and academic medical centers is encouraged to investigate environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors related to NMO. The National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium (NNO Consortium) will be established within a year of the enactment of this section to conduct research on the causes, risk factors, and biomarkers associated with NMO. Grants will be provided for a minimum of 5 years to eligible consortia for this purpose. The NNO Consortium will assemble a panel of experts to provide ongoing guidance for research on NMO, including developing a common study design and standard protocols for collecting medical history, neurologic examination, biospecimens, and radiological data. The NNO Consortium requires radiological data, specific analytical methods, consensus review of cases, an integrated data collection network, and a central laboratory for research funded by the consortium. Eligible consortia must demonstrate the capability to enroll participants. The NNO Consortium requires the capability to enroll at least 25 individuals with NMO diagnosis from a specific catchment area that does not overlap with other consortia. The Secretary must submit an annual report on research funded by the consortium and list of grant recipients. The NNO Consortium requires funding of $25,000,000 annually from 2013 to 2017 for research activities in defined catchment areas. The NNO Consortium requires $25,000,000 annually from 2013 to 2017 for research in designated catchment areas with population data available. A consortium is defined as a partnership of universities, health care organizations, or government agencies serving the catchment area."
