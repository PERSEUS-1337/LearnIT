    "content": "The South Korean consortium signed a $20 billion contract in December 2009 to provide four nuclear reactors to the UAE, marking South Korea's transition to a major nuclear technology supplier. The plants are based on a U.S. design, requiring U.S. export controls. Westinghouse received authorization from the U.S. DOE in March 2010 for technology transfer to the UAE. A peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement between the UAE and the U.S. was also established in December 2009. The UAE's nuclear power program, governed by a peaceful cooperation agreement with the U.S., is subject to restrictions on fuel cycle facilities to prevent weapons proliferation. South Korea, a major nuclear technology supplier, seeks advanced U.S. consent for reprocessing and enrichment technologies in future agreements. This could impact the renewal of the U.S.-Korea nuclear cooperation agreement. South Korea seeks advanced U.S. consent for reprocessing and enrichment technologies in future agreements, citing the need to compete globally. The U.S. is concerned about nuclear weapons proliferation implications and potential security issues on the Korean peninsula. An extension of the existing 123 agreement was announced to allow for further negotiations. South Korea, like France and Japan, is following a path of developing its nuclear power industry with technology licensed from U.S. companies. The South Korean consortium, led by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), competes for nuclear plant contracts globally, including in the United States. The consortium includes other major Korean industrial companies and Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric Company. The South Korean consortium, led by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), competes globally for nuclear plant contracts. The consortium includes Korean companies and Westinghouse Electric Company. Westinghouse provides support for Korea's nuclear power plants under a design license. The Korean plant in the UAE is based on the APR-1400 model, a modified version of the System 80+ design by Combustion Engineering. The total value of components and services for the UAE project is estimated at $2 billion. The South Korean economy, once much smaller than Japan's, has grown significantly, allowing for the successful development of a nuclear power program through KEPCO. The South Korean economy has grown significantly, enabling the development of a nuclear power program through KEPCO. Initially, foreign suppliers like Westinghouse provided turn-key nuclear power units, with Korean firms gradually taking over construction work on subsequent plants. In 1985, foreign companies like Westinghouse, AECL, and Framatome provided NSSS, turbine-generators, and architect/engineering services for South Korea's nuclear power program. KEPCO later established a standard Korean design based on the System 80 design from Combustion Engineering, with full technology transfer agreed upon in a contract signed in 1987 and extended in 1997. U.S. contractors for turbine-generators and architect/engineering services agreed to transfer key technology to Korean firms for the construction of nuclear power plants. Major U.S. companies served as subcontractors to Korean firms, with partnerships formed to build several plants. Korean reactor designers collaborated with foreign firms to develop a standard Korean design. The collaboration between Korean and foreign firms led to the development of the 1,000 megawatt Optimized Power Reactor (OPR-1000) and the more advanced APR-1400 model. Korean firms built the OPR-1000 units with some key components supplied by non-Korean firms. The APR-1400 design was completed in 1999, based on the C-E System 80+ design certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1997. South Korea has four nuclear units under construction, with plans for more APR-1400 reactors to increase nuclear power capacity to 42,700 megawatts by 2030. The country aims to generate 59% of its electricity from nuclear plants by 2030. South Korea plans to complete one reactor per year through 2030, with a goal to capture 20% of the world nuclear power plant market in the next 20 years. This expansion of the nuclear engineering and construction industry would rely heavily on exports, with the recent reactor sale to the UAE seen as the beginning of a larger global marketing effort. South Korea aims to capture 20% of the global nuclear power plant market by completing one reactor per year through 2030. Recent indications suggest a scaling back of targets, but the country is still competing vigorously for export sales, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. The UAE contract for the Barakah plant is the first foreign reactor sale for South Korea and is expected to set a template for future exports. The ROK government's emphasis on the contract was highlighted by President Lee Myung-bak's presence at the signing ceremony in December 2009. Construction of the first Barakah reactor in the UAE began in July 2012 with the KEPCO consortium overseeing the project. The $20 billion contract includes designing, building, operating, and maintaining four nuclear units, with the first unit expected to start commercial operation in 2017 and the remaining three by 2020. Korean investors will have an equity interest in the UAE plants, and extensive training will be provided for UAE nationals to staff the nuclear plant. The Korean consortium, led by KEPCO, won a $20 billion contract to oversee the construction and operation of the Barakah nuclear plant in the UAE. They were chosen over Areva and General Electric-Hitachi due to their lower bid, which was $16 billion less than Areva's offer. Discussions are ongoing for a potential $20 billion contract for long-term operation and maintenance of the plant. The Korean consortium, led by KEPCO, won a $20 billion contract for the Barakah nuclear plant in the UAE, with costs lower than U.S. reactors. Korean and U.S. companies collaborated on the project, with Korean firms gradually taking over most work. KEPCO, KHNP, and other members of the consortium have specific roles in the project. The Korean consortium, led by KEPCO, won a $20 billion contract for the Barakah nuclear plant in the UAE. Korean and U.S. companies collaborated on the project, with Korean firms gradually taking over most work. KEPCO, KHNP, and other members of the consortium have specific roles in the project. KEPCO subsidiary KOPEC, Korea Nuclear Fuel Company (KNF), Korea Plant Service and Engineering Company (KPS), Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction, Samsung C&T Corporation, Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Westinghouse Electric Company, and Toshiba Corporation are involved in various aspects of the project. Westinghouse and other U.S. companies are expected to carry out 10% of the work on the Barakah project, with $2 billion in financing approved by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. This financing is estimated to support approximately 5,000 American jobs across 17 states. Items to be supplied include reactor coolant pumps, components, controls, engineering services, and training. Despite technology transfer to Korean firms, Westinghouse still plays a significant role in the project. Westinghouse considers Korean reactors as their licensed products, subjecting Korean exports like the APR-1400 to U.S. export control requirements. Marketing restrictions from the original licensing agreement continue under a new \"business cooperation agreement.\" Westinghouse is collaborating with Korean industry to produce control element assemblies for C-E reactor designs, including UAE projects. A joint venture with KNF in Korea will produce these assemblies, with Westinghouse owning 55% of the venture. The Korean Ministry of Knowledge Economy aims for a 20% South Korean share of the global nuclear power plant market, positioning South Korea alongside Russia, France, and the United States. The ministry sees nuclear power-related business as highly profitable, following industries like automobiles, semiconductors, and shipbuilding. South Korean firms are urged to expand their presence in the $78 billion world market for operation, maintenance, and repair of nuclear power plants. Despite potential optimism, South Korea remains committed to being a significant player in the global nuclear market, with the UAE contract boosting credibility and altering market dynamics. The UAE contract with South Korea has altered the dynamics of the world nuclear power market. Areva is looking to modify its plant design to cut costs after losing the UAE contract. Other potential Korean export deals are being considered in Indonesia, the United States, Jordan, and Indonesia. Japanese firms are also under consideration for these projects. Alternate Energy Holdings Incorporated (AEHI) is negotiating with South Korean officials to build APR-1400 nuclear units in Idaho and Colorado, similar to the UAE agreement. KEPCO is also considering exporting the APR-1400 to the United States and met with the U.S. NRC for standard design certification. Financing plans for the projects are unknown. The NRC officials stressed that the meeting did not start the review of the APR-1400 design certification. The KEPCO design certification review is scheduled to begin in mid-2013 with no completion date set. Korea's nuclear industry would need to expand to meet export goals, aiming to complete an average of one reactor per year domestically. To achieve the goal of exporting 80 units by 2030, the industry would need to complete an additional four units per year. To expand Korea's nuclear plant construction capacity, MKE plans to train 2,800 nuclear technical staff by 2011 and invest $350 million in design improvements. South Korea aims to be self-sufficient in nuclear reactor technology by 2012, with R&D cooperation dating back to the Atoms for Peace program. Joint U.S.-ROK nuclear projects have been ongoing since 1962. Joint research on the nuclear fuel cycle between South Korea and the United States has faced challenges. The current peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement, signed in 1972, requires U.S. consent for South Korea to reprocess spent fuel. In the 1980s, Korea proposed the TANDEM fuel cycle, but the United States opposed this plan. In the 1990s, Korea conducted joint research with the US and Canada on the DUPIC fuel cycle, converting light water reactor spent fuel into Candu fuel without reprocessing. However, KEPCO showed little interest in the technology. In the 2000s, KAERI focused on pyroprocessing to handle spent fuel inventory, partially separating uranium, plutonium, and other elements through an electrometallurgical process. Pyroprocessing facilities partially separate plutonium and other elements through electrodeposition on a cathode. The process is considered proliferation-resistant as it cannot produce pure plutonium. The George W. Bush Administration supported South Korea's pursuit of pyroprocessing technology, leading to the construction of the Advanced Conditioning Pyroprocess Facility (ACPF) at KAERI for commercial-scale operation. The Bush Administration withheld permission for spent fuel separation work in Korea, including oxide fuel reduction to metal, due to concerns about violating the 1992 Joint Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They proposed carrying out all separation work in the United States at the Idaho National Laboratory. South Korea objected to this and began sponsoring seminars to address the issue. South Korea strongly objected to the U.S. proposal for spent fuel separation work, leading to a 10-year Joint Fuel Cycle Study in 2011. KAERI scientists would conduct work at U.S. facilities, while Korea's operations would be limited to simulated material. Collaboration between South Korea and the U.S. extends to international R&D organizations like the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and the International Atomic Energy Agency's International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO). Both countries are also members of the International Framework on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC). The U.S. and South Korea are working on a new 123 agreement for nuclear cooperation before the current one expires in 2014. The Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC) provides a forum for discussions on nuclear research and other energy issues between the two countries. A new U.S.-Korea 123 agreement does not require congressional approval but must be presented to Congress for 90 days before going into effect. If the agreement expires, NRC would be prohibited from issuing export licenses for nuclear reactors or materials to Korea. Under NRC regulations, specific licenses are required for exporting major reactor components like reactor pressure vessels and control rod systems. Minor reactor components can be exported under a general NRC license with \"generic assurances\" for peaceful purposes. The Republic of Korea is included in the list of countries eligible for exporting minor reactor components under a general license. If the U.S.-ROK 123 agreement lapses, South Korea may be removed from the general license list for exporting minor reactor components. Specific licenses would then be required, but Commerce Department export regulations would still apply. Special nuclear material needs specific NRC licenses for shipments over 1 gram, and uranium exports above certain levels also require specific licenses. Without a 123 agreement, specific licenses for nuclear materials exports cannot be issued. Exports below specified levels can use a general NRC license and do not require a 123 agreement. These exports cannot go to a country on NRC's embargo list, excluding South Korea. Table 1 lists current NRC specific licenses for U.S. exports to South Korea, including pressurized water reactors, reactor components, and nuclear materials. Most licenses expire before the U.S.-ROK 123 agreement. U.S. companies may need DOE authorization under 10 CFR Part 810 for nuclear-related business abroad. Section 57b of the Atomic Energy Act requires DOE authorization for companies or individuals engaging in the production of special nuclear material outside the U.S., involving nuclear technology transfer and services. U.S. exports to South Korea include nuclear components and fuel elements, with some large exports estimated to be worth up to $200 million each. The total value of these exports is difficult to estimate. The total value of U.S. exports to South Korea, including nuclear components and fuel elements, is estimated to be higher than shown in the Comtrade data base search. A major U.S. uranium enrichment company signed a $400 million contract with South Korea, averaging $67 million per year. U.S. exports of natural uranium to Korea are smaller, with an average of $19 million from 2007-2011. The UAE Barakah plant, a Korean-U.S. nuclear project, could be impacted by a lapse in the U.S.-ROK 123 agreement, with about $2 billion of work expected to go to U.S. companies. The UAE has its own 123 agreement with the United States, so exports to the UAE would not be directly affected by the U.S.-ROK agreement. However, some components will be sent to Korea for further fabrication and shipment to the UAE. Any components requiring NRC licenses could not be exported without a 123 agreement. The Barakah project is crucial for South Korea's nuclear export plans, and uncertainty regarding the 123 agreement would be a major concern for all parties involved. The U.S.-ROK agreement could impact major U.S.-Korean nuclear projects in China, specifically the construction of four reactors. The Chinese reactors are Westinghouse AP1000s with passive safety features. Lapses in 123 agreements have occurred before, such as with Euratom in 1995. The NRC suspended licenses for most Euratom countries in 1996, allowing exports to continue only to four countries with nonproliferation assurances. Despite some controversy, a new agreement took effect in March 1996. The future of U.S.-South Korean cooperation in nuclear energy markets poses policy considerations for both countries. The immediate challenge is the renewal of the 123 agreement. The renewal of the 123 agreement between the U.S. and South Korea is a key issue in their nuclear cooperation. South Korea is seeking U.S. advance consent for future reprocessing and enrichment activities, but the U.S. is hesitant due to nonproliferation concerns and potential security complications on the Korean peninsula. The change in presidential administrations in South Korea further complicates the outlook for a new agreement. The United States' control over South Korea's nuclear program has led to discussions on \"nuclear sovereignty.\" South Korean Minister Choi Kyung-hwan clarified that this term does not involve nuclear weapons development, but rather peaceful nuclear sovereignty. He criticized U.S. restrictions on South Korean spent fuel reprocessing as excessive and pointed to the UAE sale as a sign of global confidence in South Korea's capabilities. Koreans argue that the U.S. has granted advance consent for reprocessing to other countries and believe Korea should have similar rights. South Korea seeks advance consent for reprocessing spent fuel to address storage crisis. The nuclear industry aims to shift fuel to newer pools to delay space shortage until early 2020s. Dry storage expansion is challenging. South Korea's request for advance consent on uranium enrichment is politically and legally problematic. KAERI's program aims to develop pyroprocessing technology for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent fuel in fast reactors. Supporters argue that a \"closed\" fuel cycle could increase public acceptance and provide a secure, domestic energy source. Critics question the need for advance consent and point out competition in the world market. South Korea is considering building an enrichment plant to reduce reliance on foreign providers and offer complete fuel supply services with reactor sales. This move could potentially undermine U.S. policy against expanding enrichment technology to additional countries. South Korea's consideration of building an enrichment plant could undermine U.S. policy against expanding enrichment technology to other countries. Granting advance consent to South Korea may complicate efforts to persuade North Korea to denuclearize. Negotiations on renewing the 123 agreement have been challenging due to differing views on reprocessing and enrichment, leading to a two-year extension of the existing agreement in 2013. Negotiators are considering various compromise approaches for a new agreement with South Korea regarding reprocessing and enrichment activities. Options include a short-term agreement, advance consent with conditions, and advance consent for limited activities. These decisions are crucial in the context of the Korean Peninsula denuclearization agreement and the renewal of the 123 agreement. South Korea's nuclear energy technology export program, including the operation of KAERI's Advanced Conditioning Pyroprocess Facility, would require further DOE 810 authorizations for the transfer of U.S.-based technology. The Secretary of Energy must ensure that each proposed technology export aligns with U.S. interests, with input from the Department of State, NRC, and other relevant departments. Controls on the re-transfer of U.S.-origin nuclear technology after export by Korea would also be examined. The growth of South Korea's nuclear energy technology export program presents opportunities and challenges for the U.S. industry. The recent KEPCO-UAE sale highlights the potential benefits for U.S. companies, but also the competition they may face from Korea. As South Korea develops more indigenous reactor components, the opportunities for U.S. participation in export projects may decrease. Government ownership of KEPCO could also pose a competitive concern for the U.S. industry. South Korea may develop an exportable reactor design based on the APR-1400 with indigenous components by 2015, but Westinghouse may not allow it to compete in key markets like the USA and China without KEPCO buying the rights. Issues related to South Korean nuclear sovereignty are likely to be discussed in U.S.-ROK relations."
