    "content": "Article III, Section I of the Constitution establishes the judicial power of the United States in the Supreme Court and lower courts created by Congress. Justices and judges appointed under Article III serve for life unless removed for misconduct. This report focuses on recent nominations to the U.S. circuit courts of appeals and district courts by President Obama and other Presidents, excluding nominations to the Supreme Court and U.S. Court of International Trade. In recent Congresses, there has been ongoing interest in the nomination and approval process of U.S. circuit and district court judges by the President and Senate. Senate debates have discussed the success rate of a President's nominees in gaining confirmation, the timing of consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the increase in vacant judgeships in the federal judiciary. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII in November 2013 to lower the vote threshold for cloture on presidential nominations, allowing a simple majority to confirm nominations. This change was in effect from the first to the second session of the 113th Congress. The Senate reinterpreted Senate Rule XXII in November 2013 to lower the vote threshold for cloture on presidential nominations, allowing a simple majority to confirm nominations. This change was in effect from the first to the second session of the 113th Congress. The purpose of this report is to provide an annual update of certain statistics related to the nomination and confirmation of lower federal court judges during the current presidency, with a focus on the aggregate statistics of the current President's first six years in office. The report compares the number and percentage of U.S. circuit and district court nominees confirmed during the first six years of past presidencies. It also analyzes the time from nomination to confirmation for nominees approved by the Senate. Additionally, it examines the percentage of vacant judgeships and \"judicial emergencies\" at the beginning of each President's sixth and seventh years in office. The report provides a comparative analysis of U.S. circuit and district court nominees confirmed during the first six years of past presidencies. It also examines the time from nomination to confirmation and the percentage of vacant judgeships and \"judicial emergencies\" at specific points in each President's term. Table 1 shows the total number of circuit court nominees confirmed by the end of a President's sixth year in office, as well as the number and percentage confirmed after the sixth year. It also includes the number and percentage of nominees never confirmed. Each President nominated between 61 and 68 individuals to circuit court judgeships during their first six years in office. During their first six years in office, Presidents Reagan and G.W. Bush nominated the most individuals for circuit court judgeships, with Reagan having the highest confirmation percentage (97.1%) and Bush the lowest (75.0%). President Obama nominated the fewest individuals but had the second-highest confirmation percentage (86.9%) by the end of his sixth year. Reagan had the most nominees confirmed (66) by the end of his sixth year. During their first six years in office, President Reagan had the most circuit court nominees confirmed (66), while President Clinton had the fewest (50). President Obama had the second-highest number confirmed (53) by the end of his sixth year. If two nominees from Obama's first six years are confirmed during the 114th Congress, the percentage of nominees confirmed would increase to 90.2%. President G.W. Bush had 51 nominees confirmed, and four nominees from his first six years were confirmed later, bringing the total to 80.9%. During President Clinton's first six years, four circuit court nominees were eventually confirmed later in his presidency, raising the percentage of nominees confirmed to 87.1%. President G.W. Bush had the highest percentage of nominees never confirmed at 19.1%. Table 2 presents the total number of district court nominees and the confirmation percentages for Reagan, Clinton, G.W. Bush, and Obama during their first six years in office. Table 2 shows the number and percentage of district court nominees confirmed after the sixth year of each presidency. Presidents nominated between 230 and 275 individuals to district court judgeships during their first six years, with Clinton and Obama nominating the most. Reagan had the highest confirmation percentage at 97.4%, while G.W. Bush had the lowest at 86.8%. During his first six years in office, President G.W. Bush had the lowest percentage of nominees confirmed (86.8%). President Obama had the second-highest percentage (92.6%) and the greatest number of nominees confirmed (250). Nine nominees from Obama's first six years have been renominated during the 114th Congress, potentially increasing the confirmation rate to 95.9%. During President G.W. Bush's presidency, 24 district court nominees nominated in his first six years were confirmed later, increasing the total to 227 (97.0%). President Clinton had the highest number of nominees not confirmed (23, 8.4%), followed by Presidents G.W. Bush (7, 3.0%) and Reagan (4, 1.7%). During President Obama's sixth year in office, 12 circuit court nominees were confirmed, the second-highest among the four Presidents. This accounted for 22.6% of the total 53 circuit court nominees confirmed during his first six years. The number of circuit court nominees confirmed during just the sixth year accounted for 17.6%, 26.0%, and 16.7% for Presidents G.W. Bush, Clinton, and Reagan, respectively. During recent presidencies, the number of circuit court nominees confirmed during a President's sixth year in office tends to be greater than in the fifth year. President Reagan had fewer nominees confirmed in his sixth year compared to his fifth year. President Clinton saw the greatest increase in nominees confirmed between his fifth and sixth years. The number of confirmed circuit court nominees also increased during the G.W. Bush and Obama presidencies. During recent presidencies, the number of district court nominees confirmed during a President's sixth year tends to be greater than in the fifth year. President Obama had 77 district court nominees confirmed in his sixth year, accounting for 30.8% of the total confirmed during his first six years. Presidents G.W. Bush, Clinton, and Reagan had 21, 50, and 33 nominees confirmed in their sixth years, respectively. The number of district court nominees confirmed in the sixth year accounted for 10.3%, 20.2%, and 14.7% of the total confirmed during each President's first six years. During a President's sixth year in office, the number of confirmed court nominees tends to increase compared to the fifth year. President Obama had the greatest increase in nominees confirmed between his fifth and sixth years. The number of confirmed circuit court nominees also increased during the G.W. Bush and Clinton presidencies. The increase in nominees confirmed during the Obama presidency's sixth year is likely due to a reinterpretation of Rule XXII. During President Obama's sixth year in office, a reinterpretation of Rule XXII led to a standing order reducing post-cloture consideration for district court nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours. This, along with a lower vote threshold for cloture, allowed the Senate to confirm more district court nominees. During President Obama's sixth year in office, a reinterpretation of Rule XXII reduced post-cloture consideration for district court nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours, leading to more confirmations. The statistics presented account for nominees confirmed during a President's first six years, tracking the average and median days from nomination to confirmation. During President Obama's sixth year in office, a reinterpretation of Rule XXII reduced post-cloture consideration for district court nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours, leading to more confirmations. The statistics show that President G.W. Bush's circuit court nominees had the longest wait time from nomination to confirmation, followed by President Obama, Clinton, and Reagan. Obama's nominees had the longest median wait time for confirmation. President Obama's confirmed nominees had an average wait time of 219.4 days from nomination to confirmation, while President G.W. Bush's district court nominees waited an average of 169.7 days. District court nominees confirmed during President Clinton's first six years waited an average of 129.6 days, and those confirmed during President Reagan's first six years waited 50.2 days. The median waiting times for district court nominees ranged from 214.5 days during Obama's first six years to 35 days during Reagan's first six years. During President Obama's presidency, U.S. district court nominees were confirmed within an average of 219.4 days. The confirmation process for nominees fell into three groups based on when they were nominated and approved by the Senate, either before or after a reinterpretation on November 21, 2013. During President Obama's presidency, U.S. district court nominees were confirmed within an average of 219.4 days. Nominees fell into three groups based on nomination and confirmation timing. U.S. district court nominees confirmed after a reinterpretation had the shortest wait time (167.0 days average, 154.5 days median). Comparatively, their wait time was similar to nominees during the first six years of the G.W. Bush presidency. The median waiting time for Obama nominees was closest to G.W. Bush nominees, longer than Reagan and Clinton nominees. Those confirmed after reinterpretation had the shortest wait time, while those confirmed before had the longest wait time. During the 113th Congress, a standing order reduced post-cloture consideration for district court nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours. This, along with lowering the cloture vote threshold, likely shortened the waiting times for confirmation of U.S. district court nominees. During the 113th Congress, a standing order reduced post-cloture consideration for district court nominations from 30 hours to 2 hours, likely shortening waiting times for confirmation. In the following years, a smaller percentage of circuit court nominees were first nominated and confirmed after a reinterpretation. Specifically, 4 out of 53 nominees fell into this group, with the shortest average and median wait time of 149.5 and 151.5 days, respectively. The average and median number of days for vacant circuit and district court judgeships were 257.0 and 229.0, respectively. The percentage of vacancies varies during a presidency due to the pace of nominee selection and Senate confirmation. Table 3 compares the percentage of vacancies for four Presidents in their sixth and seventh years in office. During certain presidencies, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships increased due to judges stepping down, leading to more vacancies. The highest percentages of vacancies at the beginning of the sixth and seventh years in office were seen during the Clinton and Obama presidencies. Obama had the lowest percentage of vacant judgeships in his seventh year at 3.9%. During Obama's seventh year in office, the percentage of vacant judgeships was the lowest at 3.9% compared to other Presidents' sixth or seventh years. The vacancy rates for circuit court judgeships decreased during the Clinton and Obama presidencies but increased during the Reagan and G.W. Bush presidencies. District court judgeships had the highest vacancy rates during the Clinton and Obama presidencies. During Obama's seventh year in office, the percentage of vacant district court judgeships was the lowest at 4.9%, compared to other Presidents' sixth or seventh years. The vacancy rates for district court judgeships declined during the Reagan, Clinton, and Obama presidencies, but increased slightly during the G.W. Bush presidency. A vacancy is considered a \"judicial emergency\" by the Judicial Conference of the United States under certain criteria. Judicial emergencies are declared for circuit and district court vacancies based on specific criteria, including case filings and vacancy duration. Factors affecting the percentage of judicial emergencies include the pace of nominee selection by the President and Senate consideration. For circuit court vacancies, a judicial emergency is declared if case filings exceed 700 per appellate panel or between 500 to 700 after 18 months. For district court vacancies, a judicial emergency is declared if weighted case filings exceed 600 per judgeship. The court declares judicial emergencies for circuit and district court vacancies based on specific criteria, including case filings and vacancy duration. A judicial emergency is declared for circuit court vacancies if case filings exceed 700 per appellate panel or between 500 to 700 after 18 months. For district court vacancies, a judicial emergency is declared if weighted case filings exceed 600 per judgeship. President Obama and his predecessors' comparison of judicial emergencies in their sixth and seventh years in office is shown in Table 4. During the sixth year in office, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships considered judicial emergencies was highest under the G.W. Bush presidency (61.5%), followed by Obama (58.8%) and Clinton (39.1%). In the seventh year, G.W. Bush had the highest percentage (81.2%), while Obama's decreased from 58.8% to 42.9%. Clinton's percentage was 64.7% in his seventh year. During the sixth year in office, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships considered judicial emergencies was highest under the G.W. Bush presidency (61.5%), followed by Obama (58.8%) and Clinton (39.1%). In the seventh year, G.W. Bush had the highest percentage (81.2%), while Obama's decreased to 42.9%. Clinton's percentage was 64.7% in his seventh year. The percentage of vacant district court judgeships considered judicial emergencies on January 1 of a President's sixth year was greatest during the Obama presidency (36.0%), followed by Clinton and G.W. Bush presidencies (33.3% and 22.9%, respectively). During his seventh year in office, the percentage of vacant district court judgeships considered judicial emergencies declined from 36.0% to 27.3%. For Presidents Clinton and G.W. Bush, the percentage of vacant circuit court judgeships deemed judicial emergencies increased from January 1 of their sixth to seventh year."
