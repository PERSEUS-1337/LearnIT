    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teen Pregnancy Prevention, Responsibility, and Opportunity Act of 2006\". Congress finds that the United States has the highest teen-pregnancy rate and teen birth rate in the western industrialized world, costing the country billions annually. About 1 in 3 young women in the US becomes pregnant before the age of 20, leading to serious consequences such as high school dropout, poverty, and increased likelihood of children ending up in prison or becoming teen parents themselves. Teens growing up in disadvantaged circumstances are particularly at risk. Teens in disadvantaged circumstances more likely to engage in risky behavior and have a child during adolescence. Strong emotional attachments to parents delay sexual activity. Lack of communication with parents is a common reason for teen pregnancy. Unsupervised hours increase likelihood of teens having sex. After-school programs reduce risky behavior. After-school programs reduce teen risky behavior by providing activities that offer alternatives to sex, such as sports for girls, leading to delayed sexual activity and fewer partners. These programs also help prevent teen pregnancy by promoting good decision-making skills, offering health education, and providing positive role models in a supervised setting. Many teens express regret about having sex too early. SEC. 3. EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR PREVENTING TEEN PREGNANCIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to local educational agencies, public health agencies, and nonprofit entities for projects educating on preventing teen pregnancies.
