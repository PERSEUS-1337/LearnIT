    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Disaster Recovery Improvement Act\" and includes provisions for additional mitigation assistance. Section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to allow for additional mitigation assistance if a State has an approved State building code in effect and actively enforced. The President may increase the maximum total contributions for a major disaster by 5 percent of the estimated grants amount if this condition is met. States must submit their building code to the President every four years to be eligible for this increased Federal share. The President must approve a State building code if it aligns with a nationally recognized model building code, is adopted within 4 years, and uses the model code as a minimum standard. Definitions include \"actively enforcing\" as effective jurisdictional execution. Enforcing refers to the effective jurisdictional execution of all phases of a State building code, including examination, approval of construction plans, specifications, and inspection of new construction or renovation. A nationally recognized model building code is one developed in an open consensus forum with input from national experts, based on national structural design standards. The State building code establishes design standards for residential and commercial buildings to protect users from natural disasters. It includes requirements and standards for construction materials implemented statewide through ordinances or zoning laws. The State building code sets design standards for residential and commercial buildings to safeguard against natural disasters. Requirements apply to construction activities of residential building contractors for single-family and two-family structures, as well as engineers, architects, designers, and commercial building contractors for commercial, industrial, and multifamily structures. Regulations must be established within 180 days by the President through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will issue necessary regulations to implement the State building code for residential and commercial buildings to protect against natural disasters. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED PAYMENTS. Amends Section 406 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to require the President to provide at least 50% of the initial estimate of federal assistance within 60 days of the estimate. SEC. 4. DEBRIS REMOVAL. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to increase the Federal share by 5 percent for States and local governments with approved debris management plans and prequalified debris removal contractors. Additionally, financial incentives for debris recycling are introduced, allowing grant recipients to use funds for recycling costs. Grant recipients under subsection (a)(2) can use funds for recycling debris and wreckage from a major disaster, including sorting materials. They can keep any financial benefits from salvaged materials without it being considered program income. Any contracts with contractors for debris recycling are allowed. The contractor will retain possession of recyclable materials, reflected in bid price. Recipients must report on debris/wreckage recycling efforts to FEMA, including volume recycled and benefits received. Contractors who choose not to recycle debris or wreckage during disaster operations must provide a written statement to the Administrator explaining their decision. SEC. 5 amends the timing for appeals process under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to 60 days. The Administrator must issue rules for denied project worksheets, including reasons for denial, disputed items, and additional information needed from the applicant. SEC. 6 addresses factors for individual assistance. SEC. 6. INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE FACTORS. The Administrator of FEMA will review and update criteria for evaluating individual assistance needs in disasters within 180 days of this Act. SEC. 7. HOUSEHOLD PETS AND SERVICE ANIMALS. Section 502(a) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to provide assistance for rescue, care, shelter, and essential needs to individuals with household pets and service animals, as well as to the pets and animals themselves."
