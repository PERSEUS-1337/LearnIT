    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Big Cat Public Safety Act of 2016\" and includes findings related to big cat safety. Congress finds that the global illicit trade in wildlife is worth up to $20 billion annually, with the legal wildlife trade in the United States valued at $2.8 billion annually. The illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species stimulates demand and harms the health and welfare of the people of the United States, as well as the conservation of these species. Private possession and breeding of prohibited wildlife species has a significant impact on interstate commerce as these species are often bred and possessed for public exhibition or sale in the exotic pet trade. This activity also contributes to interstate trafficking and the international illegal trade of prohibited wildlife species. Federal control of intrastate private possession and breeding of prohibited wildlife species is crucial due to the fungibility of these species, making it difficult to differentiate between those involved in interstate commerce and those that are not. Breeding of prohibited wildlife species is necessary for controlling interstate trafficking. The United States is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to protect species from exploitation through international trade. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the document. The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 redefine the term \"breed\" to include intentional or negligent actions that facilitate or fail to prevent propagation or reproduction. Conforming amendments are made to related acts to reflect this change. The Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 update clauses and sections within the act to reflect changes in definitions related to breeding. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS.
