    "content": "In March 2011, antigovernment protests erupted in Syria, leading to escalating violence primarily by Syrian government forces. President Obama called for Syrian President Bashar al Asad to step down. Pressure increased for the US to assist the opposition due to rising death tolls and the use of chemical weapons. Congress debated providing assistance to vetted Syrian opposition groups in 2013, authorizing nonlethal support. The Obama Administration requested funding for lethal support in 2014. In response to escalating violence in Syria, Congress authorized a Department of Defense-led program to combat terrorist groups and promote a negotiated settlement. The US began air strikes in Syria in 2014 to prevent the Islamic State from using the country as a base for operations in Iraq. CJTF-OIR was formed to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria, involving over 70 countries. The US increased its personnel in Syria from 50 to 2,000 by late 2017. Despite Trump's initial call for withdrawal, US forces remained to defeat ISIS and counter Iranian-led forces. Trump ordered a complete withdrawal in December 2018, leading to Mattis' resignation and congressional criticism. In early 2019, Secretary James Mattis resigned, and the White House announced that several hundred U.S. troops would remain in Syria. The Syrian government has made significant military and territorial gains, with the conflict shifting in their favor. The ongoing conflict between Syrian Kurdish partners and Turkey, as well as the presence of Al Qaeda-affiliated groups, continue to challenge U.S. policymakers. The humanitarian crisis persists, with millions of Syrians as refugees or internally displaced. The U.N. has sponsored peace talks in Geneva since 2012, but it is unclear when (or whether) the parties might reach a political settlement that could result in a transition away from Asad. With many armed opposition groups weakened, defeated, or geographically isolated, military pressure on the Syrian government to make concessions to the opposition has been reduced. U.S. officials have stated that the United States will not fund reconstruction in Asad-held areas unless a political solution is reached in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254. Congress has considered key issues related to U.S. national interests in Syria and the resources required to implement U.S. objectives. The U.S. faces questions on military presence in Syria, progress metrics, and potential consequences of action or inaction. Despite territorial losses by ISIS and Syrian opposition, policymakers must consider the impact on regional countries and outside actors. President Trump's 2018 announcement of U.S. forces withdrawal was welcomed by the Syrian government and its allies. In 2018, President Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which faced criticism for potentially enabling the reemergence of ISIS and emboldening Russia and Iran. Some Members of Congress urged reconsideration, citing concerns about national security. In February 2019, the White House reversed the decision, leaving 400 troops in Syria. Members of the 116th Congress may seek clarification on the strategy for defeating ISIS. The Lead Inspector General report on Operation Inherent Resolve warns of ISIS resurgence in Syria without sustained counterterrorism pressure. The Islamic State has lost territory in Syria, now controlled by local forces trained and assisted by the US since 2014. The Trump Administration requested $300 million in FY2019 for Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund to support Syria programs. The Train and Equip Fund (CTEF) for Syria programs received $1.35 billion from the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019. Congressional concerns led to a slightly lower amount than requested. The FY2019 NDAA extended the Syria T&E program's authority through December 2019 but required a strategy report from the Trump Administration. The FY2019 act extended the Syria T&E authority through December 2019 without adjusting the program's scope. The FY2020 defense funding request includes an additional $300 million for Syrian opposition forces. U.S. policy towards Syria aims for Bashar al Asad's departure, but with Asad backed by Russia and Iran, victory seems likely. Calls for Asad's departure have diminished as the conflict progresses. In late 2018, U.S. calls for Asad's departure have faded, with the Syrian people having the ultimate decision on their leadership. The Trump Administration refrains from supporting reconstruction in Syria until a political solution is reached. Policy discussions may focus on how the Syrian government's control affects U.S. military and assistance policy. The Administration has reoriented U.S. assistance programs in Syria and secured foreign contributions for stabilization efforts in areas liberated from Islamic State. The Trump Administration has reoriented U.S. assistance programs in Syria and secured foreign contributions for stabilization efforts in areas liberated from Islamic State control. The future of U.S.-administered stabilization and other assistance programs in formerly opposition-held areas of Syria is uncertain due to the Asad government's reassertion of control, planned reduction of U.S. military forces, and withdrawal of State Department and USAID personnel from northern Syria. The Administration intends to end nonhumanitarian assistance to Asad-controlled areas until the Syrian government fulfills the terms of UNSCR 2254. The Trump Administration has reoriented U.S. assistance programs in Syria and secured foreign contributions for stabilization efforts in areas liberated from Islamic State control. The Administration intends to end nonhumanitarian assistance to Asad-controlled areas until the Syrian government fulfills the terms of UNSCR 2254. Congress may debate how the United States might best assist Syrian civilians in need without inadvertently strengthening the Asad government or its Russian and Iranian patrons. Introduced on January 3 by Senator Rubio and three cosponsors, the bill incorporates the Senate version of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2018. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2018, introduced by Senator Rubio and cosponsors, includes measures to determine if the Central Bank of Syria is a money laundering concern. It also expands sanctions on Syria to include support to Russian or Iranian entities, sale of military aircraft, energy sector goods, and construction services to the Syrian government. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019, introduced in the House and Senate, includes suspension and waiver authorities for the President. The provisions would expire five years after enactment. The bill eliminates certain sections from a previous version and emphasizes that U.S. foreign assistance in Syria should only be used in democratic or non-Assad controlled areas. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019 restricts U.S. reconstruction aid in Syria to democratic or non-Assad controlled areas. Aid cannot be provided to areas under Syrian government control unless specific conditions are met, including ceasing air strikes against civilians and releasing political prisoners. The House passed an earlier version of the bill during the 115th Congress. The bill passed during the 115th Congress restricts U.S. aid to Syria, limiting funds flowing through international organizations. Exceptions are allowed for aid to government-held areas for humanitarian projects and basic human needs. Congress also states that U.S. should not fund projects involving Syrian government officials or their family members. The Syrian Democratic Forces announced the defeat of the Islamic State in Baghouz. Despite the loss of territory, General Joseph Votel clarified that ISIS has not surrendered as an organization, but is preserving their capabilities by dispersing to camps for displaced persons and remote areas. The Islamic State remains a threat as its unrepentant and radicalized population disperses to camps for displaced persons and remote areas. Concerns about the group's resiliency and potential to regenerate have been raised, especially with the planned withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from Syria. Recent attacks, including a suicide bombing in Manbij that killed 4 Americans, highlight the ongoing threat posed by ISIS. The recent Lead Inspector General report on Operation Inherent Resolve warns of the potential resurgence of ISIS in Syria within six to twelve months. Prior to the Administration's withdrawal announcement in December 2018, plans were in place to shift focus to stabilization and training local forces to hold liberated areas. Following the Administration's decision to keep U.S. troops in Syria for FY2019, General Joseph Dunford emphasized the need for campaign continuity in clearing ISIS-held territory and transitioning to a stabilization phase. While military officials stress the continuity of the campaign, concerns remain about the evolving threat posed by ISIS as it shifts to a \"clandestine insurgency.\" The Islamic State has become more dispersed and decentralized, posing a new threat as a clandestine insurgency. Former U.S. Special Envoy Brett McGurk emphasized that defeating ISIS physically does not equate to defeating the group entirely. Idlib province, under rebel control since 2015, hinders government transit from south to north. U.S. officials view Idlib as a safe haven for Al Qaeda and halted CVE initiatives in the region in May 2018. In May 2017, an agreement between Russia, Iran, and Turkey established the Idlib de-escalation area to reduce violence between regime and opposition forces. Regime forces recaptured half of the area by mid-2018, raising fears of a humanitarian crisis. In October 2018, Russia and Turkey created a demilitarized zone in parts of Idlib province. In January 2019, the Al Qaeda-linked group Haya't Tahrir al Sham (HTS) seized large areas of Idlib province from rival armed groups, establishing an HTS-run civil administration. HTS, a successor to the Nusra Front, was described by U.S. officials as the core of Al Qaeda in mid-2017. The United States conducted air strikes in Idlib province against Al Qaeda targets starting in 2014, outside of Operation Inherent Resolve, based on the 2001 AUMF. In Syria, U.S. officials conducted airstrikes on Al Qaeda leaders in Idlib since 2014, with a significant strike in February 2017 killing the deputy leader. Another Al Qaeda-linked group in Syria, Hurras al Din, also operates in Idlib. Despite occasional clashes, both groups serve Al Qaeda's objectives, with an accord signed in February 2019 for broader cooperation. In February 2019, jihadist groups in Idlib signed an accord for broader cooperation. Concerns have risen about potential Syrian and Russian operations in the area. Syrian and Russian strikes in Idlib intensified in March 2019. Idlib is described as a \"dumping ground\" for fighters and civilians evacuated from opposition-held areas. U.N. officials warn of a possible humanitarian catastrophe if a mass assault occurs. Turkey has maintained a military presence in northern Syria since 2016, with forces deployed in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Turkish forces partner with local militias and target jihadist fighters. President Trump has stated that Turkey could play a larger role in countering the Islamic State in Syria, but it is unclear how much U.S. and Turkish objectives align. Turkish officials have expressed intentions to target Kurdish forces allied with the U.S. in addition to IS militants. Turkey has not participated in ground operations against IS in Syria since 2017, and has not been involved in fighting in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. Islamic State in the Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV) is approximately 230 miles from the Turkish border. Turkish officials seek U.S. support for potential operations despite differing views on the YPG. President Trump proposed a 20-mile \"safe zone\" in Syria, aiming to ensure security for anti-IS forces and prevent attacks on Turkey. The enforcement of this zone is uncertain, with the U.S. favoring a Western coalition and Turkey preferring its forces and Syrian allies. Kurdish representatives insist on international guarantees for the safe zone. In September 2018, Israeli strikes in Syria targeted locations near the Lebanese border linked to weapons shipments to Hezbollah. Strikes also hit Iranian facilities and personnel for the first time. A Syrian antiaircraft battery shot down a Russian plane during Israeli strikes in Lattakia. Israeli jets targeted a Syrian Armed Forces facility transferring weapons to Hezbollah on behalf of Iran. The IDF and Russian military maintain a deconfliction system in Syria. Russian plane was not in the area during the Lattakia strike. Russian defense officials plan to provide an S-300 air defense system to Syria. Israeli military confirmed strikes on Iranian targets in Syria. Israel accuses Hezbollah of establishing a cell in Golan Heights. tensions between Israel and Iran persist. Since 2012, Syrian government and opposition have participated in U.N.-brokered negotiations under the Geneva Communiqu\u00e9, endorsed by the U.S. and Russia. The agreement calls for a transitional governing body with full executive powers, but subsequent negotiations have stalled due to differing interpretations. The opposition insists on excluding Asad, while the Syrian government points to his 2014 reelection. The Syrian government maintains that Asad was reelected in 2014 and does not need to step down according to the Geneva Communiqu\u00e9. Asad believes a transitional government can be formed by expanding the current government to include opposition members. He insists on defeating \"terrorism\" before any political transition. UNSCR 2254 outlines a political settlement in Syria, including a new constitution and U.N.-supervised elections. U.S. officials emphasize the importance of UNSCR 2254 principles in resolving the conflict. The last round of Geneva talks closed in January 2018. The U.N.-led Geneva talks, closed in late January 2018, highlighted the U.S. stance on a political settlement in Syria. The U.S. intelligence community doubts Asad's willingness to negotiate or make significant concessions due to regime momentum and support from Russia and Iran. Despite U.S. support for the Geneva forum, concerns exist about the Russia-led Astana Process. The U.S. backed efforts to establish a Syrian Constitutional Committee in 2018. De Mistura's efforts in 2018 to establish a Syrian Constitutional Committee, stemming from the Russian-led Sochi conference. He resigned in December 2018, succeeded by Geir Pederson, who continued the efforts. Peace talks in Astana since January 2017, led by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, established \"de-escalation areas.\" The United States observed the talks, with Russia playing a leading role. The U.S. opposes Astana potentially superseding Geneva. The U.S. strongly opposes Astana superseding Geneva as the exclusive platform for the political process in Syria. Despite efforts by Russia, Iran, and Turkey in Astana talks, the U.S. emphasizes the importance of the Geneva process according to UNSCR 2254. In November 2018, the 11th round of Astana talks took place, followed by a trilateral summit in February 2019 to discuss Idlib and U.S. military presence in Syria. The U.S. opposes Astana as the exclusive platform for the political process in Syria. Russia, Iran, and Turkey attempted to host a \"Syrian People's Congress\" in Sochi, boycotted by most opposition groups. A constitutional committee was agreed upon for drafting a reform, supported by the U.S. under U.N. supervision. The United States supports the formation of a constitutional committee under U.N. auspices in the Geneva process. The committee's membership is divided equally between the Syrian government, Syrian opposition, and U.N.-selected delegates, causing a sticking point with the Syrian government objecting to the U.N.'s role in naming delegates. In July 2018, the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) began discussions with the Syrian government to address Kurdish-held areas in northern Syria. The U.S. intelligence community assessed that the Syrian government is likely to focus on regaining control over these areas. Kurdish leaders sought protection from the Syrian government following the U.S. announcement of troop withdrawal from Syria. Turkey aims to expand military operations against Kurdish elements in Syria. The Syrian government is expanding military operations against PYD and YPG elements in Syria, leading to accelerated talks between Kurdish representatives and the Asad government. Nearly 12 million people in Syria require humanitarian assistance, with millions internally displaced or registered as refugees. The Syrian government opposes humanitarian assistance not under its control, despite U.N. Security Council resolutions authorizing it. The Syrian government seeks the return of refugees while humanitarian advocates raise concerns about forced returns and protection from persecution. The U.N. Secretary-General reports to the Security Council on humanitarian issues in Syria. The U.S. is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syria crisis, with over $9.5 billion provided since 2011. The Trump Administration's FY2020 request would eliminate funding for the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account and overseas humanitarian assistance programs previously funded through the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account. Instead, it requests $5.9 billion for a new International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) account to consolidate U.S. overseas humanitarian programming. Funds from the IHA account would support the U.S. humanitarian response in Syria and other crisis areas. The response to the Syria crisis includes the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) and the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). The 3RP addresses the impact on Syria's neighbors with refugee/humanitarian and resilience responses. The HRP focuses on humanitarian assistance, civilian protection, and increasing resilience inside Syria. This includes reconstruction of infrastructure and restoration of medical and education facilities. In 2019, U.N. officials warned that the Syria conflict was ongoing with significant humanitarian needs. The 3RP appeal seeks $5.5 billion and the Syria HRP seeks $3.3 billion. U.S. policy towards Syria aims to support governance reforms and a transition away from Bashar al Asad's leadership. The United States and its partners aim to support a transition in Syria away from Bashar al Asad's leadership, prevent military force against civilians, address humanitarian needs, and prevent destabilization of neighboring countries. The conflict in Syria has evolved from civil unrest to a nationwide military conflict, with changing policies and priorities. In late 2018, the United States and its partners have not been successful in removing Syrian President Bashar al Asad or fundamentally changing Syria's political system. Various interventions by Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States, and Israel have altered the dynamics in Syria. The Administration's Syria policy underwent significant changes in 2018, reflecting internal reviews and disagreements between President Trump and senior officials. In January 2018, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced the US would maintain a military presence in Syria to prevent ISIS resurgence. This approach was supported by CENTCOM Commander General Votel. However, in March 2018, President Trump fired Tillerson and indicated that US troops would soon withdraw from Syria. In April 2018, Trump expressed a desire to bring U.S. troops home from Syria soon, but a chemical weapons attack and subsequent airstrikes led to a shift in plans. By May 2018, the Administration began reducing direct funding for stabilization programs in recently liberated areas of Syria. In July and August, U.S. officials emphasized the importance of maintaining a presence in Syria to prevent the resurgence of ISIS. The State Department redirected $230 million in stabilization funds for Syria to other priorities, notifying Congress of the reprogramming. In fall 2018, U.S. officials outlined a three-track Syria strategy focusing on defeating ISIS, achieving a political settlement based on UNSCR 2254, and removing Iranian forces. National Security Advisor John Bolton emphasized the presence in Syria until Iranian troops and proxies leave. Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, Special Representative for Syria Engagement, reiterated the commitment to Syria. In December, U.S. officials emphasized the need for enduring defeat of ISIS in Syria, stating that local forces must be able to handle the terrorist threat. President Trump announced on December 19 that U.S. forces would remain in Syria. President Trump announced on December 19 that U.S. forces would be returning from Syria \"now\" after declaring victory over ISIS. The Pentagon confirmed the start of the troop withdrawal, which surprised senior military and diplomatic officials who had planned to remain in Syria for stabilization operations. McGurk emphasized the resilience of the Islamic State, highlighting the presence of clandestine cells. He warned against a hasty withdrawal after the defeat of the physical caliphate. Following Trump's announcement of troop withdrawal from Syria, Defense and State Department officials tried to persuade reconsideration. Defense Secretary Mattis resigned, and McGurk accelerated his resignation as Special Envoy, citing a shock and reversal of policy. The Syria withdrawal announcement faced criticism from Members of Congress, with some supporting the decision as overdue. Senator Graham and others drafted a letter to President Trump expressing concerns about the premature and costly mistake that could embolden ISIS, Assad, Iran, and Russia. Senator Rand Paul and Representatives Ted Lieu and Ro Khanna praised the decision, citing concerns about U.S. operations. U.S. allies, including coalition partners in the counter-IS campaign, also criticized the decision. Several countries, including France and the United Kingdom, criticized the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. However, Russian President Putin and Turkish leaders welcomed the move. U.S. forces began withdrawing equipment in January but later announced that approximately 400 troops would remain in Syria. President Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria in December. A multinational force of 800-1,500 military personnel, mostly from NATO member states, is planned. General Joseph Dunford stated that the mission remains focused on clearing ISIS and transitioning to a stabilization phase. In March 2019, reports suggested that up to 1,000 troops may remain in Syria. The U.S. military is planning to leave up to 1,000 troops in Syria, despite General Dunford calling this claim \"factually incorrect.\" The number of troops remaining will depend on allied states' contributions. The FY2020 defense funding request assumes over 7,000 U.S. military personnel will be deployed to Iraq and Syria. There are uncertainties about USAID and State Department personnel redeploying for stabilization projects in Syria. The Administration is seeking increased coalition financial contributions for Syria stabilization efforts. The FY2020 foreign assistance request aims to leverage additional partner contributions, without specific funding for assistance programs in Syria. President Trump recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel, a disputed area captured from Syria in 1967. UN resolutions call for negotiations on its final status. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights, leading to Security Council Resolution 497. In December 1981, the Security Council adopted Resolution 497, declaring Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights as \"null and void.\" Syria criticized the Trump Administration's recognition of Israeli sovereignty in March 2019 as a violation of U.N. resolutions. Congressional debates have focused on presidential authority for military operations in Syria since 2011. In April 2018, U.S. missile strikes targeted Syrian chemical weapons facilities in response to an attack in Douma. Defense Secretary Mattis stated that the President has the authority to use military force to defend U.S. national interests, specifically deterring chemical weapons use in Syria. President Trump justified the U.S. missile strikes on Al Shayrat airbase in April 2017 as necessary for national security interests. He stated his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive to conduct foreign relations. Past Presidents have also relied on inherent Article II powers for military actions to defend national security interests. The U.S. military used force against the Syrian government and its allies in 2017 and 2018 for force-protection purposes, including defending U.S. partner forces. The State Department asserted that the 2001 AUMF provides authority to use force to defend U.S., Coalition, and partner forces engaged in the campaign to defeat ISIS. The strikes against the Syrian Government and pro-Syrian-Government forces in May and June 2017 were limited and lawful measures to counter immediate threats to U.S. or partner forces. The United States will use necessary force to defend U.S., Coalition, or partner forces in the campaign against ISIS. Congress has debated authorizations for military force related to Syria and ISIS. President Obama claimed that the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria was authorized by the 2001 AUMF and 2002 AUMF. Senate committees held hearings on a proposed new AUMF in 2018. U.S. forces have been operating in Syria since 2015 in support of the counter-IS campaign. Roughly 2,000 U.S. military personnel conduct train and equip program-related activities as well as \"advise and assist\" operations in support of U.S. partner forces. The Special Operations Joint Task Force, Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR) led by Brigadier General Patrick B. Roberson is the primary force advising and assisting the SDF in Syria. They report to the Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) which leads the coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. U.S. forces operate in northern and eastern Syria with the SDF and in southwest Syria with the Maghawir al Thawra militia near the At Tanf garrison. Strike operations in Syria are conducted under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. U.S. forces in Syria operate under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force for training, advising, and assisting partner forces. Military operations against IS targets are also conducted under this authorization. Additionally, support from the Iraqi government in 2014 led to the creation of a new authority for the Department of Defense to train and equip select Syrians. The Department of Defense has the authority to train and equip select Syrians for various purposes, including combating the Islamic State in Syria and promoting a negotiated settlement for the civil war. Congress has not allocated specific funds for this program, but has authorized the reprogramming of funds from global counterterrorism assistance. The Department of Defense has reprogrammed over $2.5 billion from global counterterrorism assistance accounts to support program activities. The FY2019 NDAA extends the program's authorization but places limitations on the use of funds until certain requirements are met. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 115-245) allocates $1.35 billion for the CTEF account, slightly less than the Administration's requested amount. The act requires the Secretary of Defense to submit quarterly certifications on progress and human rights violations. The FY2020 request seeks $300 million for equipping and sustaining vetted Syrian opposition forces. The FY2020 request seeks to focus on equipping Internal Security Forces and VSO elements for back-clearing and holding areas liberated from ISIS. The request mentions a 61,000 VSO force without specifying the breakdown for internal security tasks. Unlike the FY2019 request, there is reduced emphasis on direct U.S. training of VSO forces, with DOD supporting recruitment, vetting, training, and equipping efforts instead. The FY2020 budget request reallocates funds for IS-related border security support to partner nations from the CTEF fund to Operation and Maintenance, Defense-wide. The Trump Administration plans to end nonlethal assistance for the Syrian opposition and shift funding responsibility for stabilization projects to coalition partners. Since 2012, the US has provided nonlethal assistance to Syrian opposition groups and funded stabilization efforts in areas of northeastern Syria liberated from Islamic State control. The FY2020 budget request reallocates funds for IS-related border security support to partner nations. The US has provided nonlethal assistance to Syrian opposition groups since 2012, with efforts in areas of northeastern Syria liberated from Islamic State control. Since FY2012, successive Administrations and Congresses have utilized a mix of regular and OCO funds, largely from ESF accounts, for assistance and stabilization programs in Syria. In FY2017, the Obama Administration planned to spend $230 million in ESF-OCO funds to support stabilization in areas freed from the Islamic State in Syria. The Trump Administration reprogrammed funds from P.L. 114-254 for Syria stabilization, citing a burden-sharing concern. $422 million in OCO funds were used in FY2017, but FY2018 funds for nonlethal assistance remain unobligated. P.L. 115-141 authorized $500 million for a Relief and Recovery Fund in FY2018. The Trump Administration reprogrammed funds from P.L. 114-254 for Syria stabilization, citing a burden-sharing concern. $422 million in OCO funds were used in FY2017, but FY2018 funds for nonlethal assistance remain unobligated. In FY2018, P.L. 115-141 authorized $500 million for a Relief and Recovery Fund (RRF) for areas liberated from the Islamic State, with no specific amount allocated for Syria. As of March 2019, no FY2018 monies have been notified for programs in Syria. The Administration's FY2019 budget request sought $130 million in Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) monies and $44.5 million in Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs (NADR) for stabilization efforts in nongovernment-controlled areas of Syria. The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6) specifies that at least $40 million should be made available for nonlethal stabilization assistance for Syria, with $7 million for emergency medical and rescue response and chemical weapons use investigations. The FY2020 State and Foreign Operations request for Syria does not seek ESDF or NADR funding for Syria-specific programs, unlike the FY2019 request. The request includes $145 million from various accounts for the Relief and Recovery Fund, with some funds potentially used in Syria. Regionally based teams were established to monitor and implement U.S. assistance programs, including the Syria Transition Assistance and Response Team (START) operating from Turkey. In 2018, the Syria Transition Assistance and Response Team (START) and Southern Syria Assistance Platform (SSAP) programs underwent changes, with some programs amended or ended to focus on stabilizing former IS-held areas. Cross-border SSAP programs were reportedly halted after Syrian military forces regained control of southwestern Syria. In mid-2018, Syrian military forces regained control of southwestern Syria. In late 2018, U.S. forces announced their withdrawal, followed by the withdrawal of civilian personnel from northern Syria. The Administration's 2019 announcement of some U.S. forces remaining in Syria raises questions about the redeployment of START Forward personnel for stabilization efforts. Syrian government and international supporters' demands to end cross-border assistance operations could complicate U.S. assistance efforts. Russian objections to U.N. Security Council mandates for humanitarian operations and Syrian government rejections of non-humanitarian assistance in opposition-held areas add to the complexity. UNSCR 2449 authorizes cross-border and cross-line humanitarian assistance until January 10, 2020, subject to renewal at the Security Council. Russia and China abstained from the December 2018 renewal, with Russia suggesting the mandate be gradually removed. The Syrian government has been accused of using chemical weapons against opposition forces and civilians, confirmed by U.N.-OPCW investigations. The Syrian regime and the Islamic State have been found to use chemical weapons in attacks, violating the Chemical Weapons Convention. Reports indicate the use of chlorine in barrel bombs and sarin in various incidents. The United Nations confirmed the use of sarin by the Syrian military in 2017 and 2013. Investigations are ongoing for alleged chemical weapon incidents, including mustard gas use by the Islamic State. The OPCW confirmed mustard gas use by the Islamic State. Syrian government denies chemical weapon use, blames opposition forces. Russian Federation supports Syrian position. US officials suspect chlorine and nerve agent in Douma attack. OPCW investigation suggests toxic chlorine used in the attack. Toxic chlorine likely used as a weapon in the attack on eastern Ghouta. British, French, and U.S. launched missiles at chemical weapons sites in Syria. Strikes targeted research and storage facilities. U.S. military officials focused on hitting the heart of the chemical weapons enterprise. On April 4, 2017, Syrian aircraft in rebel-held Idlib province used a chemical nerve agent in air strikes, killing 80 to 100 people. OPCW confirmed Sarin exposure. U.S. targeted three sites to minimize collateral damage and send a strong message. On April 6, 2017, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at Al Shayrat airfield in Homs province in response to the Syrian air force's use of sarin nerve agent in earlier attacks. The strike targeted aircraft, shelters, storage facilities, and air defense systems to deter future chemical weapon use. Sanctions were also imposed on 271 Syrian employees of the Scientific Studies and Research Center responsible for managing Syria's chemical weapons. The largest-scale use of chemical weapons in Syria was an August 21, 2013, nerve gas attack that killed over 1,400 people. The U.S. government identified the nerve agent as sarin and assessed that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons multiple times. President Obama sought congressional approval for military force but later pursued a diplomatic solution where Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons and join the Chemical Weapons Convention. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118 mandated Syria to relinquish all its chemical weapons. Resolution 2118 (2013) mandated Syria to give up all its chemical weapons under U.N. Charter provisions. Syria declared possessing 1,308 metric tons of chemical warfare agents, including nerve agents sarin and VX, and mustard agent. The international community oversaw the removal and destruction of these weapons, with all declared chemicals neutralized by January 2016. OPCW verified the destruction of all 27 declared chemical weapons production facilities by June 2018. The OPCW continues to investigate gaps in Syria's declaration of chemical weapons stocks and facilities. The Syrian government has not fully cooperated with the OPCW's inquiries, leading to doubts about the accuracy and completeness of their declaration. A technical meeting was held in mid-March to address discrepancies in Syria's declaration of chemical weapons. Various bodies, including the OPCW inspections and Fact Finding Mission, have been formed to investigate chemical weapons use in Syria. The United Nations Mission was established in March 2013 to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria. The UN-OPCW Joint Mission oversaw the removal of chemical weapons in Syria between October 2013 and June 2014 after Syria joined the CWC. The OPCW established a Fact Finding Mission in Syria in April 2014 to investigate new allegations of chlorine use as a weapon. The FFM had the Syrian government's permission and cooperation for its investigations. The FFM was granted authority to attribute attacks in June 2018 by a special session of CWC member states. Resolution 2235 established the OPCW-U.N. Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) in August 2015 to identify those responsible for chemical attacks. The JIM's mandate expired in November 2017, and it was the first to be tasked with attributing attacks in Syria. The OPCW FFM and JIM concluded with high confidence that chemical weapons were used in Syria in 48 incidents from April 2014 to November 24, 2017, with 7 incidents attributed to the Syrian Armed Forces. Notable attacks included the use of chlorine barrel-bombs in Idlib Governorate and sarin in Khan Sheikhoun. The JIM's mission was hindered by the security situation in Syria. The JIM concluded in October 2017 that Syrian Armed Forces used sarin-filled aerial bombs in the Khan Sheikhoun attack and ISIL used sulfur mustard-filled mortars in Aleppo Governorate. Russia blocked attempts to renew the JIM mandate, leading to the formation of the \"International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons\" in January 2018. The use of chemical weapons in Syria has been a contentious issue at the U.N. Security Council, with Russia vetoing resolutions condemning attacks. Despite a veto on a resolution for an investigation into the April 7 attack, the OPCW's Fact-Finding Mission continued its work. The U.N. Human Rights Council has also documented the use of prohibited chemical weapons in Syria. The Commission of Inquiry has documented 25 incidents of prohibited chemical weapons use in Syria between March 2013 and March 2017, with 20 perpetrated by government forces against civilians. The victory of pro-Asad forces in the conflict may complicate unresolved issues in Syria. The U.S. is reevaluating its involvement in Syria, focusing on issues like the return of displaced Syrians, reconstruction, and managing threats to neighboring countries. Combatting ISIS was a top priority, but plans changed with Trump's announcement to withdraw troops. The use of chemical weapons by government forces in Syria has been documented, raising concerns about the ongoing conflict. The Trump Administration is reducing U.S. funds for stabilization efforts in conflict-damaged areas in Syria's northeast, shifting the responsibility to coalition members and U.S. partners. Questions arise about program management and the future of security and stabilization efforts amid U.S. military withdrawal plans. The Administration's FY2020 defense funding requests indicate continued support for U.S. partner forces, but the potential reintegration of areas by the Asad government raises challenging policy questions. The Asad government's approach towards U.S. forces and their local partners in Syria could lead to renewed conflict or integration of U.S.-trained forces. The expansion of Syrian government control in northeastern Syria may limit U.S. involvement in stabilization and counterterrorism activities. Areas of Idlib province remain outside government control, posing challenges for pro-Asad forces. In Idlib province, there is a significant zone outside of government control in western Syria. Pro-Asad forces may launch military operations to reclaim these areas in the coming months. Infighting among anti-Asad groups has escalated, and extremist groups are expected to resist any Syrian government military campaign. Turkish forces in some areas may also oppose pro-Syrian government forces. The use of military force by the Syrian government could result in civilian casualties and displacement, potentially leading to calls for U.S. or coalition military intervention. The presence of Al Qaeda-aligned individuals in Idlib remains a security concern for the United States. The presence of Al Qaeda-aligned individuals in Idlib is a security concern for the United States and its allies. The ability of U.S. and coalition forces to operate in Idlib may be hindered by Syrian government disapproval and Russian military capabilities. If the Syrian government delays action against opposition-held areas in Idlib, extremist groups hostile to the United States could have a safe haven. The conflict in Syria has resulted in numerous casualties and displaced millions of people. Syrians face challenges in deciding whether to return home due to security concerns, political persecution, crime, economic conditions, and documentation issues. The Asad government is urging internally displaced Syrians and refugees to return, raising concerns about their safety and political reconciliation. Humanitarian assistance delivery across the Syrian border without government consent may face scrutiny, with pressure on neighboring countries from the Asad government and its supporters. The United States is the leading donor for international humanitarian efforts in Syria, with estimated reconstruction costs exceeding $250 billion. The Trump Administration has stated its intent not to contribute to Asad-controlled Syria's reconstruction without political change. Congress has also restricted U.S. funds for assistance in Syria. In the absence of U.S. engagement, Russia or China could potentially provide assistance for Syria's reconstruction, but may not mobilize enough resources or coordinate investments effectively. Predatory conditional assistance could increase Syria's debt to these actors and strengthen strategic ties against U.S. interests, delaying recovery and worsening the conflict's impact on the population. The conflict in Syria has had lasting negative effects on the population, impacting the country's security and stability. Various threats are perceived by U.S. partners and allies from Syria-based extremist groups, Iranian forces, Syrian military, Russian presence, and Kurdish armed groups. The support of Russia and Iran has been crucial for Asad's post-2015 fortunes in the conflict. Despite some tensions, it is unlikely that the current Syrian government will seek to change the presence of Russian or Iranian forces in the short term. The Syrian security services have reconstituted some of their lost capabilities. The Syrian security services have reconstituted some lost capabilities, posing long-term strategic challenges for U.S. partners like Israel and Jordan. Turkish concerns about armed Kurdish groups in Syria, including those partnered with the U.S., have led to ongoing military deployments and the potential for confrontation with U.S. forces. Plans for enduring partnerships with Kurdish-led armed groups in Syria could further strain relations with Turkey, Syria, Russia, and Iran. The U.S. drawdown or withdrawal in Syria could lead to increased tensions with Turkey, Syria, Russia, and Iran. Reconciliation between Kurdish armed groups and the Syrian government may escalate confrontations. Abruptly cutting U.S. support for Kurdish groups could strain relations with Kurdish populations in other countries. The U.S. has shifted from seeking regime change to behavior change in Syria, while still advocating for a political settlement based on UNSCR 2254. The conflict in Syria is based on UNSCR 2254, requiring a new constitution and U.N.-supervised elections. Asad's reelection in 2014 and consolidation of security control limit political change. U.N.-led negotiations are open-ended but unlikely to incorporate opposition figures. Alternative negotiations by Asad's Russian and Iranian supporters pose a challenge for Syria's opposition groups. Congress and the Administration may reassess U.S. leverage for a political outcome. The 115th and 116th Congress appropriated defense and foreign assistance funds for FY2019. Congress conditioned some defense funds on the Administration providing a new strategic plan for Syria. Questions remain about the Administration's planned military withdrawal and FY2020 funding requests. The 116th Congress may face challenges in reaching consensus on a counterproposal to the Administration's military withdrawal plans in Syria. Asad's potential victory in the conflict goes against congressional preferences, complicating decisions on funding and engagement with the Asad-led government. Congress will need to consider conditions for U.S. engagement and expenditure in Asad-controlled areas. The dilemma for Congress and the Administration lies in balancing U.S. counterterrorism efforts with other priorities. The 116th Congress faces challenges in deciding on U.S. military involvement in Syria, balancing counterterrorism goals with concerns about empowering the Asad government. Efforts may involve working with local partners and allies, but differing interests could complicate the situation. There is uncertainty about the effectiveness of incentives and disincentives in influencing combatants in Syria. Long-term commitments from the U.S. and others remain undefined. The United States and others face challenges in deciding on long-term commitments for achieving an inclusive political transition, protecting civilians, defending partners, promoting accountability and reconciliation, and contributing to the rebuilding of a war-torn country like Syria."
