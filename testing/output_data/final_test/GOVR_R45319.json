    "content": "The Supreme Court relies on precedents to interpret the Constitution, which influences its future decisions. Debate surrounds whether the Court should uphold or overturn past rulings on controversial issues. The challenge lies in balancing stability in the law through stare decisis while also correcting faulty reasoning or outdated assumptions in prior decisions. One contentious precedent is the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Supreme Court's 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the core aspects of Roe v. Wade, stating that a woman has a protected constitutional liberty interest in terminating her pregnancy. Despite doubts about Roe's reasoning, the Casey plurality decided to uphold it due to societal reliance, concern for the Court's legitimacy, and adherence to stare decisis. The Supreme Court's decision to retain a precedent may prompt significant debate, but overruling precedent can also be controversial, as seen in the Citizens United v. FEC case in 2010. This case established that the First Amendment prohibits governments from restricting independent expenditures on political speech related to an election campaign by corporations, labor unions, and other organizations, overturning the Court's previous decision in Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce. This sparked debate about the Court's adherence to the principle of stare decisis. During the 2017-2018 term, the Supreme Court overturned four longstanding precedents, sparking debate over the role of stare decisis. For example, in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the Court ruled that laws requiring public employees to pay \"fair share\" fees to unions violated the First Amendment. In South Dakota v. Wayfair, the Court concluded that states can require out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes. The report examines how the Supreme Court determines whether to overrule its prior decisions on constitutional law, discussing the doctrine of stare decisis and how Justices handle conflicts between precedent and their judicial philosophies. It also explores factors the Court considers when deciding to overrule or limit precedents, providing examples from recent jurisprudence. Understanding stare decisis may help the Senate evaluate the judicial philosophy of federal court nominees. President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to fill Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's seat on the Supreme Court. There was interest in Kavanaugh's views on stare decisis, which could impact future decisions on constitutional law. Stare decisis is a judicial doctrine where courts follow prior decisions. The Appendix lists Supreme Court decisions overruled in its history. The doctrine of stare decisis involves courts following prior decisions, with horizontal and vertical aspects. The U.S. Supreme Court determines whether to overrule its prior decisions based on horizontal stare decisis, where it follows its own rules unless exceptional circumstances arise. The U.S. Supreme Court applies the doctrine of stare decisis by following its prior decisions unless there is a \"special justification\" or \"strong grounds\" to overrule precedent. The Court views stare decisis as a discretionary principle of policy to be weighed along with the merits of the prior decision and pragmatic considerations when interpreting the Constitution or deciding whether to hear a case. The Court may avoid overruling precedent by distinguishing the law or facts of a prior decision. The doctrine of stare decisis in American jurisprudence is rooted in English common law from the 18th century. Judges are expected to follow precedent unless it is \"flatly absurd or unjust,\" promoting stability in the law. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution also favored adherence to judicial precedent to limit judges' discretion in interpreting ambiguous provisions. The Founders of the U.S. Constitution favored adherence to judicial precedent to limit judges' discretion in interpreting ambiguous provisions, with some exceptions allowed for certain policy reasons. During Chief Justice John Marshall's tenure in the early 1800s, the Supreme Court showed a strong preference for adhering to precedent while also allowing for limited error correction. The Court was cautious about overruling prior decisions that could disrupt commercial reliance interests. Recently, the Court has begun to outline factors considered when deciding to overrule precedent, aiming to maintain a stable body of consistent jurisprudence with room for error correction. The Court values following prior decisions to maintain stability, predictability, and consistency in applying the law. Adhering to stare decisis supports the Court's role as an unbiased decision-maker and saves time by reducing legal questions in litigation. The Court values following prior decisions to maintain stability, predictability, and consistency in applying the law. Adhering to stare decisis supports the Court's role as an unbiased decision-maker and saves time by reducing legal questions in litigation. The Court must resolve legal questions in litigation, such as declaring a federal law unconstitutional, with reference to past decisions like Marbury v. Madison. Some argue that overruling incorrect precedents may be necessary to rectify wrong decisions or account for changes in society's understanding. The Supreme Court values following prior decisions to maintain stability and consistency in applying the law. Critics argue that strict adherence to stare decisis can lead to unpredictable decisions based on ideology, lacking a basis in the Constitution, and shielding the Court's errors. Some Justices and scholars suggest that incorrect precedents should be overruled when they conflict with the proper understanding of the Constitution. The Court has special rules for applying stare decisis in constitutional cases, adopting a weaker form when cases involve prior interpretations of the Constitution. The Supreme Court values following prior decisions for stability and consistency in applying the law. Critics argue that strict adherence to stare decisis can lead to unpredictable decisions based on ideology, lacking a basis in the Constitution. The Court has special rules for applying stare decisis in constitutional cases, requiring a \"special justification\" or \"strong grounds\" for overruling constitutional precedents. When interpreting the Constitution, conflicts can arise between judicial precedent and methods like originalism or textualism. Some argue that following precedent that contradicts the Constitution's text or original meaning perpetuates mistaken interpretations. However, proponents of textualism and originalism may still adhere to precedent for pragmatic reasons. Justice Scalia, a textualist and originalist, sometimes followed precedent for pragmatic reasons, even if it conflicted with his interpretation of the Constitution. An example is his concurrence in McDonald v. City of Chicago, where the Supreme Court considered gun rights under the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment applies to state governments through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, protecting the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right rooted in American traditions. Justice Scalia concurred with this decision. Justice Scalia demonstrated a willingness to make exceptions to his philosophy for interpreting the Constitution by adhering to longstanding precedents for maintaining stability in the Court's jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has emphasized the need for special justifications or strong grounds when considering overruling past decisions to avoid undermining the Court's legitimacy. When deciding whether to overrule a past decision in a constitutional case, the Court considers factors like the quality of reasoning, workability of the rule, consistency with other decisions, developments since the decision, and reliance on the decision. The Court's jurisprudence illustrates the use of these factors in its analysis. The Supreme Court considers factors like the quality of reasoning, workability of the rule, consistency with other decisions, developments since the decision, and reliance on the decision when deciding whether to reaffirm or overrule a prior decision. An example of overruling precedent due to significant disagreements with its reasoning is seen in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. In Barnette, the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision in Minersville School District v. Gobitis, which upheld a state's flag-salute requirement. Justice Robert Jackson refuted Gobitis' reasoning, arguing that certain subjects like freedom of speech are reserved for the judiciary, not legislatures. He also emphasized that American constitutional government does not rely on government coercion for national unity, unlike authoritarian regimes. The Supreme Court overturned the precedent in Gobitis due to flawed reasoning and the belief that government coercion is not necessary for national unity. In Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, the Court overturned Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, citing violations of the First Amendment by compelling speech on public concerns. The decision in Janus was based on various factors, including the unworkability of Abood's standards. The Supreme Court overturned the Abood decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, citing flaws in reasoning and violations of the First Amendment. The Court criticized Abood for improperly relying on government authorization of private sector collective bargaining agreements and not considering fundamental free speech rights. This led to the decision to discard Abood. The Supreme Court overturned the Abood decision in Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, citing flaws in reasoning and violations of the First Amendment. Another factor considered for overturning a precedent is whether the rule established is unworkable, as seen in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority. This case questioned Congress's ability to impose FLSA requirements on a municipally owned mass-transit system. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Supreme Court found that the test developed in National League of Cities v. Usery for determining state immunity from congressional regulation under the Commerce Clause was unworkable. This decision raised difficulties for lower courts in consistently applying the distinction between traditional and nontraditional government functions for state immunity purposes. The Court in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority rejected the test from National League of Cities v. Usery for state immunity under the Commerce Clause. Instead, the Court allowed Congress to impose wage and hour requirements on state employees. In Janus, the Court overturned Abood's ruling that public employees must pay union fees, setting a new three-part test to balance labor peace and free speech rights. The Supreme Court overturned the Abood precedent on compelled union fees, citing the unworkability of the Abood test and the inconsistency with other Court decisions. The Court considered factors such as erosion of legal foundation and being a recent outlier among precedents. The Supreme Court overturned the Abood precedent on compelled union fees, citing inconsistency with other Court decisions and erosion of legal foundation. The Court considered whether overruling the precedent would restore coherency in the law. An example of this is Janus overruling Abood, noting that Abood had become inconsistent with the Court's First Amendment cases. The Court found that Abood's First Amendment analysis was eroded by subsequent decisions, leading to its overturning. In another case, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, the Court addressed equal protection rights under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause regarding government incentives for subcontractors. The Supreme Court ruled in Inc. v. FCC that the federal government's racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, overturning the Metro Broadcasting case. The Court emphasized the equal protection obligations that apply to federal, state, and local governments. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Court struck down a Texas law banning private, consensual same-sex sexual activity. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Supreme Court struck down a Texas law banning private, consensual same-sex sexual activity as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Justice Kennedy's opinion overruled a previous decision, Bowers v. Hardwick, and cited the Court's decisions in Casey and Romer to support the notion of autonomy and freedom of intimate conduct. The Supreme Court's decisions in Casey and Romer emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects personal autonomy in areas such as marriage, procreation, and family relationships. Justice Scalia disagreed, arguing that only \"fundamental rights\" deeply rooted in history deserve enhanced protection. The Court's ruling in Lawrence, which overturned Bowers, sparked debate on whether it restored or departed from the law. The Court acknowledges that evolving societal understanding may challenge prior decisions. In Casey, the Court highlighted the occasional necessity of overruling a precedent based on subsequent factual developments, citing the example of West Coast Hotel v. Parrish where the Court overturned precedents on minimum wage and maximum working hours laws. The Court in Casey overruled precedent due to the nation's struggles during the Great Depression, citing the need for minimum wage laws to protect workers with less bargaining power. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court held that segregating public schools by race violated the Fourteenth Amendment. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court ruled that segregating public schools by race violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The decision rejected the \"separate but equal\" doctrine and highlighted the stigmatizing effects of racial discrimination. The Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education rejected the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, emphasizing the stigmatizing effects of racial discrimination. Modern authority supports the finding of racial stigma, with the Court later characterizing Brown as overruling Plessy v. Ferguson. Changes in factual understandings have been a key element in determining whether to retain or overrule precedent, as seen in cases like South Dakota v. Wayfair where the Court overturned its previous holdings on the Commerce Clause. The Court overturned precedents to allow states to collect sales tax on remote sales due to changes in the economy and increased revenue shortfall. The reliance factor considers hardship for parties if a precedent is overruled. The Supreme Court often adheres to precedent, considering economic reliance interests, such as investment of time, effort, or money. This factor weighs against overruling precedent, especially in property or contract law matters. Individual reliance on procedural or evidentiary rules is not given much weight. Janus case is an example of the Court considering economic reliance when deciding whether to overrule precedent. The Supreme Court overturned Abood v. Detroit Board of Education in the Janus case, stating that laws requiring public employees to pay \"fair share\" fees to unions violated the First Amendment. The Court rejected arguments based on economic reliance on Abood, emphasizing that free speech rights were more important. The Supreme Court's decision in Janus overturned Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, ruling that fees charged by unions to nonmembers were unconstitutional. The Court had previously hinted at overruling Abood and emphasized the importance of free speech rights over economic reliance. In a later case, Casey, the Court recognized societal reliance on certain rights, such as abortion, and argued for their retention based on their impact on individuals' lives and societal equality. In Casey, arguments for retaining precedent based on societal reliance sparked strong debate among the Justices. The Court's decision in Dickerson v. United States is an example of adhering to precedent due to societal reliance, as seen in the case of Miranda v. Arizona. The Supreme Court declined to overrule Miranda v. Arizona, citing societal reliance on the precedent. Critics argue that relying on cultural or societal factors for retaining precedents gives the Court too much discretion. The Court has not provided clear guidelines on when societal reliance justifies overturning precedent. The Supreme Court's precedents may foster government reliance by providing guidance for officials in different branches on actions that align with the Constitution. This reliance has been seen in critical decisions, such as those expanding Congress' power under the Commerce Clause and establishing the constitutionality of issuing paper money as legal tender. Legislators may also consider the Court's decisions when drafting legislation. In Lawrence v. Texas, the Court struck down a Texas law banning same-sex sexual activity as unconstitutional. Justice Kennedy argued against retaining the precedent set in Bowers v. Hardwick, stating there were no relevant reliance interests. Justice Scalia disagreed, stating legislators had relied on Bowers for laws regulating certain sexual behaviors. Scalia argued that protecting legislative reliance interests justified retaining Bowers. In Arizona v. Gant, the Court ruled on the search-incident-to-arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment. Justice Alito dissented, arguing that the majority opinion effectively overruled New York v. Belton, a case providing certainty to law enforcement officers on searching a vehicle's occupant after arrest. Alito emphasized the reliance on Belton by law enforcement officials. Justice Alito emphasized the reliance on the Benton rule by law enforcement officers for over a quarter century. The Supreme Court's prior decisions on constitutional matters influence future cases, leading to debates on whether to retain or overrule precedent. The doctrine of stare decisis is often at the center of this debate. The Supreme Court considers various factors, including stare decisis, when reviewing precedent. It is difficult to predict when the Court will overrule a prior decision due to uncertainty in weighing these factors. Justices may face conflicts between their judicial philosophy and precedent, leading to decisions on maintaining stability in the law. The Court's approach to retaining or overruling precedent remains unclear. The Supreme Court Justices have significant discretion in deciding whether to retain or overrule precedent. Justice Alito emphasized the need for special justifications when considering overturning a precedent, as it requires the exercise of judgment and is not a strict rule under stare decisis. The Court may overrule a precedent if unable to distinguish it from the current case. The Supreme Court Justices have discretion in deciding whether to retain or overrule precedent. Justice Alito emphasized the need for special justifications when considering overturning a precedent, as it requires judgment and is not a strict rule under stare decisis. The Court may overrule a precedent if unable to distinguish it from the current case to maintain legitimacy and balance in jurisprudence.
