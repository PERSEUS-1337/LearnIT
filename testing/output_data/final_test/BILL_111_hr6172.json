The Congress finds that involvement in sports has significant benefits for students' development, but they also have the right to know the risks of concussions, which are a common type of mild traumatic brain injury. Children and adolescents are more vulnerable to brain injury due to their developing brains, and the prevalence of sport-related concussions is higher than reported. The prevalence of concussions in high school sports is higher than at the collegiate level, with 400,000 students sustaining concussions in a high school athletics program from 2005-2008. Over 40% of high school athletes return to play before fully recovering, increasing their risk of further injury or death. Concussions are also reported in non-scholastic youth sports, playgrounds, and physical education classes. Timely recognition and response to concussions in student athletes is crucial to prevent successive injury, chronic impairment, or death. However, only 42 percent of schools have access to an athletic trainer and only 53 percent meet the recommended nurse-to-student ratio. Concussion treatment in schools is often sporadic and neglects the athlete's role as a student. Medical care for concussions can be costly, and students should gradually return to physical activity after a concussion. Students should gradually return to physical activity and academic activities only as the symptoms of a concussion permit to avoid exacerbating symptoms and prolonging recovery time. Best practices can help protect student athletes from the risks of concussions. Minimum state requirements for concussion management should be followed to protect student athletes from the risks of concussions. Beginning in fiscal year 2013, each State educational agency must establish minimum requirements for concussion safety and management in local educational agencies. This includes developing a standard plan for educating students, parents, and school personnel about concussions. The State educational agency must establish minimum requirements for concussion safety and management in local educational agencies, including educating students, parents, and school personnel. This involves training on concussion safety, using standardized forms, and providing support for students recovering from concussions. The State educational agency must establish minimum requirements for concussion safety and management in local educational agencies, including educating students, parents, and school personnel. This involves training on concussion safety, using standardized forms, and providing support for students recovering from concussions. Additionally, schools must designate individuals to oversee and manage the recovery of students with concussions, provide academic accommodations, and refer students with persistent symptoms for evaluation under relevant disability acts. Each public elementary and secondary school must post visible information on concussions, ensuring uniform safety standards and management for all students. This includes disseminating concussion management information to the public and applying consistent safety standards. The website must provide information on concussions based on scientific evidence, including risks, actions to take, and symptoms. Additional content may include the definition of a concussion and ways to reduce its occurrence. The website must provide information on concussions, including risks, symptoms, and actions to take. If a student sustains a concussion during a school-sponsored athletic activity, they must be immediately removed from participation and prohibited from returning until they submit a clearance. Before a student who has sustained a concussion in a school-sponsored athletic activity can resume participation, they must submit a written release from a healthcare professional. Personnel must also report the injury details and treatment actions to the student's parent or guardian. Before resuming participation in school-sponsored activities, a student with a concussion must provide a written release from a healthcare professional. This release should confirm the student's capability to participate and may include a recovery plan involving cognitive and physical rest. The plan should gradually reintroduce exertion to prevent symptom exacerbation. To safely resume school activities after a concussion, gradual increases in exertion should not worsen symptoms. Each State educational agency must report their regulations to the Secretary of Education within 6 months to receive funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This Act does not override State laws on education standards or civil liability. The term \"concussion\" in this Act refers to a traumatic brain injury caused by a blow, jolt, or motion to the head or body that disrupts normal brain functioning and alters the mental state of the individual. Symptoms include confusion, disorientation, impaired consciousness, memory dysfunction, and loss of consciousness lasting less than 30 minutes. A concussion is a traumatic brain injury that disrupts normal brain functioning and alters mental state. Symptoms include physical, cognitive, emotional symptoms, and difficulty sleeping, occurring with or without loss of consciousness during sports or recreational activities. A health care professional is defined as a registered, licensed, or certified individual experienced in diagnosing and managing traumatic brain injuries in children. Local and state educational agencies are defined as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. School personnel are also mentioned. The term \"school-sponsored athletic activity\" includes physical education classes, non-instructional athletic activities on school grounds, and extracurricular sports teams organized by a school."
