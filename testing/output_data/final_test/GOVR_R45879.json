    "content": "The U.S. Congress has funded international food assistance through the Food for Peace program for over 65 years to alleviate hunger and improve global food security. U.S. food assistance includes in-kind food commodities and market-based approaches administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Nonemergency food aid has decreased over the years within the program. The report focuses on the decline of nonemergency food aid within the Food for Peace program, managed by the Bureau for Food Security. It discusses current programs, legislative history, funding trends, and the future of nonemergency programs under the Trump Administration proposals. In FY2018, Food for Peace operated in 59 countries, reaching over 76 million recipients. Nonemergency programs were active in 15 countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. These programs aim to address root causes of hunger and build resilience in vulnerable communities, lasting about five years to reduce chronic malnutrition and increase household income. Food for Peace (FFP) nonemergency activities aim to increase household income, provide opportunities for microfinance and savings, and support agricultural programs to reduce vulnerability to shocks. These programs include in-kind food distributions, educational programs for dietary diversity, farmer training, and conflict sensitivity training. FFP seeks to build resilience in vulnerable communities to reduce the need for future emergency assistance and promote longer-term development goals. Nonemergency programs are typically implemented by NGO partners. SHOUHARDO III is a nonemergency program under FFP in Bangladesh focusing on gender equitable food security and resilience. Implemented by CARE, it targets 384,000 participants through various activities like climate change training, food distributions, youth skills training, and microenterprise groups. Tuendelee Pamoja II in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) aims to enhance food security and resilience for 214,000 households, with a focus on women and youth. Implemented by Food for the Hungry, the program includes distributing new crop varieties, building planting terraces, providing fishing training, and youth education in various skills. It received over $15 million in FFP Title II funding in FY2018 and is set to continue until the end of the program in FY2020. Njira Pathways to Sustainable Food Security in Malawi, funded by FFP Title II, aims to improve food security for over 244,000 vulnerable people in selected districts. Implemented by Project Concern International, activities include livestock distribution, women's empowerment groups, farmer training for Fall Armyworm, and food rations for children under five. The Njira project in Malawi, funded by FFP Title II and Community Development Funds, aims to improve food security for vulnerable populations by distributing food rations to children under five. FFP nonemergency programs focus on addressing root causes of food insecurity and building resilience, while emergency programs provide immediate life-saving assistance. Food for Peace programs provide immediate, life-saving food and nutrition assistance to populations in crisis, primarily through food procurement in the United States. The programs, implemented by the United Nations' World Food Programme, run for 12-18 months and focus on the poorest of the poor to build resilience. In FY2018, emergency responses were staged in South Sudan, Yemen, and Ethiopia. Feed the Future, on the other hand, works with communities ready for longer-term development, focusing on agricultural systems strengthening and market development. Catholic Relief Services implements both FFP nonemergency and Feed the Future programs in Ethiopia. Food for Peace in Ethiopia focuses on rehabilitating irrigation systems, conflict management assessments, and livelihood pathways. Feed the Future program includes financial education, marketing groups, and youth participation training. Food for Peace supports resilience strategies and asset-building, while Feed the Future encourages diverse market engagement. Funding requirements differ between the two programs, with FFP requiring in-kind food distributions and FTF having more flexibility. Food for Peace nonemergency programs have funding flexibility that Feed the Future development programs do not. Funding can be shifted from nonemergency to emergency responses if needed. This flexibility allows for a smooth transition between emergency and nonemergency programming, as seen in Madagascar during a drought in 2015. In some cases, both programs may duplicate efforts to ensure a sustainable sequencing of food security programs. Food for Peace nonemergency programs coordinate with Feed the Future development programming to ensure a smooth transition between emergency and longer-term programs. Geographic teams within FFP manage both types of programs, allowing for resource and approach sharing. FFP officers collaborate with Bureau for Food Security counterparts to select target countries and work closely together. The Food for Peace program, established in 1954, collaborates with the Bureau for Food Security in selecting target countries for nonemergency resources. FFP uses Feed the Future indicators for program evaluations and works closely with BFS officers in the field. Congress authorizes international food assistance programs, including Food for Peace Act, which has evolved over time to reflect changes in domestic and foreign policy. Congress authorizes international food assistance programs, including the Food for Peace Act, through legislation such as the Farm Bill and the Global Food Security Act. The Farm Bill, renewed every five years, governs various agricultural and food programs, with Title III encompassing the Food for Peace Act. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 authorized programs through FY2023, while the Global Food Security Act of 2016 directs the President to coordinate a global food security strategy and provide food assistance. The Global Food Security Act (GFSA) amended the 1961 Act to establish the Emergency Food Security Program (EFSP) under International Disaster Assistance authorities. The GFSA extension (P.L. 115-266) authorizes programs through FY2023, with bipartisan support for nonemergency programs like Title II in-kind commodity purchase and distribution. These programs have domestic connections to U.S. farmers and shippers through the farm bill's statutory requirements. In a statement to the House Agriculture Committee, the USA Rice Farmers Board expressed support for U.S. international food aid programs, emphasizing the importance of providing agricultural bounty to those in need. Mercy Corps highlighted the effectiveness of non-emergency food assistance programs in building resilience to food insecurity in fragile states. The U.S. maritime industry has a close relationship with the Food for Peace program, with tensions arising from agricultural cargo preference requirements. Despite this, the maritime industry remains engaged and advocates for commodity-based programs to prevent food security crises. Historic ties to U.S. agriculture and maritime industries influence Congress in legislation. Food assistance funds are allocated through Agriculture and SFOPS appropriations. Nonemergency program funds come from Food for Peace Title II Grants in Agriculture and Development Assistance in SFOPS. Community Development Funds from SFOPS complement Title II resources for coordination between programs. Congress established CDF funds in FY2010 to support FFP. In FY2010, Congress established Community Development Funds (CDF) to support Food for Peace (FFP) in reducing reliance on monetization. CDF funds are not required by law but are designated in annual appropriations. FFP also receives funding for emergency food programs through the International Disaster Assistance (IDA) account. In FY2018, FFP received nearly half of its resources through Agriculture appropriations. 11% of FFP's overall funding was used for nonemergency programs. In FY2010, Congress established Community Development Funds (CDF) to support Food for Peace (FFP) in reducing reliance on monetization. FFP used 11% of its overall funding for nonemergency programs, with the majority allocated to emergency programs. Nonemergency programming's share of funding has decreased over the years, with a minimum level of nonemergency food assistance established in the 2008 farm bill. The most recent farm bill set the minimum level of nonemergency food assistance at $365 million but allowed for Community Development Funds and the Farmer-to-Farmer Program funds to be counted toward the minimum. The 116th Congress may be interested in proposed reforms to the FFP program funding and structure, including potential changes to how nonemergency programs fit into U.S. international food assistance programs. The Trump Administration has proposed eliminating funding for the entire FFP Title II program to streamline foreign assistance. The Trump Administration proposes to prioritize funding for international food assistance programs by eliminating the FFP Title II program and shifting food aid solely through SFOPS appropriations. This move aligns with a broader agenda to reduce overall funding for U.S. foreign assistance. The Obama Administration also sought similar reforms in its FY2014 budget request. The Obama Administration proposed changes to increase flexibility, timeliness, and efficiency of U.S. international food assistance, aiming to reach an additional 4 million people each year with equivalent funding. Efforts in Congress to change parts of the Title II program were seen in the 115th Congress with bipartisan support for the Food for Peace Modernization Act. This included eliminating the requirement to purchase all food aid commodities in the U.S. and removing the monetization requirement to reduce costs. In an effort to reduce costs and gain efficiency, the United States considered proposals to change the Title II program for international food assistance. Congress did not accept the Administration's proposals to eliminate Title II funding in FY2018 and FY2019. The House-passed Agriculture appropriations for FY2020 include $1.85 billion for Title II. Members of Congress may need to balance calls for reform with the priorities of domestic constituencies, such as agricultural interests and development groups, to ensure the effectiveness of nonemergency programs. USAID is planning to merge the FFP Office with the Office of U.S. as part of its internal reform initiative. USAID is planning to merge the FFP Office with the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance into a new Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA) to consolidate food and nonfood humanitarian responses. This merger aims to eliminate duplication and present a more unified U.S. policy on humanitarian assistance globally. The new HA bureau will have eight offices, including three geographically focused and five technical offices. The humanitarian community is engaged with the U.S. government on the proposal to merge the FFP Office with the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance into a new Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on Title II programming, but nonemergency programming is expected to remain within the new bureau. Details regarding the management of emergency and nonemergency programs are still being worked out by USAID leadership. As part of its Transformation process, USAID is working on incorporating nonemergency programs into disaster risk reduction efforts and aligning them with the new Bureau for Resilience and Food Security. Congress has the opportunity to provide feedback on the structural redesign, with some policymakers suggesting consolidating similar programming under one office for increased coordination. Having one office manage all programming and present a unified voice to stakeholders may reduce communication challenges for USAID. However, consolidating nonemergency programs under the Bureau for Food Security could lead to a loss of focus on serving vulnerable populations, as Feed the Future programs do not prioritize the poorest of the poor or include food distributions. This shift may deprioritize unique qualities of Food for Peace in favor of a more traditional development model. Additionally, during disasters, Food for Peace often uses its nonemergency programs as a component in response efforts. If BFS programming were to move to the Office of Food for Peace, FTF programs could be deprioritized in favor of emergency programming. Emergency funding needs have been rising, potentially jeopardizing FTF gains and future programming. Food for Peace has received Community Development Funds to support nonemergency programs and reduce reliance on monetization. Food for Peace (FFP) has grown to rely on Community Development Funds (CDF) to support nonemergency programs and reduce reliance on monetization. If CDF funding were to drop, FFP may need to return to using monetization. Congress could consider increasing flexibilities in Title II funding, including Section 202(e), to address this potential challenge. Proposed increases in flexibility for Food for Peace (FFP) have faced opposition from some stakeholders, particularly U.S. agricultural commodity groups. Designating a specific CDF level in law for FFP could ensure stable funding for nonemergency programs, but may impact Feed the Future programming if overall funding decreases. Coordination between FFP and BFS could be affected by this approach. Congressional oversight of U.S. international food assistance programs is hindered by separate committee jurisdictions. The jurisdictional differences between Food for Peace (FFP) Title II-funded programs and Community Development Funds (CDF) funded programming hinder Congress's ability to provide comprehensive oversight. The International Food Assistance Report (IFAR) covers FFP programs but lacks context within the broader U.S. international food assistance landscape. Emergency Food Security Program and Feed the Future reporting are overseen by different committees, further complicating coordination and oversight. The oversight jurisdictions of Food for Peace (FFP) Title II-funded programs and Community Development Funds (CDF) funded programming present unique challenges to USAID. FFP has been subject to multiple Government Accountability Office (GAO) audits, while CDF has had fewer audits. The 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) has implications for Food for Peace Title II. The 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) authorizes Food for Peace Title II nonemergency programs through FY2023, despite the Administration's proposal to eliminate the program. USAID's Transformation initiative is making changes to how nonemergency food assistance programs are administered. Congress may address FFP nonemergency programs through appropriations legislation, stand-alone bills, and Transformation-related consultations. The nonemergency programs discussed in this report are highlighted in the graphic. Appendix B details USAID's Proposed Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance."
