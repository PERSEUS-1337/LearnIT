The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) aims to minimize the burden of federal paperwork on individuals, businesses, and governments by regulating information collection requirements authorized by regulations. The PRA was enacted in 1980 and has been amended multiple times to ensure the greatest public benefit from federal information. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980 established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to reduce unnecessary paperwork burden and improve information resources management. It assigns responsibilities to OIRA and federal agencies regarding information collection, paperwork control, dissemination, statistical policy, records management, privacy, security, and federal information technology. This report focuses on the PRA's requirements for information collection and paperwork control. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) has a broad scope, covering federal agencies and various types of information collection activities. It defines covered agencies and excludes specific entities like the Government Accountability Office and government-owned contractor-operated facilities. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) applies to all executive branch agencies, including independent regulatory agencies, and covers information collection from non-federal entities. The act defines a \"collection of information\" as obtaining facts or opinions from 10 or more non-federal persons, including individuals, partnerships, corporations, and state or local government elements. If a covered agency collects information from or requires information from 10 or more non-federal entities, it is likely subject to the PRA. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) defines \"burden\" broadly to include time, effort, or financial resources expended to provide information to a Federal agency. Agencies must justify information collection by showing need, estimating burden on respondents, and proving it is the least burdensome way to gather information. The Paperwork Reduction Act defines \"burden\" broadly as time, effort, or financial resources expended to provide information to a Federal agency. Paperwork burden is measured in burden hours, which is a function of the frequency of information collection, the number of respondents, and the time taken by each respondent to complete the collection. The government-wide paperwork burden estimate is nearly 10 billion burden hours as of May 2009. While federal paperwork requirements are often unwelcomed, some burden is voluntarily undertaken. The Paperwork Reduction Act defines \"burden\" broadly as time, effort, or financial resources expended to provide information to a Federal agency. Some information collection burden is voluntarily accepted by respondents for certain benefits, such as federal crop subsidies or tax deductions. The Act does not apply to information collection during federal criminal investigations or administrative actions against specific individuals or entities. The Paperwork Reduction Act requires OIRA oversight for information collection requests, with agencies needing OIRA approval before implementation. Failure to obtain approval or renewal every three years violates the act and triggers the public protection provision. No penalties can be imposed if the collection lacks a valid OMB control number. The Paperwork Reduction Act mandates OIRA oversight for information collection requests, requiring agencies to obtain approval before implementation. OIRA can disapprove collections inconsistent with PRA requirements, and agencies must establish an independent paperwork clearance process. The Paperwork Reduction Act mandates OIRA oversight for information collection requests, requiring agencies to obtain approval before implementation. Agencies must submit a certification to OIRA that the proposed information collection meets statutory requirements and publish a notice in the Federal Register. GAO reported in 2005 that agency CIOs sometimes provided certifications without adequate support, reducing assurance that standards in the act have been consistently met. The Paperwork Reduction Act mandates OIRA oversight for information collection requests, requiring agencies to obtain approval before implementation. GAO suggested options for Congress to improve compliance and recommended changes to OMB guidance. Neither Congress nor OMB has acted on GAO's recommendations. OIRA must provide at least 30 days for public comment on proposed information collection requests. If not part of a proposed rule, OIRA must notify the agency within 60 days of certification or Federal Register notice. If part of a proposed rule, notification must be given \"as soon as practicable.\" OIRA approves 3,000 to 5,000 information collection requests annually for up to three years. A daily-updated PRA database is publicly available online, showing approved collections, those under review, and expired collections. As of May 14, 2009, there were 8,674 approved collections in the OIRA inventory. Although most requests are approved, OIRA sometimes disapproves. In November 2008, OIRA disapproved an information collection requirement in a Federal Communications Commission rule regarding emergency backup power sources for carriers. OIRA concluded that the agency did not seek public comment or demonstrate the practical utility of the information. The PRA allows for \"fast-track\" OIRA reviews in emergency situations. The agency head can request expedited authorization from OIRA if normal clearance procedures may cause public harm, an unanticipated event has occurred, or if normal procedures may disrupt information collection. OIRA must approve or disapprove the request within the specified time frame, assigning a control number if approved, allowing information collection without PRA compliance for up to 180 days. The OIRA can expedite authorization for information collection without PRA compliance for up to 180 days if requested by the agency head. Approval or disapproval must be within a specified timeframe, with the option to delegate final approval authority to an agency if deemed independent and resourceful enough. OIRA can delegate authority for information collection without PRA compliance for up to 180 days. The PRA requires OIRA to keep Congress informed of major activities and submit an annual report on agencies' information collection burdens. The most recent Information Collection Budget reflects changes in agencies' collections. Congressional committees overseeing the PRA are the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The PRA of 1995 required OIRA to set annual government-wide goals for reducing information collection burdens. Agency-specific burden reduction goals were also mandated. Before the PRA took effect, the government-wide burden estimate was around 7 billion burden hours. The burden estimate under the PRA of 1995 aimed to reduce burden hours by 35% to 4.6 billion hours by 2001, but it actually increased to nearly 7.7 billion hours by then. By 2002, it rose to over 8.2 billion hours, a 17% increase since the PRA took effect. Despite some declines in 2003 and 2004, burden-hour estimates have since substantially increased. The government-wide burden-hour estimates have increased substantially from just under 8 billion hours in 2004 to nearly 10 billion hours in 2009. The Department of the Treasury drives a large portion of this paperwork burden, with its proportion falling slightly below 80% since 2005. The Department of the Treasury estimate, primarily driven by the IRS, represents nearly 99.5% of the Treasury's estimate of over 7.7 billion burden hours. The 10 largest IRS information collections in May 2009 totaled nearly 6.6 billion burden hours, with the U.S. Individual Income Tax Return alone accounting for nearly 3.8 billion burden hours. Other federal agencies with large paperwork burdens as of May 2009 included the Department of Health and Human Services. The IRS has the largest paperwork burden among federal agencies, with over 6.6 billion burden hours in May 2009. Other agencies with significant burdens include the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Transportation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Labor, EPA, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Agriculture. OIRA categorizes changes in burden-hour estimates as \"program changes\" or \"adjustments.\" In recent years, adjustments in burden-hour estimates have been made due to factors like changes in population or agency reestimates, not deliberate federal government action. Examples include an increase in burden hours for the Food Stamp Program due to an economic downturn or a revision of burden estimates based on a better understanding of applicants. Program changes, on the other hand, involve alterations in the application process itself. In recent years, most of the government-wide burden-hour increases have been due to adjustments, not program changes. For example, in fiscal years 2006-2007, 80% of the 718.9 million hour increase was caused by adjustments, with the Department of the Treasury accounting for the majority of these adjustments. The report did not specify if these adjustments were due to reestimates or changes in the population required to complete forms. In fiscal years 2006-2007, federal paperwork increased by 156.1 million burden hours due to program changes, with new statutes accounting for the majority of the increase. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 caused the IRS to revise the individual taxpayer return, adding Form 5695 for \"Residential Energy Credits,\" resulting in a 71.5 million burden hour increase. Additionally, agency actions unrelated to new statutes led to a 23.8 million burden hour increase, mostly attributed to the Department of the Treasury. The recent report on the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) highlighted various additions to tax forms, such as Form 990 and U.S. Return of Partnership Income, resulting in millions of burden hours. OIRA's report also discussed agency efforts to reduce paperwork burden, including initiatives by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Health and Human Services. The Department of Heath and Human Services had an initiative to eliminate or revise obsolete forms, promote electronic reporting, and reduce reporting frequency, expected to reduce burden by more than 5.3 million hours. The IRS is working on a more efficient process for filing the S-Corporation Form 2553, preliminarily estimated to reduce burden by 8 million hours. EPA's claims of reducing paperwork burden by 24 million hours were found to be misleading by GAO in 2000. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted that agencies can reduce burden estimates through various means such as changes in the economy, technology, or violations of the Paperwork Reduction Act. They emphasized the importance of reviewing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs' (OIRA) Information Collection Budget (ICB) reports for a comprehensive understanding of burden reduction goals. Additionally, OIRA collects information on financial costs associated with information collection requirements, including equipment, supplies, IT systems, and postage. OIRA reported that annual financial costs for information collection totaled nearly $62.5 billion in May 2009, including expenses for equipment, supplies, IT systems, and postage. Agencies were required to convert burden hours into dollar costs by estimating wage rates that include overhead and fringe benefits. This could result in a wage rate exceeding the actual hourly pay of technical employees. Monetization of agency burden-hour estimates can result in significant costs. For example, assuming a $20 per hour wage for paperwork completion, with added overhead and fringe benefits raising the hourly rate to $40, the total estimated annual cost of federal paperwork is $458.5 billion. This includes financial costs of $62.5 billion per year. The benefits of federal paperwork may exceed costs, with failure to obtain OIRA approval violating the PRA. Agency violations do not create penalties for non-compliance with unapproved information collections. OIRA's annual PRA report for 2008 showed a significant decrease in violations, with only 15 new violations in FY2007. The Department of Transportation was rated as \"poor\" with five or more violations, while five departments and agencies were rated as \"need improvement\" with one to four violations. OIRA's efforts to control violations followed critical reports by GAO. In 2004, GAO reported a decrease in PRA violations from 872 in FY1998 to 223 in FY2003. OIRA was praised for addressing violations but could do more, such as notifying budget examiners within OMB. OIRA's 2007 report highlighted efforts to improve agency compliance, including enhancing its database. The PRA of 1995 authorized $8 million in appropriations to OIRA from 1996 to 2001 for the act's purposes only. Since 2001, the PRA and OIRA have operated without appropriations authorization. OIRA's funding is part of OMB's appropriation, and staffing levels are allocated from OMB's totals. In the 108th Congress, a provision in H.R. 2432 would have required the OMB Director to assign at least 2 full-time staffers to review the IRS's paperwork burden. OIRA indicated it devoted less than one full-time staff person to this task due to statutory mandates. The PRA requires agencies to submit certifications to OIRA, including reducing paperwork burden for small entities. The George W. Bush Administration objected to this requirement, leading to its removal from the legislation in 2004. No similar legislation has been introduced in the 111th Congress. Techniques to reduce burden include differing compliance requirements and exemptions for certain entities. The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-198) amended the Paperwork Reduction Act to establish a single point of contact for small businesses regarding information collection. It aimed to reduce paperwork burdens for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees and required OMB to publish compliance assistance resources annually. The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 aimed to reduce paperwork burdens for small businesses. It established an interagency task force to study streamlining information collection requirements. OIRA's report in June 2004 contained recommendations to reduce the burden on small businesses, including an internet-based system to help them comply with paperwork requirements. H.R. 535 in the 111th Congress proposed amending the PRA to suspend fines for first-time paperwork violations by small businesses under certain circumstances. The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 aimed to reduce paperwork burdens for small businesses by establishing an interagency task force. OIRA recommended reducing burden on small businesses through an internet-based system. Legislation in the 110th Congress addressed similar issues but was not enacted. Concerns have been raised about whether the PRA's requirements should apply to audits and investigations by agency Inspectors General, impacting their ability to conduct timely reviews. The PRA's requirements have compromised the independence of agency Inspectors General, leading to limited surveys, audits conducted without adherence to the PRA, and decisions to not undertake information collections. Concerns have been raised by the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program regarding the impact of the PRA on oversight activities. The SIGTARP faced obstacles in sending inquiry letters to TARP fund recipients due to PRA requirements. Emergency OMB approval was obtained after Senator Grassley intervened. The PRA does not clearly define if IGs are covered under its regulations. The PRA, enacted in 1980, does not exclude GAO and SIGTARP from its requirements. The PRA applies to general investigations but not to federal criminal investigations or administrative actions. Legislative and non-legislative alternatives to address concerns about the PRA's application to IGs are discussed. The burden reduction goals of the PRA of 1995 were not met. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) enacted in 1980 aims to minimize paperwork burden on the public, with agency and OIRA reviews helping to keep federal paperwork burden lower. Despite the benefits of federal information collection requirements, the nearly 2 billion burden-hour growth in government-wide paperwork estimate between 2004 and 2009 raises concerns. The increase in federal paperwork burden between 2004 and 2009 suggests a need for action to reduce it. The responsibility to lessen this burden lies with Congress if the burden is mainly due to statutory requirements. Some agencies have claimed that their paperwork burden increases are mandated by law, but later reported reductions in that burden. The increase in federal paperwork burden between 2004 and 2009 suggests a need for action to reduce it. Agencies have claimed burden reductions through initiatives like reducing collection frequency or shortening forms, indicating agency discretion in information collection. OIRA and federal agencies may bear responsibility for burden reduction, with potential for OIRA to focus on larger information collections. Most of the active information collections in May 2009 had paperwork burdens below 4,000 hours. Delegating clearances for collections below a certain threshold to federal agencies could expedite the process, allowing OIRA to focus on collections with larger burdens. Limiting clearance authority delegations to agencies with proven capabilities may be necessary. Congress could exempt certain information collections by IGs or SIGTARP from the PRA in response to recent concerns. The Legislation Committee of the Council of the IGs on Integrity and Efficiency has proposed an exemption for IGs from PRA collection of information requirements, which would amend 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3518(c) to exclude information collections during investigations, audits, inspections, evaluations, or reviews by federal statutory IG offices. S. 976, introduced by Senator Grassley, would amend 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3518(c) to exclude such collections of information by IGs established in the IG Act, Special IGs established by statute, and the Council of the IGs on Integrity and Efficiency. IGs can use various options to obtain information, including using subpoena powers to compel production of needed information. Alternatively, OIRA could exempt certain IG collections from review or provide expedited reviews for specific entities' information requests. The PRA of 1995 authorized appropriations for OIRA to carry out its functions until September 30, 2001. Reauthorization of appropriations for OIRA has historically provided a chance for Congress to amend the PRA and improve its implementation. However, no legislation to reauthorize OIRA appropriations has been submitted since 2006. No legislation to reauthorize OIRA appropriations has been submitted since 2001."
