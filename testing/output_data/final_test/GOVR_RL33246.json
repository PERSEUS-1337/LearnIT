    "content": "The Reading First program was authorized as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) through the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. It aimed to improve K-3 reading programs based on scientifically proven methods to enhance student reading achievement. The Reading First program, part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, aims to improve K-3 reading programs to enhance student reading achievement. It includes formula and targeted assistance grants to states, with funds allocated based on poverty levels. States then award grants to local educational agencies for screening, diagnostic assessments, and implementing scientifically based reading instruction programs. The Reading First program focuses on improving K-3 reading instruction by providing funds for instructional materials, professional development, data collection, and promoting reading programs. LEAs can use funds for family reading programs, training tutors, and supporting parents in their child's reading development. The program required significant start-up time due to its complexity and new requirements. States and LEAs took time to implement the Reading First program, including staff, curriculum, assessment, and evaluation components. By October 2003, all states and DC received their FY2002 and FY2003 awards. The Virgin Islands received funds in September 2004. State grants are awarded for six years, with only two states distributing funds in 2002-03. By 2004-05, 24 additional states awarded grants, with the Virgin Islands awarding grants in 2005-06. Puerto Rico's unique situation with Reading First funds led to disagreements with ED over instruction and methods. Despite not receiving approval for FY2005 and FY2006 funds, Puerto Rico has the opportunity to revise its application for FY2007 funds based on feedback from the Advisory Committee. The NCLBA mandates a midterm peer review of states' performance in the Reading First program after the third grant period. The Education Department (ED) adjusted the timeline for the Reading First program to allow states to participate in three grant cycles before a midterm review in November 2006. State progress reports are being reviewed by the Reading First Advisory Committee to determine continued grant funding. The first targeted assistance grants were delayed to ensure states had sufficient data showing improvement. States seeking these grants needed one year of baseline data and two years of follow-up data. The first round of targeted assistance grants for the Reading First program required applications by July 30, 2005. Massachusetts received the first award in September 2005. Tennessee was the only state to receive an FY2005 grant, while FY2006 grants were given to Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Virginia. The program has extensive standards, including midterm reviews, tracking individual student progress, and annual evaluations submitted to ED. Multiple evaluations of Reading First have been contracted by ED. The Education Department has contracted evaluations of Reading First, including an impact study on student achievement. Reports are expected in 2008. An implementation study by Abt Associates is ongoing, with a final report expected in 2008. A follow-up evaluation on the implementation of RF is planned for the 2008-2009 school year. Additionally, a study on the relationship between Reading First funds and learning disabilities is being conducted. A study is being conducted on the relationship between Reading First funds and learning disabilities, with a report expected in 2008. Another study is investigating the preparedness of prospective teachers to teach reading instruction, with a report anticipated in the summer of 2008. A report from RMC Research Corporation on the alignment of reading standards with essential components was issued in December 2005. Positive information on the impact of Reading First on student achievement has been provided by various reports. State assessment measures and cut-off scores for reading proficiency vary, making it hard to assess Reading First's performance. The Reading First Annual Performance Report Data showed improvements in reading fluency and comprehension in 26 states between 2004 and 2006. The first implementation report by Abt Associates was issued in 2006. The first implementation report by Abt Associates, issued in 2006, evaluated how Reading First was being implemented in schools and whether instruction differed between Reading First and non-Reading First schools. The report also looked at student achievement, with further analysis planned for the final report after additional data collection. The interim report on Reading First implementation found that schools were following the program as intended by the NCLBA, with differences between Reading First and non-Reading First schools that could improve student achievement in reading. Reading First schools received support from various sources and had more adherence to program guidelines in classroom instruction compared to Title I schools. Reading First schools were more likely to place struggling students in intervention programs and had reading coaches. They also received more professional development compared to Title I schools. A 2007 report noted that many states and districts believed Reading First contributed to increases in student achievement, but causation was not confirmed. The 2007 CEP report found that states and districts believed Reading First was effective in increasing reading achievement. 82% of states reported that professional development was effective, while 78% indicated that curriculum and assessments were effective. Additionally, 69% of districts attributed increases in reading achievement to Reading First assessments, and 68% to Reading First instruction. Coordination between Reading First and Title I was reported by 80% of states and 75% of districts. The 2005 CEP study examined ED's administration of the state application process for Reading First grants. Many states had to revise their initial applications multiple times before acceptance. States were consistent in selecting assessment instruments for reading progress. Almost all states included DIBELS and the Consumer's Guide in their approved assessments for Reading First grants. State recommendations influenced districts' choice of reading programs funded by Reading First. The GAO report focused on changes in reading instruction due to Reading First funds, state criteria for subgrants, and challenges in program implementation. It was requested by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in response to concerns about the Reading First program. The report used data from ED, surveys, interviews, and site visits to assess the program's effectiveness. The GAO report supported findings from ED's performance report data, the CEP study, and the interim Reading First evaluation. State responses to implementation issues were included, with most states finding ED staff helpful in addressing questions. States made modifications to their Reading First grant applications, including changing assessments used. Most states changed assessments used for Reading First, with DIBELS being the most common. States also developed approved lists of reading programs. GAO reported improvements in reading instruction, including emphasis on key components, assessments, and professional development. Reading First schools utilized reading coaches and increased reading time. States reported significant improvements in reading instruction and professional development, with increased resources allocated. However, the ED had not developed certain aspects. The GAO found that the ED lacked written policies and procedures for ensuring compliance with statutory requirements regarding local control of curriculum. They also found confusion among states regarding monitoring procedures. GAO recommended that the ED establish control procedures and distribute guidelines for monitoring procedures to clarify roles and responsibilities. There is a debate in education research on the value of different methodologies, with some arguing that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the \"gold standard.\" RCTs require random assignment to experimental or control groups to verify cause-effect relationships. However, RCTs may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for all educational research needs. RCTs are often considered the \"gold standard\" in education research, but they have limitations. They may be impractical, unethical, time-consuming, and costly compared to other research designs. RCTs are best suited for certain types of questions and may not assess how and why impacts occur, program modifications, cost-effectiveness, unintended consequences, or validity of measures. The NCLBA endorses the use of SBR in funded activities, including instructional and assessment programs, professional training programs, and other NCLBA funded activities. The emphasis is on experimental research, particularly RCTs. Programs affected by this requirement include Title I, Part A grants, Reading First, Early Reading First, Even Start, Literacy Through School Libraries, Comprehensive School Reform, and others. This discussion focuses on the application of SBR to Reading First. The Reading First program under NCLBA requires recipients to implement scientifically based reading research (SBRR) programs. SBRR involves rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain valid knowledge relevant to reading development, instruction, and difficulties. The Reading First program requires recipients to implement scientifically based reading research (SBRR) programs, which involve rigorous procedures to obtain valid knowledge on reading. The program draws on the work of the National Reading Panel (NRP) and incorporates five essential components of reading based on NRP's research. The NCLBA defines essential components for reading instruction funded under the Reading First program as phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary development, reading fluency, and reading comprehension strategies. Major implementation issues have arisen regarding the application of SBRR to the program, including criticisms of ED's implementation and implications for states and LEAs navigating existing research and resources while maintaining local autonomy in choosing curricula. The Success for All Program criticizes the NCLBA's requirement for interventions based on scientifically based research, arguing that it does not differentiate between rigorously evaluated programs and those without efficacy research. They also claim that the U.S. Department of Education has narrowed the definition of scientifically based research in its implementation of the Reading First program. The U.S. Department of Education's focus on scientifically based research in the Reading First program has led to criticism for limiting states' choices in reading programs and professional development. Implementation challenges reflect the current state of research in education, with a lack of RCT studies in many areas. Some argue that navigating existing resources for scientifically based research in education is challenging for states and LEAs. While there is more user-friendly material available, evaluations of its application to educational interventions are limited. There is no single federal website cataloging and evaluating all available resources, but there are federally funded offices and resources offering guidance on SBR. The federal government provides guidance on scientifically based research (SBR) to states and LEAs through various online resources, including websites, databases, and publications. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) offers publications and resources on SBR, such as a user-friendly guide published in 2003. Additionally, ED has awarded grants to comprehensive centers and regional centers to support states and LEAs in meeting NCLBA requirements. The regional centers funded by ED, such as the Mid-continent Research Center for Education and Learning and the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, have published resources on education research and evidence-based practices. These resources are not centralized and may not provide specific analysis on educational instruction or assessment packages meeting NCLBA requirements. Ellen Lagemann emphasized the importance of translating research results into practical tools for educators. The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) was created by ED's IES to provide user-friendly information on evidence-based practices in education, including evaluations of educational interventions. This addresses the need for clear guidance on selecting curriculum and assessment programs that meet NCLBA requirements. The WWC provides intervention reports with evidence-based practices in education topics. These reports include program descriptions, costs, and effectiveness ratings. Resources on SBRR for the Reading First program are also available. The Education Department (ED) provides resources and support for the Reading First program, including links to additional resources on their websites. They offer leadership academies, nonregulatory guidance, and a National Center for Reading First Technical Assistance. Training is provided for administrators and teachers in scientifically based reading research, program reviews, assessment critiques, and using data to improve student reading performance. The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) provides technical assistance through various learning opportunities such as conferences, training, consultations, and links to reading experts. NIFL disseminates information on SBRR for children, youth, and adults, as well as specific reading programs and effective classroom programs. Some states rely on a limited number of programs due to challenges in finding SBRR interventions meeting NCLBA requirements, raising concerns. NIFL publications can be downloaded from their website. Some are concerned about the \"overprescriptiveness\" of ED's application of SBRR to Reading First, potentially infringing on states' and LEAs' curriculum choices. This conflicts with section 9527 of the No Child Left Behind Act, which prohibits the federal government from mandating or controlling curriculum, programs, or resources. The Department can use funds under this Act to support school curriculums. A 2005 CEP study showed states were consistent in program choices, with many revising applications for Reading First. States often included DIBELS and used the Consumer's Guide to select reading curriculums. State recommendations influenced district choices, with half changing programs to qualify for grants. The Reading First program was investigated by the ED's OIG after complaints were filed by three groups representing different reading programs. The OIG conducted audits on the federal Reading First program, state programs, and ED's administration, validating concerns raised in the complaints. The ED concurred with the OIG's findings. The OIG investigated concerns raised in complaints about the Reading First program. ED agreed with the OIG's recommendations and addressed them. The OIG report criticized ED's implementation of the program, highlighting issues with the expert review panel selection process for state applications. ED created 16 subpanels instead of following NCLBA requirements. The OIG found that ED did not follow NCLBA requirements for the expert review panel selection process for state applications. A majority of panelists on 15 out of 16 subpanels were nominated by ED, and none included nominees from specified organizations. The OIG also found that the subpanels did not meet to review applications as a whole before making recommendations to the Secretary. The screening process for conflicts of interest was deemed ineffective by the OIG. The OIG found that ED did not follow its own guidance for the peer review process of the Reading First Program. Panelists provided useful comments in Panel Chair Summaries, but ED did not share these with states. Instead, the Reading First director and his assistant used them to write their own reports, sometimes inaccurately reflecting panelists' comments. The OIG found that the assistant changed or omitted panelists' comments, leading to states lacking adequate information for their applications. Some state applications were approved without proper documentation or meeting required criteria. Panelists were provided with 25 criteria to rate in each state application, with \"Meets Standard\" being the approval bar. The OIG found that some requirements in the \"Meets Standard\" category were not mandated by the NCLBA, leading to state applications being reviewed based on non-statutory standards. Program officials attempted to obscure the ESEA content and disregarded Congress' direction. ED's actions lacked management integrity and accountability, potentially violating DEOA and ESEA prohibitions. The OIG found violations of DEOA and ESEA prohibitions against federal endorsement of specific curricula. Recommendations include implementing procedures for soliciting advice from the Office of the General Counsel, resolving disputes, strengthening conflict of interest procedures, reviewing Reading First applications for compliance, and making changes to ensure NCLBA requirements are met. The OIG found violations of DEOA and ESEA prohibitions against federal endorsement of specific curricula. Recommendations include implementing procedures for soliciting advice from the Office of the General Counsel, resolving disputes, strengthening conflict of interest procedures, reviewing Reading First applications for compliance, and making changes to ensure NCLBA requirements are met. Additionally, steps are being taken to evaluate the impact of Reading First on the Federal interest, establish internal controls to prevent similar problems in future programs, and engage in discussions with state and local education representatives during the reauthorization process. The U.S. Department of Education agreed with OIG recommendations for Reading First but disagreed with some findings. They stated that their peer review process did not adversely affect any state and made efforts to address conflicts of interest. ED also mentioned that they took effective steps in screening panelists, exceeding legal requirements. The statute did not specify the role of peer review comments, and ED had not replaced any required processes. The U.S. Department of Education stated that the peer review panel was advisory and not meant to review every resubmitted state application. They emphasized that the Reading First guidance aimed to encourage high-quality projects beyond minimum standards. Additionally, they affirmed that the guidance was consistent with the law and helped ensure high-quality applications. The department also mentioned they were not aware of any inappropriate actions requiring specific programs or approaches. The audit focused on ED's administration of the Reading First program, including RLAs, the program's website, and conflicts of interest in technical assistance contracts. Major findings included non-compliance with curriculum provisions, bias issues, and promotion of DIBELS in RLAs. ED's guidance and website administration were consistent with the law, but issues were found in the RLAs. The OIG recommended that the Assistant Secretary of ED's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education establish controls to ensure compliance with curriculum requirements and avoid promoting specific curriculum in department-sponsored events. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education agreed with the recommendations and committed to immediate action. However, ED did not agree with all of the findings. The ED disagreed with some findings in the OIG report, stating it lacked balance and failed to mention positive aspects of activities discussed. They argued that discussing specific reading programs in Theory to Practice sessions at RLAs was necessary for usefulness. ED also noted that participants were informed the sessions were not meant to endorse any particular program. The audit focused on RMC's Reading First technical assistance contracts. The OIG found that RMC did not adequately monitor staff for conflicts of interest in their assistance contracts with ED. They also failed to include required conflict-of-interest clauses and screen technical assistance providers for affiliations with specific reading programs. The OIG recommended that the Assistant Secretary of ED's OESE require RMC to address these issues. The OIG recommended that RMC implement conflict-of-interest procedures for contracts with the ED, investigate bias in TA providers, and develop a certification form. RMC has agreed to the recommendations and worked with ED to strengthen conflict-of-interest requirements. The House Committee on Education and Labor has held oversight hearings on Reading First. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions issued a report revealing financial ties between four out of five Reading First Technical Assistance (TAC) directors and publishers. This raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest in the administration of the Reading First program. The report found that four Reading First Technical Assistance Center directors had financial ties to publishing companies while overseeing the selection of reading programs for federal grants. This compromised the integrity of the program, leading to recommendations for stricter financial disclosure requirements to prevent conflicts of interest. H.R. 1939, the Reading First Improvement Act, was introduced to address these issues. The Reading First Improvement Act, introduced in 2007, establishes procedures for setting up an advisory committee and subcommittees to review state applications. It aims to prevent conflicts of interest, ensure transparency in decision-making, and prohibit contracts for program evaluation to entities involved in implementing Reading First. Conflict-of-interest screening is required for all employees involved in contracts or subcontracts."
