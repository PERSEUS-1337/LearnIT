Roosevelt ordered the creation of an all Black flight training program after the NAACP filed suit on behalf of Howard University student Yancy Williams. Black military pilots trained at a separate airfield near Tuskegee, Alabama, becoming known as the \"Tuskegee Airmen\". The Tuskegee Airmen inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces, overcoming prejudice and discrimination to excel in pilot training despite initial doubts about their capabilities. Over 992 Black pilots graduated from the program at Tuskegee Army Air Field. The Tuskegee Army Air Field training program produced over 992 Black pilots, with the last class finishing in June 1946. Captain Benjamin O. Davis Jr. was one of the graduates, and the experiment's success was evident in the eventual promotion of pioneers to flag rank in the United States Air Force. Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. led 450 Black fighter pilots in World War II, flying various aircraft in missions over North Africa, Sicily, and Europe. He later became the first Black flag officer in the United States Air Force and was honored with a 4th star in retirement by President Clinton. German pilots respected the Tuskegee Airmen, calling them the \"Schwartze Vogelmenshen.\" The Tuskegee Airmen, known as the \"Black Redtail Angels\", were highly respected for their escort missions over Europe during World War II. The 99th Fighter Squadron, along with three other Black squadrons, formed the 332nd Fighter Group and became the largest fighter unit in the 15th Air Force. They were successful in destroying enemy targets on the ground and at sea, including a German destroyer. During World War II, the Tuskegee Airmen, also known as the \"Black Redtail Angels\", were highly respected for their escort missions over Europe. They destroyed numerous enemy aircraft and a German destroyer. Sixty-six pilots were killed in combat, while 32 were captured as prisoners of war. The Black airmen received numerous awards for their bravery, including Distinguished Flying Crosses and Bronze Stars. Additionally, other Black pilots and crew members formed the 477th Composite Group, flying B-25 and P-47 aircraft. They demanded equal treatment and recognition for their service. In September 1947, the 332d Fighter Group was reactivated by the United States Air Force as a separate service. They were highly skilled, winning the 1st annual Air Force Gunnery Meet in 1949. Alongside Black pilots, many civilian and military Black men and women provided ground support during World War II and continued to serve, contributing to the integration of the US Armed Forces. The Tuskegee Airmen, a group of Black pilots, gained recognition after years of anonymity when Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. was founded in 1972. The organization aims to inspire young Americans to participate in society and preserve their legacy through various memorials. The Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. perpetuates the memory of the Black pilots through various memorials, including a scholarship fund, a museum in Detroit, Memorial Park at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a statue at the United States Air Force Academy, and a National Historic Site at Moton Field. The President is authorized to award the Tuskegee Airmen a gold medal in recognition of their military record. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal. Duplicates in bronze may be sold under regulations set by the Secretary. The National Medals authorized under this Act are considered national medals for purposes of the United States Code. An amount not exceeding $30,000 is authorized to be charged for the cost of the medals, with proceeds from the sale of duplicate bronze medals to be deposited in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund."
