Benefits for eligible dependents of Federal law enforcement officers include educational assistance for each month of the officer's service, covering tuition, room, board, and other educational costs. Assistance is provided directly to educational institutions or the dependent, following guidelines from title 38, subchapter IV of the United States Code. Benefits for dependents of officers killed in the line of duty allow them to receive educational assistance without the usual criteria, for a maximum of forty-five months. SEC. 3.

No educational assistance shall be paid to an eligible dependent after ten years from the officer's death or permanent disability, or the dependent's twenty-seventh birthday, whichever is later. SEC. 4. EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL COUNSELING.

The Attorney General will notify an eligible dependent of approval or disapproval of their application for an education program under this subpart. The Attorney General will establish rules for unacceptable courses under this subpart, and may discontinue funding for unsatisfactory conduct or progress.

An \"eligible officer\" is an agent who has served at least 180 days and is either killed or permanently disabled while on duty. The term \"eligible dependent\" refers to the child or spouse of an eligible officer who is dependent at the time of the officer's death or total and disabling injury. A \"program of education\" is any curriculum pursued at an educational institution to fulfill a specific educational, professional, or vocational objective. The term \"educational institution\" includes various types of schools and colleges providing education for adults. An \"institution of higher learning\" refers to colleges, universities, and similar postsecondary level institutions. Eligible dependents must apply for approval to pursue a course of study not related to a single career field. An educational institution can offer postsecondary academic instruction leading to an associate or higher degree if authorized by the State or accredited by a recognized agency. This term also includes hospitals and institutions offering courses recognized by the Secretary of Education. The term \"standard college degree\" refers to an associate or higher degree awarded by an institution accredited by a recognized regional or national accrediting agency, a \"candidate\" for accreditation, or upon completion of a course accredited by an agency recognized for specialized degree-level programs. The accrediting agency must be recognized by the Secretary of Education under section 1775 of title 38 for programs."
