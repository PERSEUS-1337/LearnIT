    "content": "Hezbollah's 2006 attack in northern Israel led to a month-long war involving Israel, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Palestinian militants in Gaza. Iran and Syria supported Hezbollah, complicating the conflict. Iran has played significant roles in arming, training, and financing Hezbollah and Hamas as proxies to further their own goals in the Middle East. The fighting in southern Lebanon in 2006 was seen as a contest between Israel and Iran (via Hezbollah), raising concerns about potential future confrontations between these powerful actors. The attacks by Hezbollah in Israel and clashes in the Gaza Strip highlighted the risks posed by terrorist groups along Israel's borders and the importance of comprehensive peace agreements for regional security. The risk to regional security is heightened by the absence of comprehensive peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, including Lebanon and Syria. Non-state political movements like Hezbollah and Hamas pose a challenge to achieving peace, as they do not recognize Israel's right to exist. The 2006 war in Lebanon exemplified the ongoing conflict along the Israeli-Lebanese-Syrian border, exacerbated by the technical state of war between Israel and its northern neighbors. Historically weak Lebanese governments have neglected the predominately Shiite southern region. The southern portion of Lebanon, predominantly Shiite, was initially neglected by the government and vulnerable to outside groups. Palestinian militants used the area as a base to attack Israel, leading to Israeli occupation of a buffer zone for 18 years. This occupation, along with support from Iran, contributed to the rise of Hezbollah in the region. Hezbollah, supported by Iran, has filled the power vacuum in southern Lebanon, threatening Israel with the backing of Syria. The Israeli-Lebanese-Syrian tri-border area remains a potential conflict zone due to unresolved territorial disputes. Syria seeks the return of the Golan Heights lost in the Six Day War, using groups like Hezbollah as proxies. Despite past negotiations, significant differences between Syria and Israel persist. In 2006, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1701 to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The resolution called for a cessation of hostilities, the expansion of UNIFIL forces, and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. Resolution 1701 called for the deployment of U.N. and Lebanese forces to the south, a ban on weapons delivery to any entity in Lebanon except the Lebanese Army, and delineation of Lebanon's borders within 30 days. It also emphasized addressing prisoner issues, providing financial and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people, and facilitating the safe return of displaced persons. The agreement entered into force on August 14. Resolution 1701 called for the deployment of U.N. and Lebanese forces to the south, a ban on weapons delivery to any entity in Lebanon except the Lebanese Army, and delineation of Lebanon's borders within 30 days. It also emphasized addressing prisoner issues, providing financial and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people, and facilitating the safe return of displaced persons. The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was created in 1978 to monitor Israeli withdrawal, with plans to increase its size to 15,000 personnel, including contributions from European countries, Turkey, Qatar, and potentially Indonesia for broader support. The expanded UNIFIL deployment is being considered for southern Lebanon and the Syrian-Lebanese border, opposed by Syria. Resolution 1701 supports the Lebanese Armed Forces deploying 15,000 personnel to southern Lebanon as Israeli forces withdraw. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of the Lebanese troops due to limited capabilities, outdated equipment, and sectarian divisions within the army. The Lebanese army, led by General Elias Hanna, has a predominantly Christian and Sunni officer corps, with the rank and file being 70% Shiite. Deployment of Lebanese troops could help monitor the Lebanese-Syrian border. Resolution 1701 aims to create temporary calm but may not address the root cause of the conflict - Hezbollah's presence on Israel's borders. UNIFIL's expanded deployment will not operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. According to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, there is no expectation for the UN force to physically disarm Hezbollah. Israel wants peacekeepers along the Lebanese-Syrian border to prevent Hezbollah's re-armament, but Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora says Lebanese forces are already deployed there. Syria's President Bashar al-Asad threatened to close the border if peacekeepers are stationed nearby. Asad opposes peacekeeping force along the border, citing infringement on Lebanese sovereignty. Lebanese army struggles to prevent arms smuggling to Hezbollah. International mediators work to free kidnapped Israeli soldier in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Hamas demands simultaneous prisoner swap, hampering mediation efforts. Egyptian officials are mediating a prisoner exchange involving the release of a kidnapped Israeli soldier and about 800 Palestinian prisoners in three groups. The Hamas military wing, possibly answering to Chief Khalid al-Mish'al, may need approval from Syrian hosts or Iranian supporters for any deal. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is mediating an exchange of prisoners between Israel and Hezbollah. Egyptian officials are mediating a prisoner exchange involving the release of a kidnapped Israeli soldier and about 800 Palestinian prisoners in three groups. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is mediating an exchange of prisoners between Israel and Hezbollah, with Israeli officials showing contradictory actions indicating they expect an exchange despite their initial refusal to negotiate. Israel has a history of exchanging prisoners with Hezbollah via third party mediators. The Israeli government launched a recent war to end the precedent of prisoner exchanges. The fighting in Gaza has decreased, with Israeli forces making sporadic incursions to attack terrorists and smuggling tunnels. Air and artillery strikes have been reduced, possibly due to a shift of forces to the northern front against Lebanon. It is uncertain if hostilities will escalate again in Gaza. Since the fighting in Gaza has decreased, it is uncertain if hostilities will re-escalate. The conflict involves supporters and opponents of the Hamas-led government, with rising crime rates and violence attributed to economic difficulties. Gaza's dire economic situation worsened after funds were cut off to the Palestinian Authority when Hamas took over leadership. The Hamas-led government in Gaza faces pressure to accept President Mahmud Abbas to form a national unity government to allow foreign aid to flow again. Hamas resists conceding the premiership and insists on maintaining dominance in the cabinet. They also reject the idea of a government of technocrats and refuse to accept principles of non-violence, recognize Israel, and prior agreements. The unresolved border issue of the Shib'a Farms near the Lebanon-Syria-Israel tri-border area continues to exacerbate tensions in southern Lebanon and complicate cease-fire terms. Israel argues it is part of the Syrian Golan Heights, while Lebanon claims it as Lebanese territory. The Shib'a Farms territory is disputed between Lebanon and Israel. The UN Secretary General stated that it is not part of Lebanon, but the issue remains unresolved. Hezbollah uses this as a reason to keep their weapons and launch attacks on Israeli forces in the area. Hezbollah seized three Israeli soldiers in October 2000 near the Shib'a Farms area, leading to their release in January 2004 in exchange for Hezbollah prisoners. This incident preceded the 2006 kidnapping that sparked Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, resulting in border violations, attacks, air strikes, and tensions exacerbated by the undefined Syrian-Lebanese border and lack of formal diplomatic relations. The twin protectorates of Syria and Lebanon, established under a French mandate, did not establish diplomatic structures or agreed boundaries upon gaining independence in 1943. Advocates of a \"Greater Syria\" were hesitant to recognize separate states. The Shib'a Farms territory became a focal point during political upheavals in Lebanon in 2005 and the fighting in July 2006. Discussions on the status of Shib'a Farms arose during international conferences on Lebanon. Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora proposed placing the Shib'a Farms under U.N. jurisdiction until border delineation is settled. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 referenced the proposal but did not specifically endorse it. The U.N. Secretary-General is tasked with developing proposals to implement agreements regarding the delineation of Lebanon's international borders, including the disputed Shebaa Farms area. Syrian President Bashar al-Asad expressed readiness to delineate the border with Lebanon, but formal demarcation of the Shebaa Farms is pending Israeli withdrawal. The status of the Shebaa Farms is crucial for Lebanon's stability. The Shebaa Farms area is a key factor for stability in Lebanon and future agreements involving Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. It is disputed territory that could fall under different U.N. resolutions depending on whether it is considered part of Lebanese or Syrian territory occupied by Israel. The issue remains unresolved due to Israeli occupation. Hezbollah's success in recent conflicts can be attributed to various factors. Hezbollah's recent success in conflicts can be attributed to extensive defensive preparations, support from Iran, and a network of fortified sites. Their ability to withstand Israeli attacks was due to well-equipped personnel and underground facilities. Hezbollah's well-equipped units, supported by stockpiled supplies and local support, maintained strong resistance against Israeli forces. Their familiarity with the terrain, widespread support, and effective communication networks allowed them to slow Israeli advances through guerrilla warfare tactics. Despite attempting limited incursions into Israeli territory, Hezbollah's rocket attacks continued throughout the conflict. Hezbollah maintained a campaign of rocket attacks on Israeli territory during the conflict, firing an estimated 4,000-5,000 rockets. Israeli retaliation was swift, but the mobility of rocket launchers made them difficult targets. Rockets supplied by Iran and Syria had ranges of up to 120 miles and were effective terror weapons. Despite potential reductions in military capabilities, Hezbollah's long-term potential as a guerrilla movement remains intact. Hezbollah's potential as a guerrilla movement remains intact despite the conflict. Critics questioned the government's handling of the war, noting that Hezbollah retained its arms and may have been politically strengthened. Israelis initially supported the war as a response to Hezbollah rocket attacks but later criticized the government for poor results. Charges against the government and military leaders include hesitant decision-making and excessive reliance on air power. The government faced criticism for its handling of the war, including delayed ground offensive, poor intelligence on Hezbollah, deficient training for reservists, and ill-prepared home front defenses. However, the government argues that the war forced Hezbollah from the border, degraded its arms, and pressured the Lebanese government to assert control over the south. The government, with international support, is working to assert control over the south, a demand Israel had since withdrawing in 2000. Israeli officials see Hezbollah's weakened state confirmed by Nasrallah's admission. Public support for the government has dropped, with calls for the resignations of top officials due to lack of military experience. Critics blame Gen. Halutz for the situation. Some critics blame Gen. Halutz, a former head of the air force, for making too many appointments to the general staff from the air force and ignoring well-developed plans for a ground campaign. The revelation of Halutz's personal stock market transactions during the war raised questions about his priorities. Reservists and families of those killed in action have been demanding accountability, but Prime Minister Olmert rejected calls for an independent state commission of inquiry, citing the need for the military to focus on more urgent tasks. Instead, he appointed former Mossad Director Nahum Admoni to lead a government investigatory committee. Prime Minister Olmert appointed Director Nahum Admoni to head a government investigatory committee to examine wartime decision-making. Critics were unsatisfied, calling for a state inquiry. Attorney-General Menahem Mazuz disqualified two committee members for conflicts of interest. Olmert approved Defense Minister Peretz's appointment of Gen. (Res.) Ammon Lipkin-Shahak to investigate military and Defense Ministry performance during the war. Accusations of lack of independence were made against Lipkin-Shahak, who had advised Peretz during the war. Despite calls for a state commission of inquiry, Olmert persisted in avoiding it. Despite calls for a state commission of inquiry, Prime Minister Olmert appointed retired judge Eliahu Winograd to head a committee to examine wartime decision-making. Support for Olmert's coalition partners has decreased, while opposition parties have gained popularity. Speculation about reconfiguring the governing coalition has arisen, although Olmert claims no interest in change. Netanyahu, Lieberman, and other parties show reluctance to bring down the government immediately. Likud has a deal to support the 2007 budget. Netanyahu may not feel ready for another election due to past criticisms. Kadima members are tied to Olmert's political survival. Kadima, formed in 2005 for disengagement from the West Bank, now lacks purpose as public and party support wanes. Olmert focuses on rebuilding the north post-war, but this isn't seen as a new party platform. Peretz faces challenges within Labor from dissidents without cabinet roles. Dissidents within the Labor party, led by Avishay Braverman and Ami Ayalon, are criticizing their party leader due to budget cuts for the war affecting the party's social and economic agenda. Defense Minister Peretz is caught between supporting military demands and addressing social causes, facing opposition within his own party. The government's instability is highlighted, with Israeli governments typically lasting less than two years. The current Israeli government is facing doubts about its longevity, with concerns that it may not survive two years. Despite a halt in fighting, Iran and Hezbollah are competing with the United States and its allies to rebuild southern Lebanon and win over the Lebanese civilians. Hezbollah is providing financial aid to those who lost their homes during the war, with most of the funds coming from Iran. Hezbollah is distributing aid to Lebanon, including banknotes not from the formal banking system. They pledge to rebuild buildings and villages within three years. Lebanon's Prime Minister offers compensation for homes destroyed in the conflict. The Lebanese government estimates $3.5 to $4 billion in infrastructure damage from the war. President is countering Hezbollah's efforts. President Bush announced a $230 million aid package to Lebanon to counter Hezbollah's efforts. The aid includes funds from various foreign aid accounts and will focus on projects like reconstructing the Fidar Bridge in Jbeil. The international community has recognized Lebanon's urgent need for reconstruction assistance. A total of $940 million in early reconstruction aid was committed and earmarked for rebuilding various infrastructure projects, including the Fidar Bridge in Jbeil, cleaning and repairing schools, providing support to fishermen, and addressing the oil slick pollution along the Lebanese coastline. Countries opposed to Iranian influence in Lebanon are also involved in the reconstruction efforts. The slow pace of international financial and security commitments has hindered countries opposed to Iranian influence in Lebanon. Lebanon's internal politics were dominated by Syria for almost 30 years until 2005, leading to resentment among various Lebanese populations. The assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005, blamed on Syrian agents, triggered significant political changes in Lebanon. The withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon in 2005, following the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, led to significant political changes. Free parliamentary elections were held without Syrian interference, a new anti-Syrian cabinet was installed, and a UN commission was established to investigate Hariri's murder. Initial reports implicated Syria, but findings remain inconclusive. Many saw Syria's withdrawal and the election of an anti-Syrian majority in Lebanon as a setback for Syrian ambitions in the region. Syria's regime under Bashar al-Asad weakened, but maintained assets in Lebanon: mixed government with pro- and anti-Syrian elements, possible Syrian intelligence presence, and Hezbollah's refusal to disarm. Lebanese government divided with anti-Syrian majority in parliament, Hezbollah leading a minority bloc, and President Lahoud supported by Syria. President Emile Lahoud, supported by Syria and Hezbollah, refuses to retire before his term ends in 2007. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, part of the anti-Syrian bloc, leads a cabinet with two Hezbollah members. Disputes over Hezbollah's disarmament, President Lahoud's status, and relations with Syria have caused cabinet crises, limiting the government's effectiveness. The 2006 conflict between Hezbollah and Israel boosted Hezbollah's reputation, with leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah gaining hero status. Hezbollah's reputation has soared due to its military success against Israel and efficient disaster relief efforts in Lebanon. This has bolstered Nasrallah's popularity and made it difficult for critics to challenge the group. Syria, a major sponsor of Hezbollah, also benefits from the group's strong position. Efforts to investigate Syria's role in the Hariri assassination have waned, as Hezbollah's effectiveness overshadows other concerns. The comparisons between Hezbollah's effectiveness and the Lebanese government's ineptitude raise questions about the future of the Siniora government. The interaction of Lebanon's diverse religious and political groups will play a crucial role in determining the government's ability to withstand domestic criticism. Shiite Muslims, though not a majority, have increased their influence in Lebanon, with Sheikh Nasrallah likely to have a greater impact in the post-conflict environment. Sheikh Nasrallah's multiple roles in Lebanon post-conflict include military leader, reconstruction czar, and political participant. Despite his favorable image, he may prefer to enhance his role in the government rather than challenge the Shiite leadership. The interaction between government offices in Lebanon complicates decision-making, with Prime Minister Siniora not directly engaging with Hezbollah, listed as a terrorist organization by the US. The United States has pledged $230 million in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Lebanon following the Israeli-Lebanon/Hezbollah conflict. Prime Minister Siniora negotiated wording in Resolution 1701 to Lebanon's advantage. Realignments within parliamentary blocs are possible as the political situation evolves. Israel received no additional assistance except for an extension of existing loan guarantees. The United States provides aid to countries in the Middle East, including Israel and Lebanon, for peace, economic development, and defense. Loan guarantees allow Israel to borrow at lower rates, with funds set aside for possible default. Israel has never defaulted on a U.S.-backed loan guarantee to maintain its good credit rating. The FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act authorized $9 billion in loan guarantees for Israel, with conditions on usage within pre-June 1967 borders and reduction for spending on settlements. The $3 billion loan guarantees for FY2003 were reduced by $289.5 million due to Israel's continued settlement construction in occupied territories and the security barrier. The Bush Administration plans to extend Israel's loan guarantees through FY2010, with $4.6 billion left to draw on. The United States provides assistance to Lebanon for economic, military, and humanitarian purposes, with annual funding maintained at $35 to $40 million since FY2001. Lebanon may also be eligible for $10 million in Department of Defense funds for training and equipping foreign military forces for counter-terrorist operations. The United States plans to provide $10 million in aid to modernize the Lebanese Armed Forces, including upgrading military trucks, armored personnel carriers, and utility helicopters. The aid may come with conditions to use the equipment to contain Hezbollah's militia. Additionally, the US has pledged $230 million in aid to Lebanon for reconstruction, with $55 million already committed and the remaining $175 million expected to be reprogrammed from existing funds. On September 14, 2006, Representative Tom Lantos put a hold on aid to Lebanon until Lebanese Armed Forces deploy along the Lebanese-Syrian border. Allegations of targeting civilian populations with inaccurate munitions during the war were made by partisans and human rights activists. Hezbollah's indiscriminate rocket firing into Israeli towns was condemned for causing terror and infrastructure damage. According to the Jerusalem Post, rockets fired by Hezbollah into northern Israel contained anti-personnel munitions like steel ball bearings. Israeli civil defense agencies are working to identify and remove unexploded ordnance. Amnesty International accused Hezbollah militants of war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law during the Lebanon war, noting the indiscriminate nature of Hezbollah's Katyusha rockets. Israel's use of cluster weapons in response to Hezbollah's attacks has also been criticized. The issue of cluster weapons has received media attention due to the US being a major provider of military aid to Israel. The issue of cluster weapons in southern Lebanon has received media attention and is under investigation. Large numbers of unexploded cluster bombs from Israeli ground- and air-launched weapons remain scattered in the area. Criticisms have been made regarding Israel's use of cluster weapons in populated areas due to the high failure rate and risk to civilians. Israel reportedly received some cluster weapons from the United States. Israel reportedly used cluster weapons in southern Lebanon, leading to civilian deaths and injuries. The United Nations documented 12 deaths and 61 injuries from unexploded ordnance (UXO), mostly linked to cluster sub-munitions. Clearing the 448 cluster weapon strike sites may take 12 to 15 months. Human Rights Watch noted that 57 countries stockpile cluster weapons, with nine using them in combat, including the United States. Israeli officials claim they considered civilian casualties, but concerns remain about the impact of cluster weapons on civilians. Israel defended its use of cluster weapons in southern Lebanon, stating it was legal under international law. The IDF targeted Hezbollah rocket launch sites in open areas, transferring maps to UNIFIL to clear unexploded ordnance (UXO) after the conflict. The U.S. plans to expand humanitarian efforts for landmine and UXO removal. The U.S. plans to expand its landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) humanitarian clearance program in Lebanon after the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. This includes a $420,000 emergency grant and increased support for UXO data collection and mapping operations. Congressional approval is being sought for up to $2 million for continued UXO clearing in FY2007. Additionally, the Department of State has delayed a shipment of M-26 cluster munitions to Israel and is investigating the Israel Defense Force's use of cluster munitions during the conflict. The U.S. plans to expand its humanitarian clearance program in Lebanon after the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. This includes increased support for UXO data collection and mapping operations. The Department of State has delayed a shipment of M-26 cluster munitions to Israel and is investigating Israel's use of U.S.-supplied weapons. President Bush characterized Israel's military actions as \"self-defense\" during the conflict. The Arms Export Control Act requires U.S.-supplied weapons to be used only in \"legitimate self-defense.\" Senators Feinstein and Leahy introduced an amendment to prevent the use of cluster munitions near civilian populations, but it failed to pass in Congress. Opponents argued it would restrict military options. In December 2004, the U.S. State Department added Al-Manar to the Terrorist Exclusion List (TEL), citing incitement to commit terrorist acts and providing material support for terrorism. This led to the organization being banned from broadcasting its satellite signal into the United States, but it continues to upload content on its website accessible to anyone with an internet connection. On March 23, 2006, the Department of the Treasury designated Al-Manar as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity, blocking access to its assets under U.S. jurisdiction. Stuart Levey stated that any entity maintained by a terrorist group is as culpable as the group itself. Transactions with Al-Manar by U.S. persons or corporations are prohibited. Boughader, owner of a Lebanese restaurant in Mexico, arrested on human-smuggling charges for trafficking Lebanese nationals into the US. Admitted to assisting an Al-Manar employee and individuals with Hezbollah ties. Javed Iqbal arrested for offering Al-Manar broadcasts in New York through his company HDTV Ltd. Transactions with Al-Manar prohibited by US authorities. On August 29, 2006, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated the Islamic Resistance Support Organization (IRSO) of Lebanon as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity for fundraising for Hezbollah through Al Manar television network. IRSO allowed donors to specify funds for military equipment. IRSO is now prohibited from operating in the U.S. and its assets frozen. On September 7, 2006, the U.S. Treasury designated Bayt al-Mal and the Yousser Company for Finance and Investment of Lebanon for supporting Hezbollah financially. Iran's Bank Saderat was also prohibited from conducting financial transactions with the U.S. due to its funding of Hezbollah. Israel had previously conducted military strikes on Hezbollah's financial operations in July 2006. Israel conducted military strikes on Hezbollah financial centers and banks in Lebanon in July 2006. The strikes were aimed at sending a message to Lebanese banks supporting Hezbollah. Al-Manar, a Hezbollah-controlled satellite TV station, broadcasts anti-Israel propaganda and was targeted by Israel during the conflict. During the conflict in Lebanon in July 2006, Israel targeted Al-Manar, a Hezbollah-controlled satellite TV station in southern Beirut. Despite damage to the complex, the station resumed broadcasting at full capacity after the attacks. The conflict also sparked debate among Sunni Islamists, including Al Qaeda leaders, about supporting Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militia. The conflict in Lebanon in July 2006 sparked debate among Sunni Islamists about supporting Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militia. Some viewed Hezbollah's actions as part of a Shiite conspiracy for power, while others called for unity between Sunni and Shiite Muslims against Israel. These debates could impact U.S. foreign policy initiatives and counterterrorism objectives in the region. Some Sunni Islamic leaders, like Yusuf Al Qaradawi and Egypt's Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, supported Hezbollah and Hamas as legitimate resistance groups defending Muslim territory. Saudi sheikh Salman Al Awda urged Sunnis to unite with Shiites against Israel. These statements could have political implications and diverge from Arab political leaders' positions. Some Sunni Islamic leaders supported Hezbollah and Hamas as legitimate resistance groups defending Muslim territory, diverging from Arab political leaders' positions. Al Qaeda rejected unity with Hezbollah, viewing them as serving Iranian interests. Al Qaeda leadership, led by Ayman Al Zawahiri, remains ambiguous on sectarian issues, refraining from directly urging Sunni-Shiite unity or supporting Hezbollah. Zawahiri's statements lack clarity on Muslim unity, with a Hezbollah official calling for clearer references to Shiites. In September, Zawahiri addressed Muslims globally and in Lebanon without addressing sectarian questions raised by Hezbollah. Hezbollah and others raise sectarian questions, urging Muslim aid for Lebanon and Gaza. Lebanese Muslims are urged to reject international resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 1701. Sunni jihadist debate on Shiites' stance may impact future conflicts involving Shiites. Divergent interpretations of the Lebanon war and its implications for U.S. policy in the Middle East exist. Some see it as part of a global war on terror, while others view it differently. The war in Lebanon is seen as a battleground in an Iranian-Israeli struggle for regional dominance. Some view it as part of a long history of Arab-Israeli violence, while others see it as a challenge for U.S. policy. The conflict presents a dilemma for the Bush Administration, torn between supporting Israeli military action and maintaining stability in Lebanon. The fighting in Lebanon poses a challenge for the Bush Administration's goals of promoting democracy and fighting terrorism. If Lebanon falls into civil strife or aligns with Syria or Iran, it could lead to regional instability, terrorism, and chaos similar to the civil war era. This would hinder U.S. efforts to support a modernizing pluralist state and could strengthen Syrian or Iranian influence in the region. The potential strengthening of extremist and anti-Western views in the region due to Iranian and Syrian influence, as well as the challenges of disarming Hezbollah's militia and terrorist wings. Israeli skepticism towards international efforts to disarm Hezbollah and concerns over Syrian and Iranian shipments to the group. The role of Syria in Hezbollah's possible re-armament. The role of Syria in Hezbollah's possible re-armament is uncertain, with questions surrounding Syria's influence over Hezbollah in a post-Syrian military occupation Lebanon and potential demands Syria may make for cooperation. The West could offer incentives to Syria, such as ending its isolation, removing it from the terrorism list, recognizing its influence in Lebanese politics, ratifying trade agreements, easing international pressure, and providing financial support. Some believe increased financial support, possibly from Arab Gulf states, could influence Syria's actions. Others argue against U.S. engagement, fearing it could undermine Lebanese independence. Speculation continues on winners and losers of the war. Israeli officials emphasize their response to the conflict. The aftermath of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is still being debated. Israeli officials believe their response weakened Hezbollah's capabilities, but some Israelis feel the war was poorly managed. Hezbollah claims a symbolic victory by surviving and continuing to threaten Israel. Iran sees the conflict as boosting Arab and Muslim support for Lebanese Shiites and opposition to Israel. Analysts warn that this support may be temporary. Increased Arab and Muslim support for Hezbollah following the conflict with Israel may be temporary, driven by solidarity with the Lebanese people and anger towards Israel. There is also growing political pressure in moderate Arab states to condemn Israel and hold the United States accountable for civilian casualties in Lebanon. In January 2006, Hamas won Palestinian legislative elections, leading to deteriorating Israeli-Palestinian relations and renewed fighting in Gaza. Hezbollah used the clashes as a pretext for its July 12 attack, transforming the region from relative calm to full-scale war. In response to Hamas winning the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, the Quartet (United States, European Union, United Nations, and Russia) emphasized the importance of non-violence, recognition of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements for further engagement. President Abbas endorsed Hamas' platform but demanded compliance with these principles for a two-state solution. Hamas leaders have largely rejected the Quartet principles, arguing for negotiations with Israel. The Quartet principles were not accepted by Hamas, leading to isolation and violence within the Palestinian Authority. Israel and the Quartet limited aid to the Hamas-controlled PA due to their refusal to comply with the principles, resulting in financial consequences for the PA. The Bush Administration and the European Union suspended aid to the Palestinian Authority due to its control by Hamas, a designated terrorist entity. This led to budgetary shortfalls and economic hardship for Palestinians. President Abbas referred to the measures as a \"siege.\" In April, May, and June 2006, tensions between Hamas-led government and Fatah loyal armed forces escalated over unpaid salaries and command responsibilities. Efforts to end intra-Palestinian violence were made by Palestinian leaders, including President Abbas, but fresh violence between Israel and Hamas erupted in the Gaza Strip. Israeli-Palestinian fighting had been subdued due to self-imposed restraint before the outbreak of violence in late spring/summer 2006. 12 Palestinian groups extended an informal truce with Israel for one year, known as a hudna. Hamas refrained from suicide bombings but continued to launch attacks. Israel responded with air and artillery strikes and targeted killings of terrorists. On June 9, 2006, a Palestinian family was killed on a Gaza beach, sparking Hamas to intensify rocket fire into southern Israel. Palestinian factions agreed on a National Accord Document in June, but Hamas leaders in Damascus were hesitant due to concerns about moderating views on Israel and the peace process. On June 25, Hamas militants attacked Israeli forces near Gaza, killing two soldiers and kidnapping one. The attack was believed to be orchestrated by Hamas leader Mish'al to assert power and undermine the National Accord. Israeli forces launched a major operation to rescue the soldier and weaken Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government. Israeli officials claimed Hamas crossed a \"red line\" with a kidnapping and attack in pre-1967 Israel. Hamas officials in the Palestinian Authority allied with the kidnappers. Israel arrested 64 Hamas officials in the West Bank and Jerusalem. Israeli forces bombed PA ministries, weapons depots, and targeted Hamas offices in the West Bank. After Hamas militants fired an upgraded rocket at Ashkelon, the Israeli cabinet approved \"prolonged\" activities against Hamas, including air and artillery strikes. Palestinian militants continue to fire rockets into southern Israel. International mediators, including the Egyptians, have proposed a resolution for the release of prisoners. However, Hamas leader Khalid Mish'al insisted on a mutual release or \"swap\" of prisoners, while Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed concerns about the potential damage to the future of Israel if prisoners were traded with Hamas. Hamas leader Khalid Mish'al insists on a mutual release of prisoners, while Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expresses concerns about potential damage to Israel's future. Negotiating with Hamas could signal that moderates like Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas are not needed. Abbas aims to prevent non-Palestinian extremists from hijacking the Palestinian issue. Hamas leader Mish'al emphasizes cooperation with Hezbollah and calls for unity on Palestinian and Lebanese issues. Hezbollah forces from Lebanon attacked Israeli vehicles in northern Israel, killing three soldiers and kidnapping two. Hezbollah's leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, suggested a prisoner exchange for the soldiers' return. Hezbollah supports Hamas, providing training and support. Hamas, inspired by Hezbollah, kidnapped an Israeli soldier. Hamas's kidnapping of an Israeli soldier follows Hezbollah's example, as both groups aim to drive Israel from occupied territories and have close ties with Iran. Nasrallah of Hezbollah has expressed a desire to kidnap Israelis for a prisoner exchange. Hezbollah may have acted in solidarity with Palestinians, Syrian and Iranian supporters, or to prevent a resolution of the Gaza crisis. The Hezbollah attack complicated a prisoner exchange agreement that was almost reached. Speculation surrounds Hezbollah's autonomy and possible motives, including acting on behalf of Iran to divert attention from its nuclear program. Syria may be using Hezbollah to regain influence in Lebanon. In response to the Hezbollah attack in Lebanon, experts believe Syria and Iran may be exploiting the situation. U.S. officials state that Hezbollah does not necessarily seek permission from Iran for all actions, but may do so for those with broader international implications. Congress swiftly expressed support for Israel in the current crisis. Congress swiftly expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself against terrorist groups and their state sponsors in Lebanon and Gaza. Some members called for an immediate cessation of violence, multi-party negotiations, and an international peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon. House Resolution 954 urged the President to appoint a Special Envoy for Middle East Peace. In response to the conflict in the Middle East, Congress called for a Special Envoy for Middle East Peace and urged Syria and Iran to stop supporting Hezbollah. The State Department initially required U.S. citizens evacuated from Lebanon to sign promissory notes for evacuation costs, but after objections from Congress, these fees were waived. Congress also increased funding for the Social Security Administration to provide temporary assistance. Funding available for temporary assistance to U.S. citizens returning from foreign countries and increased funding for State Department evacuations. Proposed legislation aims to change reimbursement requests and replenish funds for Health and Human Services. U.S. sanctions Syria, Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah for aggression and terrorism support. The Secretary of State designated Syria and Iran as state sponsors of terrorism, triggering various economic sanctions. Iran is also restricted from receiving investment for its petroleum industry under the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, with penalties for unlawful investment including export bans, denial of loans, and procurement contract restrictions. The President can restrict participation in U.S. debt instruments and procurement contracts under the IEEPA. Executive Orders also restrict petroleum-related investments. Syria, a state sponsor of terrorism, faces less restrictive trade regulations due to its role in the Middle East peace process.
