    "content": "The \"Affordable Gas Price Act\" includes provisions such as termination of restrictions on oil and natural gas development on Federal lands, limitation of suits under the National Environmental Policy Act, incentives for investment in oil refineries, suspension of fuel taxes on highway motor fuels during high gasoline prices, increase in mileage reimbursement rates, and termination of certain trade restrictions with Russia and Kazakhstan. Congress acknowledges that high fuel costs hinder economic growth and impact the quality of life for Americans, especially in the trucking industry. They recognize that government intervention in the market, such as price controls, will lead to shortages and rationing. Federal regulations on drilling and gas taxes further inflate prices, burdening families, businesses, and truckers. Litigation delaying refinery construction is also a concern. The Jackson-Vanik amendment was a US response to the Soviet Union's restrictive emigration policy. By 2005, Russia and Kazakhstan allowed citizens to emigrate without heavy taxes or fees. Elimination of the Jackson-Vanik amendment would increase US access to oil supplies from non-Arab countries, lowering gas prices. Termination of restrictions on oil and natural gas development on federal lands. The curr_chunk discusses the termination of laws prohibiting expenditures for natural gas leasing and preleasing activities on the Outer Continental Shelf, as well as the revocation of existing presidential withdrawals for oil and natural gas exploration.

The term 'petroleum refining property' excludes assets for which a deduction was previously taken and applies to refineries placed in service after the enactment date, except for those under a binding construction contract prior to enactment.

After this extension, Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 will no longer apply to these countries."
