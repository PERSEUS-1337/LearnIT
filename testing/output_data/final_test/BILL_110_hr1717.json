The National Bio and Agro-defense Facility (NBAF) is established within the Department to research and defend against agroterrorism and natural incidents impacting public health, animal health, and homeland security. The NBAF is responsible for producing and sharing knowledge and technology to reduce economic losses from animal diseases and prevent human suffering. The Director is tasked with directing research on various animal diseases, including foot and mouth disease. The NBAF is responsible for developing countermeasures for foreign-animal, zoonotic, and other endemic animal diseases, including diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. It also provides advanced test and evaluation capabilities for threat detection and conducts nonclinical animal model testing to support the development of human medical countermeasures. The NBAF is responsible for developing countermeasures for animal diseases, including diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. It facilitates coordination of research efforts to protect public and animal health from various diseases and ensures public safety during emergencies by developing response plans for emergency providers. The NBAF ensures response providers are trained effectively, site security is maintained, staff are skilled, and expertise from various sources is leveraged. The facility must meet specific requirements during design and construction. The NBAF must meet requirements for state-of-the-art biocontainment labs, a minimum 30-acre secured site, 500,000 square feet facility with capacity for 80 large animals, preexisting utility infrastructure, and easy access for response providers. The NBAF must be located near an airport and major roadways, and the Secretary can accept donations for the site. The NBAF is considered a public building for the Public Buildings Act of 1959. The Secretary can enable foot and mouth disease research with live virus at the NBAF. Coordination involves agreements with other federal departments for carrying out animal and zoonotic disease research. The NBAF conducts research on foreign-animal, zoonotic, and endemic animal diseases to protect public and animal health. Agreements with the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services outline research programs and functions, including those from Plum Island Animal Disease Center. The Director of NBAF shall establish cooperative relationships with national animal health organizations to facilitate a rapid response to animal health emergencies. Sec. 316. National Bio and Agro-defense Facility."
