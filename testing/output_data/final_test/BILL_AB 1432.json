    "title": "AB 1432",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1190 of the Harbors and Navigation Code is amended to establish rates for bar pilotage through the Golden Gate and into or out of the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun. The rates include a charge per draft foot of the vessel's deepest draft and an additional charge per high gross registered ton. The mill rates may be adjusted based on the number of licensed pilots. On January 1, 2010, if the board has fewer than 58 licensed pilots, the mill rate from December 31, 2006, will be adjusted as if there are 58 pilots. The adjustment is based on the gross registered tons handled by pilots and their annual income. The new mill rate adjustment will take effect at the beginning of the next quarter as determined by the board. Starting January 1, 2010, if the number of licensed pilots is 60 or more in any quarter, certain clauses will become inoperative in the following quarter. The board may authorize an incremental mill rate charge per high gross registered ton to cover costs for new pilot boats and modifications for existing pilot boats. The charge will be labeled as a pilot boat surcharge on invoices and used to reduce debt on new pilot boats. Adjustments to the surcharge may be made to reflect operational savings from boat modifications. The mill rate established by the board may be adjusted if there is a catastrophic cost increase to pilots resulting in a 2% increase in annual costs. The minimum charge for bar pilotage is $662 per vessel. The vessel's deepest draft during transit inward or outward shall be the maximum draft attained. The rate for pilotage through the Golden Gate to or from the high seas to a berth within a specific area is specified by the board. A movement fee is added for pilotage past certain points. The rate is for trips between the high seas and dock, excluding docking and undocking services. The board will determine the number of licensed pilots based on a 1986 manpower study. The board has adopted rate recommendations for pilotage through the Golden Gate, with rate increases of 4% in 2003 and 2004, and 3% in 2005 and 2006. A movement fee will be imposed to cover pilot costs for navigation equipment starting in 2017. The software, equipment, and technology covered by this section are strictly for piloting on the pilotage grounds. A navigation technology surcharge will be imposed on pilot invoices, with a maximum collection limit of $1,200,000. The surcharge will be reviewed and adjusted quarterly by the board. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, unless extended by a later statute."
