    "content": "As Congress investigates the Benghazi attacks, questions arise about security funding. The State Department is authorized to provide maximum security for U.S. properties abroad. The Diplomatic Security Act of 1986 emphasized the Secretary of State's role in funding diplomatic/embassy security. Following the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, an independent panel chaired by Admiral William Crowe highlighted inadequate resources for protective measures against terrorist attacks and low priority given to security concerns. In response, Congress passed the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (SECCA), which established stricter security requirements, mandated additional training, authorized $900 million annually for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) for five years, and required the Secretary of State to convene an Accountability Review Board (ARB) in case of serious incidents. After the Benghazi attacks in 2012, a new Accountability Review Board (ARB) was convened to address the State Department's struggle to obtain resources for risk mitigation at U.S. facilities worldwide. The report highlighted the importance of managing resources effectively but also noted a tendency among some managers to restrict resource usage. The ARB report after the Benghazi attacks in 2012 emphasized the need for effective resource management at the State Department. Congress is urged to provide necessary funding for security measures, as security funding is only about 9% of the total appropriation for diplomatic security. Congress has not passed a stand-alone State Department appropriation since 1995 or a Foreign Relations Authorization law since 2002. Congress has not passed a stand-alone Foreign Relations Authorization law since 2002, leading to ongoing security funding delays within Continuing Resolutions. State Department officials can only allocate funding after the final appropriation is passed by Congress and signed into law. Congress provides funding for diplomatic/embassy security through various subaccounts within the Department of State appropriations, including Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU). These funds address security programs for life, property, and information globally. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) is responsible for protecting people, property, and information globally. Funding for security programs comes from Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU), which cover salaries, security-related costs, and construction of secure embassy compounds. The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) protects people, property, and information globally. It conducts international investigations, provides threat analysis, and focuses on cyber security, counterterrorism, personnel security, and security technology. The Bureau manages much of the WSP funding. The Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT) leads the U.S. government in counterterrorism diplomacy and provides an on-call capability to respond to terrorist incidents worldwide. Funding within the Border Security Program (BSP) is allocated to DS to fund the protection of consular affairs facilities in the United States. The Appendix presents annual diplomatic/embassy security requests and actual funding levels from FY2008 to the FY2015 request. Base funding is available to U.S. facilities worldwide. Total security funding includes base funding, supplemental, and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for diplomatic/embassy security. Supplemental security funds were requested and enacted for FY2008 and FY2009, while OCO funds were requested and enacted for FY2012, FY2013, FY2014, and requested for FY2015. The peak years for security funding requests and funds made available were in FY2013-FY2015 following the Benghazi attacks. FY2015 had the largest request for total security funding at $4.7 billion. In FY2013 and FY2014, total security funding peaked following the Benghazi attacks. Congress provided less than requested each year except FY2009 and FY2014. FY2015 saw the largest request for total security funding at $4.7 billion, with OCO funding decreasing to one-third of the total. Total security funding peaked at $4.5 billion, including transfer authority, with the highest portion of Administration of Foreign Affairs expenditures in FY2014. Funding trended upward between FY2008 and FY2009, declined to a low in FY2011, and remained flat in FY2012. Congress provided increased security funding in FY2013, following the diminishing role of the U.S. military in Iraq and increasing security needs in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In FY2013, Congress increased security funding following the Benghazi attacks and the troops leaving Iraq in 2011. Funding peaked in FY2013 with more OCO funds for WSP than WSU. FY2014 saw an increase in enduring funds while OCO declined. FY2015 requested more OCO funds compared to FY2014. Some observers question the increased use of OCO funds, possibly to avoid exceeding spending caps. Administration requests for diplomatic/embassy security exceeded actual funding levels in most years. The largest funding gaps were in FY2011 and FY2012. Congress appropriated OCO funds for security in Iraq, not widely available for other facilities. In FY2013, transfer authority was sought to use Iraq OCO funds for WSP and WSU expenses. In FY2014, $1.419 billion of Iraq OCO funds were used for WSP and WSU expenses as part of an Increased Security Proposal. The proportion of expenditures allocated to diplomatic/embassy security varied over the years, decreasing in FY2011 and FY2012, expanding in FY2009 and FY2013-FY2014 following the Benghazi attack. Budget analysts consider enacted funding levels as reflecting Congress's intent more closely than actual funding levels. The diplomatic/embassy security budget includes Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU) as key line-items. Funding levels for WSP and WSU from FY2008-FY2014 varied, with FY2014 being the only year where enacted levels exceeded the requested levels. In FY2013, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton requested transfer authority for $1.4 billion of OCO funds following the Benghazi attacks. Hillary Clinton requested transfer authority from Congress for $1.4 billion of OCO funds previously appropriated for Iraq as part of an Increased Security Proposal. Congress agreed to much of the increase, but sequestration mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 caused enacted levels to be about 3% below what would have been appropriated. The total WSP and WSU funds requested from FY2008-FY2014 exceeded what Congress enacted by $220.4 million. Funding levels leading up to Benghazi were 6% less than requested, but increased by 6% in the years following the attacks. Senate-proposed security funds exceeded House-proposed levels every year except FY2008. In FY2008, House-proposed diplomatic/embassy security funding levels exceeded Administration request, Senate-proposed, or enacted levels. Appropriations from FY2008-FY2014 were consistently delayed, leading to the use of continuing resolutions to fund the government. Delayed appropriations have made planning for security needs challenging. In recent years, Congress has faced delays in approving budgets, with concerns about combining appropriations into omnibus bills. Analysts suggest passing stand-alone State-Foreign Operations legislation for better oversight. Complexities surrounding security funds for Benghazi include the facility's temporary designation and available funding timing. The Benghazi facility's temporary designation led to a lack of security standards and resources, with no process in place to re-evaluate security for facilities used longer than anticipated. The Benghazi facility, initially planned to close in 2011, had its mission extended until December 2012. Security upgrades were noted as necessary but not funded for temporary facilities, leading to confusion over security funding eligibility. The Benghazi facility's eligibility for security funding under WSU funding was unclear. State Department officials stated that the facility would have been eligible for the Compound Security Program. WSU funding covers security upgrades for permanent structures, not temporary ones. The Benghazi facilities were considered permanent. OBO did not receive any requests to use WSU funding for a security upgrade in Benghazi. Funding availability in FY2012 was confirmed by the Department of State. In FY2012, funding for Benghazi facilities came from ESCM appropriations, with WSP funds used for security enhancements. Delayed appropriations affected security upgrades, limiting funds to 80% of the previous year's level. Continuing Resolutions hindered security improvement efforts in Benghazi. In FY2012, funding for Benghazi facilities came from ESCM appropriations, with WSP funds used for security enhancements. Security funds for Benghazi had to be taken 'out of hide' from funding levels for Libya due to a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act."
