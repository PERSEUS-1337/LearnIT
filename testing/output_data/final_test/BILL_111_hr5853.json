    "content": "The \"Fiscal Responsibility and Retirement Security Act\" may be cited as the short title. The Act includes a review and approval process for the designation of class independence benefit plans. Title XXXII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, now requires approval by law for the designation of the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan by the Secretary. No premiums can be collected unless a joint resolution is enacted by Congress. Title XXXII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, now requires approval by law for the designation of the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan by the Secretary. No premiums can be collected unless a joint resolution is enacted by Congress. The new section added states the requirements for approval by law for the designation of the plan by the Secretary. SEC. 3211 outlines the procedural requirements for approval by law of the designation of the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan. For approval of the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan, reports from the Secretary and Chief Actuary of CMS must be received by the Senate or House at least 60 days prior to consideration. The Chief Actuary of CMS must submit a report to Congress on the long-term actuarial soundness of the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan, including estimates of average premiums and benefits per enrollee over a 75-year period. Congress approves the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Public Health Service Act. This approval is part of the rulemaking power of each House and supersedes other rules if inconsistent. Congress approves the CLASS Independence Benefit Plan under the Public Health Service Act, with recognition of each House's constitutional right to change rules related to their procedures. SEC. 3. REQUIRED NOTICE PRIOR TO ENROLLMENT. Section 3204(a) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, requires employers to provide employees with specific statements before enrolling them in the CLASS program. The Secretary must provide specific statements to individuals seeking to enroll in the CLASS program outside of employer enrollment, and the individual must acknowledge receipt of these statements in writing. The Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assessed the CLASS program in April 2010, stating that voluntary insurance programs like CLASS are at risk of failure due to adverse selection by participants. Individuals with health issues or higher risk of functional limitations are more likely to participate, posing a serious risk of adverse selection for the program. The Chief Actuary estimated in April 2010 that the CLASS program will likely run deficits starting in 2025, requiring an average premium of $240 per month. The Federal Government is expected to collect over $70 billion in program premiums from 2012 to 2019. The CLASS program premiums are used for other Government expenses, workers and retirees may need to repay IOUs in the form of higher taxes. There is no separate pool of money set aside for CLASS program benefits. The CLASS program will terminate immediately if an annual report indicates it will not be actuarially sound over a 75-year period. Section 3208(c) of the Public Health Service Act is amended to state that no premiums can be collected from an individual's wages under section 3204(e) until final regulations are promulgated by the Secretary. This includes regulations described in sections 3202(6)(C), 3203(a)(3), and paragraph (1). SEC. 3212. TERMINATION OF PROGRAM IF CLASS INDEPENDENCE FUND ACTUARIALLY UNSOUND. This section addresses the termination of the program if the Class Independence Fund is found to be actuarially unsound. If the Board of Trustees of the CLASS Independence Fund submits a report on the actuarial unsoundness of the fund to Congress, enrollment in the CLASS program will cease, premiums will no longer be collected, benefits will not be provided, and any remaining funds will be refunded according to a specified process. The CLASS Independence Fund and its Board of Trustees will be abolished upon notification of actuarial unsoundness. The CLASS Independence Advisory Council will also be abolished. The Secretary will take necessary steps to terminate the CLASS program and provide quarterly reports on the termination process to Congress. The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services will submit quarterly reports to Congress on the termination of the CLASS program, including any waste, fraud, or abuse, until the program is completely terminated. The report of unsoundness will indicate projected issues with the CLASS Independence Fund. The CLASS Independence Fund is projected to be actuarially unsound over a 75-year period. The Secretary will refund individuals enrolled in the program an amount equal to the difference between their paid premiums and benefits received. The Secretary will refund individuals enrolled in the CLASS program an amount equal to the difference between their paid premiums and benefits received, even if the CLASS Independence Fund has insufficient funds. The CLASS Independence Fund will refund individuals based on their contributions, with any excess funds transferred to the Treasury. Enrollees can still use remaining funds in their Life Independence Accounts after the program's termination. Enrollees with remaining funds in their Life Independence Accounts can continue to use the funds for specified purposes even after the program's termination. SEC. 6. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.
