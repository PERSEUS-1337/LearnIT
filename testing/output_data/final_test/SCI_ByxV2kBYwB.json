The approach involves treating a classifier trained on synthetic examples as a \"student\" and one trained on real examples as a \"teacher\". Knowledge distillation is introduced to encourage the generative model to produce examples that help the student mimic the teacher's behavior. Progressive distillation is proposed to bridge the gap between student and teacher classifiers. This model-agnostic approach is demonstrated in the research. Generative models like GANs and VAEs can create high-quality images but struggle in discriminative visual tasks. A model-agnostic distillation approach is used to improve few-shot learning on benchmarks like miniImageNet and ImageNet1K. The performance of classifiers trained on synthetic images is inferior to those trained on real images. This paper focuses on building generative models for recognition tasks to help improve classification algorithms. This approach is beneficial for addressing data scarcity in scenarios like few-shot learning. The key insight is to synthesize examples that recover or stabilize classifier decision boundaries learned from real samples. In a 2-way 2-shot classification problem, the goal is to learn a classifier that distinguishes between two classes using only 2 training examples per class. Additional examples are synthesized to minimize the difference between classifiers trained on synthetic and real examples, leveraging knowledge distillation techniques. Knowledge distillation, as proposed by Hinton et al. (2015), is used on real examples to train a lightweight \"student\" model to mimic a larger \"teacher\" model. In the context of few-shot learning, the goal is to recognize two novel classes from 2 examples per class. By distilling the knowledge of a desired large-sample classifier into a generative model, additional examples can be produced from a few real examples to minimize the discrepancy between classifiers trained on synthesized and real examples. In few-shot learning, a generative model is trained to produce examples that help a smaller classifier mimic the class probabilities of a larger classifier. This is achieved through knowledge distillation and incorporated into a meta-learning framework for broad category applicability. The text discusses using a generative model to synthesize additional examples for few-shot recognition tasks on unseen categories. It proposes distilling knowledge in a progressive manner to address challenges when the student has limited real examples compared to the teacher. Progressive distillation involves strengthening the teacher with more real examples and weakening the student by removing real examples. The generative model is trained progressively to produce synthetic examples. Ensemble distillation trains multiple student-teacher pairs to reduce variance in few-shot classifiers. This method improves generative models for discriminative recognition tasks, enhancing few-shot learning performance. Generative models like GANs and VAEs can synthesize images that closely resemble natural images. They have shown potential for data augmentation in few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning tasks, but recognition performance improvement is still limited. Our work focuses on training the generator to improve recognition tasks by leveraging large amounts of auxiliary data. Meta-learning is a powerful framework for learning with limited data, with approaches falling into optimization and metric learning based methods. Meta-learning approaches can improve recognition tasks by leveraging auxiliary data. Optimization based methods focus on fast adaptation to novel tasks using memory-based architectures or few gradient descent steps. Metric learning methods aim to learn a similarity metric between examples of the same class, utilizing various distance functions and parametric metrics. Graph neural networks are introduced to consider relations between categories. Recent approaches in meta-learning often involve using graph neural networks to leverage relations between categories. To conduct meta-learning effectively, features of images are computed using a trained feature extractor network, and tasks are formulated as convex optimization problems in a low-dimensional space. Knowledge distillation, compressing models into smaller ones, is a popular technique, with recent work focusing on advanced distillation processes. Recent work focuses on advanced techniques for knowledge distillation, including applications to object detection and distributed machine learning. This study introduces knowledge distillation for learning generative models, specifically focusing on models of the same capacity trained on real or synthetic data in a few-shot learning setting. The goal is to learn a classification model for novel categories based on a small dataset, differentiating from existing work that addresses models of varying capacities. Recent work focuses on advanced techniques for knowledge distillation, including applications to object detection and distributed machine learning. This study introduces knowledge distillation for learning generative models in a few-shot learning setting. It aims to develop a classification model for novel categories based on a small dataset by leveraging a meta-learning procedure that uses a variant of prototypical networks with cosine distance function. In each iteration, a prototype representation is computed for each class in L using an embedding function. The prototype of a class is the mean output of examples from that class in S train. During meta-testing, a previously meta-learned classifier is used for a unique M-way k-shot task with C novel and D novel. Incorporating a generative model for data augmentation has been shown to facilitate meta-learning. The model T is built from a set S teacher with real examples, and knowledge distillation loss is computed over the test set Stest. The feature generator G(x, z, q; w) produces examples in a pre-trained feature space, with q as the mean of examples from the category of x. The generator G produces synthetic examples in the same category as x by using a mean q from available examples. Meta-learning is integrated with G, where during each iteration of meta-training, the support set is augmented with a generated set. The final training set includes both the original support set and the generated set, allowing for back-propagation of gradients to produce useful synthetic examples. During meta-training, the generator learns to capture shared modes of variation across categories and can generalize to unseen categories. The end-to-end optimization enables the generator to synthesize examples that contribute to classifier decision boundaries. However, the resulting classifier may still be far from the desired one due to the small support set used for generating synthetic examples. Closing the gap between these classifiers is crucial, especially since a large amount of annotated examples are available for the base categories during meta-training. During meta-training, the generator learns to capture shared modes of variation across categories and can generalize to unseen categories. The goal is to minimize the discrepancy between the student model trained on synthetic examples and support examples, and the teacher model trained on real examples. Inspired by knowledge distillation, the student mimics the distribution of class probabilities predicted by the teacher. The generator is meta-trained to mimic the teacher model's class probabilities. During meta-training, a teacher classifier is trained on a large set of examples, and a student classifier is trained on augmented examples using a generator. The student model is trained using a knowledge distillation loss function that includes a cross-entropy loss and a component measuring the difference between student and teacher outputs. The goal is to balance the two terms using a trade-off hyper-parameter, with temperature being a critical learnable parameter. The distillation process in meta-learning involves using a teacher classifier trained on a large set of examples and a student classifier trained on few real examples. The goal is to guide the generator towards synthesizing examples that help the student recover the decision boundary from the teacher in a progressive manner. Progressive distillation in meta-learning involves gradually increasing the number of real examples for the teacher classifier while the student classifier remains with few examples. The generator learns to generate additional examples to match the teacher's performance as it becomes stronger with more samples during training. During meta-training, the support set for few-shot tasks gradually increases in size for the teacher classifier, while the student classifier retains a small number of examples. The generator learns to generate missing examples for the student based on the remaining real examples, allowing the student to maintain performance as the teacher becomes stronger. During meta-training, the student classifier learns to preserve the original decision boundary formulated by the teacher classifier using a decreasing number of examples per class in the support set. Ensemble learning is introduced to benefit from diverse teachers by training several generative models independently guided by different teachers. Starting with a higher number of examples per class works as well as starting with lower values empirically. During meta-training, multiple teachers are used to train students and generators with a diverse collection of generators. The final label prediction is the average of student predictions. Ensemble learning reduces variance in few-shot student classifiers. Experiments evaluate meta-learning with knowledge distillation on few-shot tasks and its effect on generative modeling. The focus is on a cosine classifier known for competitive few-shot performance. The study explores different variants of a cosine classifier for few-shot learning on miniImageNet and ImageNet1K datasets. The ImageNet1K dataset contains 389 base categories and 611 novel categories, with evaluations done in 311-way settings. The approach involves training a feature extractor first and then evaluating the performance in various shot settings. In the study, different variants of a cosine classifier are explored for few-shot learning on miniImageNet and ImageNet1K datasets. Pre-trained features from ResNet-10 are used with either a standard linear classifier or a cosine distance based classifier. Evaluation is done using mean top-5 accuracies under different protocols depending on the set of pre-trained features. The protocol used depends on whether features are from Hariharan & Girshick or Gidaris & Komodakis. An ensemble of models with mixed features is compared against baselines and concurrent work in few-shot learning. Various distillation approaches are compared with pre-trained features, including cosine classifier and attention weight generator. Results are summarized in Table 1. The results show that the approach outperforms baselines in recognition accuracy on the ImageNet1K benchmark. A simple cosine classifier achieves superior performance compared to more complex models. Future research could explore combining this approach with other classification models for further improvement. The performance gain and impact of different components and design choices were analyzed through a series of ablations. The generator reconciles conflicts between pre-trained features and the final recognition classifier, significantly boosting performance. Progressive distillation techniques, such as strengthening the teacher or weakening the student, have shown to outperform normal distillation methods. Weakening the student has been found to achieve better results, as starting with both teacher and student being weak can make the learning problem harder. Top-5 accuracy comparison on ImageNet1K 311-way, k-shot classification shows the effectiveness of progressive distillation in improving performance. The study compares different distillation techniques for improving performance in k-shot classification tasks. Results show that weakening the student model initially can lead to better outcomes. Progressive distillation methods, such as strengthening the teacher, have been found to outperform traditional distillation approaches. The study reports accuracy results for various models, including Logistic regression and Matching Nets. The study compares distillation techniques for k-shot classification tasks, finding that using a logarithmic scale for training performs better. Ensemble learning with multiple teachers outperforms a single super teacher. Performance boost comes from diversity of teacher classification networks. Training an ensemble with diverse feature extractors can further improve performance in k-shot classification tasks. The study uses the miniImageNet dataset with 100 classes and evaluates in 5-way, 1-shot, and 5-way, 5-shot settings. A ResNet18 feature extractor trained with the 'baseline' method is utilized. Results show that progressive distillation improves performance on ImageNet1k and miniImageNet, especially when the gap between student and teacher is large. The generator also enhances performance when trained with additional validation data. Various methods like Matching Networks, MAML, Prototypical Networks, Relation Networks, and R2D2 are compared for k-shot classification tasks. The study compares different methods for k-shot classification tasks, including Relation Networks, R2D2, Transductive Prop Nets, SNAIL, Dynamic Few-shot, AdaResNet, TADAM, Activation to Parameter, and LEO. Visualization with t-SNE shows the evolution of the decision boundary for novel classes during metatraining the generator through progressive distillation. In this study, a general framework of meta-learning with knowledge distillation is introduced to guide the learning of generative models for discriminative recognition tasks, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios with limited data. The evolution of the decision boundary for novel classes during progressive distillation is visualized using t-SNE, along with the synthesis of examples in pixel space. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on miniImageNet and ImageNet1K few-shot classification datasets by distilling knowledge from diverse teachers. Implementation details of the distillation procedure and evaluation on ImageNet1k and miniImageNet benchmarks are provided. The embedding function of our cosine classifier varies based on pre-trained features used, with the student model having a 2-layer fully-connected network and the teacher model using a simple linear layer embedding. Distillation is challenging when there is a large difference between teacher and student, and reducing the capacity of the embedding helps in this process. Reducing the capacity of the embedding helps bridge the gap between teacher and student models during distillation. However, adding an embedding function is not beneficial when using pre-trained features from a cosine distance classifier. Progressive distillation involves weakening the student by decreasing the teacher capacity logarithmically over iterations. Parameters such as temperature, scale factor, and \u03b3 are adjusted during training. The student model is saved after each training iteration. During distillation, parameters like \u03b3 are adjusted and the student model is saved after each training iteration. For testing, different models are used based on the value of k. Distillation with ensemble involves learning 12 pairs of student and teacher, but increasing this number does not improve performance. The ImageNet1k dataset has about 1000 examples per class, with 12 teachers built on 256 randomly sampled examples per class. Fewshot learning on miniImageNet is easier than on ImageNet1k, and using an embedding function leads to overfitting. Progressive distillation weakens the student by decreasing teacher capacity logarithmically over iterations. During progressive distillation, the teacher model is trained with decreasing capacity from 128 to 1 in a logarithmic scale over 6000 iterations. The temperature is initialized to 7, cosine distance scale factor to 150, and \u03b3 to 5. Distillation with ensemble involves learning 20 pairs of student and teacher."
