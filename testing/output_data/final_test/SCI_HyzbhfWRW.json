    "content": "We propose an attention module for CNN architectures in image classification. The module enhances relevant features and suppresses irrelevant ones, improving classification accuracy. The proposed attention module enhances relevant features in CNN architectures for image classification, leading to superior generalization over unseen datasets and outperforming other attention maps in weakly supervised segmentation. It also shows improved robustness against adversarial attacks. The attention map in CNNs represents the importance of layer activations for the target task. It helps locate objects, segment them, and identify visual properties. Mimicking attention maps of larger networks can improve classification accuracy in smaller networks. Integrated attention mechanisms have been proposed to improve classification accuracy in smaller networks by learning parameters over the course of end-to-end training. These mechanisms have shown benefits in various applications such as attribute prediction, machine translation, image captioning, and visual question answering. The novelty lies in representing attention as a probabilistic map over input image locations and implementing its estimation via an end-to-end framework. The contribution focuses on repurposing global image representation as a query to estimate multi-scale attention in classification. By defining a compatibility measure between local and global features, standard architectures are redesigned to classify input images using a weighted combination of local features represented by an attention map. This forces the network to learn a relevant pattern of attention for the task at hand. The proposed attention mechanism enhances CNN architectures like VGGNet and ResNet for image classification, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Attention-aware models show resistance to adversarial fooling and outperform other attention maps and saliency maps in weakly supervised tasks. In the context of enhancing CNN architectures for image classification, attention mechanisms have shown improvements in weakly supervised segmentation tasks by highlighting the object of interest and suppressing background clutter. Two main schemes for implementing attention in CNNs are post hoc network analysis and trainable attention mechanisms, with the former being predominantly used for visual object recognition tasks. These schemes interpret the gradient of a class output score with respect to the input image as the class's spatial support in the image domain, known as an attention map. Attention mechanisms in CNNs have shown improvements in weakly supervised segmentation tasks by highlighting the object of interest and suppressing background clutter. Methods have explored optimizing the weights of the attention unit along with the original network weights. Trainable attention in CNNs falls under two main categories - hard (stochastic) and soft (deterministic). The soft-attention method in CNNs is probabilistic and trainable by backpropagation, while the hard-attention method relies on non-differentiable techniques. The BID19 method improves upon soft-attention by using nonuniform non-rigid attention maps for better object shape representation in images. This approach is being explored in the current work. In our current work, we explore trainable soft attention in CNNs for guiding desired inference by highlighting relevant parts of input images. We compare our approach to the progressive attention method for attribute prediction, noting differences in the use of category labels and sequential mechanism. The current work explores the use of attention in CNNs to handle domain shift and weakly supervised semantic segmentation, focusing on relevant parts of input images for fine-grained recognition. This approach aims to better adapt to changes in background content, occlusion, and object pose variation. Our work utilizes category labels for soft-attention, without explicit training for segmentation with pixel-level annotations. We evaluate spatial attention maps for object segmentation. Adversarial robustness is explored by identifying and masking likely adversarial feature dimensions. The study focuses on enhancing adversarial robustness in CNNs by identifying and suppressing adversarial feature dimensions through spatial suppression. The goal is to use attention maps to highlight important image regions and suppress irrelevant information to improve generalization over different data distributions. A trainable attention estimator is proposed to integrate into CNN pipelines for influencing their output. The study aims to enhance adversarial robustness in CNNs by using attention maps to highlight important image regions and suppress irrelevant information. This is achieved by integrating a trainable attention estimator into CNN pipelines to influence their output. The method involves enforcing compatibility between local feature vectors and the global feature vector in the CNN pipeline, leading to attention-aware classification. The proposed method enhances adversarial robustness in CNNs by integrating a trainable attention estimator into the pipeline. It enforces compatibility between local and global feature vectors using a compatibility function, leading to attention-aware classification. The method enhances adversarial robustness in CNNs by integrating a trainable attention estimator. It computes compatibility scores for layers and uses global vectors for class prediction probabilities. Different options are compared for multiple layers, and all network parameters are learned through end-to-end training. The compatibility score function can be defined in various ways. The alignment model from BID1 can be repurposed as a compatibility function by simplifying the concatenation of local and global image descriptors to an addition operation. This limits the parameters of the attention unit and allows for learning a fully connected mapping to compatibility scores. The weight vector u learns features relevant to object categories, while the dot product between g and s i measures their compatibility based on alignment in high-dimensional features. Our method encourages filters in the CNN to learn mappings compatible with the global image descriptor g, allowing local descriptors to contribute to classification based on compatibility with g. The method proposes using attention over different spatial resolutions to facilitate learning diverse and complementary features in CNN layers. Attention units are deployed after convolutional blocks late in the pipeline but before maxpooling operations to maintain spatial resolution. The use of the softmax function normalizes compatibility scores. The method incorporates attention into the VGG network by moving max-pooling layers after additional convolutional layers to maintain spatial resolution. The modified model has 17 layers, with the output activations defining a global feature vector. The global feature vector g is defined by the output activations of layer-16 (fc). Local feature maps from layers 7, 10, and 13 (convolutional) are used for attention estimation. The approach is compared with other attention methods. The network architecture includes a 164-layered network with modifications for obtaining the global feature g. The local descriptors for attention are derived from the outputs of blocks 2, 3, and 4. If the dimensionality of g and local features differ, g is projected to the lower-dimensional space of local features to limit parameters at the classification stage. The global feature vector g is shared by local features from different layers in the network. Different levels of attention are denoted as Net-att, Net-att2, and Net-att3. The use of dot product and parametrised compatibility is denoted by dp and pc. Concatenation of descriptors from different levels is used for final classification. The benefits of attention in CNNs for image classification and object recognition are evaluated, along with robustness. The study evaluates the benefits of attention in CNNs for image classification, object recognition, and fine-grained category recognition. Attention maps from VGG-att2 are compared with activation-based attention maps. The proposed attention mechanism in the VGG architecture shows noticeable improvements in focusing on specific object regions for different tasks. The proposed attention mechanism in the VGG architecture improves performance for visual recognition tasks, achieving significant improvements over baseline models. The attention mechanism allows the network to focus on the object of interest while suppressing background regions, leading to specialized focus on different object parts for fine-grained recognition tasks. The networks are pre-trained on CIFAR-100, showing comparable results to models pre-trained on ImageNet but at a lower training cost. Our networks, despite increased parameters from attention units, generalize well to the test set. Compared to PAN BID19, we improve by 4.5%. Introducing the same attention mechanism into RNs results in a slight performance drop on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Skip-connections in RNs may work similarly to the proposed attention mechanism, allowing select features to influence inference. The attention mechanism in the network provides explicit attention maps for tasks like weakly supervised segmentation. By changing the query vector, the predicted attention pattern can be influenced. The fooling rate of attention-aware VGG is 5% less than the baseline VGG with an L \u221e noise norm of 1, but as the noise norm increases, the performance gap gradually decreases. The fooling rate saturates for the two networks as the noise becomes perceptible, with VGG-att2 outperforming VGG by around a percentage point. Cross-domain classification using CIFAR images shows attention-aware models consistently improving over baseline models by an average margin of 6%. Training on low-resolution CIFAR images transfers useful visual properties to high-resolution images. The Event-8 dataset consists of 600 \u00d7 600 images. Training for diversity is more effective, as shown in CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Models trained on CIFAR-100 have more diverse attention maps compared to CIFAR-10 models. Attention maps at lower levels focus on specific details. The attention maps in the study focus on part details and whole objects, with a comparison of different methods showing superior performance in weakly supervised segmentation. The proposed attention maps outperform existing methods by a significant margin. The study proposes a trainable attention module for generating probabilistic landscapes that highlight where a network focuses on different regions of an image for classification. It outperforms saliency-based methods in the car category but performs less well for airplane and horse categories due to their detailed structure and smaller size. The method shows significant performance gains in classification of seen and unseen categories by focusing on the object of interest. The proposed attention module generates probabilistic landscapes to highlight where a network focuses on different image regions for classification. It improves classification performance for seen and unseen categories, facilitates weakly supervised segmentation, and shows promise in robustness to adversarial attacks. The attention models are evaluated on various datasets for classification tasks and tested for robustness to adversarial attacks. The dataset used for evaluating weakly supervised segmentation performance includes various datasets with different normalization techniques applied. The images range from simple objects to complex activities in different backgrounds. The progressive attention mechanism proposed by BID19 is experimented with as part of a 2-level network. The progressive attention mechanism proposed by BID19 is implemented in a 2-level attention-based VGG model. At the lower level, compatibility scores are used to weigh local features before being fed to the next network layer. This filtering operation is core to the progressive attention scheme. At the final level, attention is implemented similarly to VGG-att2-concat-pc, with compatibility scores normalized using softmax for image classification training. The proposed attention mechanism with the VGG architecture for image classification is implemented and evaluated using the progressive attention approach. The ResNet architecture also undergoes attention-related modifications, with the baseline implementation consisting of 4 levels projecting RGB input onto a 256-dimensional space. Each level contains n-residual blocks with convolutional layers interleaved. The ResNet architecture for image classification includes residual blocks with convolutional layers interleaved with non-linearities. The network has 9n + 2 parameterised layers for an n of 18 in a 164-layered network. Batch normalization is used, and global feature vectors are obtained through convolutional and maxpooling operations. Attention mechanisms are implemented at different levels in the network. Training routines involve using VGG networks for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN from scratch with specific optimization parameters. For CIFAR experiments, a batch size of 128, learning rate decay of 10 \u22127, weight decay of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124, and momentum of 0.9 are used. The initial learning rate is 1 for CIFAR and 0.1 for SVHN. Training lasts for 300 epochs. For CUB, the model is initialized with CIFAR-100 weights. A transfer-learning schedule is followed with varying learning rates over epochs. ResNet is trained with SGD optimizer, batch size of 64, initial learning rate of 0.1, weight decay of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124, and momentum of 0.9. Learning rate adjustments are made at specific epochs for convergence. Models for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are trained from scratch. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 experiments, models are trained from scratch using Torch on an NVIDIA Titan-X GPU. Adversarial images are generated using the fast gradient sign method, and cross-domain classification is done without finetuning the networks. ZCA whitening is applied to evaluation datasets. Weakly supervised segmentation is also evaluated. In weakly supervised segmentation, attention maps are combined from the last 2 levels using element-wise multiplication, then squared to create a probability distribution. The progressive attention mechanism involves multiplying attention maps from different levels without squaring them. Operations like rescaling and binarization are commonly applied. In weakly supervised segmentation, attention maps are combined from the last 2 levels using element-wise multiplication and squared to create a probability distribution. Operations like rescaling and binarization are commonly applied to all final attention maps. The global feature vector is used to estimate attention on local image regions, allowing for external control over attention patterns. Two different compatibility functions are considered in two network architectures: (VGG-att2)-concat-dp (DP) model and (VGG-att3)-concat-pc (PC) model. The study utilizes the parameterised compatibility function and the extra cosegmentation image set from the Object Discovery dataset. A query image is selected along with target images containing the same object category but with variations. Two rounds of experiments are conducted to analyze the role of the global feature vector in driving attention patterns. Global and local image feature vectors are obtained from target images, and attention patterns at layer 10 are visualized for two different network architectures. In the study, attention patterns are analyzed using global and local feature vectors from target images in two rounds of experiments. The global vector guides attention in the dot-product-based mechanism, while it appears redundant in the parameterised compatibility function mechanism. The global feature vector has little impact on attention scores, but attention maps consistently highlight object-relevant regions. Object-centric high-order features are learned in the weight vector u, adapting to the training dataset and generalizing to new images with similar object categories."
