The Gulf Coast region of the United States was devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Hurricane Katrina, a category 4 storm, made landfall on August 29 with sustained winds over 140 mph. The damage along the coastal regions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama was extensive, with a 10- to 30-foot storm surge affecting over 200 miles of coastline. Hurricane Katrina's unprecedented 30-foot storm surge in Biloxi, Mississippi breached levees in New Orleans, flooding 80% of the city. The disaster declarations covered over 90,000 square miles, displacing over 1,000,000 people, marking a crisis unseen since the Great Depression. Hurricane Rita, following Hurricane Katrina, struck the Gulf Coast as a category 3 hurricane with winds up to 120 mph and a 10-foot storm surge. It reopened levee breaches in New Orleans, causing further flooding. Local storm surges of 15 to 20 feet in southwestern Louisiana caused extensive damage in coastal parishes. Thousands of residents outside the 100-year flood plain, who were advised against flood insurance, now face significant home damage or total losses. These families lack permanent shelter, impacting the Gulf Coast region and its economy. The Federal Government should provide emergency assistance due to the unprecedented magnitude of the storm's devastation. The Federal Government should provide emergency assistance to families impacted by storm surges in southwestern Louisiana to help them rebuild and move forward. SEC. 425 of the Robert T.
