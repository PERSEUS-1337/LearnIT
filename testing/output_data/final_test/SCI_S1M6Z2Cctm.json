    "content": "The paper introduces HarmonicGAN for image-to-image translation, focusing on consistent mappings and reducing artifacts. It utilizes a smoothness term over a sample graph to enforce harmonic functions, maintaining self-consistency through similarity-consistency. HarmonicGAN shows significant improvements over existing methods like CycleGAN, without additional manual inputs, by leveraging distance metrics on histogram and CNN features. HarmonicGAN outperforms existing methods like CycleGAN in various applications, including medical imaging, object transfiguration, and semantic labeling. It significantly improves qualitative and quantitative results, turning CycleGAN from a failure to a success in a medical imaging task. Image-to-image translation is a challenging task in computer vision with applications in image synthesis, medical image generation, and domain adaptation. Image-to-image translation can be approached as a regression problem using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) with pixel-to-pixel correspondences between source and target images. Generative Adaptive Networks (GANs) have been successful in providing additional image-level feedback for translation quality. However, the need for paired training data is a limitation, leading to the proposal of circularity-based approaches for translation without paired data. Circularity-based approaches like CycleGAN have been proposed for image-to-image translation tasks, allowing for unsupervised translation without paired data. By using a cycled regression for pixel-level prediction and adversarial supervision at the image-level, CycleGAN can successfully train translation models in many cases. However, there is a lack of mechanism to enforce regularity in the translation process. In this paper, the problem of unpaired image-to-image translation is addressed from a manifold learning perspective. Introducing a regularization term in the translation encourages similar contents in the same image to undergo similar transformations, preserving local distances in the process. This principle has been applied in graph-based semisupervised learning as well. During unpaired image-to-image translation, domain-specific attributes like colors and textures are altered without supervised information. To maintain consistency, smoothness terms inspired by graph-based semi-supervised learning are introduced to regulate the transformation between source and target domains. This aims to exploit the \"manifold structure\" of the domains by minimizing the distance between corresponding locations in the target image for similar samples. HarmonicGAN algorithm utilizes distance metrics on alternative features to learn dual translations between source and target domains. It outperforms existing methods in various applications, including a medical imaging task where it significantly improves upon CycleGAN's performance. HarmonicGAN method improves upon CycleGAN, reducing mean-squared error and producing preferred images by radiologists in 95% of cases. It introduces smooth regularization for image-to-image translation, utilizes alternative feature measures for weight matrix computation, and demonstrates improved consistency for transformations. Experiments show that HarmonicGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple translation tasks. Prior works like image analogies and exemplar-based methods aim at similar goals. Image-to-image translation frameworks require paired training data, which can be laborious to obtain. Unpaired frameworks like CycleGAN remove the need for detailed supervision by enforcing bi-directional prediction and adversarial penalties. HarmonicGAN is proposed as an improvement to CycleGAN for unsupervised image translation, addressing issues such as artifacts and unexpected results. HarmonicGAN introduces a smoothness term into the CycleGAN framework to enforce regularized translation, aiming to make the translation harmonic by adding additional regularization. The smoothness term acts as a graph Laplacian imposed on all pairs of samples, differentiating it from DistanceGAN in motivation, formulation, implementation, and performance. The smoothness term in HarmonicGAN acts as a graph Laplacian on sample pairs, enhancing CycleGAN performance by reducing artifacts. It differs from DistanceGAN and Conditional Random Fields in output space, formulation, application domain, and effectiveness. In CycleGAN, unpaired training samples are used for image-to-image translation with dual mappings G and F, along with discriminators D_X and D_Y to distinguish real and generated images. Adversarial constraints are applied in both source and target domains to improve the overall algorithm. In CycleGAN, unpaired training samples are used for image-to-image translation with dual mappings G and F, along with discriminators D_X and D_Y to distinguish real and generated images. A circularity constraint is introduced to establish relationships between X and Y, enforcing that G and F are inverse mappings. The circularity constraint contains consistencies in the forward cycle, formulated with weights \u03bb GAN and \u03bb cyc to control the importance of corresponding objectives. The full objective of the circularity-based approach includes adversarial constraints and the circularity constraint to ensure generated samples are in the distribution of the source or target domain. The proposed smoothness term in CycleGAN enforces a stronger correlation between source and target domains by focusing on similarity-consistency between image patches during translation. It defines a graph Laplacian with minimal value achieved as a harmonic function, where individual image patches are nodes in the graph. The smoothness term in CycleGAN enforces correlation between source and target domains by focusing on similarity-consistency between image patches during translation. It defines a graph Laplacian with image patches as nodes, using affinity measures to compute edges on the graph. The features are normalized to [0,1] and L1 distance is used as the Dist function. A smoothness term is defined for the backward part to ensure similarity-consistency between patches. The overall objective of HarmonicGAN under the smoothness constraint is similar to graph-based semi-supervised learning. The optimization process leads to a harmonic function, preserving local neighborhood structure. HarmonicGAN preserves local neighborhood structure, while CycleGAN separates similar patches after translation. The smoothness constraint measures patch similarity using low-level soft histogram and VGG features. A weight matrix is designed based on RGB histograms, ensuring gradient computability. The soft histogram representation is differentiable and its gradient is utilized for end-to-end learning. The soft histogram function in the RGB space uses linear basis functions to represent pixel values, with each pixel voting for a specific bin. This representation results in a B-dimensional vector for each patch in the image domain X. In some cases, semantic features are used instead of RGB histograms to capture higher-level patch representations. The semantic features extracted from a pre-trained CNN encode relevant information from local image patches, allowing for higher-level patch representations. These features are differentiable and can be integrated into HarmonicGAN for end-to-end training. The method is evaluated in medical imaging, semantic labeling, and object transfiguration applications. In medical imaging, the task involves cross-modal medical image synthesis, specifically Flair \u2194 T1 on the BRATS dataset BID26. The models are trained on paired MRI data for evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of image reconstruction quality using SSIM and semantic labeling on various tasks like labels \u2194 photos and horse \u2194 zebra. Quantitative evaluation metrics include FCN score, per-pixel accuracy, per-class accuracy, and mean class IOU. A user study is conducted for the horse \u2194 zebra task due to the lack of quantitative measures. The study applies a smoothness term to CycleGAN for image transformation. The architecture includes BID16 as the generator and PatchGAN BID15 as the discriminator. Input images are resized to 256 \u00d7 256, with histogram and semantic features extracted. Loss weights are set, and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 is used. The study applies a smoothness term to CycleGAN for medical image synthesis, showing significant improvement over CycleGAN with lower MAE and MSE reconstruction losses, and higher PSNR and SSIM scores. HarmonicGAN based on histogram and VGG features also performs well, indicating the importance of both low-level RGB values and high-level CNN features in maintaining smoothness-consistency in medical images. The proposed method using VGG features outperforms all competing methods in semantic labeling on the BRATS dataset, showing a 3% improvement in Pixel Accuracy for photo \u2194 label translation scores. However, the performance using a histogram is slightly lower than CycleGAN, possibly due to the large intra-class variance and inter-class similarity in appearance of objects in photos. Randomly selected images from the BRATS test set were evaluated by one radiologist, comparing real ground truth images with those generated by CycleGAN, DistanceGAN, and HarmonicGAN. The radiologist preferred images generated by the proposed method over CycleGAN, DistanceGAN, and HarmonicGAN in 95% of cases, with an average Likert score of 4.00 compared to 1.68 for CycleGAN. This confirms that the generated images are significantly better and address issues with CycleGAN identified in a recent paper. Additionally, object transfiguration was evaluated on horse \u2194 zebra with positive results from a human perceptual study. The human perceptual study involved 50 images from the horse2zebra test set, with participants scoring images from CycleGAN, DistanceGAN, and HarmonicGAN. The proposed method received the highest scores in 72% of cases, outperforming CycleGAN and DistanceGAN. Qualitative comparisons show improvements in background changes and transformations compared to CycleGAN. Additional results and analysis are presented in figures. The study introduced a smoothness term over the sample graph to enforce consistency in image-to-image translation. Additional regularization was used to maintain self-consistency, resulting in significant improvements over current methods in medical imaging, object transfiguration, and semantic labeling. The method showed a notable enhancement over CycleGAN in medical imaging tasks. The smoothness constraint in DistanceGAN is based on a graph Laplacian to ensure similarity-consistency between image patches. It uses affinity between patches as weights to measure similarity, achieving a minimal value as a harmonic function. In contrast, HarmonicGAN computes the smoothness constraint on image patches, while DistanceGAN computes the distance constraint on whole image samples. The smoothness constraint in HarmonicGAN is measured on features of each patch, mapping samples from two domains into the same feature space. In contrast, DistanceGAN computes the distance constraint on whole image samples, scaling distances with precomputed means and stds to reduce domain gap. HarmonicGAN corrects tumor location issues seen in CycleGAN and DistanceGAN results, as shown in qualitative results on the BRATS dataset. HarmonicGAN corrects tumor location issues, yielding a large improvement over CycleGAN. There are fundamental differences between CRF literature and HarmonicGAN, with similarities in the adoption of a regularization term. The smoothness term in HarmonicGAN preserves the overall integrity of the translation for the image manifold, leading to its significant improvement over CycleGAN. HarmonicGAN outperforms CycleGAN due to its focus on preserving similarity in the image manifold, unlike CRF which may over-smooth boundaries and introduce artifacts. HarmonicGAN maintains image integrity and achieves better results in background regions. HarmonicGAN outperforms CycleGAN by focusing on preserving image similarity in the manifold, achieving better results in background regions. However, it still fails on the human body due to semantic features not trained on shirtless humans."
