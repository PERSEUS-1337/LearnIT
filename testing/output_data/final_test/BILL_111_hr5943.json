    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Community Recovery and Enhancement Act of 2010\" or the \"CRE Act of 2010.\" It introduces a deduction for equity investments used to reduce debt on commercial real property under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Community Recovery and Enhancement Act of 2010\" introduces a deduction for equity investments and debt reduction payments made by taxpayers in partnerships or on commercial real property. The deduction is limited to 50 percent of the qualified debt reduction amount and cannot exceed the qualified indebtedness on the property at the beginning of the taxable year. The deduction for equity investments and debt reduction payments in partnerships or on commercial real property is limited to 50 percent of the qualified debt reduction amount or the adjusted basis of the property at the end of the taxable year. Qualified debt reduction equity investment refers to the amount of qualified equity investment used. The qualified equity investment is used by the partnership to reduce the principal amount of qualified indebtedness. It must be acquired at its original issue solely in exchange for cash, with at least 80 percent of the cash used for debt reduction. The partnership uses cash for improvements to commercial real property held by the partnership, with consent from those entitled to depreciation. Redemptions follow a similar rule as section 1202(c)(3). For commercial real property held by a taxpayer, a qualified debt reduction payment is the cash amount paid during the taxable year. The taxpayer's cash payments during the taxable year to reduce qualified indebtedness, defined as debt secured by commercial real property held by a partnership before January 1, 2009, or by other taxpayers. The term 'qualified indebtedness' refers to debt reduction payments made by taxpayers on commercial real property, excluding residential rental properties with less than three dwelling units. This definition applies to depreciation adjustments under section 1250. The deduction allowed by this section for property is treated as depreciation, and depreciation adjustments include deductions for reducing debt secured by the property. Special rules include basis reduction for property with qualified debt reduction investments or payments, and refinancing of indebtedness described in subsection (d)(1)(A)(i). The deduction allowed for property under this section includes rules for reducing debt, such as debt reduction exceeding scheduled payments and denial of deduction for debt-financed investments. Additionally, any additional debt incurred within 3 years may result in recapture of the deduction. The partnership's ordinary income may increase if additional debt is incurred within 3 years of receiving a qualified debt reduction equity investment. The recaptured deduction is the excess of the deduction allowed on the investment over what would have been allowed if the investment had been reduced by its share of the additional debt. The applicable percentage for determining debt is outlined in a table. The applicable percentage for additional debt reduction equity investment is determined based on the year it occurs: 100% in the 1st year, 66 2/3% in the 2nd year, and 33 1/3% in the 3rd year. The investment's share of additional debt is calculated based on the taxpayer's qualified debt reduction equity investment compared to all taxpayers. The partnership's subsequent depreciation deductions for periods after a recaptured deduction shall be determined as if the qualified debt reduction equity investment allocable to the recaptured deduction had never been made. Similar rules apply to qualified debt reduction payments. Section 469 does not apply to the deduction allowed by this section. This section applies to qualified debt reduction equity investments and payments made after the enactment date. The section allows for reduction payments made after enactment but before January 1, 2013. Earnings and profits are affected by the deduction allowed by section 199A. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The deduction for equity investments used to buy down debt on commercial real property under Sec. 199A applies to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
