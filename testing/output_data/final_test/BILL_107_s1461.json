    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Airline Passenger Safety Enhancement Act of 2001\". Congress finds that airport security screening in the United States is the responsibility of airlines, with over 18,000 security personnel employed by private companies under contract. These personnel are paid low wages with minimal benefits, leading to high turnover rates, as high as 416 percent in some cases. Other countries have lower turnover rates for airport screening personnel. The General Accounting Office has found high turnover rates for airport screening personnel, with some countries having rates less than 50 percent. Insufficient security precautions are being taken at airport entrances and checkpoints, leading to vulnerabilities. Investigators have gained access to secure areas of US airports without proper credentials in 68 percent of tests, boarding aircraft unchallenged 117 times. The General Accounting Office found that undercover agents penetrated US commercial airports with fake credentials, allowing them to potentially bring dangerous materials into restricted areas. SEC. 3. AIRPORT SECURITY STUDY. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration is required to conduct a study on organizing and carrying out security functions at airports in the United States to ensure passenger and worker safety. A comprehensive plan for airport security must be developed, taking into account the study results. A report on the study findings and the security plan must be submitted to Congress, including any legislative recommendations deemed necessary. The Administrator must complete the study and security plan within 30 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. SCREENING OF AIR PASSENGERS AND PROPERTY BY FAA.

A fee for security operations is imposed, capped at $1.00 per domestic flight segment, with collected amounts available for sections 44901 and 44939 of the title. The Federal Aviation Administration will develop a plan to support small- to medium-size airports in enhancing security operations and provide financial assistance for security enhancements."
