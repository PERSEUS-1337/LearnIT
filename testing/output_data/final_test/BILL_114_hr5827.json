    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Determination of Russia-Iran Weapons Transfer Act of 2016\". The S-300 surface-to-air missile defense system, with a range of 120 miles, enhances Iran's military capabilities and poses challenges for the US in preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon. Iran acquired the system from Russia after agreeing to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. Russia plans to deliver four systems to Iran by the end of 2016. Russia is set to deliver S-300 missile defense systems to Iran by the end of 2016 as part of an $800 million contract signed in 2007. The US has expressed objections to this sale, citing concerns about adding tensions in the region and violating non-proliferation goals. Congress believes that selling advanced integrated air defense systems to Iran is destabilizing. Sanctions may be imposed for such sales. The President must notify Congress within 15 days of any sale or transfer of advanced integrated air defense systems to Iran. Within 30 days of notification, the President must determine if sanctions should be imposed.

The Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992, and Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act are specified provisions of law.
