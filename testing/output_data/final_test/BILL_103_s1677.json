    "content": "The Act of 1993 is titled the \"Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers Act\" and includes findings related to arms transfers. The Congress finds that approximately 40 million people died in wars during the cold war, showing that conventional weapons can be weapons of mass destruction. Conflict has increased post-cold war, with 26 wars in 1992. War is a human tragedy and economic disaster affecting the world, including the US economy. International trade in conventional weapons increases the risk of war, creating more costs than benefits for the US economy. The United States aims to reduce global military spending, especially in developing countries, to enhance national security and economic interests. The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is seen as a crucial tool to control the supply of weapons and assess foreign governments' eligibility for military assistance. The United States supplies a significant amount of conventional weapons to developing countries, totaling $15.6 billion annually since the end of the cold war. Most arms transfers are to undemocratic governments, limiting citizens' ability to change their government peacefully.

The US is the world's primary seller of conventional weapons, contributing to global conflicts. The United States has a constitutional responsibility to participate in decisions regarding military assistance and arms transfers to foreign governments. Providing such assistance to undemocratic, human rights-violating, or aggressive governments should undergo higher scrutiny.

Additionally, governments must not be engaged in armed aggression and must fully participate in the UN register of conventional arms.
