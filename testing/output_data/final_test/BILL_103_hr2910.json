    "content": "The \"Risk Communication Act of 1993\" aims to provide scientifically objective information on health, safety, and environmental risks to the public and EPA officials for regulatory decisions and public education. It also emphasizes the importance of full consideration and discussion of relevant data, explanation of significant choices in risk assessment, and improving consistency within the EPA. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY; SAVINGS PROVISIONS.\n\n(a) Effective Date - Provisions take effect 2 years after enactment.\n(b) Applicability - Applies to EPA risk assessments, except in emergencies.\n(c) Savings Provisions - Does not modify health, safety, or environmental standards.\n\nSEC. 4. PRINCIPLES FOR RISK ASSESSMENT. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must apply specific principles when preparing risk assessments to ensure scientific objectivity and inclusion of all relevant data. These principles include distinguishing scientific findings from other considerations and discussing regulatory strategies. The Administrator must consider both negative and positive data of sufficient quality when assessing human health risks, including discussing possible reconciliation of conflicting information. When selecting assumptions, inferences, or models, they must present a list of alternatives, explain choices, and identify any policy judgments. The Administrator must consider both negative and positive data of sufficient quality when assessing human health risks, including discussing possible reconciliation of conflicting information. They must present a list of alternatives, explain choices, and identify any policy judgments. Additionally, the Administrator shall indicate the extent to which any significant model has been validated by or conflicts with empirical data. SEC. 5. PRINCIPLES FOR RISK CHARACTERIZATION. In characterizing risk, the Administrator must identify populations or natural resources at risk and provide numerical estimates with a statement of scientific uncertainty. Plausible upper and lower bounds estimates may also be presented. The Administrator may present multiple estimates based on assumptions, inferences, or models for risk assessment. Exposure scenarios, population at risk, and comparisons with other risks should be explained. When conducting risk characterization for regulatory actions, it must include a statement on known substitution risks. If a commenter provides a risk assessment consistent with guidelines, the Administrator must present the results alongside the EPA's assessment or regulation during the public comment period. SEC. 6. GUIDANCE, PLAN FOR ASSESSING NEW INFORMATION, AND REPORT. Within 18 months of enactment, the Administrator will issue guidance on risk assessment principles and a format for summarizing results. The guidance will cover interspecies scaling factors, dose-response models, thresholds, maximum tolerated dose definitions, and more. Within 2 years, a plan will be published to review and revise any risks. The Administrator will publish a plan to review and revise risk assessments based on new information. Within 3 years, a report evaluating policy judgments in risk assessments will be provided to Congress. The guidance, plan, and report under this section will be developed after public comment and consultation with relevant agencies and organizations. The guidance will be reviewed by the Administrator every 4 years. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"risk assessment\" as the process of identifying hazards and quantifying the degree of risk, and \"risk characterization\" as presenting the degree of risk in regulatory proposals or reports. \"Best estimate\" refers to an estimate based on central risk estimates. The term \"negative data\" refers to data showing that a substance or activity did not cause harm under certain conditions. \"Substitution risk\" is the potential increased risk to human health or the environment from a regulatory option aimed at reducing other risks."
