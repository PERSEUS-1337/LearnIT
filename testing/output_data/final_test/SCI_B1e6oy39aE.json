    "content": "This work demonstrates that invariance-inducing regularizers can enhance predictive accuracy for worst-case spatial transformations. Regularization on top of standard or adversarial training reduces relative error by 20% for CIFAR10 without increasing computational cost, outperforming handcrafted networks. Robust training also improves standard accuracy on the test set for SVHN, known for its variance in orientation."
