The Department of Defense mandates that commercial cloud vendors meet security requirements and justify discrepancies. They must undergo the same certification process as government-owned systems. In pilot demonstrations, an analysis is conducted to extend the Defense Information Network to commercial service providers for secure connections. The Defense Information Systems Agency is tasked with enabling secure connections for commercial service providers to provide services for Department of Defense impact levels 1 through 5 using logical separation. The Chief Information Officer will provide a briefing to the Committees on Armed Services regarding innovative solutions for separating customer data and supporting resources without physical separation, the considerations for equivalence to physical separation, and the benefits and challenges of hybrid solutions for cloud services within 30 days after a pilot demonstration."
