    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009. The law aims to preserve and create jobs, assist those impacted by the recession, promote economic recovery, invest in technological advances, infrastructure, and stabilize state and local government budgets. Energy provisions in the law support these goals through appropriations and tax incentives. Division A of ARRA includes energy appropriations provisions, while Division B includes energy tax provisions. Highlights of ARRA funding for selected departments and agencies are provided in Table 1, with more details under \"Division A- Appropriations Provisions.\" Table 2 highlights ARRA funding for selected tax provisions, with more details under \"Division B\u2014Tax.\" The ARRA law directs $3.69 billion of the $4.24 billion provided for DOD's Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization account to be used for energy efficiency projects and facility repairs. DOD accounts for 63% of federal energy consumption and operates over 316,000 buildings and 182,000 structures worldwide. DOD's annual spending on facility energy use was over $3.4 billion in 2007, making it the largest energy consumer in the nation. The FSRM account covers expenses for maintaining DOD facilities in the US and its territories. ARRA provides $300 million for energy efficiency projects and research, with $75 million allocated to Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense-wide funding. The ARRA provides $350 million for energy research and development, including funds for improvements in energy generation, efficiency, transmission, regulation, and storage. The funding includes research and development of energy from fuel cells, wind, solar, biofuels, and other renewable sources. Additionally, ARRA provides $2.5 billion for applied research and development in various Department of Energy offices and programs. ARRA funding of $2.5 billion for applied research at DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, with $800 million for biomass energy projects and $400 million for geothermal projects. $50 million directed for R&D in information technology efficiency. House and Senate versions of H.R. 1 recommended $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion respectively. EERE programs had $1.72 billion in FY2008. ARRA also provides $3.2 billion for Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants program. The Energy Independence and Security Act established the Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants program to reduce energy use and carbon emissions at the local level. The program has eligibility requirements such as prevailing wage rates and strategic planning. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 1 recommended different funding amounts for the program. ARRA also provides funding for the DOE Weatherization Program. The DOE Weatherization Program, funded by ARRA, aims to help low-income families reduce energy bills by making homes more efficient. Eligible measures include insulation, heating equipment, windows, water heaters, and air conditioners. Income eligibility cap increased to 200% of the poverty level. Funding is allocated to states and territories, which then distribute it to local governments. The DOE Weatherization Program receives funding from ARRA to assist low-income families in making their homes more energy-efficient. Funding allocation to local governments and jurisdictions is determined by the DOE, with additional appropriations provided in FY2009. The State Energy Program (SEP) under ARRA receives $3.1 billion, with funding dependent on states implementing new building codes and pursuing utility rate decoupling. SEP grants are directed to state energy offices for renewable energy projects. The State Energy Program (SEP) under ARRA provides funding to state energy offices for renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. The decoupling problem involves utilities' reluctance to promote energy efficiency due to their profit dependence on electricity sales. Decoupling is a regulatory approach where utilities meeting conservation targets receive compensation funded by ratepayers for lost sales. Decoupling is a regulatory approach where utilities receive payments funded by ratepayers to compensate for lost sales, decoupling growth in sales from profitability. ARRA offers incentives for states to implement decoupling, with $3.05 billion in energy funds available if certain criteria are met, including the governor certifying efforts to implement decoupling rules. The governor must guarantee best efforts for decoupling and also commit to implementing new energy-efficient building codes to qualify for additional funds. The funds available for states meeting these criteria amount to $3.05 billion out of a total of $3.1 billion. Additionally, ARRA establishes a $2.0 billion program for facility funding grants to manufacturers of advanced battery components. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 and the Senate-passed version recommended different funding amounts for programs related to lithium ion batteries, hybrid electrical systems, and advanced technology vehicles. The Continuing Resolution for FY2009 provided funds to retool facilities for fuel-efficient vehicles. ARRA allocated $300 million for grants to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, with differing funding amounts in the House and Senate versions. The EPAct2005 authorized grants for alternative fuel vehicles, including buses, heavy-duty vehicles, and infrastructure support. ARRA provided $400 million for transportation electrification grants. EISA directed DOE to establish a program for electrification grants for various transportation modes, with $185 million annually authorized. ARRA also allocated $300 million for rebates to buy energy-efficient products. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized rebates for Energy Star products to lower energy bills. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $4.5 billion for grid modernization and worker training. $100 million is designated for worker training and $80 million for regional transmission. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $80 million for regional transmission planning and $10 million for developing electronic system communication standards for the smart grid. The funding is directed to projects in rural, urban, suburban, and tribal areas, with a requirement for participants to provide data to a new smart grid information clearinghouse. The federal matching fund requirement for smart grid investments is increased to 50%. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased the federal matching fund requirement for smart grid investments to 50%. ARRA also allocated $6.0 billion for a temporary program for rapid deployment of renewable energy and electric power transmission, with up to $500 million for leading edge biofuels projects. This provision is expected to leverage over $60 billion in loan guarantees for transmission grid construction supporting renewable energy projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $6.0 billion for rapid deployment of renewable energy and electric power transmission, with a 50% federal matching fund requirement for smart grid investments. Additionally, a new loan guarantee program was created to support commercial technology for transmission and renewable electricity projects. ARRA also provided $3.25 billion in new borrowing authority for the Bonneville Power Administration and $3.25 billion for the Western Area Power Administration. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 and the Senate-passed version were identical with each other and with the final law regarding the new borrowing authority for BPA and WAPA. The purpose is to support transmission system planning, operations, and construction, with funds for delivering power from renewable power plants. ARRA provides $3.4 billion for DOE's Fossil Energy R&D program, with differing recommendations from the House and Senate versions. The report allocates $1.52 billion for industrial carbon capture and energy efficiency projects, with a focus on large-scale demonstration projects. $1.0 billion is designated for fossil energy R&D programs, while $800 million is for the Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III. $50 million is for site characterization for geologic formations for CCS activities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) allocates $20 million for geologic sequestration training and research, $10 million for unspecified program activities, and $1.6 billion for the Office of Science. The majority of the $3.4 billion for fossil energy R&D is expected to be used for carbon capture and storage (CCS) activities, representing a significant increase in funding compared to previous years. The conference agreement for H.R. 1 allocates $230 million for the Office of Science, excluding $100 million for advanced scientific computing. The office conducts basic research in physical sciences, user facilities, biological and environmental science, and energy technology programs. Funding for the office was set to double over 10 years under the American Competitiveness Initiative, but actual appropriations have not met these targets. The ARRA provides $400 million for ARPA-E, with no specific guidance on allocation. The purpose of ARPA-E is to support breakthrough energy research. P.L. 110-69 established the organizational structure and purpose for ARPA-E. ARRA also provides $5.5 billion for the Federal Buildings Fund. The ARRA allocates $5.5 billion for the Federal Buildings Fund, with $4.5 billion designated for converting GSA facilities to high-performance green buildings. EISA established the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings in GSA to reduce energy use in federal buildings by 30% by 2015. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandates a 30% reduction in energy use in federal buildings by 2015. New federal buildings and renovations must cut fossil energy use by 55% by 2010 and eliminate it by 2030. The General Services Administration (GSA) is tasked with coordinating green building efforts, setting standards, promoting innovative technologies, and procuring energy-efficient vehicles for federal fleets. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provides funding for GSA to purchase hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and electric vehicles. The Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486) mandates that 75% of vehicles purchased by federal agencies must be alternative fuel vehicles. ARRA provides funding for construction activities in various agencies, including energy-efficient retrofits. Additionally, ARRA allocates funds for EPA state revolving loan funds, Clean Water State Revolving Funds, and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The enacted law allocates $2.0 billion for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. At least 20% of each fund must be used for green infrastructure, water/energy efficiency, and other water-related projects. States can use less than 20% for these projects if they lack sufficient applications, but must certify this to the Agency. A minimum of $800 million is available for the Clean Water Fund and $400 million for the Drinking Water Fund, totaling $1.2 billion for water-related uses, including energy efficiency. The ARRA allocates $300 million to EPA for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Program, authorized by EPAct2005. Grants can be used for retrofitting or replacing diesel engines in various applications. Additionally, ARRA provides $500 million for Training and Employment Services for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.

EISA added a new section to the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program, with up to $125 million authorized annually. ARRA provides an additional $250 million for Job Corps Centers, with funds allowed for career training in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The ARRA provides funds for career training in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental protection industries until June 2010. The House bill allocated $250 million for worker training grants, prioritizing energy efficiency and renewables. The Senate recommended $500 million for worker training but did not specify efficiency and renewables. Additionally, $1 billion is allocated for energy projects in VA medical facilities until the end of FY2010. The enacted provision differs from both the House and Senate recommendations. The ARRA provides additional funding for monument and memorial repairs, including energy projects. $50 million is allocated to the National Cemetery Administration for these repairs. Additionally, $100 million is provided for discretionary grants to public transit agencies for capital improvements aimed at reducing energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. The House and Senate had differing recommendations for these allocations. The HUD Public Housing Capital Fund from ARRA provides $1 billion competitively for priority investments, including energy conservation retrofit investments. The Indian Housing Block Grant program allocates $255 million for tribes for new construction, acquisition, rehabilitation, energy efficiency, and infrastructure development. Funding must be used by September 30, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provides funding for energy efficiency, conservation, and infrastructure development until September 30, 2011. $250 million is allocated for energy retrofit and \"green\" investments in HUD-assisted housing. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 did not specify the energy retrofit program but gave HUD the authority to set aside funds for efficiency incentives. The Senate-passed version recommended $118 million for the program out of the $2.25 billion total appropriated for HUD Assisted Housing Stability program. \"Assisted housing\" refers to multifamily properties serving low-income tenants with rental assistance. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provides funding for energy efficiency, conservation, and infrastructure development until September 30, 2011. $250 million is allocated for energy retrofit and \"green\" investments in HUD-assisted housing owned by private landlords serving low-income tenants.

The funding is available for obligation until September 30, 2012. Additionally, ARRA provides $53.6 billion for a State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, with $48.32 billion available for DOED \"State Allocations\" for public safety, government services, and modernization of school and higher education facilities. The enacted law extends the placed-in-service date for wind facilities and other qualifying resource facilities, such as biomass and geothermal, through 2012 and 2013 respectively. The cost is estimated at $13.1 billion over 10 years. The renewable energy industry faces uncertainty in future tax positions. The law extends the placed-in-service date for renewable energy facilities, offering a 30% investment tax credit as an alternative to the production credit. The cost is estimated at $285 million over 10 years. The House and Senate proposed to repeal the limit on the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for properties financed with industrial development bonds or other subsidized financing programs. Previously, businesses could claim a 30% tax credit for small wind-energy, solar water-heating, and geothermal heat pump properties. The House and Senate proposed to repeal dollar caps on tax credits for renewable energy projects. Nonprofit entities would be authorized $1.6 billion in clean renewable energy bonds for various projects. JCT estimates the cost at $604 million over 10 years for tax credits and $578 million over 10 years for the bonds. The Clean Renewable Energy Bond program was established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 with an initial $800 million authorization. State and local governments can issue bonds for various purposes including reducing energy use in buildings, green community programs, renewable electricity production, and research on nonfossil fuels and carbon capture technologies. The curr_chunk discusses various initiatives to promote energy efficiency and green technology, including mass commuting facilities, agricultural waste conversion for fuel, advanced battery manufacturing, peak electricity demand reduction, carbon capture technologies, and public education campaigns. The provision authorizes $2.4 billion for Energy Conservation Bonds to finance government programs and green community initiatives. The Senate provision differs from the House version by not addressing private activity bonds. The curr_chunk discusses the cost estimates and provisions of various energy efficiency programs, including investment tax credits for home energy improvements. The House-passed ARRA bill increases the credit to 30% for 2009 and extends it through 2010, with a new aggregate cap of $1,500. JCT estimates the cost at $2.03 billion over three years. The House-passed ARRA bill increases investment tax credits for renewable energy equipment, eliminating caps and subsidized financing reductions. The cost is estimated at $268 million over nine years. Additionally, qualified transportation fringe benefits provided by employers are excluded from an employee's gross income for income tax purposes. The ARRA bill increases investment tax credits for renewable energy equipment and excludes qualified transportation fringe benefits from an employee's gross income. The bill also proposes to increase the monthly exclusion for employer-provided transit, vanpool, and bicycle commuting benefits to $230 per month. The ARRA bill increases investment tax credits for renewable energy equipment, including ethanol, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and hydrogen refueling systems. The credit is valued at 30% of the system cost, up to $30,000 for retail systems and $1,000 for residential systems. For calendar years 2009 and 2010, the tax credit is raised to 50% for most fuels, with higher limits of $50,000 for retail systems and $2,000 for residential systems. The credit for hydrogen remains at 30% but with a higher limit of $200,000. EESA established a tax credit for new plug-in vehicles based on battery capacity, capped at $7,500 for light-duty vehicles and up to $15,000 for heavier vehicles. The ARRA bill modifies existing tax credits for electric vehicles, capping the credit at $7,500 for light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles up to 14,000 pounds. It establishes new credits for low-speed four-wheeled vehicles, two- and three-wheeled electric vehicles, and vehicle conversions to battery power. The credit phase-out limit is set at 200,000 per manufacturer, and taxpayers subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax can claim the plug-in credit. Total cost estimated at $2.0 billion over 10 years. The Senate bill proposed a new 30% ITC to support advanced energy property manufacturing facilities, costing $2.0 billion over 10 years. The enacted law establishes a credit for renewable energy equipment manufacturing, fuel cells, energy storage, electric grid equipment, renewable fuels, energy efficiency technologies, smart grid equipment, plug-in hybrid vehicles, and carbon capture equipment, with up to $2.3 billion in credits allocated. JCT estimates the cost at $1.6 billion over 10 years. The House proposed a grant program worth up to 30% of project costs for PTC or ITC-supported projects in response to uncertain market conditions. The program would be administered by the DOE for tax years 2009 and 2010, with existing dollar caps remaining in place. A similar Senate proposal required applicants to \"share ownership\" with the Department of the Treasury through stock warrants or debt instruments, but was not included in the final bill. The enacted provision (\u00a71603) follows the House proposal, with Treasury administering the program instead of DOE. The law appropriates funds as needed and expires on September 30, 2011, costing an estimated $5 million over 10 years. Living wage provisions are required for projects financed by Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) and Energy Conservation Bonds (ECBs)."
