    "content": "This report provides an overview of federal information security and data breach notification laws applicable to entities handling sensitive personal information. These laws aim to protect personal data from unauthorized access and require entities to have breach notification policies in place. Data breach notification laws cover personally identifiable information and individually identifiable information. No single federal law governs the security of all types of sensitive personal information. Certain sectors are legally obligated to protect specific types of sensitive personal information under federal regulations. These obligations were established when federal privacy legislation was enacted in various sectors such as credit, financial services, health care, government, securities, and Internet. Certain entities must implement information security programs and provide breach notice. Federal information security requirements apply to all federal government agencies (FISMA) and a federal information security law applies to the Veterans Affairs department. In the private sector, different laws apply based on the industry. Critics argue that current laws focus too much on industry-specific uses of information rather than protecting individuals' privacy. The sectoral approach to personal information protection reflects variations in the types of information collected and differences in regulatory frameworks. The majority of states have passed bills to require businesses and government agencies to notify individuals affected by data breaches and to implement information security programs. 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted such laws as of December 9, 2009. Several states have enacted legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information, with some considering holding retailers liable for third party companies' costs from data breaches. Many states provide a safe harbor for entities regulated by state or federal law. Data breaches have been disclosed by various sectors including data brokers, retailers, educational institutions, government agencies, health care entities, financial institutions, and Internet businesses. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse reports over 345 million records with sensitive personal information were breached in the U.S. since January 2005. Significant breaches include 26.5 million veterans' data in 2006, 46.2 million credit/debit cards at TJX Companies in 2007, and 4 million card numbers at Hannaford in 2008. In 2009, Health Net experienced a data breach affecting almost half a million Connecticut residents and 1.5 million patients nationwide. The breached information was not encrypted, leading to 1,800 cases of fraud. Data breaches with personal information can lead to identity theft and various financial crimes. Identity theft involves the misuse of identifying information to commit illegal activities, and it is a common complaint reported to the Federal Trade Commission. Identity theft is the most common complaint from consumers in all 50 states, accounting for over 35% of complaints received by the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse for calendar years 2004-2006. In 2006, 36% of the 674,354 complaints received were related to identity theft. Concerns about data security breaches have increased interest in protecting personal information and enforcing federal laws. Businesses, regulators, and credit issuers may be liable for costs arising from data breaches. The report describes information security and data breach notification requirements under various federal laws such as the Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. In August 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services issued interim breach notification regulations to implement Section 13402 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission issued a rule requiring certain Web-based businesses to notify consumers of breaches in electronic health information security. The Privacy Act is the main law governing federal information privacy, along with other relevant laws like the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988. The Privacy Act of 1974 governs the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies in systems of records. It requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments on new information technology systems. The act prohibits the disclosure of records without the individual's written consent. The Privacy Act of 1974 governs the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies in systems of records. It requires agencies to conduct privacy impact assessments on new information technology systems and prohibits disclosure of records without written consent. Individuals can seek access to their records and challenge the accuracy of information. Agencies must establish safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of records. Legal remedies are provided for violations of the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act provides legal remedies for individuals to enforce their rights, including civil suits against agencies for non-compliance. Courts can order record amendments, enjoin record withholding, and award damages for intentional violations. Criminal penalties apply to federal employees who violate the act. The Office of Management and Budget oversees implementation with guidelines and regulations. Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), requires federal government agencies to provide information security protections for agency information and information systems. Agencies must develop, document, and implement an agency-wide program for information security. The information security plan under FISMA must include procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents, consulting with relevant agencies, and conducting annual security program evaluations. Compliance with NIST standards is required, and agency heads are responsible for ensuring adherence to FISMA requirements and related policies. The FISMA requires agencies to comply with information security policies and guidelines, with oversight delegated to the agency CIO and OMB. OMB issued guidance in 2007 for breach notification policies to protect personally identifiable information. Agencies must review existing privacy and security measures to formulate their policy. Agencies must review existing privacy and security requirements to develop policies for incident reporting, breach notification, and access to personally identifiable information. New privacy and security requirements are established to ensure accurate, relevant, timely, and complete information holdings. Agencies must establish a plan to eliminate unnecessary collection and use of social security numbers within 18 months. New security requirements include encrypting data on mobile devices, two-factor authentication for remote access, and logging data extracts from databases holding sensitive information. Incident Reporting and Handling Requirements apply to breaches of personally identifiable information. Agencies must report incidents of personally identifiable information breaches promptly and establish response teams to assess and address the risks. Notification should be provided without delay, except in cases of law enforcement or national security concerns. Encryption may exempt the need for notification. Attachment 3 provides details on notification procedures for law enforcement, national security, and agency needs. Attachment 4 outlines rules of behavior, consequences, and corrective actions for breaches of personally identifiable information. Supervisors may face disciplinary action for not addressing breaches or preventing them. The Veterans Administration (VA) is required to implement information security procedures to protect sensitive personal information (SPI) and VA information systems. This is in response to a breach in 2006 that exposed the personal data of 26.5 million veterans. Failure to report breaches or adequately train employees may result in disciplinary actions. The VA must develop and maintain cost-effective security controls to protect VA information and systems. This includes periodic risk assessments, policies based on assessments, security control implementation, security plans, annual training, testing of controls, and remedial action procedures. The VA Secretary is required to comply with FISMA, NIST, and OMB security requirements, establish information security responsibilities, and conduct independent risk analysis in the event of a data breach of sensitive personal information. The VA Secretary must conduct an independent risk analysis following a data breach to assess the potential misuse of sensitive personal information. If a reasonable risk is found, credit protection services must be provided. Reports on the risk analysis findings and credit protection services must be submitted to the Veterans Committees and Armed Services Committees. Quarterly reports on data breaches involving sensitive personal information are also required. The VA Secretary must promptly notify the Veterans Committees and Armed Services Committees of any significant data breach involving sensitive personal information. Contracts with private-sector service providers must include data security requirements and a prohibition on unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. Contractors must notify the Secretary of any data breach. The VA Secretary must be notified of any data breach involving sensitive personal information. Contracts with private-sector service providers must include data security requirements and liquidated damages for breaches. Regulations were issued to address data breach security, including credit protection services. The final regulations adopted the interim rule without change. The regulations do not override other laws like the Privacy Act, HIPAA, and Fair Credit Reporting Act. HIPAA requires private sector entities to maintain safeguards for personal information. Part C of HIPAA mandates the development of a health information system with electronic transmission standards. HIPAA establishes national standards for electronic information exchange, data code sets, privacy protection, security safeguards, unique health identifiers, and electronic signature procedures. Covered entities must comply with these standards, with the Secretary imposing civil monetary penalties for non-compliance. The maximum fine for violating administrative simplification provisions is $100 per violation. HIPAA establishes civil monetary penalties for violations of administrative simplification provisions, with fines ranging from $100 per violation to up to $25,000 for all violations of an identical requirement in a calendar year. Criminal penalties are also imposed for knowingly using a unique health identifier or disclosing individually identifiable health information, with enhanced penalties for offenses committed under false pretenses or with intent to sell the information. Penalties include fines up to $100,000 and/or imprisonment for up to five years for offenses under false pretenses, and fines and/or imprisonment for offenses with intent to sell or use health information for personal gain. HIPAA established civil and criminal penalties for the misuse of individually identifiable health information, with fines up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. The Privacy Rule, issued by HHS, sets national standards for the protection of health information transmitted electronically. This rule applies to health plans, clearinghouses, and providers, regulating protected health information across various mediums. The HIPAA Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities. PHI can be used without patient authorization for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations. Other uses require patient authorization, except for certain exceptions like public health or law enforcement purposes. In some cases, PHI can be used without authorization if the individual has the opportunity to object. The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires covered entities to protect health information, disclose minimum necessary information, provide privacy notices, allow individuals to review their information, and enforce safeguards to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure. The Office of Civil Rights enforces the Privacy Rule. The Office of Civil Rights enforces the HIPAA Privacy Rule, while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services enforce the HIPAA Security Standard for electronic protected health information. Covered entities must maintain safeguards to protect against threats and unauthorized disclosures of information. The Security Rule under HIPAA requires covered entities to protect against threats to information security and ensure compliance by its workforce. It establishes standards in three categories: administrative, physical, and technical, with implementation specifications for each standard. Covered entities must also enter into agreements with business associates who handle electronic protected health information. The Security Rule under HIPAA requires covered entities to protect against threats to information security and ensure compliance by its workforce. Covered entities must enter into agreements with business associates who handle electronic protected health information, ensuring safeguards are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information. The contract must authorize termination if the business associate violates a material term, and the covered entity is not liable unless aware of violations and fails to take corrective action. The HITECH Act, enacted in 2009, made sweeping changes to health information privacy laws. It extended HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules to business associates, imposing civil and criminal liability for violations. The law also established new limits on the use of protected health information for marketing purposes. The HITECH Act, enacted in 2009, extended HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules to business associates, imposing civil and criminal liability for violations. It established new limits on the use of protected health information for marketing and fundraising purposes, increased penalties for violations, and required notification of data breaches. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, business associates will be subject to civil and criminal penalties for Security Rule violations starting February 17, 2010. The HITECH Act mandates that existing business associate agreements include new security requirements. HHS guidance specifies encryption and destruction as methods to protect health information. Covered entities and business associates following the guidance are exempt from notification requirements. Prior to the HITECH Act, HIPAA rules did not require notifications after a breach of PHI. The HITECH Act now mandates covered entities, business associates, and PHR vendors to notify individuals in case of a breach of unsecured protected health information. Breach is defined as unauthorized access, acquisition, use, or disclosure of PHI. The HITECH Act defines breach as the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of protected health information that compromises its security or privacy. It also mandates notifications for breaches of unsecured PHI by covered entities, business associates, and PHR vendors. Unsecured PHI is information not protected through specified technologies or methodologies. The HITECH Act requires the HHS Secretary to issue guidance on securing PHI, with a default definition provided if guidance is not issued. The HITECH Act mandates notifications for breaches of unsecured PHI and requires the HHS Secretary to issue guidance on securing PHI, with a default definition provided if guidance is not issued. PHI is unsecured if not rendered unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals through encryption or destruction methods. Section 13402 of the HITECH Act mandates notifications for breaches of unsecured PHI. Covered entities must notify affected individuals when their unsecured PHI is breached. The notification requirements vary based on the number of individuals affected. Written notice is generally sufficient for breaches involving fewer individuals. Covered entities must notify individuals whose unsecured PHI was compromised. Written notice is sufficient for breaches with fewer than 500 individuals, while larger breaches may require notice through media outlets. The Secretary of HHS must be informed, with breaches of over 500 individuals listed on the department's website. Notification must be given promptly, within 60 days of discovery, with delayed notification allowed for law enforcement purposes. The burden of proving a reasonable delay falls on the covered entity in enforcement actions. The breach notification requirement for covered entities includes providing a description of the breach, types of information involved, steps for individuals to take, and contact information for more details. The Secretary must report to Congress annually on breaches and actions taken. Interim regulations must be issued within 180 days of enactment. The Breach Notification Interim Final Regulation, issued on August 24, 2009, includes requirements for notification to individuals, the media, and the Secretary by business associates. Section 13407 of the HITECH Act mandates breach notification for PHR vendors, service providers, and PHR servicers not covered entities or business associates. These entities must notify US citizens and residents of breaches involving their unsecured PHR identifiable health information. PHR vendors, service providers, and PHR servicers must notify the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of breaches involving unauthorized acquisition of individuals' PHR identifiable health information. Violations of notification requirements are considered unfair and deceptive trade practices. The HITECH Act mandated the FTC to create regulations for health breach notifications, which were issued on August 25, 2009. These rules apply to vendors of PHRs, PHR-related entities, and third-party service providers handling information on U.S. citizens. The regulations cover timeliness, methods of notification, content, and enforcement of breach notification requirements. Additionally, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to notify customers of privacy policies and safeguard customer information. Financial institutions are mandated to protect customer information from threats and unauthorized access. They are prohibited from disclosing nonpublic personal information to third parties without customer consent, with exceptions allowed by law. Financial institutions can disclose nonpublic personal information to third parties for services, governed by GLBA regulations. Customers must be notified about privacy policies and can opt out of information disclosure. This rule applies to entities under FTC jurisdiction. The Safeguards Rule under GLBA applies to all businesses providing financial products or services, including check-cashing businesses, payday lenders, and credit reporting agencies. It requires institutions to have security measures in place to protect customer information from threats and unauthorized access. The Commission enforces the Safeguards Rule to ensure financial institutions protect customer information from harm or inconvenience. GLBA mandates standards for administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to safeguard customer information and prevent unauthorized access. The security guidelines under the Safeguards Rule require financial institutions to assess risks, manage and control them through a program, train staff, test controls regularly, and dispose of customer information appropriately. The security guidelines mandate financial institutions to implement measures to protect customer information, require service providers to do the same, monitor and adjust security programs, report annually to the board on security compliance and issues, and recommend changes based on risk assessment. The security guidelines recommend a risk-based response program for unauthorized access to customer information, requiring disclosure of data breaches if misuse is possible. Procedures include assessing incidents, identifying accessed information, and notifying regulators. The security guidelines emphasize the importance of notifying regulators and law enforcement about incidents involving unauthorized access to sensitive customer information. Financial institutions must take steps to contain the incident and prevent further unauthorized access, including notifying affected customers when necessary. Embarrassment or inconvenience should not delay customer notification. When a financial institution discovers unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, they should promptly investigate the likelihood of misuse. If misuse is confirmed or possible, affected customers must be notified as soon as possible, unless law enforcement requests a delay for a criminal investigation. Notification should not be delayed unnecessarily, and can be limited to specific customers if necessary. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines address notifying customers when their information has been improperly accessed. If a group of files is accessed improperly and specific customers cannot be identified, all customers in the group should be notified. The FTC's mission is consumer protection and preventing anticompetitive practices. The FTC enforces laws like the Safeguards Rule and Disposal Rule to protect consumer data. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in commerce that cause substantial harm to consumers. The FTC enforces laws like the Safeguards Rule and Disposal Rule to protect consumer data. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices that mislead consumers and affect their decisions. The Commission has used Section 5 to challenge deceptive claims about privacy and security, alleging companies made promises they did not fulfill to protect sensitive consumer information. The FTC enforces laws like the Safeguards Rule and Disposal Rule to protect consumer data, prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices. Recent cases saw the FTC assessing the largest civil money penalty ever ($10 million) for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which regulates credit bureaus and consumer data privacy. Consumer reporting agencies, also known as credit bureaus, have specific responsibilities to ensure that consumer information is used only for permissible purposes under the act. They must employ reasonable procedures to verify the identity of users and the certified uses before providing consumer reports. Permissible purposes include credit, insurance, or employment decisions, and reports can be provided to those with a legitimate business need for the information. The agencies are also responsible for correcting any incorrect information or fraud in a consumer's report. The Fair and Accurate Transactions Act (\"FACT Act\") amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to prevent identity theft and assist victims. It requires financial regulatory agencies and the FTC to create rules for proper disposal of consumer report information. Violations of the FCRA are considered unfair or deceptive acts under the FTC Act, with various penalties depending on the violation. The FCRA imposes liability for willful and negligent noncompliance, with penalties including actual damages, costs, attorneys fees, and punitive damages for willful violations. Violators who procure consumer reports under false pretenses are liable for $1000 or actual damages. Enforcement actions can be brought by the Commission, other agencies, and states, with monetary and injunctive penalties. Monetary penalties for knowing violations include up to $2500 per violation in a civil action by the Commission. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) imposes penalties of up to $2500 per violation in civil actions. It requires organizations handling bank cards to adhere to security standards and reporting requirements. Developed by VISA, MasterCard, and other distributors, PCI DSS aims to maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, implement access control measures, and more. It became effective on December 31, 2006, with version 1.2 released on October 1, 2008 by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). The PCI SSC released version 1.2 of the PCI DSS, which maintains existing standards but changes some practices. Non-compliance can result in fines, increased transaction fees, and potential loss of payment card processing authorization. Texas House passed legislation mandating PCI DSS compliance."
