    "content": "The paper presents a method to autonomously find periodicities in a signal, building on the Fourier Transform and autocorrelation function. The proposed method includes extra steps to address issues with noisy or multi-periodic signals, outperforming existing algorithms. The study focuses on the periodic component of time series data, assuming stationarity in mean and variance. Detecting and analyzing this component is challenging but crucial. Periodicities in time series data are essential for accurate forecasts. Cyclical patterns, which have inconsistent intervals, are harder to detect compared to seasonal patterns with well-defined intervals. Seasonal patterns, common in human behavior data, repeat at regular time intervals like hours and calendar events. Detecting periodicities in time series data is crucial for forecasting. While some patterns like hourly or calendar-based periodicities are easily identifiable, others, such as tides and menstrual cycles, are more complex. Detecting these patterns is challenging and often requires preprocessing data or struggles with identifying multiple periodicities. The paper presents a new method, Clustered Filtered Detrended Autoperiod (CFD-Autoperiod), for detecting periodicities in signals. It combines frequency and time domain advantages, is robust to noise, and can handle multiple periodicities. The method outperforms previous techniques like Autocorrelation and Fourier transform. The Fourier series represents a signal as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, detecting main frequencies. The Discrete Fourier Transform can find frequencies, but to get periodicities, we need to go back to the time domain. The Periodogram can be obtained from the Discrete Fourier Transform, showing the range of periods. The Fourier transform resolution may not accurately estimate long periods, leading to wider ranges. Autocorrelation function provides a more precise estimation of periodicities, especially for longer periods, but struggles to select the most predominant peaks when multiple periodicities are present in the signal. The methodology introduced by BID11 combines frequency domain (DFT) and time domain (ACF) techniques to detect periodicity in signals. It aims to overcome the limitations of each method by using a threshold on the Periodogram to discard noise and refining periodicity hints with the ACF function. This approach helps in accurately detecting periodicities in signals with multiple components. The ACF function is used to refine periodicity hints, with a focus on local maxima for validation. A gradient ascent is employed for further refinement. The Fourier Transform is utilized to select periodicity hints, with a threshold determined using the Li et al. (2010) technique. This involves finding the maximum spectral power of signal noise and using it as a threshold to eliminate noise. Spectral leakage can lead to multiple hints near the true periodicity, increasing the probability of false positives. It is important to reduce the number of periodicity hints to achieve higher precision. Spectral power higher than the threshold provided by the 99% confidence method can generate imprecise periodicity hints. To achieve higher precision scores, density clustering can be used on periodicity hints to reduce their number. The clustering is done in ascending periodicity order to prevent smaller clusters from being altered by larger ones. The range for seeking neighbors in density clustering algorithms is not constant and is related to the resolution of the DFT bin size. Leaked hints from adjacent DFT bins are adjusted to avoid numerical issues. The density clustering in the GEF dataset BID3 reduces periodicity hints, with resulting centroids close to true periodicities. Centroids are used as hints for validation, with a search interval defined for each periodicity hint to check ACF peaks and valleys. A quadratic function is fitted to the ACF in the search interval to validate hints. The presence of multiple periodicities complicates the validation of hints in the ACF. Higher frequency periodicities can create sinusoidal correlations that interfere with the desired correlation. This issue is addressed in the following section, where a multiperiodic signal composed of periodicities of different lengths is discussed. The presence of multiple periodicities complicates the validation of hints in the ACF. To tackle this issue, periodicity hints are analyzed in ascending order. If a periodicity hint is validated, a lowpass filter with an adapted cutoff frequency is applied to the signal to remove correlations induced by frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Ideal lowpass filters have full transmission in the pass band and complete attenuation in the stop band, but practical filters are only an approximation of this ideal. In practice, filters approximate ideal filters, with higher filter orders providing better approximation. A Butterworth filter is chosen for its flat frequency response, but it has a slow roll-off near the cutoff frequency. To validate periodicity hints, the cutoff frequency is set slightly below the hint frequency to avoid attenuation. To validate periodicity hints, the autocorrelation function (ACF) is detrended by subtracting the best fitted line in a specific interval. This ensures that the ACF does not exhibit any linear trend, allowing the fitted quadratic function to efficiently validate or discard the hint. Time series datasets are necessary to evaluate the performance of this method. To evaluate the proposed method, time series datasets with periodicities are used. Initial evaluations are done on synthetic signals with known ground truth, comparing performances with real datasets. Signals of length 2000 with 1 to 3 periodicities are generated using a pseudo-random process. Precision and recall metrics are computed using a validation criterion. The metrics are consolidated over 500 iterations for each generated periodicity. The autoperiod and CFD-Autoperiod methods show high precision scores for non multi-periodic signals, while the Fourier Transform method has high recall but low precision. Autoperiod method may miss some periodicities due to lack of density clustering and narrow interval search. For multi-periodic signals, detrending and lowpass filtering improve scores for CFD-Autoperiod method. Fourier Transform method lacks a filtering step, resulting in high recall but consistently low precision scores. In benchmarks on synthetic signals, the autoperiod and CFD-Autoperiod methods have lower scores for multi-periodic signals due to the inability to distinguish very close periodicities. Autocorrelation is efficient for validating periodicities in real datasets with sufficiently spaced values. The dataset GEF BID3 from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 consists of 6 years of hourly load data with multiple periodicities detected by the CFD-Autoperiod method. The Great Lakes dataset provided by NOAA contains monthly water levels with a mono-periodicity of 12 months, and the autoperiod method detected 4 periodicities with only one correct. The CFD-Autoperiod method detected 4 different periodicities in the Great Lakes dataset, with only one correct. The BID8 method also analyzed the dataset but did not specify the exact periodicities detected. The Boston Tides dataset contains water level records of Boston, MA. The Boston Tides dataset includes water level records from July 01 to August 31 with 6-minute sampling intervals. BID12 detected 2 periodicities, 12.4 hours and lunar month cycles. CFD-Autoperiod method found a 24-hour and 50-minute periodicity related to mixed tides. The CFD-Autoperiod method can detect periodicities in noisy time series and output raw periodicities that can be refined later. It can only detect periodicities equal to or less than half the signal length. To address non-stationary series, tracking periodicity evolution over time using a Kalman filter could strengthen results. The CFD-Autoperiod method can detect periodicities in noisy time series and output raw periodicities that can be refined later. To strengthen results, tracking periodicity evolution over time using a Kalman filter could be beneficial. This would enhance the reliability of periodicities detected, allowing for the development of more complex machine learning models."
