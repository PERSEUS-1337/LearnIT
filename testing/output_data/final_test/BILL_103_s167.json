    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy Act\" and establishes a commission to study the overclassification of information and make recommendations to reduce classified information and strengthen protection of legitimate classified information. During the Cold War, a secrecy system grew significantly, limiting public access to vital information and hindering participation in governmental decision-making. In 1990, nearly 7 million documents were classified, leading to communication challenges within the government and scientific community, as well as high administrative costs and unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The requirement for three million individuals to obtain security clearances is seen as a significant invasion of privacy, contrary to American traditions. A suggestion is made to classify only truly sensitive information to reduce costs and privacy concerns. A 1970 Task Force proposed complete openness in all areas of information. A bipartisan study commission is expected to propose comprehensive reforms to the secrecy system. The Commission's function is to investigate matters related to legislation, executive orders, and security clearances, making recommendations on national security information classification. The Commission on the Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy is established with twelve members appointed by the President, Senate, and Speaker of the House. The Commission elects a Chairman and Vice Chairman from its members. The Commission on the Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy elects a Chairman and Vice Chairman from its twelve members. Seven members constitute a quorum, and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members may receive compensation not exceeding the daily equivalent of grade GS-18 pay for each day of duty. Members of the Commission on the Protection and Reduction of Government Secrecy, who are full-time officers or employees of the United States or Members of Congress, do not receive additional pay for their service. They are allowed travel expenses, including per diem, while performing Commission duties, following the same rules as government employees under section 5703(b) of title 5, United States Code. The commission members do not receive extra pay for their service but are reimbursed for travel expenses while performing their duties. Sec. 205 allows the Commission to hold hearings, administer oaths, issue subpoenas, and compel witnesses to testify and produce documents for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this title. Subpoenas can be issued by the Chairman or designated member, and failure to comply may result in legal consequences. The Commission is authorized to obtain information from various government entities for the purpose of this title. Each department or agency must provide information directly to the Commission upon request. The Commission has the power to appoint personnel and set their compensation without following certain regulations. It can also hire experts and consultants at rates not exceeding GS-18. Appropriations are authorized for the expenses of the Commission."
