Title II of the act authorized grants to states for this purpose, administered by the EPA. Federal funds were allocated to states based on a formula, which they used to make grants to cities for building or upgrading wastewater treatment plants. The federal share of project costs started at 75% but was later reduced to 55%. The Clean Water Act established a federal program to assist in municipal wastewater treatment plant construction. The federal share of project costs was reduced to 55% in 1981, leading to policy debates over the future of the construction grants program. Congress had appropriated nearly $41 billion by FY1984, making it one of the largest nonmilitary public works programs. Budget cuts in the Reagan Administration targeted the grants program to reassess federal, state, and local government roles in water pollution control. The Reagan Administration sought to phase out the Clean Water Act's construction grants program by 1990, believing state and local governments were capable of running construction programs. Many states and localities supported the idea, seeking a longer transition period and flexibility to set up long-term financing for self-sufficiency. Congress responded to the debate. The 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act authorized $18 billion over nine years for sewage treatment plant construction through the clean water state revolving fund program. This program provided federal grants as seed money for state-administered loans, enabling a phaseout of federal involvement while building up state capital for future investments. The Clean Water Act amendments in 1987 authorized $18 billion for sewage treatment plant construction through the clean water state revolving fund program. This program aimed to provide federal grants for state-administered loans, allowing for a transition to state capital investments and reducing federal involvement. Despite the expiration of CWSRF authorizations in 1994, pressure to extend federal funding persists due to high funding needs. An estimated $271 billion is needed nationwide over the next 20 years for eligible projects under the act, prompting Congress to continue appropriating funds to assist states and localities in meeting wastewater infrastructure needs and complying with CWA requirements. In 1996, Congress established a program under the Safe Drinking Water Act to help communities finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water was provided due to the increasing need for treatment technologies as communities grew and land-uses became more concentrated, resulting in more contaminants reaching water sources. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments addressed the growing concern over contaminants in drinking water sources. The number of regulated contaminants increased from 23 to 83 between 1986 and 1996, leading to the need for additional treatment technologies to meet new standards. The EPA and states were worried about the financial capacity of small community water systems to comply with the rising costs of SDWA compliance. A 2018 EPA-state survey estimated that $473 billion would be needed over the next 20 years for projects to treat and deliver public drinking water supplies in the United States. Congress responded by enacting the 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) to address these concerns. The 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) authorized a DWSRF program to help water systems comply with regulations and protect public health. Congress provided funding for the program through FY2019, totaling $23 billion. The AWIA of 2018 reauthorized appropriations for the DWSRF at $1.17 billion in FY2019. The AWIA of 2018 reauthorized appropriations for the DWSRF at $1.17 billion in FY2019, $1.30 billion in FY2020, and $1.95 billion in FY2021. The report includes a table summarizing the history of appropriations for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure programs, historical developments in water infrastructure funding, and a detailed chronology of congressional activity since the 1987 CWA amendments. Funding for EPA programs is within the appropriations act for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. The portion of the bill that funds EPA and wastewater treatment assistance has evolved over the years, starting as Construction Grants and eventually becoming State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG). This account now includes funds for water infrastructure, air quality, water quality, and other environmental programs. The appropriations cover various grants and programs such as CWA Title II grants, CWSRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, special project grants, and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program. The WIFIA program was funded by Congress in FY2017. Table 1 excludes funds for state environmental management grants, which cover a range of environmental programs including water, air, and waste programs. Funding levels for these grants have changed over time. Key categorical grant programs related to water infrastructure include grants for nonpoint source management and pollution control. Figure 1 shows total EPA water infrastructure appropriations from FY1986. Between FY1986 and FY2019, appropriations for EPA's water infrastructure programs in nominal and constant (2018) dollars are discussed. Earmarking funds for specific water projects began in FY1989, increasing to 31% of total appropriations in FY1994 but decreasing in subsequent years. The number of earmarked projects also rose significantly, from 4 in FY1989 to 319 in FY2010. Between FY1989 and FY2010, the total number of earmarked projects increased, resulting in more communities receiving grants but in smaller amounts. The average size of earmarked grants decreased over the years, with interest groups criticizing the practice for reducing funds provided to states for their SRF programs. Approximately 10% of total water infrastructure appropriations went to earmarked project grants. Critics of financing programs argue that earmarked appropriations undermine the purpose of state funds for water quality improvements. They believe funds should be allocated more equitably, without political influence, to ensure SRFs receive sufficient seed funding for financial self-sufficiency. Earmarked projects receive preferential treatment, with 55% federal grants and no requirement for full repayment, bypassing standard procedures. Special purpose grant funding for water projects bypassed standard state funding processes, leading to projects not reviewed by CWA authorizing committees. Congressional intervention occurred when communities faced high costs for state loans, resulting in increased user fees. This practice began in the early years, originating in the House version of funding bills. Special purpose grant funding for water projects bypassed standard state funding processes, leading to projects not reviewed by CWA authorizing committees. Congressional intervention occurred when communities faced high costs for state loans, resulting in increased user fees. This practice began in the early years, originating in the House version of funding bills. Earmarking special purpose grants in appropriations bills continued funding wastewater treatment construction after FY1990, with Congress providing EPA grants for drinking water systems. After FY1990, Congress provided EPA grants for drinking water system projects, which had not been available before. However, opposition to congressional earmarking ended this practice after FY2011. The federal percentage share and local match required for special purpose grants varied depending on the project and year of funding. For example, in early projects (FY1989), federal cost shares ranged from 75% to 85%. In FY1992 and FY1993, funds were provided \"as grants under title II,\" requiring local communities to provide a 45% share of project costs. After FY1993, appropriations acts themselves authorized special purpose projects grants. In FY1995, Congress addressed funding allocation for needy cities. In FY1994, Congress addressed federal and local cost shares for grants, expecting a 45% local cost share under Title II of the Clean Water Act. In FY1996, there was no mention of cost share requirements, leading EPA officials to plan for a 5% local match for special purpose grants. The local match could include in-kind services or project funding. In FY1997, Congress included report language on federal and local cost share requirements for grants. The Agency was directed to develop a standard cost-share consistent with fiscal year 1995. FY1998 and FY1999 appropriations did not mention cost-share, but directed EPA to work with grant recipients on appropriate arrangements. For FY2000, Congress included explicit report language on the local match for water and wastewater treatment facilities. The cost-share requirement for water and wastewater treatment facilities and groundwater protection infrastructure mandates that 45% of project costs be covered by the community or entity. Congress has specified this requirement in appropriations legislation since FY2004, with flexibility for certain circumstances. The earmarked grant provides up to 55% of project costs, with changes in special project water infrastructure grants over the years due to controversies surrounding congressional earmarks. President Obama responded to concerns over special interests influencing spending decisions and lack of oversight. President Obama responded to concerns over special interests influencing spending decisions and lack of oversight by vetoing any legislation containing earmarks. The House extended the ban on earmarks, the Senate Appropriations Committee announced a moratorium on earmarks for FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2011 and FY2012 full-year appropriations measures contained no special project funding in the EPA STAG account, but included funds for Alaska Native Villages and U.S.-Mexico border projects. The moratorium on congressional earmarks has continued into FY2013. The moratorium on congressional earmarks has continued in recent years. Funding for special projects in the STAG account has been limited, but funds have been allocated for Alaska Native and Rural Villages as well as U.S.-Mexico border projects. The appropriations acts from FY2016 to FY2019 included funding for these projects, with amounts ranging from $10 million to $25 million. President Trump's FY2020 budget proposes to eliminate funding for U.S.-Mexico border projects and reduce funding for Alaska Native and Rural Villages from $15 million to $3 million. The SDWA allows states to use up to 35% of their DWSRF grants for additional assistance to disadvantaged communities. Congress amended the CWA in 2014. Congress amended the Clean Water Act (CWA) in 2014, requiring states to allocate a percentage of their grants for additional subsidization. This trend began in 2009 with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which mandated at least 50% of funds to be used for forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants. Subsequent appropriations acts have continued this requirement, with varying percentages of subsidization. For example, the FY2016, FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 acts mandated 10% of CWSRF grants and 20% of DWSRF grants to be used for additional subsidy. The 1987 CWA amendments authorized federal grants to assist states in managing water pollution from nonpoint sources. Congress struggled to fund this grant program due to competing priorities, but eventually provided funding through the SRF/construction grants account in FY1993. In FY1996, all state grants for environmental programs were consolidated into a single grants appropriation. Congress endorsed a more flexible approach to state grants for environmental programs, consolidating all state grants into a single grants appropriation in FY1996. Funding for items in the STAG account since the 1987 CWA amendments has been provided by Congress in specific amounts for certain programs within the categorical grants appropriation. The authorization period covered by P.L. 100-4 was FY1986-FY1994, with appropriations indirectly reflecting policy and program changes for later years. For FY1986, Congress appropriated a total of $1.8 billion. In December 1985, $600 million was approved, followed by an additional $1.2 billion in July 1986. President Reagan requested $2.0 billion for FY1987, with Congress appropriating $2.4 billion in October 1986. Only $1.2 billion was released initially, with the remaining funds released after the Water Quality Act of 1987 was enacted. $39 million of unreleased grant funds were shifted to other water quality activities authorized in P.L. 100-4. In FY1988, Congress approved $2.304 billion for construction grants, lower than the $2.4 billion initially proposed. President Reagan requested $1.5 billion for FY1989, a 35% decrease from FY1988. In FY1989, President Reagan requested $1.5 billion for EPA construction grants, which was 37.5% less than the authorized level of $2.4 billion. The final amount approved in P.L. 100-404 was $1.95 billion, with $68 million allocated for special projects in four states. This included $1.882 billion for grants divided between Title II and new Title VI SRF programs. Earmarking of funds for specified projects began in FY1989 legislation, following provisions of the Water Quality Act of 1987. In 1989, designated projects authorized under the Water Quality Act of 1987 included Boston, San Diego/Tijuana, Des Moines, IA, and Oakwood Beach/Redhook, NY. President Reagan's FY1990 budget requested $1.2 billion in wastewater treatment assistance, 50% less than the authorized level and 38.5% less than the FY1989 enacted amount. The budget proposed $800 million in Title VI monies and $400 million in Title II grants. In FY1990, Congress agreed to provide $2.05 billion for wastewater treatment assistance, with $1.002 billion each for Titles II and VI. Title II funds were reduced by $6.8 million due to earmarked funds for a project in South Carolina. All funds in the bill were reduced by 1.55% to fund the federal government's antidrug program. In FY1990, funding for wastewater treatment assistance was reduced by 1.55% to support the federal government's antidrug program. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act triggered automatic spending reductions through sequestration to eliminate deficits exceeding targets. Additional funding cuts were included in the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 to meet deficit reduction goals. In FY1990, sequestration procedures under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act led to automatic spending reductions in EPA and other agencies' programs, including wastewater treatment aid. Funding totaled $1.98 billion, with $53 million for special projects and $960 million for Title II grants. President Bush requested $1.6 billion for FY1991. For FY1991, President Bush requested $1.6 billion in funding for wastewater treatment assistance, including $15.4 million for the San Diego project. Congress agreed to provide $2.1 billion in assistance, with all funds allocated for capitalization grants under Title VI of the Water Quality Act of 1987. Traditional Title II grants program funding was no longer available. Earmarkings included $15.7 million for San Diego and $20 million for Boston. For FY1991, President Bush requested $1.6 billion in wastewater treatment funding, including $15.4 million for the San Diego project. Congress agreed to provide $2.1 billion in assistance, with earmarkings of $15.7 million for San Diego and $20 million for Boston Harbor. In FY1992, $2.048 billion was provided for Title VI grants, with $16.5 million allocated for a new Water Quality Cooperative Agreement Program. President Bush had requested $1.9 billion for wastewater treatment funds in FY1992. In FY1992, Congress provided $2.4 billion in wastewater funds, exceeding the President's request of $1.9 billion. The funds included $1.948.5 million for SRF capitalization grants, $16.5 million for Section 104(b)(3) grants, and $49 million for a special project in San Diego-Tijuana. In FY1992, Congress provided $2.4 billion in wastewater funds, exceeding the President's request. This included funding for special projects in San Diego-Tijuana, Rouge River (MI), Boston Harbor, New York City, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Seattle. The appropriation bill was the first to include special purpose grant funding for projects not specifically authorized in the Clean Water Act. President Bush requested $2.484 billion for state revolving funds/construction grants in FY1993, with $340 million targeted for construction grants to six communities. In FY1992, Congress provided $2.4 billion in wastewater funds for special projects in San Diego-Tijuana, Rouge River (MI), Boston Harbor, New York City, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Seattle. President Bush requested $2.484 billion for state revolving funds/construction grants in FY1993, with $130 million directed towards a Mexican Border Initiative for various projects and grants. Final action on FY1993 funding occurred on September 25, 1992 (P.L. 102-389), providing an appropriation of $2.55 billion, with $622.5 million reserved for special projects and grants. In FY1992, Congress provided $2.4 billion for special wastewater projects in various cities. President Clinton requested additional SRF grant funds in FY1993, but Congress did not provide them. For FY1994, the Clinton Administration requested $2.047 billion for water infrastructure. In FY1994, the Clinton Administration requested $2.047 billion for water infrastructure, including funds for State Revolving Funds, Mexican border project grants, and a hardship community in Boston. The final legislation provided $2.477 billion for water infrastructure, with $1.718 billion allocated for clean water SRFs and $500 million for economically distressed communities. The bill enacted in FY1994 provided $1.218 billion immediately for clean water State Revolving Funds (SRFs), with an additional $500 million set aside for financing projects in economically distressed communities. President Clinton's FY1995 request included $2.65 billion for water infrastructure, with allocations for various projects including grants for Mexican border projects, colonias projects in Texas, and grants for needy cities like Boston. The FY1995 funding agreement in P.L. 103-327 provided $2.962 billion for water infrastructure financing, including $22.5 million for Section 104(b) grants, $100 million for Section 319 grants, $70 million for Public Water System Supervision program grants, $52.5 million for the Section 510 project in San Diego, and $700 million for drinking water SRFs. Additionally, $1.235 billion was allocated for clean water SRF grants under Title VI of the CWA. In FY1995, $781.8 million was designated for 45 specific projects in 22 states, ranging from $200,000 to $100 million. Additionally, $500 million in needy cities money was allocated for various projects, including $150 million for Boston, $50 million for colonias in Texas, and $70 million for a New York City wastewater reclamation facility. President Clinton submitted the funding agreement in February 1995. In February 1995, President Clinton requested $2.365 billion for water infrastructure funding, including $1.6 billion for clean water state revolving funds, $500 million for drinking water state revolving funds, $150 million for Mexico border projects, $100 million for economically distressed communities, and $15 million for Alaska Native Villages. Congressional committees rescinded $16.5 billion in total funds in July 1995. In July 1995, P.L. 104-19 rescinded $16.5 billion in funds from various departments and programs, including $1,077,200,000 from water infrastructure appropriations. This included $3.2 million for a project in New Jersey that was mistakenly funded twice in a previous bill. The larger rescinded amount consisted of drinking water SRF funds, leaving $1.235 billion for FY1995 clean water SRF funds and $778.6 million for earmarked wastewater projects. Congress and the Administration reached agreement on FY1996 appropriations for EPA in April 1996 as part of omnibus legislation (P.L. 104-134). In November 1995, congressional conferees reached agreement on FY1996 legislation for EPA, providing $2.323 billion for State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) for infrastructure and environmental management grants. This included $1.125 billion for clean water SRF grants, $275 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $265 million for special purpose project grants. The drinking water SRF money also included $225 million from FY1995 appropriations rescinded in a previous bill. The November 1995 agreement on H.R. 2099 included $658 million for consolidated state environmental grants, endorsing a more flexible approach to state grants to improve the federal-state partnership in environmental programs. This made the total potentially available for drinking water SRF grants $500 million, with the money reverting to clean water SRF grants if the SDWA was not reauthorized by June 30, 1996. Performance Partnership Grants allow states and tribes to target funds for their specific environmental needs, reducing burdens and increasing flexibility. Congress supports this approach to improve environmental performance and use resources effectively. This initiative aims to address pressing concerns while achieving a clean environment. The H.R. 2099 conference agreement included legislative riders to limit EPA's spending on environmental programs. President Clinton vetoed the bill due to objections on spending and policy aspects. EPA faced funding challenges from October 1995 to April 1996, leading to short-term continuing resolutions. In April 1996, an omnibus appropriations bill was passed to fund EPA and other agencies for the remainder of FY1996. In April 1996, Congress reached an agreement on an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 3019, P.L. 104-134) to fund EPA and other agencies for the remainder of FY1996. The bill allocated $2.813 billion for a new account titled STAG, including funds for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, Mexico-border project grants, Texas colonias, Alaska Native Villages, special purpose project grants, and consolidated state environmental grants. The omnibus appropriations bill (P.L. 104-134) allocated $725 million for the STAG account, including funds for clean water SRF grants and drinking water SRF grants. Legislation authorizing an SRF program under the Safe Drinking Water Act was required by August 1, 1996, or the funds would revert to clean water SRF grants. The final agreement dropped some legislative riders and redistributed funds after the passage of Safe Drinking Water Act amendments in August 1996. The previously appropriated $725 million reverted to clean water SRF grants. In FY1996, $725 million reverted to clean water SRF grants, totaling $2.0735 billion. President Clinton's FY1997 budget requested $2.852 billion for water infrastructure, including $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $165 million for border projects, $113 million for needy cities, $550 million for drinking water SRF funding, and $674 million for state performance partnership grants. In June 1996, the House approved legislation (H.R. 3666) providing FY1997 funding for EPA, endorsing the budget request with some adjustments. The House approved $2.768 billion for various environmental programs, including $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $165 million for U.S.-Mexico Border projects, Texas colonias, and Alaska Native Village projects, $450 million for drinking water SRF funding, $674 million for state performance partnership consolidated management grants, and $129 million for special purpose grants. In July, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 3666, approving $2.815 billion for the account, including funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.426 billion for clean water SRF grants, $550 million for drinking water SRF grants (contingent upon authorization), $165 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias, and Alaska Native Village projects, and $674 million for consolidated state grants. The committee rejected the provision of $129 million for special purpose grants, stating that earmarking is at the expense of state revolving funds. The Senate adopted an amendment to reduce the FY1997 appropriation for clean water SRF grants by $725 million to fund the new drinking water SRF program. The Senate-passed bill provided $701 million for clean water SRF grants and $1.275 billion for drinking water SRF grants for FY1997. The conference report on H.R. 3666 was approved by the House and Senate on September 24, 1996, with President Clinton signing the bill on September 26 (P.L. 104-204). The bill allocated $2.875 billion within the STAG account, including funds for U.S.-Mexico border projects, Texas colonias, and Alaska Native Village projects, as well as specific wastewater, water, and groundwater project grants. The House-passed H.R. 3666 provided funds for needy cities projects requested by the Administration, along with $674 million for consolidated state grants supporting environmental programs. The allocation of clean water and drinking water SRF grants was consistent with Senate action to restore funds to the drinking water program. Congress later passed a FY1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations bill, including additional funding for EPA programs and $35 million for the Boston Harbor cleanup project. President Clinton presented the Administration's budget request for FY1998 in February 1997. In February 1997, Clinton presented the Administration's budget request for FY1998, totaling $2.793 billion for water infrastructure and state and tribal assistance. House and Senate committees began activities on FY1998 funding bills in 1997, after negotiations for a balanced budget plan. The House passed EPA's appropriation in H.R. 2158 on July 15, approving $3.019 billion for clean water and drinking water SRF grants. The Senate passed a separate version of an FY1998 appropriations bill on July 22, 1997 (S. 1034, S.Rept. 105-53), providing $3.047 billion for water infrastructure and state and tribal assistance, including funds for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, state environmental assistance grants, and special project grants. The FY1998 appropriations bill provided $3.213 billion for water infrastructure projects, including funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, state environmental assistance grants, and special purpose project grants. The bill also included $82 million for special project grants for various communities, with final agreement reached in October 1997 and signed into law by President Clinton on October 27 (P.L. 105-65). The FY1998 appropriations bill allocated $3.213 billion for water infrastructure projects, including grants for clean water and drinking water facilities. Specific grant amounts included $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, $50 million for Texas colonias, $50 million for Boston Harbor wastewater needs, $10 million for New Orleans, $3 million for Bristol County, MA, and $15 million for Alaska Native Village projects. The bill also allowed states to cross-collateralize clean water and drinking water SRF funds for maximum leverage. The FY1998 appropriations bill allocated $3.213 billion for water infrastructure projects, including grants for clean water and drinking water facilities. The bill allowed states to cross-collateralize clean water and drinking water SRF funds for maximum leverage. President Clinton used his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel six items of discretionary budget authority provided in the bill, including funding for special purpose grants. The President canceled funding for water and sewer lines in an industrial park in McConnellsburg, PA, citing reasons such as the project not being requested by the Administration and being outside the scope of EPA's mission. The Line Item Veto Act was struck down as unconstitutional, leading to the release of funding for previously canceled projects. President Clinton's budget request for FY1999 included $2.9 billion for the STAG account, representing 37% of the total requested for EPA programs. Legislative action in mid-1998 saw increases in funding for water infrastructure projects, with both houses of Congress finding the Administration's request for clean water and drinking water grants inadequate. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of an EPA spending bill in June 1998 (S. 2168, S.Rept. 105-216), providing $3.2 billion for the STAG account, including funds for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native Village projects, special needs infrastructure grants, and state performance partnership/categorical grants. The House passed its version of EPA's funding bill (H.R. 4194, H.Rept. 105-610) on July 29, also allocating $3.2 billion for the STAG account. The conference agreement in October 1998 provided $3.4 billion for the STAG account, including funds for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, U.S.-Mexico and Alaska Native Village projects, special needs infrastructure grants, and state environmental management grants. The House and Senate approved the agreement on October 7 and 8, respectively. President Clinton signed the bill into law on October 21 (P.L. 105-276) with additional funding provided in the Omnibus Consolidated and Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY1999 (P.L. 105-277). The bill directed $20 million more in special needs grants for the Boston Harbor wastewater infrastructure project. For FY2000, the Administration requested $2.638 billion for water infrastructure assistance and state environmental grants, including funds for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, Mexican border and special project grants. The Administration requested $128 million for Mexican border and special project grants, $885 million for consolidated state environmental grants, and proposed allowing states to set aside up to 20% of FY2000 clean water SRF monies for nonpoint source pollution projects. Critics argued that making grants from SRFs could compromise a state's long-term integrity. The proposal to reduce grants from the SRF was criticized for being insufficient to meet the needs of states and localities for clean water infrastructure. Despite a $550 million decrease from 1999, EPA stated that the overall fund would still revolve at $2 billion per year by 2002, including a 20% grant setaside in the FY2000 request. The House and Senate passed an EPA appropriations bill in September 1999, providing $7.6 billion overall for EPA programs, including $3.47 billion for the STAG account. This included funding for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, categorical state grants, U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Rural projects, and other environmental programs. The final bill did not approve the Administration's request to allow states to use up to 20% of clean water SRF monies as grants for nonpoint pollution and estuary management projects. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 with funding for five other agencies, which included provisions requiring a government-wide cut of 0.38% in discretionary appropriations. EPA's distribution of the rescission resulted in a total reduction of $16.3 million for special needs water and wastewater projects. The EPA reduced funds for special needs water and wastewater projects in P.L. 106-74 by 4.9%. Funding for the clean water SRF was reduced by 0.3% to $1.345 billion. The President's FY2001 budget requested $2.9 billion for water infrastructure assistance. President Clinton requested $800 million for the clean water SRF program, a $545 million reduction from the FY2000 level. The FY2001 budget included $825 million for the drinking water SRF program, $100 million for U.S.-Mexico border project grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Villages projects, and $13 million for needy cities grants. Additionally, there was $1.069 billion for consolidated state environmental grants. The budget also sought flexibility for states to allocate up to 19% of clean water SRF funds for local community projects. The House approved its version of EPA's funding bill, providing $3.2 billion for the STAG account. The FY2001 budget included $825 million for drinking water SRF grants, $1.069 billion for state environmental grants, and funds for special projects in U.S.-Mexico border and Alaska Native Villages. The House approved $3.2 billion for the STAG account, while the Senate approved $3.3 billion, including funds for special needs water and wastewater grants. EPA's funding bill for FY2001 provided $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants. In FY2001, $1.35 billion was provided for clean water SRF grants and $825 million for drinking water SRF grants. The bill also included funding for water infrastructure projects in Alaska Rural and Native Villages, U.S.-Mexico border projects, and other specified project grants. Additionally, $1.008 billion was allocated for state categorical program grants. President Clinton signed the bill into law on October 27, 2000. In addition to the $336 million in P.L. 106-377, $21 million was allocated for five special project water infrastructure grants under H.R. 4577, the FY2001 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 106-554). The Wet Weather Water Quality Act authorized a $1.5 billion grants program to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems. The Bush Administration requested $2.1 billion for clean water infrastructure funds in FY2002, including funds for drinking water SRF grants, clean water SRF grants, and municipal sewer overflow grants. The Wet Weather Water Quality Act authorized a $1.5 billion grants program to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems. The Bush budget requested no funds for special earmarked grants, except for $75 million for projects along the U.S.-Mexico border and $35 million for projects in Alaska Native Villages. Some Members of Congress and outside groups criticized the budget for not providing enough support for water infrastructure programs. The President's budget also requested $1.06 billion for state categorical program grants. The House passed FY2002 funding for EPA, providing $2.4 billion for water infrastructure funds, including clean water and drinking water SRF grants, special project grants, U.S.-Mexico border projects, and Alaska Rural and Native Villages. The bill did not include separate funds for the new wet weather overflow grant program. Total STAG account funding in the bill was $3.44 billion, higher than the President's request. The Senate also passed its version of the appropriations bill. The Senate passed an appropriations bill on August 2 (S. 1216, S.Rept. 107-43) which included funding for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, special needs infrastructure grants, U.S.-Mexico border projects, Alaska Rural and Native Villages, and state categorical program grants. The resolution of this bill was complicated by economic conditions and responses to the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Senate passed an appropriations bill on August 2 (S. 1216, S.Rept. 107-43) which included funding for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, special needs infrastructure grants, U.S.-Mexico border projects, Alaska Rural and Native Villages, and state categorical program grants. The final bill for EPA's FY2002 funding (H.R. 2620, H.Rept. 107-272) was approved by the House and Senate, signed by President Bush on November 26 (P.L. 107-73). It included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $344 million for earmarked water infrastructure project grants, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, $30 million for Alaska Rural and Native Villages, and total STAG funding of $3.7 billion. President Bush's FY2003 budget request asked Congress to appropriate $2.185 billion for EPA's water infrastructure programs. The FY2003 request sought $1.212 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $123 million for special projects in Alaska Native Villages and U.S.-Mexico border communities. The Administration proposed to eliminate funds for unrequested infrastructure projects and requested no funds for the municipal sewer overflow grants program. Some Members of Congress criticized the request level for clean water SRF capitalization grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.45 billion for clean water SRF grants, $100 million more than the FY2002 level. The Senate committee bill included $875 million for drinking water SRF grants, $140 million for special needs infrastructure grants, $45 million for Alaska Rural and Native Village project grants, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.134 billion for state categorical program grants. The House Appropriations Committee approved $1.3 billion for the clean water SRF program, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $227.6 million for special needs infrastructure grants, $35 million for Alaska Rural and Native Village project grants, $75 million for U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.173 billion for state categorical program grants. The Senate committee bill included funding for various water infrastructure projects, while the House Appropriations Committee approved funds for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, special needs infrastructure grants, Alaska Rural and Native Village project grants, U.S.-Mexico border projects, and state categorical program grants. Final funding levels for EPA and other nondefense agencies were agreed upon in an omnibus appropriations act signed by the President in February 2003. The FY2003 appropriations included 489 special water infrastructure project grants to cities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border communities, along with $1.14 billion for state grants. President Bush's FY2004 budget requested $1.798 billion for water infrastructure funds, with $850 million each for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, and $98 million for priority projects. No funds were requested for congressionally earmarked project grants. The Administration's request for clean water SRF grants was criticized by some Members of Congress and interest groups for being $490 million below the FY2003 enacted level. However, Administration officials defended the request, stating that it reflected a commitment to fund the program at $850 million annually through FY2011. The President's budget also included $1.2 billion for categorical state grants to address various environmental programs. The House approved H.R. 2861, providing FY2004 appropriations for EPA, which included $1.2 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $203 million for earmarked water infrastructure project grants, and $75 million in grants for other purposes. The Senate passed a funding bill for EPA, providing $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $130 million for targeted infrastructure project grants, and $95 million for projects in Alaska Native Villages and along the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress did not enact legislation providing FY2004 funds for EPA before the new fiscal year, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to extend FY2003 funding levels. The House passed legislation (H.R. 2673) providing full-year funding for EPA and other agencies. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-401) allocated $1.34 billion for clean water SRF grants, $845 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $425 million for earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and U.S.-Mexico border projects. The Senate approved the report on January 22, 2004, and President Bush signed the legislation on January 23 (P.L. 108-199). The FY2005 EPA appropriation for water infrastructure funds was the lowest since FY1997, mainly due to reduced funding for the clean water SRF program. President Bush's FY2005 budget requested $3.0 billion for water infrastructure assistance and state environmental program grants, including $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $94 million for priority projects, and $1.25 billion for categorical grants. The budget did not include funds for congressionally earmarked project grants, and the clean water SRF request was $492 million below the FY2004 level. The FY2005 budget requested $3.0 billion for water infrastructure assistance, including $850 million for clean water SRF grants and $850 million for drinking water SRF grants. The House and Senate Appropriations committees reviewed the EPA budget request, with the House reporting funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, and earmarked grants for water infrastructure projects. The Senate reported its version of the bill with funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants. The FY2005 budget included $1.35 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $217 million for earmarked project grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 provided total funding for EPA of $8.1 billion, with controversial decreases in funding for clean water SRF grants. In FY2006, $2.34 billion was allocated for water infrastructure programs, including grants for clean water and drinking water, earmarked grants for specific communities, and state grants for environmental programs. This funding was $542 million more than requested by the President but $276 million less than the previous year. President Bush signed the legislation (P.L. 108-447) on December 8, 2004. The FY2006 budget request sought 5.6% less funding for EPA compared to the previous year. The FY2006 budget requested 5.6% less funding for EPA compared to the previous year. The Administration proposed deep cuts for the STAG account, including reductions in clean water SRF grants and state categorical grants. Advocates raised concerns that cuts to the clean water program would hinder municipal wastewater treatment projects. The Administration planned to invest $6.8 billion in the clean water SRF program between FY2004 and FY2011, with federal funding expected to end after that. Congress had boosted funds above the FY2005 request level, leading to reduced requests for the SRF in subsequent years until a planned phaseout in FY2011. The House passed H.R. 2361 on May 19, 2005, providing $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $269 million for earmarked water projects. The House passed H.R. 2361 on May 19, 2005, providing $850 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $269 million for earmarked water projects. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 2361, providing $1.1 billion for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, and $290 million for earmarked project grants. The House and Senate approved the measure in July, and the President signed it into law on August 2 (P.L. 109-54). The bill approved in July and signed into law on August 2 (P.L. 109-54) provided $900 million for clean water SRF grants, $850 million for drinking water SRF grants, $285 million for earmarked grants in listed communities, Alaska Native Villages, and along the U.S.-Mexico border, and $1.13 billion for categorical state grants. It required an $80 million rescission from expired grants, contracts, and interagency agreements in various EPA accounts not obligated by September 1, 2006. The total funding for EPA water infrastructure programs and projects was $2.03 billion, $386 million more than requested by the President. In FY2006, funding for EPA water infrastructure programs was reduced due to rescissions mandated by P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148. The final levels for the STAG account were $887 million for clean water SRF grants, $838 million for drinking water SRF grants, $281 million for earmarked grants, and $1.11 billion for categorical state grants. In FY2006, EPA water infrastructure programs faced funding reductions due to rescissions mandated by P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148. President Bush requested Congress to rescind $2.3 billion from various federal programs, including $166 million from clean water SRF monies. However, Congress did not approve the specific request to reduce clean water SRF appropriations. The Administration's FY2007 budget request asked for $1.570 billion for EPA's water infrastructure programs, with allocations for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, and special projects in Alaska Native Villages, Puerto Rico, and other areas. In FY2006, EPA water infrastructure programs faced funding reductions due to rescissions mandated by P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148. President Bush requested Congress to rescind $2.3 billion from various federal programs, including $166 million from clean water SRF monies. The President's FY2007 budget request for clean water SRF capitalization grants was 22% less than the FY2006 appropriation for these grants and 37% below the FY2005 funding level. The request for drinking water SRF grants was essentially the same as in recent years. In FY2006, EPA water infrastructure programs faced funding reductions due to rescissions mandated by P.L. 109-54 and P.L. 109-148. President Bush requested Congress to rescind $2.3 billion from various federal programs, including $166 million from clean water SRF monies. The Administration proposed no funding for congressionally designated water infrastructure grants in FY2007, but sought $40.6 million for Administration priority projects. Advocates of the clean water SRF program argued that cuts would impair municipal wastewater treatment projects. The House passed H.R. 5386, providing $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants and $841.5 million for drinking water SRF. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding levels of $687.6 million for clean water SRF grants and $841.5 million for drinking water SRF grants. A continuing resolution provided funds for EPA and other agencies until February 15, 2007, following a \"lowest level\" concept for individual programs. Clean water SRF grants received $687.6 million in appropriations through mid-February. In mid-February, Congress passed H.J.Res. 20, a continuing appropriations resolution that provided funding for EPA and other agencies through FY2007. Clean water SRF capitalization grants received a funding increase of $1.08 billion under the resolution, with $197 million more than FY2006 and $396 million more than the President's FY2007 request. The resolution also prohibited project grants for congressional earmarks. The resolution H.J.Res. 20 provided funding for EPA and other agencies through FY2007. It banned earmarks for project grants but allowed special project grants requested in the President's budget. President Bush signed the resolution on February 15, 2007 (P.L. 110-5), allocating $1.084 billion for clean water SRF grants, $837.5 million for drinking water SRF grants, $83.75 million for specific project grants, and $1.11 billion for state grants. President Obama presented his FY2008 budget request to Congress on February 5, 2007, seeking funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, special project grants for Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico border region, and categorical state grants for environmental programs. The House passed H.R. 2643 in June 2007, providing appropriations for EPA, including funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, as well as congressionally designated water infrastructure project grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved higher funding levels for water quality programs, including clean water and drinking water SRF grants, and congressionally designated water infrastructure project grants. Congress did not enact any appropriations bills for FY2008 by October 1, leading to short-term funding resolutions until final agreement in December 2007. Full-year funding for EPA's water infrastructure programs was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008. In December 2007, the President signed legislation (P.L. 110-161) providing funding for clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants, earmarked grants for specific projects, and categorical state grants. President Obama's FY2009 budget requested funding for clean water and drinking water SRF grants, as well as special project grants. The FY2009 budget included $13 million more for special project grants for Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico border region, $18.8 million less for categorical state grants, and no funds for other earmarked grants. A bill with FY2009 funding for EPA was approved in June 2008, but partial-year funding was provided through March 6, 2009, at FY2008 levels due to the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Resolution Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329). In March 2009, a continuing resolution (P.L. 111-6) was enacted while Congress finalized a full-year omnibus FY2009 appropriations bill (P.L. 111-8). The omnibus bill allocated funds for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, categorical state grants, and earmarked water infrastructure grants. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) provided supplemental appropriations for various government programs to address the economic crisis. The legislation included $4.0 billion for clean water SRF grants and $2.0 billion for drinking water SRF grants, with a focus on quick-start projects. States were required to prioritize wastewater projects that could begin construction within 12 months, reallocating funds for projects not started by February 12, 2010. The EPA reallocated funds for projects not started by February 12, 2010. States had to reserve 20% of SRF funds for Green Projects. President Obama's FY2010 budget requested $10.5 billion for EPA, with a focus on water infrastructure assistance. The FY2010 appropriations for EPA included funding for clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants, special project grants for Alaska Native Villages and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and state categorical environmental grants. Congress passed the appropriations in October 2009, providing a total of $2.1 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.387 billion for drinking water SRF grants, $186.7 million for special projects, and $1.116 billion for state categorical grants. In FY2010, Congress allocated funding for environmental programs, including clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants. The FY2011 budget request by President Obama sought $10.02 billion for EPA, with a 3% decrease from FY2010 levels. The budget included $200 million less for grants to capitalize clean water and drinking water SRF programs, but still maintained robust funding for the SRFs. The FY2011 budget request by President Obama included $2.0 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.287 billion for drinking water SRF grants, $20 million for special projects, and $1.277 billion for state categorical grant programs. Congress took limited action on EPA funding for FY2011, passing a continuing resolution to extend FY2010 funding levels until December 3, 2010. President Obama signed a continuing resolution (CR) on September 30 (P.L. 111-242) to extend FY2010 funding levels for federal agencies and departments until December 3, 2010. Congress passed six more short-term CRs before finalizing FY2011 spending on April 14, 2011, with a bill (P.L. 112-10) that reduced EPA funding by 15%. The bill allocated $1.522 billion for clean water SRF grants, $963.1 million for drinking water SRF grants, $19.96 million for special projects, and $1.254 billion for state categorical grant programs. The President submitted the Administration's FY2012 budget request on February 14, 2011, seeking $9 billion total for EPA, including funds for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and state categorical grants. The House debated H.R. 2584 in July 2011, which provided $7.3 billion for EPA, 17% less than FY2011 funds and 19% less than the President's FY2012 request. The House debated H.R. 2584 in July 2011, providing reduced funds for clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants compared to FY2008 levels. The bill also included funds for state categorical grants but no earmarks. Final congressional action on FY2012 appropriations for EPA occurred in December 2011, with reduced funding for clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants compared to FY2011 levels.

The Senate did not act on an EPA appropriations bill, but a continuing resolution bill (P.L. 112-175) provided funding for government agencies through March 27, 2013 at FY2012 levels plus a 0.6% increase. Final action on FY2013 appropriations occurred in the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided funding for various environmental programs, including $1.452 billion for clean water SRF grants, $908.7 million for drinking water SRF grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.1 billion for state categorical grants. However, these amounts were reduced due to the sequester order and across-the-board rescission, resulting in approximately $1.38 billion for clean water SRF grants, $860 million for drinking water SRF grants, $14 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border assistance, and $1.0 billion for state categorical grants. In April 2013, President Obama presented the Administration's FY2014 budget, seeking $8.15 billion overall for EPA. This included $1.095 billion for clean water SRF grants, $817 million for drinking water SRF grants, $15 million for Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and $1.136 billion for state categorical grants. The House Appropriations Subcommittee later drafted a bill that would have reduced EPA funding by 34% from the FY2013 level, with significant cuts to SRF grants. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee proposed an alternative bill to maintain funding for the clean water SRF program at $1.45 billion and the drinking water SRF program at $907 million. However, Congress did not reach a final agreement on FY2014 appropriations before the fiscal year started on October 1. Instead, a short-term continuing appropriations measure (P.L. 113-46) provided funding through January 15, 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (H.R. 3547, P.L. 113-76) signed by the President on January 17, 2014, allocated $1.45 billion for clean water SRF grants and $907 million for drinking water SRF grants.

The FY2016 budget requested $8.6 billion overall for EPA, including funding for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and state categorical grants. In contrast, President Obama's FY2017 budget requested $8.3 billion for EPA, with specific allocations for clean water SRF grants, drinking water SRF grants, Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico border projects, and state categorical grants. During congressional hearings on the EPA budget, Members criticized the 30% decrease in funds for clean water SRF grants. The House passed H.R. 5538 with $1.0 billion for clean water SRF grants, $1.07 billion for drinking water SRF grants, and $1.06 billion for state categorical grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill with higher funding levels, but Congress did not reach a final agreement on EPA funding before FY2017. The House and Senate passed continuing resolutions to extend FY2016 funding levels for the EPA, with reductions, through December 9, 2016 and then from December 10, 2016, through April 28, 2017.
