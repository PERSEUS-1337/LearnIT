    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Diamonds Act\". Congress finds that diamonds are used by rebels and dictators to finance military activities, overthrow governments, and commit atrocities against civilians, leading to millions of people being displaced and killed in wars for control of diamond mining areas. The affected countries have a population of nearly 70 million people whose societies have been devastated. In the past decade, the United States Government has provided over $2 billion in humanitarian aid to war-torn countries, while approximately $10 billion in conflict diamonds were smuggled out, fueling and spreading the wars. Efforts are now being made to block the trade in conflict diamonds. The United Nations Security Council has prohibited importing diamonds from certain countries affected by conflicts, but diamond smugglers continue to fund rebel movements. This illicit trade has led to money laundering, arms proliferation, and other criminal activities, hindering efforts to end the conflicts. The United Nations Security Council has banned diamond imports from conflict-affected countries, but smugglers still fund rebel movements, leading to money laundering and other criminal activities. Efforts to end conflicts are hindered by this illicit trade. South Africa and over 20 countries are working on a solution through the Kimberley Process to prevent consumer backlash and damage to legitimate diamond trade economies. The US, as a major diamond consumer, has a responsibility to help break the link between diamonds and conflict.

RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTATION OF DIAMONDS. SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTATION OF DIAMONDS. Diamonds may not be imported into the United States unless the exporting country has controls on rough diamond export and import meeting specified requirements. This is in line with UN Resolution 55/56 or future international agreements. The controls include sealing rough diamonds in secure, transparent containers when exported. The exporting country must seal rough diamonds in a secure, transparent container with a visible document certifying the country of origin, export registration number, carat weight, and number of diamonds. The exporting country must also establish a database with this information. (D) The importing country must only allow rough diamonds to be imported in specified containers and verify the legitimacy of the export document using a maintained database. (E) Government authorities must be involved in the process. Government authorities must conduct physical inspections of sealed containers and bags of rough diamonds to ensure compliance with requirements. The President will monitor the system of controls and appoint an advisory commission to make recommendations on monitoring effectiveness and develop a labeling system for certification by vendors. The advisory commission, consisting of 11 members, including representatives from private voluntary organizations and the diamond industry, will certify that imported diamonds into the United States have undergone a system of controls on rough diamonds. SEC. 4. PENALTIES. Violations of section 3 are subject to civil and criminal penalties under US customs laws. The President can block assets and transactions of those exporting diamonds from non-compliant countries. Penalties from fines and forfeited goods will be utilized. Proceeds from fines and forfeited goods for violations of section 3(a) will be used for the War Victims Fund and grants under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. SEC. 5. Restrictions on OPIC and Export-Import Bank regarding investments in diamond-related projects in countries that do not meet certain requirements. SEC. 6. Annual report. The President must submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the effectiveness of diamond trade controls, identifying countries implementing or not implementing controls, and detailing technological advancements for tracking diamond origins. The Comptroller General of the United States will report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Act in preventing the importation of diamonds traded in violation of controls. Recommendations for any necessary modifications will be included in the report. The Congress urges the President to negotiate an international agreement with the Kimberley Process to stop the trade of conflict diamonds. The agreement should establish a global certification system for diamond trade and include specified elements. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Diamonds include diamonds or diamond jewelry under specific tariff headings, excluding certain low-value jewelry for personal use.\n(2) Rough diamonds are unworked or minimally processed diamonds under a specific tariff heading.\n(3) United States refers to states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.\n\nSEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE AND WAIVERS. SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE AND WAIVERS.\n\nThis Act will take effect 6 months after enactment, with the President having the authority to waive its applicability to a country for up to 6 months if certain conditions are met."
