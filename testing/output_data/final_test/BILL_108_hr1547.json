    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Religious Freedom Restoration Act\". The Religious Freedom Restoration Act acknowledges the fundamental right to practice religion and express religious thought. The Framers of the Constitution intentionally excluded federal government interference in religious affairs and free speech, as outlined in the first amendment. The First Amendment is a restriction on federal government power, not a grant of authority. The Supreme Court reversed its interpretation of the First Amendment in 1947, introducing the concept of separation of church and state. The Supreme Court has upheld the separation of church and state, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a high wall between the two. Recent rulings have restricted freedom of speech on religious matters, such as outlawing prayer in schools and displaying the Ten Commandments in public places, showing hostility towards religious thought. These decisions have undermined both our moral code and system of law and justice. The Court's abrupt change in rulings, ignoring historical precedent and the First Amendment's intent, is legally irrational. Congress must review these rulings and the First Amendment to determine original intent. This change is evident in cases like the unconstitutionality of voluntary school prayer. The Supreme Court has ruled that voluntary and denominationally neutral prayer in schools is unconstitutional. Additionally, freedoms of speech and press are guaranteed to students and teachers unless the topic is religious, in which case such speech becomes unconstitutional. It is also deemed unconstitutional for students to see the Ten Commandments in school. The Supreme Court has ruled that prayer in schools is unconstitutional, including praying aloud over lunch or displaying the Ten Commandments in a public courthouse. It is also unconstitutional for a student to engage in prayer as a government representative during school assemblies. The Supreme Court's rulings on prayer and religious speech in public places violate the free speech clause of the First Amendment. This constitutes a breach of the separation of powers doctrine, as legislative authority is solely granted to Congress by the Constitution. The intent of the First Amendment was clear in prohibiting the Federal Government from favoring any religious denomination. The Supreme Court has prohibited prayers in school and displaying the Ten Commandments in public places, citing the metaphor of \"Separation of Church and State\". This phrase was taken out of context from a letter by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists, expressing concerns about government intrusion in religious matters. Jefferson's reply to concerns about government intrusion in religious matters emphasized the First Amendment's preclusion of favoring one denomination. Justice William Rehnquist argued against the historical foundation of the \"wall of separation\" between church and state in his dissent. The \"wall of separation between church and state\" is a metaphor based on bad history and should be abandoned. The Constitution does not prohibit the Alabama Legislature from endorsing prayer, as argued by Justice William Rehnquist. The \"wall of separation between church and state\" metaphor, criticized by Justice Rehnquist, diverts judges from the original intentions of the Bill of Rights. It is important to examine Jefferson's use of the term, his role in drafting the First Amendment, and the framers' intent. The Court could have referred to Jefferson's advice on interpreting the original intent of the Constitution instead of relying on him as a legal authority for the First Amendment. Jefferson emphasized understanding the spirit of the debates and conforming to the probable meaning at the time of passage. The principal authors of the First Amendment were Fisher Ames and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, not Thomas Jefferson. Other participants included John Vining, Daniel Carroll, Charles Carroll, Benjamin Huntington, Roger Sherman, Oliver Ellsworth, William Paterson, James Madison, and George Mason. Jefferson did not participate in the record. George Mason and James Madison proposed different wordings for the First Amendment, emphasizing the protection of religious freedom and civil rights. Mason advocated for equal rights to the free exercise of religion without favoring any particular sect, while Madison focused on ensuring that no one's civil rights would be restricted based on their religious beliefs. The First Amendment aims to protect civil rights regardless of religious beliefs, with the intention to prevent rivalry among Christian sects. James Madison, George Mason, and Fisher Ames proposed different wordings emphasizing religious freedom. Justice Joseph Story clarified that the Amendment was not meant to promote other religions over Christianity. The First Amendment aims to prevent rivalry among Christian sects and exclude any national ecclesiastical establishment. George Washington's statements in his \"Farewell Address\" emphasize the importance of religion and morality in political prosperity. George Washington emphasized the importance of religion and morality in political prosperity, stating that they are indispensable supports. James Wilson, an active member of the Convention and later a Supreme Court Justice, highlighted the correlation between religion and civil laws, referring to them as twin sisters and friends. Wilson did not mention a \"separation of church and state.\" Enemies, religion, and law are closely intertwined, with Fisher Ames emphasizing the importance of the First Amendment without mentioning a separation of church and state. The responsibility falls on Congress to uphold the Constitution in the absence of correction from the Court. The Constitution empowers Congress to check and balance the government and address abuses of power. Congress must take action to correct serious issues. The text chunk discusses the removal of religious freedom-related cases from federal district court jurisdiction. The text chunk amends Chapter 85 of title 28, United States Code, to exclude federal district courts from hearing religious freedom-related cases. SEC. 4. Removal of religious freedom-related cases from federal claims court jurisdiction. SEC. 4 amends Chapter 91 of title 28, United States Code, by adding a new section that removes the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims over any religious freedom-related cases. The definition of a 'religious freedom-related case' includes actions where religious freedom provisions in State or Federal statutes are at issue. This amendment is effective immediately. The amendments made by this Act will apply to cases filed on or after the enactment date."
