    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bereaved Consumer's Bill of Rights Act of 2010\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds shocking consumer abuses in the funeral industry, high expenses for funeral arrangements, consumer interest in pre-need arrangements, vulnerability of grieving family members during funeral planning, and limitations of the Funeral Rule in protecting consumers. Consumer protections in the funeral industry are lacking, with state laws being inconsistent and too weak to provide adequate safeguards. Consumers have the right to clear and accurate information about funeral goods and services, as well as protection from fraud and abusive practices. There is a need for new federal standards to ensure grieving families are adequately protected. FTC to create rules on unfair practices in funeral industry. The Federal Trade Commission will establish rules to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in the funeral industry, including accurate price disclosure, prohibition of misrepresentations, and restrictions on conditioning the purchase of one funeral good or service on another. The Federal Trade Commission will establish rules to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in the funeral industry, including accurate price disclosure, prohibition of misrepresentations, and restrictions on conditioning the purchase of one funeral good or service on another. These rules will require clear and written presale disclosures and contracts for funeral services or goods, detailing merchandise, services, and prices. Additionally, contracts for prepaid funeral services must include clear disclosure of penalties for cancellation or transfer, as well as all future fees and costs. Cemeteries must also provide consumers with information on fees and costs associated with funeral services or goods. (7) Cemeteries must provide consumers with written rules, regulations, and clear explanations of purchased interment rights. (8) Cemeteries must retain records of all interments and accurately record all related information. The Commission shall prescribe rules within 1 year after enactment of this Act, including regulations for internment rights. Records must be made available to government entities. Application of rules to tax-exempt organizations and states is also required. The rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts in the funeral industry also apply to certain tax-exempt cemeteries, except those affiliated with for-profit funeral providers. The Federal Trade Commission enforces rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts in the funeral industry, applicable to services for sale to the public and states or political subdivisions. Violations are treated as violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act, with corresponding penalties and enforcement mechanisms. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY STATES. Whenever an attorney general of a State believes that residents are affected by a violation of FTC rules, the State can bring a civil action in federal court to stop the violation, enforce compliance, seek damages, or obtain other relief. The State must notify the FTC before taking legal action. The State can bring a civil action to the Commission under subsection (a) or (f)(2), providing a copy of the complaint. The Commission has the right to intervene, be heard on all matters, remove the action to federal court, and file petitions for appeal. Attorney generals can still conduct investigations and administer oaths for civil actions under subsection (a). The Commission can conduct investigations and administer oaths under State laws. During a civil action by the Commission, no State can initiate a civil action against the same defendant for the same violation. Civil actions can be brought in a district court where the defendant is found, resides, or conducts business. Section 1391 of title 28, United States Code allows for process serving in any district where the defendant is an inhabitant or can be found. Authorized State officials can take action in State court for violations of State statutes, in addition to actions by State attorneys general. Officers authorized by the State can also bring actions on behalf of residents. SEC. 5. EFFECT ON OTHER LAW. This Act does not override any State laws protecting consumers of funeral services, except where there is inconsistency. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cemetery\" refers to organizations offering interment services, excluding those with fewer than 25 interments per year. \"Funeral goods\" are items sold for funeral services, and \"funeral services\" include care for deceased individuals. Funeral services involve caring for and preparing deceased bodies for burial, cremation, or other final disposition, as well as arranging and conducting funeral ceremonies. This includes services provided by funeral directors, morticians, cemeterians, cremationists, and retailers of caskets, urns, monuments, and markers."
