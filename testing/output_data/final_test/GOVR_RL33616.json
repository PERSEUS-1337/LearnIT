    "content": "Since the 9/11 attacks, Congress has focused on intelligence collection for homeland security. The distinction between domestic and foreign intelligence has blurred, with threats from terrorist groups considered national security threats. Intelligence collected abroad is often relevant to the threat environment within the United States. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the challenge of bridging the \"foreign-domestic divide\" in preventing terrorist attacks. This divide exists within the Intelligence Community, between agencies focused on foreign intelligence and those responsible for homeland security and law enforcement missions. The scope of homeland security intelligence is not clearly defined, with various definitions for intelligence existing. Intelligence encompasses various types of clandestine collection methods and serves different purposes for national security and law enforcement. Traditional intelligence is gathered at the federal level for policymakers, while criminal intelligence is collected by federal, state, and local agencies for law enforcement purposes. Criminal intelligence is often reactive, supporting prosecution, while intelligence gathering can also enhance national security efforts. Local law enforcement agencies play a crucial role in counterterrorism efforts by gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks. The terms domestic intelligence and homeland security intelligence are sometimes used interchangeably, but they have distinct geographical boundaries. Domestic intelligence is collected, analyzed, and disseminated within the United States, while homeland security intelligence may encompass broader international activities. Homeland security intelligence is defined broadly without regard to geographic origin, integrating foreign and domestic intelligence to protect national security. Intelligence is seen as knowledge, organization, and activity, with a key purpose being to identify threats. The distinction between traditional and non-traditional intelligence may not impact the end goal of safeguarding the country. The U.S. Intelligence Community has always been crucial in identifying threats to national security, with state, local, and private sector entities playing an increasingly active role in protecting their populations and infrastructure. State, local, and private sector entities are taking a proactive role in protecting their populations and infrastructure by collecting their own intelligence and working with federal law enforcement and IC partners. The debate revolves around the most appropriate strategy for homeland security intelligence, whether it should be a \"top-down\" federally driven model or a \"bottom-up\" state, local, and private sector model. The debate over homeland security intelligence revolves around different models, including a \"bottom-up\" approach where state, local, and tribal law enforcement entities assess threats independently. This decentralized structure aims to improve information sharing and coordination between federal, state, and local players. Leaders in the Intelligence and Homeland Security communities often discuss various models for enhancing intelligence processes. Leaders in the Intelligence and Homeland Security communities prioritize bolstering intelligence support for homeland security as their main objective. Ambassador John Negroponte emphasized the need to integrate foreign, military, and domestic intelligence into a unified enterprise to connect the dots across different dimensions. This approach aims to enhance information sharing and coordination between federal, state, and local entities. HSINT could become another dimension of intelligence that overlaps with foreign, military, and domestic intelligence. The domestic intelligence dimension includes the role of state, local, tribal, and private sector entities in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information within their areas. Ambassador Negroponte emphasizes institution building and information sharing without compromising political values. Ambassador Negroponte highlights the federal-centric approach in refining the FBI's National Security Branch, developing the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis. State governments, local law enforcement, private sector, and tribal entities are mentioned for facilitating information flow. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff views intelligence as the \"radar of the 21st century\" for early warning of terrorist attacks, emphasizing routine observations and activities as key components of intelligence. Domestic intelligence involves a range of activities focused on protecting the United States from foreign threats, including FBI counterterrorism work and broader intelligence activities overseen by various government officials. The goal is to generate intelligence through interactions at the border, on airplanes, and with the Coast Guard. The goal of domestic national security intelligence is to integrate federal, state, and local governments, along with the private sector, to prevent threats from individuals and groups such as terrorists, criminals, and countries working against U.S. interests. This intelligence focuses on major violence or harm to national security within the country by international terrorists, homegrown terrorists, or spies financed by foreign nations. According to Dr. Sherman Kent, security intelligence is the intelligence supporting the police function. Security intelligence, as defined by Sherman Kent, is the knowledge and activity necessary for defensive police forces to protect the nation from malefactors and threats, including clandestine agents and illegal entrants. It is the first line of defense for the nation against foreign threats to U.S. national security. The national intelligence role for non-traditional players, such as state, local, tribal law enforcement, and the private sector, involves contributions to preventing terrorist attacks or other threats against U.S. citizens. Questions arise about the roles, responsibilities, and partnerships between traditional and non-traditional entities in intelligence sharing and feedback mechanisms. The DNI's National Intelligence Strategy aims to build an integrated intelligence capability to address threats to the homeland while protecting privacy and civil liberties. It emphasizes the need to rethink intelligence collection methods in response to transnational threats and ensure proper resourcing for intelligence elements in the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. The National Intelligence Strategy focuses on integrating intelligence capabilities to address threats to the homeland, ensuring proper resourcing for intelligence elements in the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and connecting state, local, tribal entities, and the private sector to homeland security and intelligence efforts. It is important to consider the reach and direction of the strategy, as it may not encompass all entities beyond federal control. The National Intelligence Strategy emphasizes integrating intelligence capabilities to address threats to the homeland and connecting state, local, tribal entities, and the private sector to homeland security and intelligence efforts. It highlights the importance of communication and information sharing among federal, state, and local intelligence officials. The National Strategy for Homeland Security, published in October 2007, emphasizes the importance of collaboration in homeland security intelligence among federal, state, local, tribal, and private sector entities. It highlights the multifaceted process of identifying terrorist activity and the need for an integrated Information Sharing Environment to support the distribution of terrorism-related information. Sharing homeland security intelligence is a key priority. The Congress prioritized sharing homeland security intelligence by establishing the Information Sharing Environment. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 directed DHS to review and analyze information from various sources, integrate it into intelligence products, and disseminate it to federal partners. DHS also established partnerships with state, local, and regional fusion centers and created an Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group (ITACG). The DHS oversees the creation of an Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group (ITACG) to bring together law enforcement and intelligence analysts. The DHS intelligence strategy focuses on vision, mission, definitions, and goals. It aims to provide valuable intelligence to national leadership, DHS components, federal partners, and other stakeholders. The DHS intelligence strategy involves gathering information from various sources to produce accurate intelligence products. It includes the adoption of the definition of homeland security information outlined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The term \"homeland security intelligence\" encompasses activities beyond traditional types of intelligence like foreign intelligence and counterintelligence. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defines homeland security information as any information related to terrorist threats, prevention, disruption, identification, investigation, or response to terrorist acts. Individuals may have varying interpretations of homeland security intelligence. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis defines homeland security information as intelligence related to terrorist threats and acts. This includes information on narcotics traffickers, organized criminals, and foreign intelligence activities. Homeland security information includes intelligence on terrorist threats, narcotics traffickers, organized criminals, and foreign intelligence activities. Traditional foreign intelligence collection methods include imagery intelligence (IMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT). HSINT, on the other hand, is more nebulous and not necessarily source-specific, leading to questions about its classification as a collection discipline. Various entities within DHS, state and local governments, and the private sector collect homeland security information, with traditional INTs also contributing to this effort. The DHS collects homeland security intelligence, including information on terrorism threats that may originate globally but manifest within the U.S. borders. OSINT and HUMINT are the primary collection methods within DHS Intelligence. Counterintelligence is also important, involving activities to protect against espionage, sabotage, or terrorist activities conducted by foreign entities. DHS Intelligence aims to establish measures to protect against hostile intelligence activities by foreign powers or terrorists. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to address gaps in intelligence uncovered by the 9/11 Commission, including the distinction between foreign and domestic intelligence. It amended the National Security Act of 1947 to encompass all intelligence related to national security, regardless of source or location. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 expanded the scope of intelligence related to national security, including homeland security intelligence (HSINT). HSINT involves threats to the United States and the development of weapons of mass destruction. Different approaches to framing HSINT include geographic, structural, and holistic perspectives. Table 1 outlines the limits and boundaries of these approaches. Different approaches to framing HSINT go beyond geographic bounds and involve differing beliefs on whether homeland security intelligence is solely the federal government's responsibility or a more inclusive model involving federal, state, local, tribal, and private sectors. Some view HSINT in terms of intelligence collection within the United States, while others argue for a more comprehensive approach combining domestic and foreign intelligence for a complete threat picture. The importance of integrating intelligence related to threats to national security regardless of geographic location is highlighted, as demonstrated by the events of September 11, 2001. Homeland security intelligence is seen as a federal activity, with a focus on a global perspective on threats. Homeland security intelligence involves federal entities collecting information globally, with the FBI having offices in over 200 countries for criminal information. Only a few statutory members of the Intelligence Community engage in domestic intelligence activities under this approach. Homeland security intelligence encompasses a broad approach that values information from various sources, including the private sector, law enforcement, and traditional intelligence agencies. It is not limited by geographic boundaries or levels of government, aiming to prevent attacks on the U.S. homeland. The challenge of effective information sharing in homeland security is acknowledged by officials, with cultural barriers and information silos still hindering collaboration. Lee H. Hamilton emphasizes the need to change the culture to motivate institutions and individuals to share information. Despite efforts to improve information sharing in homeland security, silos, cultural barriers, and other obstacles still impede collaboration among various entities, including the statutory members of the Intelligence Community, private sector ISACS, state and local law enforcement, and federal entities with law enforcement responsibilities. This holistic approach emphasizes the interdependency between the diverse players of the Intelligence Community and the broader homeland security information sharing community. Ambassador Henry A. Crumpton emphasizes the importance of interdependence between intelligence collectors and law enforcement in sharing valuable leads for near-term threats. This mirrors calls for collaboration made by Dr. Kent nearly thirty years ago, highlighting the interconnected nature of different branches of intelligence. The branches of intelligence are interdependent, with a focus on collaboration between different players in the HSINT Community. The addition of state, local, and private sector actors has expanded the role of the DHS Intelligence Enterprise. Clarifying roles and responsibilities, especially between the FBI and DHS Intelligence, is an ongoing process. The implementation of collaboration between the FBI and DHS Intelligence in the evolving HSINT Community remains a complex process. Understanding the members and functions of the Homeland Security Stakeholder Community is crucial for assessing these matters. The HSIC is not clearly defined by law but includes various organizations within the stakeholder community involved in intelligence activities. The HSIC, although not statutorily defined, exists as a community with members from various agencies involved in homeland security, law enforcement, defense, and intelligence functions. This includes entities like the Department of Defense, U.S. Northern Command, FBI, ATF, and DEA. The Homeland Security Intelligence Community (HSIC) includes various agencies such as the Department of Defense, U.S. Northern Command, FBI, ATF, and DEA. It also encompasses state and local law enforcement, intelligence fusion centers, private sector critical infrastructure, and other government entities like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Comparisons can be made between the HSIC and the statutory Intelligence Community (IC) defined in the National Security Act of 1947. The Homeland Security Intelligence Community (HSIC) includes various agencies and organizations conducting intelligence activities for foreign relations and national security. The HSIC is described as a community rather than a federation, with a diffuse nature across federal, state, local government sectors, and the private sector. Planned decentralization, with clear roles for each level of organization and bi-directional information sharing, is a model for the Homeland Security Intelligence Community (HSIC)."
