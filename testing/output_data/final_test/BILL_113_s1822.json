    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2013\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools outside the US and Canada to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Three for-profit Caribbean schools receive the majority of Federal funding for foreign graduate medical schools under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other schools. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommend that all foreign medical schools meet the same eligibility requirements for Federal funding. The attrition rate at for-profit Caribbean medical schools is significantly higher than at U.S. medical schools, with rates reaching 26 percent or higher. Residency match rates for foreign trained graduates are lower at 53 percent compared to 94 percent for U.S. medical school graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the U.S. and Canada accumulate more student debt on average than those in the U.S. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduating students at a foreign medical school are not described in section 484(a)(5) in the year prior to seeking a loan under part D of title IV. The Higher Education Act of 1965 now requires that 75 percent of students or graduates from foreign medical schools pass exams administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before seeking a loan under part D of title IV. The authority of a graduate medical school to qualify for loan programs under part D of title IV will expire on the first July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2013. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under part D of title IV due to certain amendments, enrolled students may still receive loans until they withdraw, complete their program, or the fourth June 30 after the loss of eligibility."
