The Act establishes the Office of Emergency Preparedness within the Office of Public Health and Science to coordinate Department of Health and Human Services activities for planning and responding to public health emergencies requiring federal assistance. The National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is a coordinated effort by Federal agencies to respond to emergencies such as natural disasters, transportation accidents, technological disasters, and terrorism. It is headed by the Secretary through the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness. The National System, led by the Secretary, involves Federal agencies like Health and Human Services, FEMA, Defense, and Veterans Affairs to provide health and social services during public health emergencies declared under section 319. The National System, under the Secretary's leadership, is responsible for providing health and social services during declared public health emergencies. It includes components such as direct medical care, patient evacuation, non-Federal hospital beds, and other components as determined by the Secretary. Temporary disaster-response personnel may be appointed to assist in carrying out duties under this section. The Secretary can appoint temporary personnel for the National System without following standard appointment procedures. Appointments can be temporary or intermittent, not for expert or consultant services, and have flexible durations. The term of service for a temporary appointment under paragraph (1) is limited to four years, with the possibility of reappointment. Individuals appointed are eligible for travel, subsistence, and necessary expenses. Liability for individuals appointed under paragraph (1) is defined for purposes of section 224(a) and related remedies. Participation in training programs is considered part of the appointment. The Secretary will establish criteria for the operation of the National System, including education and training of personnel. The Secretary will establish criteria for the education and training of individuals providing emergency services through the National System, especially for supervisory roles during activation. Criteria will also be set for the participation of States and private entities, including agreements for such participation. The criteria for participation of States and private entities in the National System include provisions for custody and use of Federal property, addressing agreements with multiple entities for emergency services, and establishing priorities among agreements. The term \"auxiliary services\" includes mortuary and veterinary services. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Office of Emergency Preparedness and the National System for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. Coordination of funding is specified for appropriations from allocations under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The subcommittees of the appropriations committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate are categorized into three groups: (A) Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education; (B) Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and independent agencies; and (C) Department of Defense. There is a limitation on the obligation of funds appropriated for the Office of Emergency Preparedness and the National System, exempt from submitting an operating plan to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. SEC. 3. Certain employment issues regarding temporary appointments for Office of Emergency Preparedness or National Disaster Medical System. (a) Temporary Disaster-Response Appointee defined as an individual appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under section 319A(c) of the Public Health Service Act. (b) Compensation for Work Injuries: A temporary disaster-response appointee shall be considered an employee and injuries sustained during service or training related to service deemed 'in the performance of duty' for compensation purposes under chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code. Service as a temporary disaster-response appointee and participation in uncompensated training related to such service are considered 'service in the uniformed services' for employment and reemployment rights under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code. Notice of absence from employment due to disaster response necessity is deemed preclusion by 'military necessity' for purposes of section 4312(b) of title 38, United States Code. For section 4312(b) of title 38, United States Code, notice of absence from employment due to disaster response necessity is determined by regulations set by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, and is not subject to judicial review. Temporary disaster-response appointees are exempt from certain provisions including premium pay, hours of work, leave, retirement, unemployment compensation, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on supporting local emergency medical services provided by governments, contractors, and volunteers. A report on the study's findings must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
