    "title": "AB 1592",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 38755 of the Vehicle Code authorizes the Contra Costa Transportation Authority to conduct a pilot project for testing autonomous vehicles without a driver present. The testing is limited to a designated business park and GoMentum Station, with the vehicles operating at speeds below 35 miles per hour. Ownership changes of the testing locations will not affect the authorization. Prior to testing an autonomous vehicle without a driver on a public road, the Contra Costa Transportation Authority or a private entity must obtain $5,000,000 insurance and submit a detailed testing program description to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Prior to testing on public roads, the autonomous vehicle must be tested under controlled conditions simulating real-world scenarios. Approval from local authorities is required for the designated area and conditions of the pilot project. Certification is required for the autonomous vehicle to operate in specific authorized conditions, comply with NHTSA guidance, and meet federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for the pilot project. The manufacturer must provide details of autonomous vehicles for testing on public roads, including make, model, year, VIN, and license plate. Vehicles must have communication link for remote operator, comply with road conditions, and local regulations. The law enforcement interaction plan for autonomous vehicles in a designated business park includes instructions for emergency and traffic situations. Operators must disclose any personal information collected from participants in the pilot project. The department may require data collection for evaluating vehicle safety during testing. Operators of autonomous vehicles must report any accidents resulting in property damage, injury, or death within 10 days. An annual report on unplanned technology disengagements during testing on public roads must also be submitted to the department. Disengagement refers to deactivation of autonomous mode due to technology failure or safety concerns. The Department of Motor Vehicles has the authority to regulate testing and operation of autonomous vehicles on public roads. The legislation aims to address a specific pilot project in Contra Costa County without influencing statewide regulations being developed. This section will only be in effect until 180 days after regulations are issued for testing driverless autonomous vehicles. After that, any testing by the Contra Costa Transportation Authority must comply with the new regulations, and this section will be repealed on January 1 following that date unless a later statute extends it."
