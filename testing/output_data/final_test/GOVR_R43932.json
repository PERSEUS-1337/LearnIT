    "content": "Under the Title IV-E program, states receive reimbursement for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. Funding is also provided for services for children aging out of foster care. Congress appropriates funding each year, with a current law request of $7.601 billion for FY2016, an increase from FY2015. The FY2016 budget request for the Title IV-E program is $258 million more than the funding used in FY2015. The additional funding is needed to support more children in foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. It also accounts for increased administrative costs due to new requirements. Additionally, the Administration seeks $430 million in additional funds. The Administration seeks $430 million in additional FY2016 Title IV-E budget authority to support legislative proposals, with $250 million for a demonstration on over-prescription of psychotropic drugs for children in foster care. This funding is tied to the foster care component of the program. The President's Title IV-E budget proposals include $250 million for a demonstration grant funding to improve oversight of psychotropic medication for children in foster care. This funding would be spent over 10 years, with most of the outlays occurring in FY2016. The Administration seeks legislative authority to implement new policies under the Title IV-E program, with a combined cost of $430 million for FY2016 and $1.358 billion over 10 years. This includes providing federal reimbursement for evidence-based services to prevent children from entering foster care. Under current law and policy, states can claim Title IV-E support for administrative tasks related to preventing children from entering foster care. However, they cannot use these funds for services provided to the children or their families. States serve approximately 160,000 candidates monthly, with claims totaling nearly $591 million in FY2013 for administrative work. The Administration proposes Title IV-E funding to support pre-placement and aftercare services for candidates for foster care, including kin families. States would receive federal reimbursement of 50% of administrative costs, totaling over $295 million. Services would be short-term and require states to maintain current child welfare service investments. States would need time to build capacity to provide these services. The Children's Bureau estimates that a proposal for federal reimbursement for foster care services would cost $30 million in FY2016 and $587 million over 10 years. They emphasize that children are best served in family settings and congregate care should only be used for children with specialized needs. A Children's Bureau analysis found that 41% of foster children in congregate care may not need that level of care, with reasons including child behavior problems, mental health conditions, or clinical disabilities. State agencies' use of congregate care has decreased unevenly over the past decade. Children with diagnosed mental health conditions or behavior problems tend to stay longer in congregate care. The Children's Bureau recommends measures to ensure appropriate use of congregate care and promote family-based care for children with behavioral or mental health issues. The Administration proposes a new Title IV-E eligibility requirement for children placed in congregate care to ensure appropriate use. States must assess if congregate care is the least restrictive and most family-like placement, document it in the child's case plan, and obtain judicial confirmation every six months. This aims to enable more children, including those with mental or behavioral issues, to be cared for in family settings. The Administration seeks authority to provide enhanced federal Title IV-E support for costs related to specialized training and salaries for therapeutic foster parents to care for children with behavioral and mental health challenges. This includes smaller caseloads and specialized training for caseworkers working with family-based care providers and children with mental or behavioral health needs, with a higher federal reimbursement rate to cover these costs. The proposal aims to reduce costs over time by decreasing congregate care use, with an initial cost of $78 million in FY2016 but a $69 million reduction in Title IV-E spending over 10 years. Tribes can apply for direct Title IV-E funding and grants to develop compliant plans. Five tribes have approved plans, but only two have implemented them as of February 2015. The Administration seeks authority under Title IV-E to allow tribal entities to apply for start-up funding at the time of plan approval, aiming to address the lack of funding hindering plan implementation. Successful applicants would receive higher federal reimbursement rates for administrative costs and a waiver of cost allocation requirements. The proposal is estimated to cost $27 million in FY2016 and $114 million over 10 years. Additionally, most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, including coverage for psychotropic medications. Limited research has been conducted to show that psychotropic medications alone are effective and safe for children with mental health disorders. Congress required state child welfare agencies to adopt specific protocols for the use of psychotropic medications for children in foster care. The Administration seeks new funds and program authority under the Title IV-E program for capacity and infrastructure building efforts led by state child welfare agencies. The Administration is seeking additional funding and authority under the Medicaid program to provide incentive payments to states for measurable outcome improvements in child welfare. The proposal aims to increase collaboration between state child welfare and Medicaid agencies for timely mental health assessments and services, including appropriate prescription of psychotropic medication and trauma-informed screening. The Administration is requesting $250 million in Title IV-E funds for competitive grants to state child welfare agencies. The funds will be used for mental health screening tools, coordination with Medicaid services, and improving child welfare outcomes. The Administration is requesting $250 million in FY2016 budget authority for the Title IV-E program, with an additional $500 million for Medicaid. The proposal aims to enhance child welfare services, workforce training, and data collection, with a focus on improving outcomes for children in foster care. The proposal aims to ensure that child support collected for children in foster care is used in their best interest, rather than as reimbursement for foster care costs. It includes ending the requirement for states to return a portion of child support to the federal government. The cost is estimated at $45 million in FY2016 and $476 million over 10 years. Additionally, the proposal seeks to eliminate APPLA as a permanency plan for children in care, emphasizing foster care as a temporary arrangement for safety. The current law focuses on promoting family-based care for foster children and requires states to have a permanency plan for children in foster care. However, a new law will eliminate APPLA as a permanency option for children under 16 in foster care, emphasizing the need for ongoing permanency efforts. The Administration's proposal aims to eliminate APPLA as a permanency option for children under 16 in foster care, requiring ongoing efforts for permanency. There is no estimated cost for this policy change, but states may use Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funding to support young people formerly in foster care up to age 23. This flexibility is only available to states offering extended Title IV-E assistance up to age 21. The proposal aims to eliminate APPLA as a permanency option for children under 16 in foster care, requiring ongoing efforts for permanency. States may use Chafee Foster Care Independence Program funding to support young people formerly in foster care up to age 23, but only if they offer extended Title IV-E assistance up to age 21. This change would not require additional funding as the CFCIP is a capped entitlement. Table A-1 shows the final or projected budget authority and outlays under the Title IV-E program for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Budget authority granted by Congress but not used does not result in a federal treasury outlay. The final federal budget authority under Title IV-E program for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance is reflected in Table A-1. The estimated effect of proposed policies would increase Title IV-E foster care outlays by $182 million in FY2016 and varying amounts in the following years. Proposed-law estimates are only shown for the foster care component as it is expected to result in a change in spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses its own model and assumptions to project program outlays under current and proposed law. CBO looks at projected outlays rather than budget authority when scoring the cost of a policy proposal. CBO is expected to provide its own projection of proposals included in the President's FY2016 budget in March 2015."
