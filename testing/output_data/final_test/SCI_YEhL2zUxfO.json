A study investigated target acquisition performance for the HVP based on target width, distance, approach direction with respect to gravity, and angle of approach, showing significant effects on user performance. Guidelines are proposed for ergonomic and performant HVP interface design in the context of increasing VR app popularity for creativity and productivity. The Handheld Virtual Panel (HVP) is a key tool in various VR applications like Google's TiltBrush, Oculus's Quill and Medium, and HTC Vive's MakeVR. It allows users to interact with virtual panels anchored to the non-dominant hand's controller using ray-tracing. HVPs offer advantages such as always being within reach, not cluttering the user's view, and leveraging proprioceptive sense. The Handheld Virtual Panel (HVP) is commonly used in VR applications like Google's TiltBrush and HTC Vive's MakeVR. Despite its prevalence, factors influencing target selection performance in HVPs are not well understood. There is a need to quantify HVP target selection performance while considering hand motion and other factors. The study measured HVP target acquisition performance in relation to factors like direction of movement with respect to gravity, angle of movement with respect to the body, distance, and width. Results show performance depends significantly on these factors, leading to proposed guidelines for ergonomic HVP interface design. Feiner et al. (1993) described three types of 2D windows in virtual or augmented environments. The HVP is a type of object-fixed window in VR, with the object being the non-dominant hand. Previous works have explored handheld panels for specific VR scenarios, such as Windows-in-Miniature (WIM) for navigation and manipulation. Studies have also looked at the effects of visual and haptic feedback for bimanual input in VR. Lindeman et al. found that users are faster in shape selection tasks when using a handheld panel in the non-dominant hand.

Previous works have explored handheld panels for specific VR scenarios, such as Windows-in-Miniature (WIM) for navigation and manipulation. Lindeman et al. found that users are faster in shape selection tasks when using a handheld panel in the non-dominant hand. Mine et al. also found that pointing to a target on a handheld panel was faster than on a fixed floating panel in space. However, there is a lack of research on target acquisition in the HVP with multiple target sizes and distances, as well as the performance of the current HVP incarnation with current hardware and interface. The study focuses on the effect of distance and width on movement time for the HVP, particularly in commercial VR systems using controllers for interaction. Hand tracking advancements in VR systems may lead to hand-gesture based interfaces. Studies show that whole-handed 3D movements impact movement time in pointing tasks. Directional differences in shoulder and forearm motion affect movement speed. Adduction movements are slower than abduction for 2D targets in 3D space. In current VR apps, right-handed users typically approach tools on the panel from right to left. In VR systems, users typically approach tools on the panel from right to left. Studies on target acquisition in 3D and VR address non-handheld scenarios. Gravity effects are considered for different starting positions and movement angles. Users use a controller to select targets by navigating a pointer and pressing a button. In VR systems, users navigate a pointer to select targets on a panel. Four variables were investigated: StartPos (top or bottom), Angle (22.5\u00b0 or 67.5\u00b0), Distance (2cm, 6cm, 18cm), and Width (0.63cm, 1.25cm, 2.5cm). The study focused on target acquisition in 3D and VR, considering gravity effects based on starting positions and movement angles. The study included 36 conditions with different distance levels (0.63cm, 1.25cm, 2.5cm) and panel sizes. Twelve participants (7 female, 5 male) used an Oculus Rift in a Unity3D application for target acquisition tasks in VR. Participants used an Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers in a Unity3D VR environment to select targets on a HVP attached to their non-dominant hand. Target acquisition time and errors were measured for each trial. Participants performed practice trials before the study, bringing the pointer back to StartPos before selecting the next target highlighted after 0.5s. Participants used an Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers in a Unity3D VR environment to select targets on a HVP attached to their non-dominant hand. They were instructed to perform the task quickly and accurately, with a 30s break after every 18 trials. Incorrect selections were given visual feedback. A 4-way ANOVA showed main effects of all variables on target acquisition time, with interaction effects of StartPos*Distance and StartPos*Angle. The study analyzed the interaction effects of StartPos*Angle and found significant differences in target acquisition time based on Width. Posthoc tests showed that all three widths had significantly different acquisition times. Additionally, a 1-way ANOVA for StartPos revealed an interaction effect with Distance on time. The study found significant differences in target acquisition time based on distance. Medium distance targets performed better than small and large distance targets for the top, while both small and medium distance targets outperformed large distance targets for the bottom. This difference in performance may be attributed to participants tilting the controller based on target location to improve accuracy. The study observed differences in target acquisition time based on distance and angle. Medium distance targets were easier to reach than small and large distance targets for the top, while small and medium distance targets were better than large distance targets for the bottom. The angle of the controller also affected performance, with different angles requiring varying levels of effort against gravity. The study found that gravity played a significant role in target acquisition, with participants exerting more effort against gravity at the bottom position. Error rates did not significantly vary with different variables. Participants reported the bottom starting position as more fatiguing, suggesting gravity's impact on task difficulty. The results recommend using larger horizontal widths in Human-Vertical Panels (HVPs) to minimize the effect of gravity. The study recommends using larger horizontal widths in Human-Vertical Panels (HVPs) to minimize the effect of gravity on target acquisition. It suggests minimizing hand motion by relying on wrist flicks and arranging targets on the panel to make them easier to reach from the bottom. Retargeting the HVP at a lower position could also reduce the effort needed to reach the targets. The study suggests using larger horizontal widths in Human-Vertical Panels (HVPs) to counter the effects of gravity on target acquisition. It also recommends placing high-frequency targets at the bottom of the panel and exploring retargeting techniques to minimize user motion against gravity. Additionally, the potential for HVPs to support bimanual parallel input based on Guiard's kinematic chain model is mentioned. The handheld virtual panel (HVP) is based on Guiard's kinematic chain model for bimanual input, emphasizing the principles of asymmetric two-handed interface design. Buxton et al. found that participants can work in parallel, improving task performance, but efficiency depends on task mechanics. Kabbash et al. showed that following Guiard's model improves performance in 2D tasks. HVP allows users to move both hands parallelly, potentially enhancing speed and performance. Bimanual parallel input is a promising direction for future exploration in commercial VR. Handheld virtual panel (HVP) is a popular technique for accessing tools in VR applications. An evaluation of target acquisition performance in HVP shows that width and gravity affect user performance. Addressing these limitations can enhance user experience in HVP-based VR applications."
