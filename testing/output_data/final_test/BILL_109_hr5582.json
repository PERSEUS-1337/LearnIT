The Act titled \"Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act\" defines the term \"breach of security of the system\" as the compromise of data integrity leading to unauthorized acquisition of personal information, excluding good faith employee acquisitions. The Act defines \"personal information\" as an individual's last name combined with specific data elements like social security number or account numbers. Substitute notice refers to posting on agency's website and notifying major media with a toll-free number for individuals to check if their personal data was compromised. SEC. 3. DATABASE SECURITY. SEC. 3. DATABASE SECURITY. Any agency or person engaged in interstate commerce that owns, licenses, or collects data containing personal information must notify individuals if a breach of security is discovered. If the data is not owned or licensed by the agency, they must notify the owner or licensee. Any agency or person must notify individuals if personal information is acquired by an unauthorized person through a breach of security. Notifications should be made promptly after discovering the breach, determining its scope, and taking necessary measures to prevent further disclosures. If law enforcement determines that notifying individuals of a security breach would hinder a criminal investigation, notification can be delayed. The burden of proof lies with the agency or person to show that all required notifications were made, including evidence justifying any delays. The notification of a security breach can be delayed if it would impede a criminal investigation, upon written request of the law enforcement agency. An exception is made for national security and law enforcement agencies if notification could damage national security or hinder law enforcement investigations. The head of the agency must certify in writing for this exception. The agency cannot use certification to hide violations of law, inefficiency, or competition restraint. A copy of the certification and its factual basis must be provided to Congress. Compliance can be achieved through written notification. The agency can provide compliance notification through written notification, e-mail notice with consent, or substitute notice if direct notice is impractical due to cost or lack of contact information. The agency must provide notification to individuals, including a description of the information acquired by an unauthorized person and a toll-free number for individuals to contact for more information. The agency or person must provide notification to individuals about the information maintained, including whether information was kept about them, and provide contact information for major credit reporting agencies. If notification is required for more than 1,000 individuals, consumer reporting agencies must also be notified promptly. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires agencies to compile and maintain consumer files nationwide, notifying individuals about their information. Violations may result in fines up to $1,000 per individual affected or $50,000 per day. Violators can also be subject to court injunctions. Enforcement of compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act includes fines and court injunctions. The Federal Trade Commission can enforce this section, and amendments allow for fraud alerts regarding compromised personal financial information. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT BY STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL. State attorneys general can bring civil actions on behalf of residents to enforce compliance with the Act, obtain damages, or seek other appropriate relief in court. Before filing an action under the Act, the State attorney general must provide written notice and a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General of the United States, unless it is determined to be infeasible to do so. Before filing an action under the Act, the State attorney general must provide notice and a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General at the time of filing.
