    "content": "Committees in the House and Senate have evolved from ad-hoc to permanent, standing committees organized around topics. The system was reinforced through legislative reorganization acts in 1946 and 1970. Communication within Congress has advanced with technology, allowing real-time interaction with constituents. The communication strategies of congressional committees have evolved with the development of online social networking services, such as email, official websites, blogs, YouTube channels, Twitter, and Facebook pages. These technologies have enhanced the ability of committees to share information directly with stakeholder groups, including other Members, federal agencies, and individual private citizens. The report examines how congressional committees are using social media to communicate with stakeholder groups, including individual private citizens. Concerns have been raised about adapting existing laws and regulations to new electronic technologies. Social media is altering how Members organize and manage their offices, gather support for political goals, and may transform the nature of representation in the United States. Patterns of committee use of Twitter and Facebook are analyzed, along with three potential implications of social media. Twitter, created in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, allows users to send short messages known as \"tweets.\" It enables direct interaction with the public, real-time engagement with advocacy groups, and outreach to public constituencies. Users can post thoughts, opinions, promote events, and announce products and services. Legislative branch entities actively use Twitter for communication purposes. Several legislative branch entities like the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Library of Congress (LOC), and Government Publishing Office (GPO) use Twitter for communication. Restaurant Associates, the House's food service vendor, also utilizes Twitter to announce daily specials and events. Twitter's 140 character limit allows for quick transmission of information globally, enabling instant communication regardless of physical distance. Individual users can \"follow\" others and read their tweets. Twitter allows users to \"follow\" others and read their tweets, providing instant access to information. Launched in 2004, Facebook is the largest social networking service, offering profiles and pages for users to share content. Facebook users can post pictures, videos, messages, and comments. They can limit visibility to approved friends. Users can become fans of pages by clicking \"like,\" and the page's activity appears on their personalized newsfeed. Newsfeed content includes links, updates, videos, comments, and photos. Profiles have a timeline capturing posts, and friends can also post on it with user permission. This report analyzes committee use of Twitter and Facebook, including adoption rates, follower numbers, posting frequency, content themes, and user interactions. Data was collected from House and Senate committees' social media accounts between June 21 and October 31, 2013, with the help of graduate students at the University of Texas. Custom programming scripts were used to gather information from committees' official public accounts. The dataset analyzed committee use of Twitter and Facebook from June 21 to October 31, 2013, with a total of 15,524 cases across 54 Twitter and 28 Facebook accounts. Data collection was automated, capturing date, time, and content details for each tweet or post. Researchers created coding categories and examined each post to record coding results. The team examined tweets and Facebook posts, conducting coding and internal reliability tests. Results treat all committee social media accounts as structurally identical, covering a 4\u00bd month snapshot of activity. The analysis acknowledges potential variations in committee member involvement and rapid changes in technology usage. As of October 21, 2013, 54 Twitter accounts and 28 Facebook accounts were identified for House and Senate committees. Adoption of Twitter and Facebook varied among committee majorities and minorities. Data on social media adoption by committees mirrored early adoption patterns by Members of Congress in the House. In the House, committee majorities (Republicans) had the highest adoption rates for Twitter and Facebook. Senate committee majorities (Democrats) have adopted Twitter and Facebook in greater proportions than Senate committee minorities (Republicans). 184,612 unique accounts were following at least one committee on Twitter. The number of Twitter followers for congressional committees was 322,479, providing insight into their potential reach. A social media tracking website generated a \"Social Authority\" metric, with President Obama and the Huffington Post having the highest scores. 53% of accounts following committees had a score of 1, indicating infrequent or computer-generated users. Average and median follower numbers and \"Social Authority\" scores for committees were relatively low regardless of party affiliation. The number of followers for congressional committees is relatively low, with an average \"Social Authority\" score of 13. Committees sent a total of 12,946 tweets and 2,308 Facebook posts over 4\u00bd months. The data collection period captured time when Congress was in session, in recess, and during the government shutdown in 2013. During the data collection period, congressional committees tweeted and posted more on Facebook when Congress was in session compared to recess. On average, 124.7 tweets and 22.5 Facebook posts were made per day during session, while only 42.7 tweets and 9.5 Facebook posts were made per day during recess. During the government shutdown, there was an average of 87.1 tweets and 10 Facebook posts per day, higher than during recess but not as high as during regular session days. Committees within Congress have various roles, including conducting investigations, making studies, issuing reports, and preparing measures for action. During the data collection period, congressional committees focused on legislative and oversight functions in their tweets and Facebook posts. Tweets and posts were categorized as legislative if they mentioned active legislation or committee actions, and as oversight if they related to monitoring federal agencies. Less than half of the social media content addressed these responsibilities. During the data collection period, congressional committees focused on legislative and oversight functions in their tweets and Facebook posts. Approximately 41% of the content addressed legislation or oversight, with committees using Facebook slightly more for oversight and Twitter slightly more for legislation. The difference in platform use may reflect the suitability of Twitter for promoting legislative activities and Facebook for providing content on oversight responsibilities. The study analyzed committee tweets and Facebook posts, categorizing them into 12 major message categories. These categories included committee announcements, actions, promotions, policy information, Member information, political stance, media, outreach, responses, personal content, campaign-related posts, and others. Tweets and posts referenced committee proceedings, actions, decisions, and promotions to maintain a positive image. The committee's social media presence focused on promoting a positive image, sharing policy information, and highlighting specific bills. Small business owners faced difficulties enrolling in new health care plans online. Chairman Smith's op-ed on asteroid retrieval was positively mentioned. Hill: #Asteroid Retrieval is Costly and Uninspiring. Tweets and posts included bill advocacy, criticisms, and value statements related to specific committee business. Also, tweets and posts referenced nongovernmental media content and called for constituent interaction. Tweets and posts included calls for constituent interaction, responses to followers, personal comments, and miscellaneous content. Each tweet and post was categorized based on its content. The most common categories of tweets and Facebook posts from the committee were \"political stance\" and \"Member promotion,\" comprising 29% of tweets and 26% of Facebook posts. Other categories included \"policy information,\" \"committee announcement,\" and \"media.\" Social media is designed to be interactive. Overall, only 5.52% of all tweets from congressional committees contained two-way communication language, with interactivity measured through retweets, hashtags, and followers. By retweeting constituents or stakeholders, committees could initiate dialogue or present alternative viewpoints. Overall, 27% of outreach tweets from congressional committees involved retweeting another user's tweet. The types of content that committees retweet were categorized into Nongovernmental, Committee Member, Governmental, Other Member of Congress, and Chair or Ranking Member. Table 3 displays the percentage of retweets across all House and Senate committees. Around 70% of retweets were from governmental officials, with 40% from committee members, 16% from external governmental sources, and 14% from non-committee Members of Congress. One-third of retweets came from outside the federal government, showing that committees mainly retweet federal sources. Overall, committees primarily use Twitter for internal communication, with 40% of retweets from other committee members and 54% from Members of Congress. Democrats tend to retweet messages from both \"Nongovernmental\" and \"Governmental\" sources, while Republicans more frequently retweet \"Committee Member\" and \"Congress Member\" sources. Majority parties in both the House and Senate retweet more often than minority parties, reflecting their control of committee agendas. The majority party adopts Twitter at a higher rate than the minority party on committee agendas, using retweets to extend message reach. Surprisingly, the minority party does not retweet as often, despite past research showing they tend to use Twitter more. Hashtags categorize tweets and increase message visibility, allowing them to reach a wider audience. Congressional committees use hashtags to self-categorize messages and facilitate searchability. Hashtags are used by congressional committees to self-categorize messages and increase visibility. An analysis of the 20 most frequently used hashtags between June 21 and October 31, 2013, showed varied purposes for their use, such as attracting followers or media attention. Some tweets using specific hashtags like \"#pjnet\" were retweeted over 12,000 times, indicating a strategy to expand reach through additional retweets. Using hashtags in tweets can lead to increased retweets, expanding the reach of a message. However, this can also result in loss of control over the message and potential for misinterpretation. Hashtags can differentiate messages within committees or political parties, reflecting their agendas. For example, \"#Obamacare\" is often used by Republicans, while \"#ACA\" is favored by Democrats, influencing the tone of the conversation. The rise of social media and electronic communications has wide-ranging implications for legislative politics, reducing communication costs and increasing speed. This is altering how Members organize and manage offices, gather support, and may transform representation in the United States. Social media has the potential to change how committees interact with the public, advocacy groups, and public constituencies in Congress. The use of platforms like Twitter and Facebook allows for direct contact with committees, which was previously done by lobbyists and association managers. The impact of social media on committee behavior cannot be easily generalized or predicted due to the rapid changes in technology usage. The adoption of social media has the potential to revolutionize how congressional committees communicate, providing public access for the first time. Previously, committees primarily interacted with Members of Congress, the executive branch, and stakeholder groups through press releases and websites. The shift to social media could change this dynamic, allowing for direct engagement with the public. The use of social media by congressional committees for communication with constituents is limited compared to individual Representatives and Senators. While social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook allow for real-time interaction and feedback from constituents, committees do not fully utilize these interactive features. Only 5.5% of committee tweets respond to other users, indicating a lack of engagement with the public compared to individual Members. Committees use social media to supplement traditional communication strategies by announcing hearings, legislation, and positions. Interactivity is limited, mainly consisting of retweets from journalists and Members of Congress. It is unclear if committees engage directly with constituents and how they use received information. Public opinion could potentially shift the focus of committee work away from oversight and regulation. Committees could use social media to engage the public in their activities, allowing real-time feedback during hearings. This interactive approach may introduce uncertainty in the legislative process, but communication with individual citizens is becoming more common. Prior to the rise of electronic communications, the cost of communication was a significant impediment for both Members and citizens. Electronic communications have virtually no direct marginal cost, allowing for easier and more frequent communication between them. The rise of electronic communication media has significantly increased citizen communications with Congress, with almost half a billion messages reaching Members annually. The near-zero marginal cost of electronic communication has made it easier for citizens to contact committees, opening up the system to greater public interaction. The rise of electronic communication media has increased citizen interactions with Congress, allowing for faster and more direct communication through email and social media. This shift has implications for how committees use new platforms and shape their communication strategies. The rise of electronic communication media has revolutionized how Members and constituents share real-time information, enabling virtual town halls through social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. This allows for immediate interaction and question-asking, enhancing communication between citizens and Congress. Virtual town halls through social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook allow for immediate interaction and question-asking, enhancing communication between citizens and Congress. Committees could potentially use social media for public comment or testimony in future field hearings, but they may face unique challenges due to their longer-term focus on policy and executive branch operations. Committees serve as the primary vehicle for gathering and analyzing information, specializing in both policies and the politics surrounding them. Advocacy groups utilize various methods to garner grassroots support for their causes, such as leveraging the media to promote public health issues like alcohol control, lead poisoning, and HIV prevention. Social media plays a crucial role in expanding outreach and communication efforts. Advocacy groups use social media, particularly Twitter, to engage followers and promote advocacy messages. Encouraging followers to contact government decision-makers for policy change is an effective strategy, although official resources must be used appropriately according to House and Senate rules. Congressional committees are restricted from including grassroots lobbying or promotional content on their websites. The use of social media by congressional committees for advocacy purposes may potentially violate laws prohibiting the use of appropriated funds to influence public policy. Research shows that only a small percentage of tweets and Facebook posts contain messages encouraging contact with government officials. Committees using social media need to be cautious about the content they share. Social media platforms like Facebook need to be mindful of the messages shared and their potential calls to action for followers."
