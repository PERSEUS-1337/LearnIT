    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Article 23 adds a new section to the Revenue and Taxation Code for the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund. Individuals can voluntarily contribute to the fund on their tax returns in full dollar amounts. The designation under subdivision (a) on the tax return is irrevocable. If payments and credits do not cover the taxpayer's liability, the designation is disregarded. The Franchise Tax Board will add a space for the \"Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund\" on the tax return form for voluntary contributions of $1 or more to fund programs for cat and dog homelessness prevention. Programs aimed at preventing and eliminating cat and dog homelessness, as well as addressing animal cruelty and neglect, can receive tax-deductible contributions under Section 18901.1. The Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund is established in the State Treasury to receive tax-deductible contributions for programs addressing animal homelessness and cruelty. The Franchise Tax Board notifies the Controller of taxpayer contributions, which are then transferred to the Fund for allocation by the Legislature. The Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund receives tax-deductible contributions for programs addressing animal homelessness and cruelty. Funds are allocated to the Franchise Tax Board, Controller, and Department of Food and Agriculture for reimbursement and distribution as needed. The Department of Food and Agriculture receives funds for public awareness activities promoting charitable tax deductions for the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund. Up to $250,000 will be given to a city, county, or city and county animal control agency or shelter for spay and neuter activities to prevent cat and dog homelessness. The remaining funds will be used for programs to prevent cat and dog homelessness or for animal cruelty prevention and prosecution. Grants will be given to eligible animal control agencies, shelters, or humane society affiliates in California. The Department of Food and Agriculture oversees the grant program for preventing animal homelessness and cruelty in California. Grants cannot be used for administrative expenses or out-of-state purposes. The program may consult with the State Department of Public Health. The fund will not replace state General Fund money. This article will be in effect until January 1, 2022, or the fifth taxable year after the fund's appearance on tax returns, and will be repealed on December 1 of that year. The Franchise Tax Board determines the minimum contribution amount for the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund each year by September 1. This information is then provided to the Department of Food and Agriculture. The Franchise Tax Board estimates contributions to the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund for the calendar year. If contributions fall below the minimum amount, the article will be inoperative for taxable years starting January 1 and repealed by December 1. The minimum contribution amount for the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund is $250,000 for the second calendar year after its first appearance on the tax return. The Franchise Tax Board will adjust this amount for each calendar year starting from the third year after its initial appearance. The minimum contribution amount for the Prevention of Animal Homelessness and Cruelty Fund is adjusted annually based on the California Consumer Price Index percentage change received before August 1st. The contribution amount is calculated by multiplying the prior year's minimum contribution by the inflation factor adjustment."
