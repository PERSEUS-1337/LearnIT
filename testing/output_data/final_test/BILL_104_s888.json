    "content": "The \"Spectrum Auction Act of 1995\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Act includes findings related to spectrum allocation. The Congress finds that the National Telecommunications and Information Administration report states an additional 179 megahertz of spectrum is needed in the next ten years for various mobile services. An additional 85 megahertz is required for a total of 264 megahertz to meet demand in the United States. The United States needs a total of 264 megahertz for the Intelligent Transportation System. The Federal Government will transfer 235 megahertz of spectrum for non-governmental use by 2004. 50 megahertz has already been reallocated. The United States needs 264 megahertz for the Intelligent Transportation System. 50 megahertz has already been reallocated for exclusive non-governmental use, 45 megahertz will be reallocated in 1995 for both exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental use, 25 megahertz will be reallocated in 1997 for exclusive non-governmental use, 70 megahertz will be reallocated in 1999 for both exclusive non-governmental and mixed governmental use, and the final 45 megahertz will be reallocated for mixed governmental and non-governmental use by 2004. The Federal Communications Commission is reserving spectrum for emerging technologies, but the projected spectrum needs in the United States exceed these reserves. The authority to assign radio spectrum frequencies through auctions expires on September 30, 1998, and a significant portion of reallocated spectrum remains unassigned to non-governmental users. Expediting the transfer of Federal governmental users to new frequencies could be achieved by allowing reimbursement for relocation costs from non-governmental users. The extension of auction authority and reimbursement for Federal users is crucial. Governmental reimbursement for Federal users relocation costs would enable the market to efficiently utilize available spectrum. SEC. 3. Extension and expansion of auction authority. Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to grant licenses or permits through competitive bidding for the use of electromagnetic spectrum, excluding public safety radio services and new terrestrial digital television services. The Commission assigns digital television services to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to replace current television licenses. Paragraphs are renumbered and the year 1998 is changed to 2002 in paragraph 10. Reimbursement of federal relocation costs is addressed in Section 4. Section 113 of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Act is amended to allow Federal entities operating Government stations to accept reimbursement for costs incurred in relocating operations to different radio spectrum frequencies. Federal entities operating Government stations can accept reimbursement for costs incurred in relocating operations to different radio spectrum frequencies. Reimbursements will be deposited in the Federal entity's account in the Treasury of the United States and will be available for the operations of the Federal entity without the need for appropriation or fiscal year limitation. Any person seeking to relocate a Federal Government station within a band allocated for mixed Federal and non-Federal use can submit a petition to NTIA for relocation. The Federal Government station's operating license can be limited to secondary status once certain requirements are met. The Government station is guaranteed reimbursement for all relocation costs incurred by the Federal entity, including engineering, equipment, site acquisition, construction, and regulatory fees. The person seeking relocation must complete all necessary activities, such as constructing replacement facilities and obtaining new frequencies for the Federal entity. Any required replacement facilities, equipment modifications, or changes must also be completed. The Federal Government station is guaranteed reimbursement for relocation costs, including engineering, equipment, site acquisition, and regulatory fees. If the new facilities or spectrum are not comparable, the person seeking relocation must remedy defects or reimburse the Federal entity. Federal action can expedite spectrum transfer for Government stations. The Government station must relocate its spectrum use to other frequencies reserved for Federal use or consolidate with other Federal stations to maximize spectrum for non-Federal use. The President aims to reallocate the 1710 to 1755 megahertz frequency band by January 1, 2000, and non-Federal users can relocate Federal power agencies under certain conditions. The term 'Federal entity' refers to any Department, agency, or element of the Federal Government using radio frequency spectrum. The 'Spectrum Reallocation Final Report' is a report submitted by the Secretary to the President and Congress as required. The Secretary of Commerce must submit a report and timetable to the President and Congress within 9 months, recommending the reallocation of three frequency bands (225-400 MHz, 3625-3650 MHz, and 5850-5925 MHz) not previously recommended for reallocation in the Spectrum Reallocation Final Report. Public comment will be sought before submission."
