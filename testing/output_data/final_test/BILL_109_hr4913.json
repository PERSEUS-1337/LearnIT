    "content": "The \"Corrosion Prevention Act of 2006\" may provide a credit for corrosion prevention and mitigation measures under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Corrosion Prevention Act of 2006\" offers a tax credit of 50% for qualified corrosion prevention and mitigation expenditures, including engineering design, materials, and technology installation. The \"Corrosion Prevention Act of 2006\" requires certification for design, material, application, or installation related to corrosion prevention technology. This technology includes corrosion-protective coatings, chemical treatments, corrosion-resistant metals, and cathodic protection. The \"Corrosion Prevention Act of 2006\" mandates certification for corrosion prevention technology, including coatings, chemical treatments, resistant metals, and cathodic protection. Qualified property for tax credit must be susceptible to corrosion, depreciable, placed in service by the taxpayer, and located in the US. Recapture of the credit occurs if a recapture event occurs with the qualified property. The tax credit for qualified corrosion prevention and mitigation expenditures may be recaptured if the property does not meet certain criteria. The recapture amount is determined by the applicable recapture percentage and the decrease in credits allowed for prior taxable years. The applicable recapture percentage is determined from a specific table. If the property no longer qualifies, recapture percentages range from 100% to 20% over consecutive years after being placed in service. Recapture event is defined as the cessation of use or change in ownership of qualified property with the allowable tax credit. The qualified property assumes recapture liability in writing when acquired by a new owner, who then becomes responsible for any recapture liability as if there had been no change in ownership. This rule does not apply to tax-exempt entities. The tax for the taxable year shall be increased only with respect to credits used to reduce tax liability. Credits not used to reduce tax liability will have carryforwards and carrybacks adjusted accordingly. No credits against tax will result in an increase in tax under this subsection. The increase in tax under this subsection will not affect any credits under this chapter or section 55. Additionally, the increase in tax will not apply if the property ceases to qualify due to a casualty loss that is restored by reconstruction or replacement. The basis adjustments for property credits reduce the increase in basis resulting from the expenditure. If there is a recapture amount determined for property with reduced basis, the basis will be adjusted before the event causing the recapture. The recapture amount for tax purposes shall increase the basis before the event, and no deductions or credits are allowed for expenses under this section. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary to implement this section. The credit will be included in the general business credit. The text introduces a new paragraph (31) regarding corrosion prevention and mitigation credit under section 45N(a). A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding corrosion prevention and mitigation measures under section 45N shall apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
