    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Information Independence Act\". The Congress finds that access to accurate information about the effect of nutrients on disease is crucial for informed consumer choice and public health. Despite court rulings, the FDA continues to suppress this information, hindering efforts to improve health and reduce healthcare costs. The federal government must ensure that health claims are evaluated rationally, fairly, and in compliance with constitutional requirements and the intent of Congress. Authority over health claims evaluation should be removed from the FDA and placed in the hands of Independent entities. The evaluation of health claims should be removed from the FDA and given to Independent Scientific Reviewers without bias against food and dietary supplement health claims. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY FOR MAKING HEALTH CLAIMS. The Federal Government cannot restrict the distribution of dietary supplements or nutritional foods based on unapproved health claims if the product clearly states that the claims are not FDA approved and there is no evidence of misleading information posing a threat to consumers. If the FDA suspects misleading information, an independent review will be conducted. Before taking action against dietary supplements or nutritional foods with potentially misleading information, the FDA must submit the claims to an independent review board for evaluation. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to define an Independent Scientific Reviewer as a person with a Ph.D. or M.D. who has been employed in academia for at least 5 years and has never worked for the FDA or any other health-related government agency. The Independent Scientific Reviewer, defined as a person with a Ph.D. or M.D. who has been employed in academia for at least 5 years, must sign oaths pledging to evaluate health claim petitions strictly according to specified criteria, maintain confidentiality, and provide complete written evaluations to the Secretary. The Independent Scientific Reviewer, with a Ph.D. or M.D. and 5 years in academia, must evaluate health claim petitions objectively, maintain confidentiality, and submit a complete written evaluation to the Secretary within 180 days, signing an oath to exercise independent professional judgment. SEC. 5. HEALTH CLAIMS. Section 403(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include dietary supplements and health-related conditions, with a focus on preventing, treating, or curing diseases. The Secretary must issue regulations within 30 days of receiving an evaluation from an Independent Scientific Reviewer authorizing approved claims on labels with recommended disclaimers. The Secretary's duties in this regard are nondelegable. Subparagraphs are amended to remove certain clauses. SEC. 6. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW. A new section is added to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for independent scientific review. The Health Information Independence Act mandates the Secretary to invite scientists from accredited universities to apply as Independent Scientific Reviewers every 180 days. Scientists with Ph.D. or M.D. qualifications and 5 years of professorial experience are eligible to apply. The Health Information Independence Act requires the Secretary to appoint Independent Scientific Reviewers to evaluate health claims for accuracy and safety. Scientists with specific qualifications will be randomly selected to review scientific evidence on nutrient-disease associations and submit their evaluations within 180 days. The Health Information Independence Act mandates the appointment of Independent Scientific Reviewers to assess health claims for scientific evidence within 180 days. Reviewers recommend approval if evidence supports the claim, or disapprove if no credible evidence is found and no accurate disclaimer is provided. The Health Information Independence Act requires Independent Scientific Reviewers to evaluate health claims within 180 days. Reviewers must have a Ph.D. or M.D. and 5 years of full-time experience in relevant fields. The Health Information Independence Act requires Independent Scientific Reviewers to evaluate health claims within 180 days. Reviewers must have a Ph.D. or M.D. and 5 years of full-time experience in relevant fields such as biochemistry, epidemiology, pharmacology, pharmacognosy, or nutrition at an accredited university. Reviewers should not have been employed by the FDA or any other agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, except for reviewing health claim petitions. They must evaluate health claim petitions strictly according to specified criteria and maintain confidentiality about the review process. The Health Information Independence Act requires Independent Scientific Reviewers to evaluate health claims within 180 days. Reviewers must have a Ph.D. or M.D. and 5 years of full-time experience in relevant fields. They should not have been employed by the FDA or any other agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, except for reviewing health claim petitions. Reviewers must submit a complete written evaluation of the health claim to the Secretary within 180 days and exercise independent professional judgment. Failure to abide by these rules will result in consequences. The Health Information Independence Act requires Independent Scientific Reviewers to evaluate health claims within 180 days. Reviewers must have a Ph.D. or M.D. and 5 years of full-time experience in relevant fields. Failure to abide by these rules will result in disbarment from the program and disallowance of compensation. The Secretary confirms the status of Independent Scientific Reviewers within 30 days of meeting criteria and randomly selects reviewers within 15 days. The Health Information Independence Act requires Independent Scientific Reviewers to evaluate health claims within 180 days. Reviewers must have a Ph.D. or M.D. and 5 years of full-time experience in relevant fields. The Secretary selects an Independent Scientific Reviewer at random within 15 days of approving a health claim, who then evaluates all publicly available scientific evidence relevant to the claim. The Independent Scientific Reviewer evaluates scientific evidence for health claims. If credible evidence supports the claim, it is recommended for approval. If the evidence is inconclusive or potentially misleading, a disclaimer is recommended with the approved claim. The Independent Scientific Reviewer evaluates scientific evidence for health claims. If credible evidence supports the claim, it is recommended for approval with a concise disclaimer. If no credible evidence supports the claim or a disclaimer cannot eliminate misleading connotations, the Secretary may not approve the health claim. Independent Scientific Reviewers are compensated $40,000 for their evaluation, and sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance. If a certification under subsection (a)(4) is not met, the Secretary may debar the Independent Scientific Reviewer from the program and withhold the $40,000 fee. SEC. 7. Legal effect of health claim recommendation by independent scientific reviewers. New section 403E is added to Chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Secretary must make publicly available the evaluation and scientific evidence of a health claim within 30 days of receiving it from an Independent Scientific Reviewer. The recommendation of the Reviewer must be published in the Federal Register without any alterations, including whether the claim is approved or disapproved, reasons for the decision, and if a disclaimer is required. The Secretary must make the evaluation and scientific evidence of a health claim publicly available within 30 days. Any aggrieved party can appeal an order on health claims recommendations directly to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit within 90 days. The Department of Health and Human Services will cover all costs of implementing the Act from its existing budget. The Act eliminates the need for the FDA to review health claim petitions for foods and dietary supplements, leading to staff reductions and cost savings in the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. SEC. 9 amends the definition in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to distinguish between food, including dietary supplements, and drugs."
