Initially excluded from Social Security, federal employees were mandated to participate in Social Security in 1983. This led to the development of the Federal Employees' Retirement System. The Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) Act of 1986 established FERS, which includes Social Security, a basic retirement annuity, and the Thrift Savings Plan. Most federal employees hired after 1983 are enrolled in FERS. Workers can retire at different ages based on years of service, with the minimum retirement age currently at 56. Employees with at least 10 years of service can opt for a reduced FERS annuity at the minimum retirement age. The annuity is reduced by 5% for each year before age 62. CSRS has different minimum retirement ages based on years of service, with no provision for early retirement benefits except in special circumstances like a reduction in force. Employees aged 50 or older with 20 or more years of service, or those with 25 or more years of service at any age, can opt for voluntary early retirement. The retirement annuity is reduced by 2% for each year before age 55 under CSRS. Retirement annuity is based on the average of the highest three consecutive years of basic pay multiplied by years of service and accrual rate. FERS accrual rate is 1% of basic pay per year, increasing to 1.1% for workers with 20 or more years of service retiring at age 62 or later. Under FERS, a worker with 29 years of service will receive a 29% annuity of their high-three average pay, which can increase to 33% if retirement is delayed by one year. For CSRS, the benefit accrual rate increases with length of service, yielding a pension of 56.25% of high-three average pay for 30 years of federal service. FERS accrual rates are lower due to Social Security benefits, and federal workers enrolled in FERS have 1% of their basic pay contributed to the TSP by their agencies. In 2018, workers under FERS or CSRS can contribute up to $18,500 to the TSP, with an additional $6,000 for workers aged 50 and older. Contributions are made on a pre-tax basis, except for the Roth TSP option. Qualified distributions from the Roth TSP option are tax-free. Agency matching contributions are available for workers under FERS who contribute the first 5% of their pay to the TSP. Workers under CSRS can contribute to the TSP but do not receive matching contributions. In FY2016, 94.1% of federal employees were enrolled in FERS, while 71.5% of employee annuitants were receiving pension benefits accrued under CSRS. The number of FERS annuitants is relatively small compared to CSRS due to the program's newer implementation. The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 established a program for federal employees, with 2.6 million people receiving civil service annuities in FY2016. California had the most annuitants, while Vermont had the fewest. Five states accounted for one-third of all annuitants. In FY2016, 99,242 civilian federal employees retired, with 79.4% being normal retirements and 1.1% voluntary early retirements. Normal retirement under CSRS can occur at age 55 with 30 years of service. Normal retirement can occur as early as age 55 with 30 years of service under CSRS. For FERS, the minimum retirement age is currently 56, increasing to 57 for workers born in 1970 or later. Workers can also retire at 60 with 20 years of service or 62 with 5 years. In FY2016, the average age for voluntary normal retirement was 62.1 for CSRS and 63.4 for FERS employees. Those under CSRS had an average of 37 years of service, while FERS retirees had 22.2 years. Over 1,000 federal employees took voluntary early retirement in FY2016, with an average age of 54.3 for CSRS and 54.5 for FERS employees. In FY2016, federal employees took various types of retirement. CSRS employees who took voluntary early retirement had an average service length of 31.9 years, while those who took normal retirement had 37.0 years. FERS employees taking early retirement had an average service length of 25.6 years, compared to 22.2 years for those taking normal retirement. Disability retirements accounted for 6.7% of all retirements, with CSRS disability retirees being 53.2 years old and FERS disability retirees being 50.5 years old on average. Involuntary retirements made up 1.2% of all retirements, with CSRS retirees receiving an average monthly annuity of $4,755 and FERS retirees receiving $1,714. In FY2016, CSRS retirees received an average monthly annuity of $4,755, while new FERS annuitants received $1,714 per month. CSRS retirees received larger annuities due to longer service and the design of the program. FERS provides a smaller annuity because employees also participate in Social Security and can save for retirement through the TSP. FERS retirees at minimum retirement age with 30 years of service receive a supplement until age 62 equal to their Social Security benefit earned while employed. In FY2016, federal employees retiring at age 60 or 61 with 20 or more years of service receive the FERS supplement, which ends at age 62. Agencies can offer voluntary early retirement or separation incentives. Early retirement is possible at age 50 with 20 years of service, and incentives of up to $25,000 are available. In FY2016, federal employees retiring at age 60 or 61 with 20 or more years of service receive the FERS supplement, which ends at age 62. Agencies can offer voluntary early retirement or separation incentives of up to $25,000. The Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund paid annuities to retired federal employees and survivor annuitants in FY2016, with median monthly annuities ranging from $1,082 to $3,118. The median survivor benefit under FERS was $432, smaller than CSRS benefits due to fewer years of service. COLAs for both CSRS and FERS are based on CPI-W inflation rates. If there is no increase in CPI-W, there is no COLA for annuities under CSRS or FERS. In the third quarter of the current calendar year, there is no COLA for annuities paid under CSRS or FERS. The effective date for COLAs is December, appearing in benefit checks issued in January. FERS COLAs are paid to retired workers aged 62 or older, disabled, and survivor beneficiaries of any age. FERS COLAs are less than inflation rates above 2.0%. CSRS COLAs are not subject to the same limits. The CPI-W increased by 2.0% from the third quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2018, resulting in a 2.0% COLA for both CSRS and FERS benefits starting in January 2018. The CSRS and FERS COLA for January 2018 is 2.0%. The CSRDF balance in FY2016 was $864.5 billion, invested in U.S. Treasury bonds. The fund's end-of-FY2016 balance was $879.8 billion, more than 10 times the annuities paid out that year. The fund receives income from various sources, including employee contributions. The CSRDF receives income from various sources, including employee contributions, annual payments from the Treasury, agency contributions, and interest payments on Treasury bonds. Agency contributions under CSRS are 7.0% of payroll, supplemented by transfers from the Treasury. Agency contributions to FERS are required by law. Smaller cash payments come from the District of Columbia and additional contributions from federal workers, often former employees returning to government service. The CSRDF receives agency contributions equal to the full actuarial cost of the program, totaling 13.7% of payroll for FERS employees hired before 2013 and 11.9% for those hired in 2013 or later. These contributions, along with employee contributions and Treasury bonds, fund annuity payments to retired federal employees and their dependents, totaling $82.5 billion in FY2016. The balance of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) increased from $238 billion to $972 billion between FY1990 and FY2018. This rise is due to the transition from pay-as-you-go financing under CSRS to advance-funding under FERS. In 1969, P.L. 91-93 mandated annual payments to the fund from the U.S. Treasury's general revenues to address funding shortfalls. The Office of Personnel Management estimates that the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will reach a steady state in the 21st century, with enough budget authority to finance 18 to 20 years of benefits. The number of civil service annuitants has increased significantly since 1970, but the rate of increase has slowed since 1985. Between 1940 and 1955, civilian federal employment grew from less than 1 million to 2.4 million. The number of federal employees continued to increase slowly after 1955, reaching nearly 3 million by 1970. This growth was influenced by the war in Vietnam and the creation of social programs like Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s. The number of civil service annuitants also increased steadily from just under 2 million in 1985 to over 2.6 million in 2016. Civil service annuities have grown due to factors like increases in average life-span, real wages, and inflation. Cost-of-living adjustments since 1962 maintain the nominal value but not the real value of annuities. Rates of increase in retiring federal employees' average pay affect annuities. The average real value of civil service annuities per annuitant is expected to decline in the future due to a growing number of new retirees enrolled in FERS rather than CSRS. FERS annuities are smaller but supplemented by Social Security benefits and the TSP. Civilian federal employment decreased from FY1994 to FY2006 but increased slightly from FY2006 to FY2013. From FY2006 to FY2013, total federal employment increased by 2.3%, with non-postal employment rising by 11.6%. The growth in federal employment was mainly driven by the executive branch, which saw a 1.2% increase in employees. In FY2013, judicial branch employment exceeded legislative branch employment. Additionally, under CSRS, employees with 30 or more years of service can retire at 55 with an unreduced annuity, while the minimum retirement age under FERS is 56. The minimum retirement age under FERS is 56, while employees with 30 or more years of service under CSRS can retire at 55 with an unreduced annuity. The average age of federal employees who retired in FY2016 was 61.3, with those taking normal retirement retiring at 61.8 on average. CSRS employees tend to be older than FERS employees, with no CSRS employees under 45 in 2015 compared to 38% of FERS employees. Approximately 10% of CSRS employees and 33% of FERS employees were between the ages of 45 and 54. Most CSRS employees were aged 55 or older, while only 28% of FERS employees were in that age group."
