    "content": "We introduce a new problem in the intersection of semi-supervised learning and contextual bandits, inspired by applications like clinical trials and dialog systems. Our approach combines contextual bandit and graph convolutional networks to create a multi-GCN embedded contextual bandit. The problem of Online Partially Rewarded (OPR) learning is formulated, addressing challenges from both semi-supervised and contextual bandit literature. Our algorithms are validated on real-world datasets, with a focus on incremental data collection and situations where environment feedback is limited. In Online Partially Rewarded (OPR) learning, feedback on predictions is limited, making it challenging to determine the true label. This scenario is common in clinical trials where patients may not provide follow-up feedback or in dialog systems where users may not give feedback on responses. Obtaining labeled data in such cases requires human experts or expensive resources. In semi-supervised learning, obtaining labeled data is costly, while unlabeled data is abundant. The challenge lies in learning from unlabeled observations. Online semi-supervised learning is rarely explored, especially with bandit-like feedback instead of labels. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) can be adapted to this setting. The multi-armed bandit problem addresses the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in online learning. Approaches like Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LINUCB) and Contextual Thompson Sampling (CTS) assume linear dependencies. In Online Partially Rewarded learning, the authors introduce two extensions to GCN for the bandit problem. They address the challenge of missing rewards and present quantitative evidence on four datasets. The OPR keywords are formally defined for each step in the learning setup. Rewarded Online GCN (ROGCN) is an extension of GCN designed for the online, partially rewarded setting. It involves making predictions without feedback and updating with new edges using x t. The environment provides responses h t \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} instead of true labels y t. The algorithm predicts \u0177 t and updates weights accordingly, adapting to the partially rewarded scenario. Rewarded Online GCN (ROGCN) is an extension of GCN for the online, partially rewarded setting. It involves constructing a k-NN graph when true graph information is not available. Initial estimates of hidden layer weights are obtained using a small portion of data and labels. As new observations arrive, they are added to the graph and data matrix, and additional training steps of GCN are run. In ROGCN, new observations are added to the data matrix with missing labels. The environment response h t \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1} indicates correct, wrong, or missing predictions. By combining GCN and LINUCB approaches, advantages of both perspectives can be utilized to learn from missclassified observations and improve feature learning for better classification. By combining GCN and LINUCB approaches, a suite of class-specific GCNs is proposed for online semi-supervised learning. The hidden layer representation from each class GCN is used as context for predictions in a contextual bandit framework. The labels and rewards are updated based on environment responses, with rewards imputed from the corresponding GCN when responses are missing. The GCN weights are updated as new observations are added, evolving the embeddings of previous observations. This approach eliminates the need for dynamically updating bandit parameters. The GCNUCB algorithm maintains a set of indices for each arm, using observations and responses only from these indices to update bandit parameters. It initializes GCN weights with a small amount of data and binary labels for each class. Comparison is made with LINUCB, ROGCN, and GCNUCB using different datasets. The Cora dataset is used by ROGCN and GCNUCB, while a 5-NN graph is built online for other datasets. Data points are observed and weights of the similarity graph are computed. Features with large magnitudes are discarded, and observations are row normalized. GCN is used with 16 hidden units, Adam optimizer, and regularization. Labels are removed for a percentage of observations to simulate the OPR setting. The algorithms in the study are given feature vectors and make predictions based on observed responses. GCNUCB outperforms LINUCB and ROGCN in all scenarios, using a baseline LINUCB for the first 300 steps. Performance is evaluated by comparing predictions to true labels, with data resampling done to account for data ordering effects. GCNUCB outperforms LINUCB and ROGCN in all experiments, showing that combining bandit exploration with neural network feature representation is the best solution for the OPR problem. The greatest accuracy increase is seen on the Cora dataset with a natural adjacency matrix, indicating GCNUCB's advantage in OPR applications with graph structures like dialog systems in social networks or workplaces. The context for each arm of GCNUCB is provided by the corresponding binary GCN hidden layer. The motivation for using binary GCNs to provide context to LINUCB is the ability of GCN to construct powerful features using graph convolution and neural networks expressiveness. An experiment on the CNAE-9 dataset with 25% missing labels was conducted, projecting context and bandit weight vectors to a 2-dimensional space. The bandit makes predictions based on the upper confidence bound of the regret, with different approaches for LINUCB and GCNUCB. Setting \u03b1 = 0 resulted in a greedy bandit for visualization purposes. The experiment on the CNAE-9 dataset involved using binary GCNs to provide context to LINUCB. The bandit weight vectors in LINUCB mostly point towards scattered clusters, hindering its ability to distinguish between different arms. In contrast, GCNUCB shows tightly clustered contexts, with one region for the correct label and another for a different label, resulting in higher accuracy. GCNUCB outperforms other methods by effectively distinguishing between different arms using tightly clustered contexts based on the correct binary GCN label."
