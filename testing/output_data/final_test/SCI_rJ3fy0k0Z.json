    "content": "The goal of imitation learning (IL) is to enable a learner to imitate an expert\u2019s behavior through demonstrations. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has achieved this on complex tasks but requires many interactions with the environment during training. A new off-policy IL algorithm for continuous control is proposed, utilizing a deterministic policy and a state screening function to improve efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Imitation learning (IL) aims to mimic expert behavior without relying on reward signals. A new algorithm shows superior efficiency compared to GAIL in continuous control tasks, requiring fewer interactions with the environment. This approach is valuable in real-world scenarios where designing rewards is challenging. In real-world environments, designing rewards can be challenging. Model-free IL for continuous control focuses on state-action pairs in continuous spaces. A popular method combines Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and RL, with recent advancements like generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) showing promising results. However, GAIL requires a large number of interactions with the environment during training, which can be time-consuming. Model-free IL for continuous control aims to reduce the number of interactions with the environment. A new off-policy IL algorithm proposes using a deterministic policy instead of a stochastic one like GAIL. This approach, called deterministic policy imitation gradient (DPIG), is expected to require fewer interactions than traditional methods. The DPIG algorithm aims to reduce interactions by using a deterministic policy. It introduces a state screening function to avoid noisy updates. Experimental results show it achieves expert performance with fewer interactions than GAIL, making it more suitable for real-world environments. The agent's behavior is defined by a stochastic policy \u03c0. Performance measure is defined as J(\u03c0, r) = E\u221et=0 \u03b3tr(st, at)|d0, T, \u03c0. Using discounted state visitation distribution (SVD), the performance measure can be rewritten as J(\u03c0, r) = Es\u223c\u03c1\u03c0,a\u223c\u03c0 r(s, a). RL aims to find an optimal policy in continuous state and action spaces. The paper discusses policy-based methods in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to find an optimal policy that maximizes performance. It focuses on parameterized stochastic policies and the update of parameters using gradient ascent. Different expressions of Policy Gradient (PG) are explored, with a reference to deterministic policy \u00b5 \u03b8. In RL, deterministic policy is a special case of stochastic policy. Gradient estimation for deterministic policy, known as DPG, requires calculation of expected discounted rewards. Unlike IRL algorithms, PG and DPG in RL do not assume access to the reward function. IRL aims to find a reward function where expert behavior earns greater rewards than non-experts. The objective of IRL with parameterized reward functions is to define expert and non-expert behaviors. In RL, the update of reward functions r \u03c9 is typically done by gradient ascent. In IRL, the reward function is unknown, leading to the decision process being characterized by MDP. The IL approach combines IRL and RL, alternating between them using gradient estimation. This IL process can be seen as adversarial training. In the IL process, the reward functions are updated using gradient ascent. The IL approach combines IRL and RL, alternating between them. The objective of IRL in the algorithm is defined, addressing concerns about exploration in the state space with a deterministic policy. An off-policy learning scheme is introduced with a stochastic behavior policy for adequate exploration. The algorithm combines past learner policies to approximate the expert's behavior. Optimization is done using GAIL and state sampling is performed using a replay buffer. The reward function is parameterized, allowing for gradient estimation with respect to actions executed by the policy. The algorithm combines past learner policies to approximate the expert's behavior using GAIL. The parameterized reward function enables gradient estimation for actions executed by the policy, incorporating deterministic policy imitation gradient (DPIG) for improved performance. In the IRL process, comparisons between states and expert behavior guide the learner in the right direction. Noisy policy updates, occurring in IL with limited demonstrations, can lead the learner astray. To prevent this, an additional function is introduced to avoid mimicking states not typical of expert demonstrations. In the IRL process, an additional function called state screening function (SSF) is introduced to avoid mimicking states not typical of expert demonstrations. The SSF works by assigning smaller values to states not belonging to expert demonstrations. The final objective functions K r (\u03c9), K v (\u03b7), and K \u00b5 (\u03b8) are maximized in the algorithm, with parameters updated using gradient estimations. The algorithm overview is described in Algorithm 1, with SSF acting as weighted sampling coefficients for states in S \u03b2. The state screening function (SSF) in the IRL process assigns smaller values to states not belonging to expert demonstrations, reducing the effects of noisy policy updates. Sampling states from \u03c1 \u03b2 with SSF can be interpreted as sampling states from the current learner's policy. The study evaluated an algorithm by training agents on physics-based control tasks using trust region policy optimization. The resulting agents were used as experts for imitation learning algorithms, with performance measured by cumulative rewards earned. Performance recovery rate was used to assess how well learners imitated expert behavior. See Appendix A for task descriptions and performance details. The study introduced a criterion called performance recovery rate (PRR) to assess learner imitation of expert behavior. The algorithm involved selecting actions, updating parameters, and testing against four other algorithms. PRR was calculated based on learner performance compared to random policies and expert performance. The study compared the performance of different algorithms, including behavioral cloning, GAIL, MGAIL, Ours\\SSF, and Ours\\int. Three experiments were conducted on each task, measuring the PRR during learner training. The algorithm utilized three neural networks with two hidden layers each for functions \u00b5 \u03b8, R \u03c9, and V \u03b7. TensorFlow was used for implementation, and experiments were run on a PC with specific hardware specifications. The study compared the performance of different algorithms on tasks, showing that our algorithm achieved nearly 1.0 PRR like GAIL. Our algorithm was much more sample efficient in terms of interactions required compared to GAIL. Additionally, our algorithm was more sample efficient in terms of computational cost as well. SSF outperformed Ours\\SSF across all tasks, especially in Ant-v1 and Humanoid-v1 with larger state spaces. SSF also showed improvement with fewer trajectories in Reacher-v1 and HalfCheetah-v1, reducing noisy policy updates. Table 1 summarizes the CPU-time comparison between GAIL and our algorithm, showing our algorithm's efficiency in achieving expert performance. Our algorithm outperformed BC and Ours\\int in terms of PRR and compounding error. Sampling states from distributions other than \u03c1 \u03b2 did not improve learner's performance. Experimental results on Hopper-v1 4 showed our algorithm's superiority over MGAIL. Our algorithm is more sample efficient than MGAIL in terms of interactions required to achieve expert performance. Various IL methods have been proposed, with BC being the simplest method. Our algorithm corrects learner's behavior through interactions, unlike BC which does not. Both BC and our algorithm focus on single time-step state-action pairs but ignore information over entire trajectories, leading to compounding errors in BC. Our algorithm corrects learner's behavior through interactions, focusing on maximizing cumulative rewards for trajectories starting from a given state. Unlike BC, our approach incorporates information over trajectories, reducing the impact of compounding errors. Another widely used approach for IL combines IRL and RL, with various IRL algorithms proposed. Recent advancements in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) have shifted towards utilizing nonlinear functional representations for reward functions, enabling success in complex tasks like continuous control in real-world environments. The connection between Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and IRL has also been explored, showing that IRL can be seen as a dual problem of Reinforcement Learning (RL) focused on matching the learner's occupancy measure. RL poses a challenge in matching the learner's occupancy measure to that of the expert. A regularizer choice for the cost function leads to an objective similar to GANs. The GAIL algorithm has gained popularity for Imitation Learning (IL), with some extensions proposed. Our algorithm reduces the number of interactions during training while maintaining imitation capability. Policy gradients are derived using gradients of the parameterized reward function, similar to DPG and deep DPG, but without the need for a parameterized Q-function approximator. Our algorithm is model-free and uses gradients from a parameterized reward function for policy updates in imitation learning. Unlike model-based methods like MGAIL, our algorithm requires fewer interactions during training and addresses noisy policy updates. Experimental results show our algorithm achieves expert-level performance in continuous control tasks. Our algorithm, which uses gradients from a parameterized reward function for policy updates in imitation learning, enables the learner to achieve expert-level performance with fewer interactions. The experiment involved implementing three neural networks - deterministic policy network (DPN), reward network (RN), and state screening network (SSN) - using shallow neural networks. Deep neural networks can also be applied to represent the functions in the algorithm, allowing for more complex tasks. The DPN used leaky rectified nonlinearity with 100 hidden units in each layer. The RN had 1000 hidden units and a sigmoid nonlinearity for the output. The SSN had the same architecture as RN but with different input. Sampling strategy similar to DDPG was employed for updating RN and SSN. When updating RN and SSN, state-action pairs were sampled from replay buffers. RMSProp was used for learning parameters with specific rates and epsilon. We initialized weights and biases using Xavier initialization. Coefficient and mini-batch size were set, along with the maximum number of training episodes for different tasks."
