    "content": "The \"Early Pell Promise Act\" establishes the Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program authorizes the Secretary to award grants to State educational agencies for administrative expenses and make commitments to award Federal Pell Grants to eligible 8th-grade students. The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program provides commitments for Federal Pell Grants to eligible students who participate in the program and apply for financial aid during their senior year of secondary school. The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Program offers commitments for Federal Pell Grants to eligible students who apply during their senior year of secondary school and enroll in higher education within 3 years of receiving a diploma or joining the Armed Forces. If a student applies for Federal financial aid during their senior year of secondary school or the following academic year and their family contribution is more than 2 times the threshold amount for Federal Pell Grant eligibility, they will not receive a Federal Pell Grant for the next academic year. They will still be eligible for other Federal student financial aid. The State Educational Agency must submit an application to the Secretary to participate in the Program. Federal Pell Grant requirements apply, with eligible students having their expected family contribution deemed as zero. The State Educational Agency must submit an application to the Secretary for the Program, including a description of the information campaign, cooperation with evaluation, and other required information. The Secretary will reserve funds for an independent evaluation of the Program's impact. The evaluation of the Program will be conducted on a competitive basis, considering metrics emphasizing college access, success, and cost-effectiveness. Findings will be disseminated widely. State educational agencies must conduct a targeted information campaign in cooperation with local agencies. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under this section shall develop a targeted information campaign for the Program, including outreach to students and families at the beginning and end of each academic year, distribution of information, and annual provision of information. The State educational agency must provide annual information to students and families in the Program about the estimated statewide average higher education institution costs disaggregated by type of institution. The curr_chunk provides information on private, for-profit colleges, Federal Pell Grants, and State-specific college savings programs. It includes details on tuition, fees, room and board for colleges, the maximum Pell Grant amount, application process for Pell Grants, and state-specific savings programs. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of annual information to eligible students participating in the Program, including details on State-based financial aid, Federal financial aid eligibility criteria, and a reservation of grant funds for targeted information campaigns. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the section."
