    "content": "The Impact Aid program, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, compensates local educational agencies for financial burdens resulting from federal activities such as federal land ownership and enrollment of children from federal or Indian lands. The program aims to offset the loss of tax revenue for LEAs unable to collect property taxes from individuals on federal land. The Impact Aid program, part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was reauthorized and revised multiple times, including in 2000 and 2001 with changes made through the No Child Left Behind Act. Despite lacking explicit authorization, the program continues to receive annual appropriations. The Impact Aid program receives annual appropriations and is considered implicitly authorized. The Student Success Act (H.R. 5) and Every Child Achieves Act (ECAA; S. 1177) were passed by the House and Senate respectively in 2015, both reauthorizing the Impact Aid program. This report provides an overview of Impact Aid payments, a detailed discussion of Title VIII, and information on recent appropriations. The report provides an overview of Impact Aid payments authorized by ESEA Title VIII, including payments under Section 8002, Section 8003, Section 8007, and Section 8008. Section 8002 compensates LEAs for federal property ownership, with about 216 LEAs receiving payments annually for general operating expenses. In FY2015, $66.8 million was appropriated for Section 8002. In FY2015, Section 8002 received $66.8 million for LEAs for federal property ownership. Section 8003 compensates LEAs for enrolling federally connected children, with $1.1 billion appropriated for payments. Section 8003(b) authorizes payments ranging from $100 to $53 million for LEAs enrolling federally connected children. Section 8003(d) provides additional payments for IDEA-eligible children, with $48.3 million appropriated in FY2015. About 878 LEAs are expected to receive payments ranging from $515 to $1.2 million. Section 8007 funds construction and facilities upgrading for certain LEAs serving high percentages of children living on Indian lands. Section 8007 provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading for certain LEAs serving high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children of military parents. In FY2015, $17.4 million was appropriated for Section 8007, with grants awarded only by competition. It is estimated that 6 to 10 LEAs will receive competitive grants, ranging from $50,000 to $5.0 million. Section 8008 provides funds for emergency repairs and comprehensive capital improvements to schools that ED currently owns but LEAs operate and use to serve federally connected military dependent children. In FY2015, $4.8 million was provided for Section 8008. Section 8008 of the Impact Aid program provides funds for emergency repairs and capital improvements to schools owned by the Department of Education but operated by local education agencies to serve federally connected military dependent children. The purpose of the program is to assist LEAs in areas where federal activities place a financial burden, including helping federally connected children meet state academic standards. The federal government aims to provide financial assistance while promoting local control with minimal federal or state involvement. The Impact Aid program provides financial assistance to LEAs facing financial burdens due to federal property acquisition, educating children on federal property, military families, and children of federal employees. Section 8002 compensates LEAs for federal property ownership. The Impact Aid program compensates LEAs for federal property ownership, with about 216 LEAs receiving Section 8002 payments annually. These payments are used for general operating expenses such as teacher salaries, books, supplies, and utilities. The formula for calculating Section 8002 payments was amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 amended the formula for calculating Section 8002 payments for LEAs. The amendments were initially set to be repealed on January 2, 2015, but the date was changed to January 2, 2018 by the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. If no further action is taken by Congress, the formula used prior to the amendments will be in effect starting January 3, 2018. The Section 8002 formula for LEA payments under the NDAA amendments determines the maximum payment based on real property tax rates and assessed property values. When full funding is not available, a hold-harmless formula is used to maintain historical funding levels. Payments to LEAs under the Section 8002 formula are determined by a hold-harmless formula to maintain historical funding levels. Pre-1995 recipients receive grants equal to 38% of their maximum entitlement amount for FY1994. If funds are insufficient, grants are reduced proportionally. Remaining funds are then distributed to LEAs that received payments in FY1995 or filed timely applications for subsequent years. Special payments are made after foundation payments and grants for 1995 recipients. After foundation payments and grants for 1995 recipients, remaining funds are distributed among pre-FY1995 and FY1995 recipients based on proportional share formulas. 25% of funds go to LEAs that received foundation payments, allocated based on each LEA's proportion of all foundation payments made. The remaining 75% is distributed based on each LEA's maximum payment proportion for the current fiscal year. Section 8002 payments are capped to not exceed an LEA's maximum Basic Support Payment under Section 8003. The maximum payment an LEA is eligible to receive for a fiscal year is determined by multiplying the current real property tax rate for current expenditures levied by fiscally independent LEAs, or imputed real property tax rate. The maximum payment for LEAs is determined by multiplying the real property tax rate by the estimated taxable value of federal property. Payments are made based on a hold-harmless formula with three steps, including foundation payments for pre-2010 recipients and new applicants, and a special payment to a specific school district in New York. Payments for new applicants are made from remaining funds to LEAs not eligible for Section 8002 payments in FY2009. The payments are calculated based on the appropriation ratio to all LEAs' maximum payments in the most recent year. Any remaining funds are then distributed to LEAs based on prorated shares of maximum payments for the current year, with caps applying to payments under current law. Newly eligible LEAs have their payments limited by caps in the formula. Section 8003(b) authorizes payments to LEAs to compensate them for the cost of serving federally connected children, including children of parents in the military, children living on Indian lands, children of civilian federal employees, and children living in low-rent housing. To be eligible for these payments, an LEA must have at least 400 federally connected children or such children must represent at least 3% of an LEA's average daily attendance. The Impact Aid basic support grants formula for Section 8003(b) compensates LEAs for serving federally connected children, with weights applied to different types of children to reflect tax revenue differences. Maximum grants are calculated based on weighted child counts and a Local Contribution Rate (LCR). Actual payments may be reduced if appropriations are insufficient. Table 1 outlines the categories of federally connected children and their assigned weights. Children residing on Indian lands receive the highest weight in the Impact Aid basic support grants formula, followed by children living on federal land with parents employed on federal land, members of the uniformed services, or accredited foreign military officers. These high-weighted children are known as \"3(a)\" or \"a\" children. Other children receive lower weights based on their parents' military or housing status. Children living on federal land with parents employed on federal land receive lower weights, known as \"3(b)\" or \"b\" children. A school district's weighted student count is calculated based on different categories of federally connected children. For example, a hypothetical district with 615 federally connected children would have a weighted count of 400 for funding purposes. The weighted student count is multiplied by a cost factor to determine the Impact Aid basic support grants. The Impact Aid basic support grants are calculated by multiplying the weighted student count by a cost factor, which is determined by the greatest of various factors such as the state average per-pupil expenditure, national APPE, or state APPE times the local contribution percentage. This cost factor may vary between LEAs, with the maximum basic support payment being the highest LCR amount multiplied by the weighted student count. For example, if one-half of the national APPE is the highest LCR amount, the maximum payment would be $5,200 * 400 = $2,160,000. Providing maximum payments to all eligible LEAs in FY2015 would require approximately $2.15 billion. The Impact Aid basic support grants are calculated based on weighted student count and a cost factor. The maximum payment to all eligible LEAs in FY2015 would require approximately $2.15 billion. Statutory language allows for reducing payments to LEAs if appropriations are below this amount. More heavily impacted districts receive higher percentages of their maximum payments. This is determined by calculating a Learning Opportunity Threshold (LOT) payment, which considers the percentage of federally connected children and Section 8003 payments in an LEA's total current expenditure. If 20% of children in attendance receive Impact Aid funds totaling 30% of an LEA's expenditures, the LOT percentage would be 50%, resulting in a payment of $1,080,000. If appropriations are insufficient, only a portion of the payment is made. For example, if 80% of full payments are funded, an LEA would receive 40% of its support payment, equating to $864,000. Additional funds beyond full payments are distributed based on LOT payments, prioritizing higher payments to certain LEAs. Priority for additional funding goes to LEAs with higher LOT payments, indicating those more affected by federally connected children or reliant on Impact Aid. For example, if funds cover 125% of LOT, an LEA would receive 62.5% of its maximum basic support payment. Certain LEAs are classified as \"heavily impacted,\" either continuing or new, based on their ADA composition. In FY2015, 26 LEAs received payments as heavily impacted LEAs, with calculations differing from regular Impact Aid LEAs in terms of weights for federally connected children classifications. In FY2015, 26 heavily impacted LEAs received $292 million, or 34.0% of total funding for basic support grants under Section 8003(b). They receive 1.75 weight for federally connected children and 80% of the state or national APPE for maximum basic support payment. If funds are insufficient, payments are ratably reduced. Impact Aid payments under Section 8003(b) are provided to 26 heavily impacted LEAs, receiving over four times the amount per child compared to regular Impact Aid LEAs. These funds are not limited to specified uses and can be used for both current local education expenditures and capital expenditures. Accountability requirements for the use of funds are minimal, and payments can also be made to LEAs serving federally connected children eligible for services under IDEA. Payments under Section 8003(b) of the Impact Aid program are provided to certain federally connected children eligible for services under IDEA. The weighted counts of children with disabilities are determined by multiplying eligible children living on federal property by 1.0 and those living on non-federal property by 0.5. LEAs receive payments based on their percentage share of the total weighted child count. LEAs receiving Section 8003(d) payments must use the funds to meet the needs of federally connected children with disabilities and provide them with a free appropriate public education in accordance with IDEA. Policies and procedures must ensure equal participation of children living on Indian lands in programs supported by these funds, with opportunities for parents and tribes to provide input on the needs of such children. Parents and Indian tribes must be consulted and involved in planning and developing programs for Indian children. Relevant applications, evaluations, and program plans must be shared with parents and tribes. They must also have a chance to express their views on the general education program. LEAs claiming Indian children for Section 8003 payments must maintain records to show compliance. Waivers can be granted if a tribe is satisfied with educational services provided by the LEA. Section 8004 requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to LEAs, parents, and Indian tribes to meet educational requirements. The Secretary enforces these provisions, including withholding funds. Section 8007 provides funds for construction and facility repair to certain LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children of military parents. 40% of the funds are used for construction payments to eligible LEAs. Section 8007 provides funds for construction and facility repair to LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children of military parents. Grants are divided equally between these two groups of LEAs, with 20% of the total appropriation going to each. The remaining 60% is used for school facility emergency and modernization competitive grants. Emergency grants must be used for repairs, renovations, or alterations to K-12 public school facilities. Emergency grants for K-12 public school facilities must prioritize health and safety, with higher priority than modernization grants. The Secretary must prioritize grant awards based on specific criteria, with top priority given to LEAs with limited bonding capacity and school facility emergencies posing health or safety hazards. Emergency grants for K-12 public school facilities prioritize health and safety hazards. Grants are awarded based on specific criteria, with top priority given to LEAs with limited bonding capacity and emergencies posing health or safety risks. If funds remain, grants are then awarded to LEAs meeting additional criteria, including a high percentage of students living on Indian land or military bases. Individual schools not in eligible LEAs may also apply if they meet specific criteria. The top priority for modernization grants is for LEAs meeting specific criteria, including having a high percentage of students living on Indian land or military bases. If funds are still available, grants are then awarded to LEAs that receive basic support payments under Section 8003 and have a significant number of federally connected children. LEAs with a high percentage of students living on Indian land or military bases are eligible for modernization grants. Schools not within an LEA can also apply if they meet specific criteria, such as having at least 40% of students living on Indian land or military bases. The Secretary considers various factors when awarding emergency and modernization grants. The Secretary considers the LEA's ability to respond to emergencies or fund modernization projects, taking into account factors like nontaxable property, federally connected children, and severity of the emergency or modernization need. Emergency and modernization grants are limited to 50% of the total project cost, not exceeding $4 million over four years for LEAs facing challenges like overcrowding and outdated facilities. Competitive grants in recent award cycles focused on emergency grants for LEAs with the most critical needs. Since FY2006, Section 8007 grants have been awarded as emergency grants to LEAs serving students on Indian land, with appropriations acts altering the distribution of funds. The Administration argues for competitive grants over formula grants to provide larger grant amounts to districts with the greatest needs. Section 8008 provides funds for emergency repairs and capital improvements to 12 schools owned by the Department of Education but operated by LEAs for military dependent children. The Department of Defense funds other facilities on domestic military bases serving children of Armed Forces members. Since FY2008, the Department of Education has transferred ownership of 47 facilities to the Department of Defense, with 26 facilities remaining. Of these, 14 are the responsibility of DOD, while 12 are operated by LEAs for military dependent students. The LEAs face challenges with deteriorating, overcrowded, and substandard facilities, requiring approximately $72 million for repairs and renovations. Most LEAs will not accept ownership without funding for necessary improvements. The cost of repairs and renovations for 12 schools is approximately $72 million ($6 million per school). State school finance equalization programs aim to increase educational equity by considering local capacity to raise revenue. State finance formulas cannot usually include Impact Aid funds, except with approval under Section 8009. Alaska, Kansas, and New Mexico currently have approved state equalization programs. The Impact Aid funding criteria for evaluating state equalization programs specify a 25% spending disparity limit between LEAs with the highest and lowest APPE. Alaska, Kansas, and New Mexico have approved equalization programs. The regulations provide examples for determining spending disparities. The 5th percentile of student population is reached at LEA A with a per pupil expenditure of $820, while the 95th percentile is reached at LEA B with $1,000. The disparity between the two LEAs is 22 percent. ED identifies LEAs with the highest and lowest expenditures that collectively enroll 5% of the student population. Two LEAs in New Mexico sued ED over the equalization formula implementation. The Supreme Court ruled that ED's procedures for determining educational expenditure equalization across LEAs were appropriate. Title VIII also includes sections on program administration and function, such as the process for LEAs to apply for payments and requirements for federal administration of the Impact Aid program. Section 8010 prescribes requirements for the federal administration of the Impact Aid program, including child eligibility and timely payment. Section 8011 outlines requirements for administrative hearings and judicial review. Section 8012 includes provisions for forgiving overpayments under Title VIII programs in cases of undue financial hardship. Section 8013 provides definitions for Title VIII, and Section 8014 authorizes appropriations for the programs. The Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies appropriations acts provide additional funding for Impact Aid to LEAs serving military dependent students and federally connected children with severe disabilities. Impact Aid funding through L-HHS-ED appropriations from FY2008 to FY2015 slightly increased by 3.9%, with basic support payments for federally connected children rising by 4.1%. In FY2015, Impact Aid appropriations saw an increase, with payments for federally connected children (Section 8003) making up over 90% of the funds. Basic support payments accounted for 89.3% of the appropriations, while payments for federal property, construction, and facilities maintenance were lower. The President's budget for FY2016 would maintain funding at $1.289 billion, with proposed changes to eliminate Section 8002 payments and increase Section 8008 funding. The Administration proposes to eliminate payments for Section 8002 and increase funding for Section 8008. They argue that many LEAs receiving Section 8002 funds do not meet eligibility requirements, especially after consolidation. This would no longer burden the consolidated LEAs with historic loss of taxable property. The Administration proposes to eliminate Section 8002 payments and increase funding for Section 8008, arguing that consolidated LEAs are no longer burdened by historic loss of taxable property. Impact Aid payments would remain level funded at FY2015 amounts. The Impact Aid program is not forward funded, with funds becoming available on October 1 of a given year and remaining available through September 30 of the following year. The DOD Impact Aid program was established in the early 1990s to supplement education programs. The DOD Impact Aid program, established in the early 1990s, supplements education programs. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for FY2015 authorized funding for two DOD Impact Aid programs for LEAs serving military dependent children. Funds for these programs are appropriated in the DOD annual appropriations acts. The DOD Impact Aid program supplements education programs for LEAs serving military dependent children. The annual National Defense Authorization Act authorizes appropriations for these programs, including the Supplemental Assistance program for LEAs with significant numbers of military students. Eligibility for assistance is based on the inability to provide education equivalent to other schools without additional funding. The DOD Impact Aid program provides funding to LEAs with military dependent students, including Supplemental Assistance for districts with at least 20% military students. Funds reimburse LEAs for providing education to severely disabled military dependent children. Payments are authorized under the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for FY2001. The DOD Impact Aid program provides funding to LEAs for severely disabled military dependent children, based on excess expenditures compared to state averages. The Large Scale Rebasing Program (DOD Impact Aid BRAC Program) provides assistance to LEAs affected by base closures, force structure changes, or force relocations. Funds are available to LEAs with a 5% increase or reduction in military dependent student enrollment. Eligible LEAs must meet specific criteria to receive funding. The Large Scale Rebasing Program (DOD Impact Aid BRAC Program) provides assistance to LEAs affected by base closures, force structure changes, or force relocations. Eligible LEAs must meet specific criteria to receive funding, including having military dependent students make up at least 20% of daily attendance. No LEA can receive more than $1 million in assistance per fiscal year. Funding for this program has not been allocated since FY2007, with appropriations for related programs ranging from $30 million to $45 million in recent years. The Large Scale Rebasing program, funded in FY2006 and FY2007, had appropriations ranging from $30 million to $45 million. Table 5 displays the funding for this program and related activities from FY2008 to FY2015."
