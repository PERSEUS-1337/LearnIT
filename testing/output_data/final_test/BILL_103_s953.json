    "content": "Chapter 59 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to include a new section allowing voluntary separation for objection to military policy on homosexuals. \"A member of the armed forces may request separation under this section if found eligible by the Secretary of the military department. Eligibility includes joining before the policy change on homosexuality in the military, not taking on new service obligations after the policy change, and not being eligible for retirement.\" \"A member of the armed forces can request separation if found eligible by the Secretary of the military department. Eligibility criteria include joining before the policy change on homosexuality in the military, not being eligible to retire, not previously approved for separation under other laws, and having objections to the policy change based on religious, moral, or personal reasons.\" \"A written request for voluntary separation based on religious, moral, or personal objections to a policy change will generally meet the requirements for separation. The Secretary may consider additional information to determine the validity of the member's objections.\" Members who are separated under this section may be entitled to active duty benefits if they meet certain criteria, including serving on active duty for more than six years, serving for not more than twenty years, serving at least five years of continuous active duty, and being on an active duty list if a Reserve. Additionally, members of the Selected Reserve may be entitled to Reserve benefits. Members separated under this section, after meeting specific criteria, may be entitled to benefits provided under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993. They have the option to choose between benefits for involuntarily discharged members or rights and benefits for those eligible under section 1331a of title 10, United States Code, based on their years of service. A member separated under this section must choose between benefits for involuntarily discharged members or rights and benefits based on years of service. The Secretary concerned determines the separation date, which must not exceed one hundred and eighty days after the member's request. The separation date for a member entitled to be separated under this section with military service obligations can be delayed if necessary, but must not exceed one hundred and eighty days after the member's request. The separation of a member can be delayed for up to two years if it would negatively impact military readiness. This policy will only take effect if the Department of Defense changes its stance on homosexuality in the military."
