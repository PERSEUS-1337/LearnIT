    "title": "AB 893",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 25200 of the Business and Professions Code in California is repealed and replaced with new regulations for beer labeling. All packages or containers of beer must have a label that complies with federal malt beverage labeling regulations. Additional information such as brand and type of beer must also be included on the label. The beer labeling regulations in California require the brand, manufacturer's name and address, bottler's name (if different), and alcoholic content above 5.7% to be included on the label. Manufacturers, bottlers, or packagers can use a fictitious business name if duly filed. Prior to selling a brand of beer in California, the manufacturer must register the brand with the department, including details such as the manufacturer's true name and address, any fictitious business name, the type of beer, brand names, and information on any collaborative arrangements or contract manufacturing. The manufacturer of the beer is responsible for compliance with the requirements of this section. If beer is sold in California without meeting these requirements, the department may take action, including halting sales until compliance is met. Section 25201 of the Business and Professions Code prohibits manufacturers, importers, or wholesalers of beer from using containers or cartons that do not match the brand of beer inside. A beer manufacturer refilling consumer-supplied containers must affix a label complying with regulations and remove any previous branding before resale. This does not apply to containers with a capacity of five liquid gallons or more. Section 25204 of the Business and Professions Code is repealed. Section 25204 of the Business and Professions Code is repealed. No reimbursement is required for this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
