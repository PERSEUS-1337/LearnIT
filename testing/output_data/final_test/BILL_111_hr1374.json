    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Elder Abuse Prevention Act\". Congress acknowledges the increasing number of older Americans facing abuse, neglect, and exploitation, with many cases going unreported. As the population of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to grow significantly, there is a pressing need to address and prevent elder abuse through comprehensive measures at both Federal and State levels. Elder abuse, including violent, physical, and sexual assaults, should be vigorously prosecuted by Federal and State authorities with appropriate penalties to deter such acts. No parole for sexual offenses against the elderly or sexually violent predators. For each fiscal year after a specified period, States receiving funds for certain programs must have laws prohibiting parole for individuals convicted of sexual offenses against the elderly or who are sexually violent predators within 3 years of the enactment of this Act. The Attorney General may grant an additional 2 years to a State making good faith efforts to comply with a subsection, and waive requirements if compliance would be unconstitutional. A State failing to comply with the subsection will not receive 10 percent of allocated funds under certain programs after a specified period. The Attorney General may grant an additional 2 years to a State making good faith efforts to comply with a subsection and waive requirements if compliance would be unconstitutional. Amounts not allocated to a State for failure to comply with subsection (a) shall be reallocated to States that have not failed to comply. The term \"sexually violent predator\" is defined as a person convicted of a sexually violent offense and likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder. SEC. 4. AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL SENTENCING GUIDELINES. The United States Sentencing Commission is requested to promptly review sentencing guidelines for sexual offenses against the elderly, consider new guidelines or amendments for enhancement, and submit policy recommendations to Congress. The Sentencing Commission is asked to ensure that sentencing guidelines reflect the seriousness of offenses, maintain consistency with other directives, consider circumstances for exceptions, make necessary changes to guidelines, and align with the purposes of sentencing. The United States Sentencing Commission is requested to promptly issue guidelines or amendments within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, following the procedures outlined in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1987."
