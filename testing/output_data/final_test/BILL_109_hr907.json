    "content": "ALTERNATE ENERGY-RELATED USES ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF. The purposes of this section are to protect the economic and land use interests of the Federal Government in managing the Outer Continental Shelf for energy-related activities, provide an administrative framework for oversight, expedite energy projects, coordinate interagency efforts for energy activities, and ensure responsible conduct on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Outer Continental Shelf is managed to ensure safety, protect the environment, prevent waste, conserve resources, protect rights, and national security interests. It authorizes alternate uses of existing structures and facilities, ensures fair returns for easements, and grants rights-of-way for energy purposes. The Secretary may grant easements or rights-of-way on the outer Continental Shelf for energy-related activities not covered by existing laws, in consultation with relevant government agencies. This includes activities supporting oil, gas, mineral exploration, as well as energy production from sources other than oil and gas. The Secretary may establish payment forms for easements or rights-of-way granted for activities on the outer Continental Shelf, excluding oil and gas. Consultation with relevant agencies is required before granting such easements. The Secretary can issue easements or rights-of-way for energy purposes competitively or noncompetitively, considering factors like conservation, economic viability, and national security. Regulations will be prescribed in consultation with relevant agencies. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to ensure safety, protect the environment, prevent waste, and conserve natural resources on the outer Continental Shelf. Holders of easements must provide security bonds and comply with additional requirements to protect US interests. This subsection does not affect the jurisdiction of other Federal or State agencies under different laws. The subsection does not apply to areas on the outer Continental Shelf designated as National Marine Sanctuaries. The heading for section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is amended to include Leases, Easements, and Rights-of-Way on the Outer Continental Shelf."
