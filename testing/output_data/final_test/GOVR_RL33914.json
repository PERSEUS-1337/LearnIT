    "content": "The 1992 passage of PDUFA was a response to delays in FDA decision-making on drug applications, causing dissatisfaction among industry, consumers, and the FDA. Patients faced long waits for access to life-saving drugs, while manufacturers struggled to recoup research costs. FDA lacked resources to review applications promptly, leading to backlogs. FDA sought permission from Congress to implement user fees to address these issues. The 1992 law, known as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), allowed FDA to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies to speed up drug application reviews and reduce backlogs. Industry initially opposed user fees, fearing funds would not be used for drug review, but agreed to performance goals and the promise that fees would supplement, not replace, FDA funding from Congress. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) allowed FDA to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies to speed up drug application reviews and reduce backlogs. The fees were to be used for hiring additional reviewers and were divided into application review fees, establishment fees, and product fees. Exceptions were provided for small businesses and drug development. PDUFA I authorized fee revenue limits for FY1993-1997, with adjustments for inflation. Fees were to supplement, not replace, congressional appropriations. Triggers enforced this rule, allowing FDA to collect fees only if appropriations remained at pre-PDUFA levels adjusted for inflation. The goal was to reduce drug application review times each year. PDUFA's goal was to reduce the time for FDA's approval decision by dedicating fees to expedite human drug application reviews as outlined in FDA Commissioner Kessler's September 1992 letters to Congress. The FDA's goal under PDUFA was to expedite human drug application reviews by reviewing 90% of standard applications within 12 months and 90% of priority applications within six months by 1997. Activities funded by collected fees included IND, NDA, BLA, PLA, and ELA reviews, policy development, product standards, meetings with sponsors, labeling and advertising reviews, facility inspections, assay development, and monitoring. The reauthorization of PDUFA in 1997, known as PDUFA II, aimed to expedite drug development and application review processes by setting tighter performance goals, increasing transparency, improving communication with drug makers and patient advocacy groups, and allowing FDA to consult with manufacturers earlier in the drug development process. The reauthorization of PDUFA in 2002, known as PDUFA III, allowed FDA to adjust revenue targets, meet with stakeholders, collect postmarket safety information, double staff for monitoring side effects, and authorize pilot programs for continuous improvement. The FDA's review of research activities in PDUFA III authorized pilot programs for continuous review of new drug applications for fast track products addressing serious conditions. Companies were encouraged to include risk management plans, use fees for developing databases on drug use, and oversee risk management in the post-approval period. The reauthorization also required preliminary reviews, postmarket study completion deadlines, and notifications to health practitioners for incomplete studies. The Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments (PDUFA) allowed FDA to use fee revenue for various activities related to the review of human drug applications. PDUFA II and PDUFA III expanded the scope to include preclinical and post-approval phases. PDUFA IV, part of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, further specified fee collection and usage. PDUFA IV, part of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, made technical changes and introduced new elements to the prescription drug user fee program. It included a \"reverse trigger\" to decrease user fee revenue if appropriations exceed certain amounts, added fees for drug safety, and removed limitations on postapproval activities. PDUFA IV removed calendar and time limitations on postapproval activities, allowing FDA to use funding throughout a product's life. It expanded the use of fees for postmarket safety activities, including adverse-event data collection, improved analytical tools, and managing adverse event reports. Additionally, it authorized fees for advisory review of prescription-drug television advertising. The PDUFA IV amendments, effective from October 1, 2007, introduced voluntary pre-dissemination review of advertisements with advisory FDA responses. Manufacturers requesting reviews would be subject to new fees, including an advisory review fee and operating reserve fee. Core elements of the prescription drug user fee program were codified in the FFDCA, along with new requirements to enhance the Secretary's communication with the public. The authority to assess, collect, and use drug fees would end on October 1, 2012, and reporting requirements would cease on January 31, 2013. PDUFA has received both criticism and praise from various stakeholders. The issues raised by industry, FDA staff, consumers, and Members of Congress during the legislative debate leading up to PDUFA IV persist due to broader questions about budget choices, conflicts of interest, and drug safety. PDUFA has been successful in adding review staff, reducing application backlog, and speeding up approval times. Median time for FDA approval decision decreased from 29 months in 1987. These key issues are likely to resurface as Congress plans for PDUFA V in 2012. The median time for FDA approval decision decreased from 29 months in 1987 to 17 months in the first two years of PDUFA I. FDA attributed shorter approval times to PDUFA-funded staff increases and more complete applications. Industry finds the per-application fee acceptable compared to the cost of delay before PDUFA. PDUFA has led to quicker access to new drugs, but critics are concerned about inadequate review and industry influence. Congress has discussed FDA's authority and resources to address drug safety issues during premarket and postmarket periods. The PDUFA program has significantly shortened drug review times by providing additional funds. User fees have increasingly contributed to the FDA's budget for human drug activities since FY1994, leading to budget, management, and policy implications. Funding increase due to user fees, not congressional appropriations. FTE positions funded by user fees have increased, while those funded by appropriations have decreased. PDUFA triggers impact FDA budget planning for human drugs. Balance between pre- and postapproval activities is crucial. PDUFA is criticized for causing an imbalance in FDA's budget by prioritizing premarket drug review over postmarket safety activities. This imbalance is due to PDUFA requirements and flat congressional funding levels, leading to a squeeze on non-PDUFA programs like generic drug application reviews. Congress has expanded PDUFA to address these concerns. The Congress has expanded PDUFA with each reauthorization to cover activities related to drug development stages and industry-FDA interactions. PDUFA fees now fund activities from NDA submission through FDA review, including meetings with manufacturers during clinical development stages. PDUFA IV removes the three-year limit on postapproval activities, allowing FDA to use funding for authorized activities throughout a product's life. Critics argue that industry influence is too strong due to fee provision and lack of transparency in setting performance goals. Amendments in PDUFA IV now require consumer participation in discussions between FDA and manufacturers for workload and revenue needs. The FDA submitted performance goals for the next five years to authorizing committees, including review time and completion percentages. Industry participation in goal negotiation raised concerns about industry influence on FDA resources. User fees contribute to FDA's budget, with some worrying about quick and suboptimal reviews due to pressure to meet deadlines. In FY2008, user fees contributed 24.2% of FDA's budget, with 48.4% going to the Human Drug Program. Critics are concerned about FDA's increasing reliance on industry fees for review activities, potentially undermining congressional support for direct appropriations. Some critics distrust the pharmaceutical industry's motives, but others believe Congress should fully fund the FDA to ensure public health protection, rather than relying on user fees."
