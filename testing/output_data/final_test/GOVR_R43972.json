Federal policies impact scientific and technological advancement by funding research, establishing regulatory frameworks, and influencing private sector S&T activities through tax, intellectual property, and education policies. The federal government regulates science and technology activities, including research with dangerous pathogens. This report introduces science and technology policy issues for the 114th Congress, providing background information and policy considerations. It also outlines the roles of each branch of government in policymaking and discusses federal funding for research. The federal government's role in science and technology policymaking is decentralized, involving various stakeholders in different branches. This includes funding research, promoting STEM education, and using S&T for economic and national security benefits. Congress enacts laws to establish and refine S&T-related programs and policies. The federal government's role in science and technology policymaking involves various stakeholders in different branches. Congress enacts laws to establish and refine S&T-related programs and policies, while the President formulates budgets, policies, and programs for consideration by Congress. The Office of Science and Technology Policy advises the President on S&T matters. The Executive Office of the President advises on Science and Technology Policy, with various agencies having S&T responsibilities for specific federal missions. Federal court decisions can impact S&T development, industries, and evidence admissibility. The federal government supports scientific and technological advancement through R&D funding for national interests like defense, health, and innovation. This support has led to breakthroughs in technology such as jet aircraft, the Internet, and disease defenses. Federal R&D funding has declined from $147.3 billion to $133.7 billion between FY2009 and FY2014, raising concerns about the potential long-term effects on U.S. technological leadership, innovation, competitiveness, economic growth, and job creation. This decline comes after sustained growth in federal R&D funding for over half a century and is exacerbated by increases in R&D investments by other nations, globalization of R&D and manufacturing activities, and trade deficits in advanced technology products. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about federal funding levels in light of the current fiscal condition, deficit, and debt. Federal R&D funding decisions may be influenced by the federal fiscal condition, deficit, and debt, as well as differing perspectives on the government's role in advancing science and technology. Congress faces challenges in determining the direction and prioritization of R&D investments amidst increased pressure on discretionary spending. Low or negative growth in R&D funding may require reallocating resources across disciplines, programs, or agencies to address priorities. Congress will define the nation's R&D priorities through decisions on funding size and distribution. The America COMPETES Act was enacted in 2007 to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness by authorizing federal research, education, and innovation activities. In 2010, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act extended and modified provisions of the original law. The America COMPETES Act of 2010 extended and modified provisions of the 2007 law, with funding authorizations expiring in FY2013. Legislation to reauthorize the acts was introduced but not enacted in the 113th Congress. Concerns about U.S. competitiveness in scientific and technological advancement led to the COMPETES Acts, aimed at increasing funding for federal physical science and engineering research. The COMPETES Acts aimed to address challenges by increasing funding for federal physical science and engineering research, STEM education activities, and the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. Implementation has varied, with some critics questioning the need for federal intervention in addressing a STEM labor shortage. Some analysts question whether the federal government should address the shortage of STEM labor, preferring alternative approaches like research tax credits or reducing regulatory costs. Concerns about the cost, federal budget deficit, and debt are raised, along with skepticism about using competitiveness as a rationale for economic and education policy. \"Open access publishing grants free online access to articles, contrasting with traditional publishing where fees are paid by authors and readers for journal publication and distribution.\" Supporters of federal open-access publishing policies have various motivations, including avoiding rising traditional journal subscription fees, promoting scientific progress through broader dissemination, and ensuring public access to research funded by taxes. However, traditional publishers and scholarly associations oppose these policies, fearing negative impacts on the publishing industry, profits, and academic reward systems. They raise concerns about electronic archive maintenance, increased publication costs, and the perceived status of articles in the academic community. The academic community and reward system prioritize articles in traditional journals. Congress authorized NIH to require grant recipients to submit final articles for public access. This policy raised concerns about intellectual property and government competition. In 2013, federal agencies funding over $100 million annually were directed to make research results publicly available within a year of publication. Congress mandated agencies funded through Labor, Health, and Human Services to comply starting in 2014. Federal agencies funded through the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies appropriations act have developed plans for making research results publicly available. The plans have been reviewed by the OSTP and Office of Management and Budget, with agencies starting to release them in 2015. The 114th Congress may continue to monitor the implementation of these plans and their impact on the publishing industry and scientific advancement. In the 1990s, Congress passed the Shelby Amendment to make federally funded research data more accessible to the public. This amendment directed federal agencies to allow public access to data through the Freedom of Information Act. The amendment was a response to disputes over data used in developing regulations, particularly regarding EPA regulations on air quality standards. A study funded by the National Institutes of Health found a link between air pollution and health. Industry groups requested to review the data, but researchers refused, citing confidentiality agreements. The EPA dispute raised issues of transparency, accountability, privacy of human subjects, and research integrity. Recent Administration activities focus on increasing public access to data. A 2012 report supported public access and data management plans in funding proposals. Most federal agencies lacked policies on public data access. Some federal agencies lacked policies on public data access. A 2013 OSTP memorandum affirmed the Administration's commitment to ensuring public access to federally funded scientific research results. Agencies are required to develop and implement access plans, with some already released and more expected in 2015. Bills to extend public access to federal research data were considered in the 113th Congress, with potential interest in such measures in the 114th Congress. The 114th Congress may consider federal policies to promote technological innovation and job growth. Tax incentives can influence high-wage job creation, with current federal tax law affecting new business formation and investment in R&D. The tax incentives under current federal law include a credit for research expenditures, a partial exclusion for capital gains from qualified small business stock, and a permanent expensing allowance. Some analysts argue that the current credit's incentive effect is weak due to design problems such as lack of permanence and limited usability for small startup companies. The credit expired in 2014. The Section 1202 capital gains exclusion is a permanent tax provision, with a 50% exclusion for stock acquired in 2015 and beyond. It aims to encourage equity investment in small startup firms, particularly in manufacturing, by reducing the tax burden on returns. Access to capital remains a significant barrier for young startup firms, which are crucial for U.S. job growth. Congress may need to consider new initiatives, including tax incentives, to boost domestic high-paying jobs. The 114th Congress may address issues related to the adequacy of the U.S. science and engineering workforce, including efforts to develop the future workforce and improve STEM skills. Congress has enacted programs to support education and development in these fields to maintain technological leadership and economic strength. Some policymakers aim to enhance STEM skills for more students and attract foreign scientists and engineers to the U.S. There is no definitive definition of the S&E workforce, but the focus is on computer, math, engineering, and physical science occupations. The debate centers on the adequacy of the workforce, including various occupations like life scientists, S&E managers, and social scientists. Many stakeholders have differing views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce in the United States, including the existence of a shortage and the need for policy interventions. Key indicators for assessing labor shortages include employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates. STEM education focuses on teaching in science, technology, engineering, and math fields. The term \"STEM education\" refers to teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Policymakers have a strong interest in STEM education, with varying estimates of federal STEM education efforts and annual appropriations. The national conversation often revolves around concerns about the U.S. science and engineering workforce. Many advocates debate the shortage of STEM workers in the U.S. and the benefits of increasing STEM abilities in the workforce. Some scholars oppose using education policy to address this issue, preferring the labor market to signal demand for STEM skills. Analysts have varying opinions on federal STEM education policy, with some advocating for comprehensive policies to improve STEM achievement for all students. Advocates debate strategies to improve STEM achievement for all students, including changes in teaching methods and targeted policies. Governance issues were prominent in the debate over federal STEM education funding in FY2014 and FY2015, with the Obama Administration making significant changes to the investment portfolio. The number of investments in federal STEM education decreased from 228 in FY2012 to 136 in FY2014, with a budget totaling $2.818 billion. The FY2015 budget sought to further reduce investments to 109, totaling $2.920 billion. Questions remain about the disposition and composition of STEM education efforts in FY2015 and FY2016, and their alignment with the federal STEM education strategy. For more information, refer to CRS reports on STEM education funding trends and policy discussions. The federal government supports billions of dollars in agricultural research annually, with the 114th Congress likely facing budget issues and specific challenges related to advances in agricultural biotechnology. Public investment in agricultural research has been linked to productivity gains, leading to increased agricultural and economic growth. The USDA conducts agricultural research with about $2.5 billion in funding annually. Congress reauthorizes agricultural research in omnibus farm bills, with the 2014 farm bill increasing mandatory spending by $1 billion over 10 years. Funding was also increased for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative. The 2014 farm bill increased funding for agricultural research, including the Specialty Crop Research Initiative and the Organic Agricultural Research and Extension Initiative. It also provided $200 million for the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research to support collaborative partnerships in research. The 2014 Farm Bill (P.L. 113-79) may address issues related to bioengineered animals for human consumption and labeling of bioengineered foods. The FDA is close to approving a bioengineered salmon that grows faster than non-bioengineered salmon. The FDA is close to approving a bioengineered salmon with potential ecological impacts. The agency is addressing public comments before issuing a final decision. Approval of the salmon has faced opposition from environmental groups and food safety advocates. Previous Congresses have considered bills related to labeling bioengineered food and preventing the escape of bioengineered salmon. Several bills in the 114th Congress address the labeling of bioengineered fish and foods with bioengineered ingredients. New technologies for genetically engineering plants have raised regulatory issues as the USDA lacks jurisdiction over these new techniques. This has prompted discussions on revisiting the regulatory framework for genetically engineered plants. Congress may revisit the 1986 framework governing U.S. biotechnology regulation as certain varieties are not regulated under the PPA. For further information, refer to various CRS reports on genetically engineered salmon, agricultural biotechnology, biotechnology in animal agriculture, deregulating genetically engineered alfalfa and sugar beets, and unapproved genetically modified wheat discovered in Oregon and Montana. The 114th Congress may face issues related to biomedical research and development, including budget oversight of the National Institutes of Health and the development of medical countermeasures to various threats. The NIH has a budget of $30.3 billion for research in laboratories and institutions nationwide, supporting over 300,000 scientists and research personnel. NIH funding has decreased by 22% since its peak in FY2003, with budget constraints limiting growth below inflation rates. Efforts are being made to improve research training, increase diversity in the workforce, and support career advancement for minorities. Programs like IDeA and STEM education are being reevaluated due to budget constraints. In FY2012, Congress approved an NIH reorganization focused on \"translational medicine\" to convert basic research into clinical applications. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) works on testing therapeutic products and fostering partnerships for faster commercialization. Congress may have concerns about government overlap with private sector product development and NIH expanding its mission into drug development. Other oversight topics include human research subject protection and the termination of the National Children's Study in December 2014. The National Children's Study, a 25-year-long $2.7 billion research project enrolling 100,000 children, was terminated in December 2014. Concerns about protecting research subjects and risks from intentional misuse of pathogens have been recognized by scientists. For more information, refer to CRS reports on NIH funding, federal research and development funding, and public health service agencies. The federal government addresses laboratory worker safety through best-practices guidance like Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), which establishes \"Biosafety Levels\" for working with high-risk pathogens. Compliance with BMBL is often required, especially for federal grant recipients. Biosecurity requirements to prevent releases of pathogens were mandated by Congress in 1996 and have been expanded since then. The federal Select Agent Program, established in 1996 and overseen by CDC and USDA, regulates the possession of dangerous biological pathogens and toxins. All U.S. labs handling select agents must register and follow best practices, with personnel undergoing FBI background checks. Incidents of mishandling select agents in federal labs, including the discovery of viable smallpox virus samples in an FDA lab on an NIH campus, occurred in 2014. The Select Agent Program, overseen by CDC and USDA, regulates dangerous biological pathogens. Incidents of mishandling select agents in federal labs have occurred, including finding viable smallpox virus samples in an FDA lab on an NIH campus. Congress may revisit program authority or regulations to ensure safety and security measures are adequate. The federal government responded to the vulnerability to biological terrorism after the anthrax attacks of 2001 by increasing efforts to protect against CBRN terrorism. Despite creating programs to encourage development of medical countermeasures, there is still a lack of such countermeasures for many CBRN threats, including Ebola. BARDA and Project BioShield are key federal programs addressing this issue. BARDA and Project BioShield are federal programs supporting the development and procurement of CBRN medical countermeasures. BARDA funds countermeasure development through contracts with private sector developers, while Project BioShield provides a procurement mechanism to remove market uncertainty. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 reauthorized and modified these programs, but key issues like appropriations and countermeasure prioritization remain unresolved. Congress may decide on funding for Project BioShield through multiyear advance appropriations. Policymakers will assess if new planning and transparency requirements in PAHPRA have improved coordination of countermeasure development. Congress will also review the countermeasure prioritization process in light of the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Science and technology are crucial for national defense, with the Department of Defense relying on research and development for military systems. Issues for the 114th Congress may include defense science and technology. The Department of Defense's science and technology budget concerns and effectiveness in transitioning findings into products are key issues for the 114th Congress. Over $60 billion is spent annually on research and development, with 80% allocated to military systems like aircraft carriers and fighter jets. The remaining 20% (around $11-12 billion) is dedicated to the Science and Technology Program, which supports basic science and new technology demonstrations for maintaining U.S. military superiority. The Department of Defense's research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) budget, which includes close to 1,000 line items, is subject to congressional oversight for adjustments in funding. Key concerns include ensuring sufficient funding for basic research, speeding up technology transition, and maintaining an adequate supply of S&T personnel. Further sequestrations could impact RDT&E. The Department of Defense's RDT&E budget is subject to congressional oversight for funding adjustments. Key concerns include ensuring funding for basic research, technology transition, and maintaining S&T personnel. Secretary Hagel's Defense Innovation Initiative aims to maintain U.S. military dominance, including the establishment of the Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program. The effects of these initiatives on RDT&E budgets and results are yet to be seen. Science and technology-related energy issues before the 114th Congress may include funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Science and Advanced Research Projects. For further information, contact John Moteff, Specialist in Science and Technology Policy. The Department of Energy's Office of Science and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy play a significant role in funding and developing biofuels, reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, and ocean energy technology. The Office of Science conducts basic research in various program areas and oversees national laboratories like Oak Ridge and Lawrence Berkeley. The office is a major federal funder of basic research in the physical sciences. The Office of Science's budget primarily supports national laboratories, university researchers, and other recipients. Funding levels have been a policy concern, with authorized increases not being met in actual appropriations. The 114th Congress is considering reauthorizing funding for the Office of Science. FY2015 funding is $5.068 billion. The FY2015 funding for the Office of Science is $5.068 billion. There are concerns about the ITER project, an international effort to design a fusion reactor, which has increased budget pressure on domestic fusion activities. Some analysts claim that funding for U.S. fusion researchers has been cut to maintain funding for ITER. There are also concerns about ITER's management, cost, and schedule, leading to proposals to withdraw from the project. The U.S. ITER program's website states that over 80% of project funding is spent in the U.S., providing access to technology and data for American entities. The 114th Congress may also consider topics like technology transfer and exascale computing research. For more information, refer to CRS reports on America COMPETES Acts and Energy and Water Development appropriations. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) was established to overcome technological barriers in energy development, similar to DARPA's role in critical technology advancements. ARPA-E has funded over 360 energy research projects since FY2009, but its authorization expired in FY2013. The 114th Congress faces decisions on funding and policy for ARPA-E, with a $329 million gap between House and Senate appropriations in FY2014. ARPA-E received $280 million in FY2014 and FY2015, with differing House and Senate appropriations recommendations. Policymakers struggle to determine optimal funding levels for agencies like ARPA-E, especially for transformative research with higher failure rates. Some argue for increased funding due to private sector reluctance to support high-risk research. Some question private sector support for ARPA-E projects, citing previous funding for grantees. A 2012 GAO report stated most projects couldn't be funded solely by private investors. ARPA-E's impact may take decades to be clear. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. Biofuels are seen as an alternative to conventional fuels, with potential benefits like reducing dependence on foreign oil, improving rural economies, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. However, concerns exist about their environmental impact, cost of production, and competition with other industries. Policymakers face a complex debate on the feasibility of biofuels, considering factors like feedstock costs and commercial-scale production. The debate on biofuels is complex due to various feedstocks and technologies used in production. Specific knowledge is needed to assess costs and benefits for each biofuel. U.S. energy policy influences investment in biofuel research and production. Congress has focused on \"first-generation\" biofuels like cornstarch ethanol, with farm bills playing a significant role in research and development since 2002. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires U.S. transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of biofuel, with a focus on advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. However, delays in setting annual usage requirements by the EPA have led to uncertainty and challenges in meeting targets. This policy may require more biofuel production than can be used effectively in the existing motor fuel market. The policy may require more biofuel production than can be effectively used due to limitations in the motor fuel distribution infrastructure and the limited fleet of vehicles that can run on higher biofuel blends. Congress may need to consider the necessity of a domestic biofuel industry for national defense and the potential role of the military in biofuel production. Additionally, Congress could evaluate modifying biofuel promotional efforts or maintaining the current status quo. The 114th Congress may address technology issues concerning oil and gas exploration on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and renewable ocean energy resources. Advances in deepwater drilling technology, safety measures post-Deepwater Horizon spill, and challenges of offshore drilling in the Arctic are key areas of interest for Congress. The challenges of Arctic oil and gas exploration include extreme weather, sea ice, and lack of infrastructure. Industry R&D focuses on technology to extend the drilling season, such as ice-capable drilling units. Concerns also exist about response to oil spills in the remote and harsh Arctic conditions. The Department of the Interior proposed safety regulations in 2015, which some argue are unnecessary and costly. There are debates on whether any rules or technologies can ensure drilling safety in the Arctic. The Department of the Interior (DOI) faces challenges in ensuring safety in the Arctic due to environmental obstacles. Congress must consider these concerns when overseeing DOI regulations. Wind energy is the primary renewable ocean technology ready for commercial use in U.S. waters, with seven leases issued but none operational yet. Developers are working on improving offshore turbine efficiency and reducing costs, including larger turbines and floating turbines for deep waters. Research is also focusing on enhancing electrical infrastructure for multiple projects. Offshore wind energy is the primary renewable ocean technology ready for commercial use in U.S. waters, with developers focusing on improving turbine efficiency and reducing costs. Congress could potentially consider grants for R&D, project loan guarantees, extension of federal tax credits, and regulatory issues for offshore wind and other renewables. Spent fuel from commercial nuclear reactors contains uranium, plutonium, and radioactive isotopes. The debate revolves around whether to reprocess the fuel to extract materials for new reactor fuel or dispose of it directly. Reprocessing could recover substantial energy but also poses nonproliferation concerns due to the potential use of plutonium in nuclear weapons. In the past, the government expected all commercial spent fuel to be reprocessed. President Carter halted commercial reprocessing efforts in 1977 due to concerns about weapons proliferation. President Reagan restarted a breeder demonstration project, but funding was stopped in 1983. President Clinton largely halted research on nuclear energy reprocessing, while the George W. Bush Administration renewed support for reprocessing with a new technology called UREX+. Obama's administration continued some work on reprocessing for waste management purposes. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program has shifted focus away from UREX+ under the Obama Administration. Funding for the program in FY2016 was $217.8 million, a 10.5% increase from the previous year. Science and technology are increasingly important in addressing environmental issues. Science and technology are crucial in addressing environmental issues, with climate change, carbon sequestration, and ocean acidification being key topics for the 114th Congress. The feasibility and costs of greenhouse gas regulations, such as the Clean Power Plan, will heavily rely on Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology. The President requested $7.4 billion for FY2016 to address these issues. For FY2016, the President requested $7.4 billion for clean energy programs and $2.7 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The proposed budget includes changes to tax incentives for technologies that impact greenhouse gas emissions. Congressional discussions may focus on federal expenditures for climate change and their effectiveness. Several bills were introduced in the 113th and 114th Congress to address climate change amidst budget pressures. Proposals include prohibiting the Administration from regulating GHG emissions without congressional approval, establishing new federal programs to reduce emissions, taxing carbon in fossil fuels, and supporting adaptation to climate change. Sector-specific issues like biofuel production incentives and emissions abatement from electricity generation are also likely to be addressed. Additionally, investments in technologies to mitigate damages from extreme weather events may be proposed. Technologies and investments to support resilience to future climate change have been proposed in legislation. Congress may address the federal role in facilitating effective private decision-making to anticipate and be resilient to changes. Efforts to incorporate climate change projections into agency management of federal resources and infrastructure may be considered. Scientific information and available technologies will be crucial for effective decision-making. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a process that involves capturing CO2 emissions at their source and storing them to prevent their release into the atmosphere. This technology is important for addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) involves capturing CO2 emissions at their source, purifying, compressing, and transporting the CO2 to a sequestration site, and injecting it into subsurface geological reservoirs. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has been researching and developing aspects of an integrated CCS system. Since 1997, the U.S. Department of Energy has allocated approximately $6 billion for research, development, and demonstration of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. While there are no commercial ventures in the U.S. capturing large quantities of CO2 for sequestration, the CCS program is working on commercial-scale demonstration projects for CO2 capture, injection, and storage, which will impact the future deployment of CCS technologies. The EPA standard to limit CO2 emissions from new coal-fired power plants has renewed scrutiny of CCS technology for commercial deployment. Congress should review demonstration projects to gauge DOE's progress in meeting its goal of advanced CCS technology readiness by 2020. The U.S. Department of Energy emphasizes the importance of reliable water quantity and quality for the population, ecosystems, and economy. Recent climate change impacts have increased the focus on water science and technology. Federal water research lacks a cohesive strategy or coordination mechanism, as highlighted by the National Research Council in 2004. The distribution of water research funding does not align with the nation's priority water research needs and favors short-term research. Reports recommend renewed funding for research on water use, conservation, and augmentation. Federal efforts to enhance data collection and coordination for state water management activities are needed. Water research, coordination, and federal funding have been topics of interest in recent Congresses. In recent Congresses, water research funding distribution does not align with national priorities and favors short-term research. Issues for the 114th Congress include providing additional direction for federal water research, supporting specific research topics like energy-water research, and reauthorizing appropriations for existing efforts such as federal desalination research. Ocean acidification is also a concern. Ocean acidification is the increase in seawater acidity due to CO2 absorption, potentially harming shell-forming animals and disrupting marine ecosystems. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 was passed to address this issue. The Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act of 2009 led to the development of a Strategic Plan for Federal Research and Monitoring of Ocean Acidification in 2014. The plan includes themes such as monitoring ocean chemistry and biological impacts, understanding responses to ocean acidification, predicting changes in the ocean carbon cycle, technology development, assessing socioeconomic impacts, education and outreach, and data management. The Act required the establishment of an ocean acidification program within NOAA, support for research proposals by the NSF, and the use of space-based assets by NASA to monitor ocean acidification. In the 113th Congress, bills related to ocean acidification were introduced, including the Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act of 2014 (H.R. 4692), the Ocean Acidification Innovation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4732), and a bill to reauthorize FOARAM (H.R. 5545). Potential issues for the 114th Congress include the need for continued interagency coordination and adequate resources for research and monitoring activities. The federal government invests billions in research and development for homeland security, with potential considerations for the 114th Congress on the Department of Homeland Security's research and development performance. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focuses on preventing terrorism, securing borders, enforcing immigration laws, safeguarding cyberspace, and ensuring disaster resilience. Research and development by DHS, including the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), play a crucial role in achieving these goals. The Coast Guard also conducts R&D related to its mission. These organizations report their R&D expenditures to the Office of Management and Budget. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focuses on preventing terrorism, securing borders, enforcing immigration laws, safeguarding cyberspace, and ensuring disaster resilience. Research and development by DHS, including the Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), play a crucial role in achieving these goals. The Coast Guard also conducts R&D related to its mission. These organizations report their R&D expenditures to the Office of Management and Budget. However, according to the Government Accountability Office, at least 10 DHS components fund R&D and R&D-related activities. Coordination of DHS R&D is a long-standing congressional concern. In 2012, GAO concluded that because so many components of the department are involved, it is difficult for DHS to oversee R&D department-wide. In January 2014, the joint explanatory statement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ) directed DHS to implement and report on new policies for R&D prioritization. It also directed DHS to review and implement policies and guidance for defining and overseeing R&D department-wide. In July 2014, GAO reported that DHS had updated its guidance to include a definition of R&D and was conducting R&D portfolio reviews across the department, but that it had not yet developed policy guidance for DHS-wide R&D oversight. The S&T Directorate oversees federal laboratories, R&D centers, and university centers of excellence. It has expanded its role in technology acquisition and operational support for other DHS components. R&D activities focus on short-term projects with less emphasis on basic research and high-risk projects. DHS has reorganized its R&D-related activities multiple times. DNDO and OHA were created from elements of the S&T. DNDO and OHA were created from elements of the S&T Directorate. Congress directed DHS to evaluate merging DNDO and OHA, possibly realigning functions. Congress emphasizes detecting smuggled nuclear material, investing in nuclear detection domestically and abroad. The U.S. government engages internationally through threat reduction programs and providing detection equipment to foreign governments. The U.S. government is enhancing supply-chain security efforts and border security through various detection programs. However, experts criticize the current system for not being able to detect all smuggled nuclear material. Research and development activities are ongoing to improve detection capabilities, but there are challenges such as a shortfall of key neutron detection material. The development and deployment of new neutron-detection materials, including helium-3, are being overseen by Congressional policymakers. The BioWatch program, initiated in 2003, uses pathogen sensors in over 30 U.S. cities to detect potential bioterrorism threats. The DHS Office of Health Affairs manages the system, while the CDC oversees laboratory testing. Local jurisdictions are responsible for public health management. BioWatch, a program overseen by DHS, uses pathogen sensors in U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism threats. Despite not detecting any incidents, it has identified pathogens of interest. Criticisms of BioWatch's performance have been disputed by DHS, with state and local health officials defending the program for fostering collaboration. Timely treatment is crucial in reducing casualties during a bioterrorism incident. The BioWatch program, overseen by DHS, uses pathogen sensors in U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism threats. Despite criticisms and procurement delays, DHS terminated Gen-3 sensor procurement activities in 2014. Congressional committees have held hearings on the program's expansion and funding. The BioWatch program overseen by DHS uses pathogen sensors in U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism threats. Congressional committees have held hearings on the program since the 108th Congress. The Administration requested FY2015 funding to maintain current BioWatch operations without upgrade, and the President's FY2016 budget request also seeks funding for the same purpose. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees urged OHA to improve the program's detection capability. The rapid advancements in information technology pose cybersecurity challenges for policymakers, including concerns about the security of information systems. The federal role in cybersecurity is complex, involving securing federal systems and protecting nonfederal systems. Various statutes address cybersecurity, but there is no overarching framework legislation in place. The federal policy framework must consider the evolving technology and threats, the Internet's growing importance in the economy and citizens' lives. Congress faces issues like cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, cybercrime prevention, national security in cyberspace, and federal funding for information system protection. Proposed legislation focuses on national strategy, reforming FISMA, critical infrastructure protection, information sharing, and data breaches. The White House issued an executive order in February 2013 to improve cybersecurity of U.S. critical infrastructure through voluntary collaborative efforts involving federal agencies and private infrastructure owners. Legislation in the 113th Congress addressed FISMA reform and federal cybersecurity workforce issues. The 114th Congress is considering cybersecurity legislation and additional proposals related to the federal cybersecurity workforce, protection of critical infrastructure, and R&D. The Internet is comprised of international and decentralized networks largely owned and operated by private sector entities. The Internet is governed by a private sector organization called ICANN, managing domain names and addressing using a multistakeholder model. NTIA has oversight through the IANA functions contract. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet community, potentially letting its contract with ICANN expire by September 30, 2015. The transition proposal must not involve government-led solutions. Supporters believe the transition will help the US advocate against intergovernmental control over the Internet, while critics fear hostile foreign governments gaining influence. The 114th Congress is expected to closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of authority over ICANN. The 114th Congress is likely to closely examine NTIA's proposed transition of its authority over ICANN. Congress may monitor and evaluate the transition plan, seeking assurances for a stable, secure, resilient, and open Internet and domain name system. Funding restrictions in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 prevent NTIA from relinquishing its responsibility during FY2015. Broadband technology, delivered through various means, is crucial for telecommunications services. Congress sees broadband deployment as vital for economic development and job creation. The lack of broadband availability is most acute in rural areas, where costs and low population densities hinder investment. Broadband adoption remains a challenge, with one in four American households not subscribing to broadband services. According to 2013 Census data, about 25% of American households do not have broadband. Groups that are less likely to have broadband include those with low incomes, seniors, minorities, the less-educated, non-family households, and the non-employed. The 114th Congress may address various broadband-related issues such as the transition of the Universal Service Fund to the Connect America Fund, funding for the broadband loan program, new wireless spectrum policies, and potential regulation for an open Internet. Additionally, Congress may review the regulatory structure and consider revising the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Communications Act of 1934 in light of changes in the telecommunications industry and the shift to the Internet. The transition to an Internet Protocol (IP) based network and the convergence of telecommunications providers have led policymakers to consider revising the current regulatory framework to enhance broadband deployment. Congress may explore options to increase broadband availability and adoption while minimizing negative impacts on competition and private sector investment.

As policymakers debate telecommunications reform, a key issue is ensuring unfettered access to the Internet. Discussions include placing restrictions on network owners. The debate on net neutrality focuses on ensuring equal access to the Internet without discrimination by network owners. Policymakers are discussing the need for regulatory guidelines to protect the marketplace. Some argue for specific regulatory guidelines to protect the marketplace and ensure net neutrality, while others believe existing laws are sufficient and new regulations could hinder internet expansion and innovation. Concerns include potential discriminatory behaviors by broadband providers. The debate over net neutrality revolves around network providers controlling access and pricing of broadband facilities, potentially favoring affiliated content. There is disagreement on the need for FCC regulation, with some supporting the 2015 Open Internet Order, others calling for Congress to amend laws, and some arguing against regulation altogether. The issue of broadband regulation and FCC authority is a growing concern in policy debates. The issue of broadband regulation and FCC authority is a growing concern in policy debates, with the debate over net neutrality focusing on network providers controlling access and pricing of broadband facilities. Congress passed the High-Performance Computing and Communications Program (HPCC) Act of 1991 to enhance federally-funded IT research and development programs. Government-funded IT research plays a crucial role in supporting long-term research into fundamental aspects of computing, leading to open standards and various benefits for government, industry, academia, and the public. Critics, however, raise concerns about the government's funding mechanisms. Government-funded IT research supports long-term research into fundamental aspects of computing, leading to open standards and benefits for government, industry, academia, and the public. Critics argue that government funding may influence technological development, a role that should belong to the private sector. The size of the NITRD Program could lead industry to follow government research directions instead of choosing their own. Funding for the NITRD Program will be part of the federal budget debate in Congress. The rapid growth in mobile voice and data technologies has created new demands for advanced communications infrastructure and radio frequency spectrum capacity to support high-speed, content-rich uses. Immediate policy concerns focus on providing new spectrum capacity for networks using IP-enabled technologies. The United States is a global leader in fourth-generation wireless technologies and cyber-physical systems. The challenge is to bring wireless network technology to the next level to ensure American leadership in a wireless, mobile economy for the future. The Internet of Things, part of cyber-physical systems, requires radio frequency spectrum for connectivity. 5G wireless technologies will likely develop alongside these systems. Debates in Congress may focus on the impact of technology and government's role in response. Policies may need to adapt to the changes brought by the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things is changing the world and will require modifications to policies to meet new technological demands. For example, access to the Internet is transforming education delivery and may change policymakers' expectations to ensure necessary skills are available in the labor market. The arrival of the Internet of Things will likely necessitate significant changes and coordination across all government departments, from agriculture to transportation. The curr_chunk discusses policy issues related to federal support for research and development in physical and material sciences, including funding and oversight of agencies like the National Science Foundation and initiatives in nanotechnology. It also mentions the Department of Energy's support for science and technology in these fields. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established in 1950 to support basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering. It is a key source of federal support for U.S. university research, particularly in fields like mathematics and computer science. The NSF also plays a significant role in federal STEM education programs and student aid. The current funding for NSF in FY2015 is $7.344 billion, with a key policy concern being the foundation's funding levels and the future of the \"doubling path policy.\" Since 2002, NSF authorization acts have aimed for large budget increases over a short period, but actual appropriations rarely meet authorized levels. Advocates of doubling path policy argue for steep funding increases to ensure U.S. competitiveness, while others suggest steady funding increases over longer periods. Some prefer directing federal funding to mission-oriented research or increasing research tax credits for private industry. Policymakers also consider reducing NSF funding. The National Science Foundation faces enduring federal policy issues such as scientific independence, accountability to taxpayers, funding for behavioral and social sciences, geographic distribution of grants, selection and management of projects, grant-making process, STEM field participation, STEM education investments, scholarships, and data production about the U.S. scientific and technological enterprise. Nanotechnology, focusing on matter at dimensions of 1 to 100 nanometers, offers economic and societal benefits through incremental improvements in existing products. Nanotechnology offers modest economic and societal benefits through improvements in various products, such as automobile parts, clothes, and sporting goods. In the longer term, it may lead to revolutionary advances in cancer treatment, renewable energy, water filtration, self-healing materials, and memory devices, supported by public investments in R&D. Clinton launched the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) to accelerate nanotechnology R&D and enable the development of new materials and products. Over $19.4 billion has been appropriated for nanotechnology R&D through FY2014, with a $1.5 billion funding request for FY2015. Congress enacted the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act in 2003, but subsequent legislation to amend and reauthorize the act has not been enacted. Congress has focused on three key topics that may impact nanotechnology's potential. The text discusses three key topics that may affect nanotechnology's potential: R&D funding, U.S. competitiveness, and environmental, health, and safety concerns. Congress has historically shown interest in space policy issues, including the reauthorization of NASA and Earth-observing satellites. The 114th Congress is expected to address NASA reauthorization legislation, focusing on the goals and strategy of NASA's human spaceflight program and the impact of constrained budgets on other missions. Since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011, NASA has relied on Russian spacecraft for crew transport to the International Space Station, while U.S. commercial flights have been delivering cargo since 2012. NASA is pursuing a two-track strategy for human spaceflight as directed by the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. NASA is pursuing a two-track strategy for human spaceflight. Commercial crew transportation services are expected to become operational in 2017 for low Earth orbit missions, while a new crew capsule called Orion and a heavy-lift rocket are being developed for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The first crewed test flight of Orion is expected in FY2021 or FY2022, with an asteroid as the planned first destination. Funding increases projected in the 2010 authorization act did not materialize, leading to concerns about the cost of planned human spaceflight programs. One concern is that the cost of planned human spaceflight activities may impact funding for other NASA missions, such as unmanned science satellites, aeronautics research, and space technology development. Other missions facing issues include the James Webb Space Telescope, future plans for unmanned Mars exploration, and NASA's role in Earth science. The United States government operates a constellation of Earth-observing satellites that collect data on various activities like measuring polar ice sheet mass, wind speeds, land cover change, and atmospheric parameters for weather forecasts. Satellite observations aid in short-term forecasts for El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a conditions, wildfire detection, and long-term climate data for predictive models on climate change. Congress remains interested in NASA, NOAA, and U.S. performance. Congress is concerned about NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey's performance in building and operating Earth-observing satellites, particularly the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) facing delays and cost overruns. JPSS, set to launch in 2017, aims to provide daily polar orbit measurements for weather forecasts. The Suomi-NPP satellite currently fills the gap until JPSS is operational, but its mission only extends to 2016, raising concerns about potential coverage gaps in the polar-orbiting weather satellite system. The Suomi-NPP satellite fills the gap until the JPSS spacecraft is operational, but its mission only extends to 2016, raising concerns about potential coverage gaps in the polar-orbiting weather satellite system. Landsat 8, launched on February 11, 2013, is the latest in a series of Earth-observing satellites used in various applications. Congress is considering whether there should be a Landsat 9 or another moderate resolution land-imaging satellite.
