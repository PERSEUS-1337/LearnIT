    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Aviation and Flight Enhancement Act of 2007\". Congress finds that since 1996, there have been eight major commercial air accidents with delayed recovery of flight data and cockpit voice recorder units. The events of September 11, 2001, highlighted the inadequacy of fixed recorder technology, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission staff. The TSA and FAA must enhance the survivability of flight data and cockpit voice recorders for better post-terrorist attack investigation. The 2006 terrorist bombing attempt and recent FAA ruling on extended-operation aircraft highlight ongoing security threats to commercial flights. The public interest is in equipping aircraft with recorder units that can be quickly recovered after an incident, such as when ETOPs travel from an emergency airport, increasing the difficulty of locating and recovering flight data and cockpit voice recorder units. SEC. 3. REGULATIONS REQUIRING DEPLOYABLE RECORDERS AND OTHER PURPOSES. Chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require all commercial aircraft in extended-range operations to have a second deployable recorder system that combines cockpit voice and digital flight data recording technology. This system must be mounted as far rear on the airframe as possible and meet minimum capabilities. The deployable recorder system must record all mandatory data parameters and cockpit audio for specific time frames, be powered by the electrical bus, and have an independent power source for emergency situations. Regulations will mandate the installation of a second combined system on commercial aircraft in extended-range operations. Regulations require the installation of a deployable combination recorder system on commercial aircraft ordered by an air carrier after January 1, 2009. Definitions include commercial aircraft as jet or propeller-driven planes meeting specific criteria, and a deployable recorder system as a unit housing digital flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder, and emergency locator transmitter. The curr_chunk discusses the term 'extended-range operations' in commercial aircraft, allowing them to fly up to 240 minutes of single-engine flying time from an adequate airport. This is a conforming amendment to regulations requiring the installation of a deployable combination recorder system on commercial aircraft. The Secretary of Transportation will reimburse air carriers for purchasing and installing deployable recorder systems to comply with regulations. Regulations will define a reasonable reimbursement amount within 90 days of the Act's enactment."
