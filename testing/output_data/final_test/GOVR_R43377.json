    "content": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has faced conflict and state collapse since 2013 when the Seleka rebel movement took over the government. Anti-balaka militias formed in response, leading to widespread violence and weak institutions. Despite a decrease in violence since 2013-2014, periodic flare-ups continue to disrupt social cohesion and government stability. CAR has a history of insurgencies and army mutinies since the 1990s. In early 2016, national elections were held, marking a transition from an interim government. Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra was elected president in the national elections, marking CAR's second democratic transfer of power since independence from France in 1960. The new National Assembly convened in May 2016, formally ending the political transition period. Donors are supporting the new government while addressing policy concerns and global demands for humanitarian and peacekeeping resources. International forces, including the U.N. Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA), have been deployed since 2013 to stabilize the country. MINUSCA, a military force in CAR, is mandated to protect civilians, support reconciliation, assist with security sector reform, and provide humanitarian aid. France deployed Operation Sangaris in late 2013 to disarm militias and secure Bangui. The EU also deployed soldiers to help secure the capital. President Touad\u00e9ra has been slow to advance initiatives for stability, with state institutions absent in much of the country. State institutions are absent in much of CAR, leading to the displacement of the minority Muslim community. The Seleka movement has fragmented, resulting in internal conflicts and targeting civilians. Various parties, including the military, are involved in racketeering and extortion. The Lord's Resistance Army is active in the east, taking advantage of the country's instability. Opposition to MINUSCA is fueled by capacity issues, scandals of sexual abuse by foreign troops, and self-interested actions of nativist politicians. Hundreds of thousands of Central Africans are refugees in neighboring countries, with many internally displaced. The Central African Republic (CAR) is facing a dire humanitarian situation with 385,000 internally displaced out of a total population of 5 million. Economic activity has slightly improved since 2015, but GDP remains below pre-conflict levels. The country was already one of the world's poorest, ranking 187 out of 188 on the 2015 U.N. Human Development Index. International policymakers are debating transitioning from emergency aid to development assistance for CAR. The Central African Republic (CAR) is in need of support for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants. Questions arise about funding, eligibility of fighters for integration or civilian assistance, and the role of international troops in preventing rebel assaults. The CAR government seeks to lift a U.N. arms embargo for the rearming of the CAR military, but concerns about human rights vetting and ethnic/religious balance persist. U.S. military advisors in CAR face decisions on collaborating with the CAR military, particularly in countering the LRA. The Central African Republic (CAR) seeks support for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants. Questions arise about funding, eligibility of fighters, and the role of international troops in preventing rebel assaults. U.S. military advisors in CAR face decisions on collaborating with the CAR military, especially in countering the LRA. Key issues include targeted sanctions, MINUSCA's mandate adjustments, improving effectiveness in protecting civilians, preventing sexual abuse by peacekeepers, and balancing support for the Touad\u00e9ra administration with concerns about ties to sanctioned individuals like ex-president Boziz\u00e9. The Central African Republic (CAR) faces challenges in responding to efforts by ex-Seleka leaders to reunite, encouraging the return of displaced populations, building up civilian security forces, supporting reconciliation and accountability measures, and resuming diamond exports. The conflict in CAR revolves around resource access, trade control, and national identity. The Seleka rebellion in CAR, founded in 2012, originated in northeastern CAR, a region with many Muslim communities. The movement was driven by a desire for power, looting, and revenge, drawing on grievances of political exclusion and abuse among Muslims. In response, Christian- and animist-led anti-balaka groups formed in Bangui in late 2013 to counter the Seleka takeover. Groups in Bangui organized in late 2013 in response to the Seleka takeover, fueled by anger at historic raiding by Muslims and frustrations with Muslim traders. Former President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, linked to anti-balaka mobilization, heightened religious identity politicization. Nativist anger against Chadian residents also played a role in the conflict, leading to brutal collective punishment based on sectarian identity. In 2013, Seleka commanders oversaw attacks on Christian communities, leading to massacres in Boziz\u00e9's home region. After the Seleka lost power in mid-2014, anti-balaka groups targeted Muslim communities in the south and west, forcing hundreds of thousands of Muslims to flee their homes. Muslim-owned properties were looted, mosques destroyed, and religious practices suppressed through forced conversions. Thousands of Muslims were evacuated to the northeast or neighboring countries with international assistance. The U.N. commission of inquiry found that anti-balaka groups in CAR committed \"ethnic cleansing\" against the Muslim community. Sectarian killings have decreased since 2014, but sporadic violence continues. Some violence seems spontaneous, while others are orchestrated by militia leaders with political ties. In 2015, violence erupted after the murder of a Muslim man in Bangui, leading to an attempted overthrow of the transitional government by ex-Seleka and anti-balaka hardliners. The national military (FACA) was implicated in the abuses, with a U.N. investigation noting their Christian dominance and lack of trust from Muslims. Recent sectarian and militia violence in CAR has been concentrated in Bangui and interior areas controlled by ex-Seleka and anti-balaka factions. The conflict is rooted in a history of rebel leaders being coopted into government positions, leading to cycles of violence and a perception of impunity. Analysts suggest that this conflict is also tied to systems of patronage and nepotism, allowing leaders to maintain control over the country. The recent conflict in CAR has intensified ethno-religious divisions, leading to violence between armed communities divided along religious lines. Anti-Muslim sentiment remains strong among Christians, with acts of aggression targeting Muslim populations documented by U.N. sanctions monitors in 2016. This conflict has further entrenched societal cleavages and raised questions about who has the right to live in CAR. President Touad\u00e9ra assumed office in March 2016 after winning the election with over 60% of the vote. The polls were deemed transparent by African Union observers, with voter turnout of 78% and 63% in the first and second rounds, respectively. Donors praised the election as relatively open and peaceful. Touad\u00e9ra, a former Prime Minister, ran as an independent and was not initially seen as a front-runner. President Touad\u00e9ra's victory in the election was attributed to his relative obscurity, allowing him to avoid opposition. He is the first president to come to power democratically since 1993, with international and domestic support. His administration follows the interim presidency of Catherine Samba-Panza, criticized for corruption and nepotism. Despite praise for his political coalition and personal style, challenges lie ahead for Touad\u00e9ra. The competition with Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 involved a struggle for power. Touad\u00e9ra and Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 competed for supporters of the former president, with Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 endorsed by Boziz\u00e9's party and anti-balaka militias. Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 alleged fraud in the election but conceded for peace, while also being elected to parliament leading the opposition. Touad\u00e9ra's close ties to Boziz\u00e9 raised concerns, appointing Boziz\u00e9 allies to his cabinet. Observers warn of perceived under-representation of Muslims in Touad\u00e9ra's government. Observers caution that the lack of Muslim representation in Touad\u00e9ra's government could fuel tensions, with only one Muslim in a prominent role and three in lower positions. U.N. sanctions monitors view this as a missed opportunity for inclusivity and reconciliation. Touad\u00e9ra faces challenges in disarmament, national reconciliation, military reform, and job creation to maintain popular support. Addressing CAR's history of poor governance, corruption, and impunity is crucial for stability. Despite talks with armed groups, Touad\u00e9ra's approach to these issues remains uncertain. The Bangui Forum in May 2015 produced frameworks on disarmament, reforms, and reconciliation, but the status of these commitments is now uncertain. Spoilers pose a threat as the national government is mainly in the capital, while armed factions remain active in various parts of the country. Anti-balaka leaders criticize Touad\u00e9ra's leadership, and ex-Seleka leaders are trying to reconstitute the movement. Some armed factions reject negotiations, and a fractious parliament comprises representatives from 17 parties. The new government faces challenges with a fractious parliament and questions about political will. The 2015 constitutional referendum, marred by violence, resulted in a new constitution aimed at increasing checks on presidential power and improving oversight of natural resource deals. The U.N. Security Council authorized the U.N. Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA) in 2014 to address issues of coup d'\u00c9tat, rebellion, or mutiny. MINUSCA's troop ceiling was increased to 12,870 in 2015, including military and police personnel. Despite reaching its authorized strength, logistical hurdles have hindered its effectiveness in remote areas. MINUSCA faces challenges in CAR due to lack of national transportation infrastructure, long rainy season, and troop contributor equipment shortages. Air transport to eastern and northern zones is limited by strong winds, dust, and poorly refurbished airstrips. The mission has declared \"weapons-free zones\" in conflict-affected areas like Bambari and Kaga-Bandoro, but armed actors still enter these zones. Disarmament efforts are hindered by violence triggered by incidents like the killing of a Muslim man in Kaga-Bandoro in October 2016. In CAR, a wave of violence by ex-Seleka, anti-balaka, and armed civilians claimed nearly 40 lives and displaced thousands. Twelve MINUSCA peacekeepers have been killed in \"malicious acts.\" Continued violence has fueled local frustrations with MINUSCA's perceived ineffectiveness. French, AU, and U.N. troops have been accused of sexual abuse and exploitation, including cases involving children. Troops in CAR, including French forces and MINUSCA peacekeepers, have faced numerous allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation, with 63 accusations against MINUSCA personnel since the mission's inception. A leaked memo suggested that some claims may have been fabricated for financial gain. The high number of abuses has been linked to the lack of training and vetting for African Union troops re-hatted as U.N. personnel. The U.N. has been criticized for its insufficient response to allegations of abuse by MINUSCA personnel and other foreign troops in CAR. In mid-2015, evidence of abuses by French forces in CAR was ignored by U.N. officials for months, leading to accusations of a gross institutional failure. Additionally, U.N. agencies were accused of retaliating against a human rights official who informed French authorities about the allegations. The U.N. human rights official in Geneva informed French authorities of abuse reports by French troops in 2014. The head of MINUSCA was fired in 2015, and his successor, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, is addressing abuses by providing resources for reporting, strengthening investigative officers, and protecting whistleblowers. The Secretary General announced measures to promote transparent reporting, expand prevention efforts, and strengthen accountability for troops implicated in abuses in CAR, one of the world's least developed countries. The economic sectors in CAR are in disarray due to population displacements, leading to food insecurity. Illicit economic networks thrive, with armed groups profiting from taxation, illicit trade in gold and diamonds, and poaching ivory. The country is described as a \"warlord\" economy, with armed groups using violence to collect revenue. Ivory and diamonds are lucrative sources of revenue for armed groups in CAR. Seleka fighters engaged in elephant killings and looted the Ministry of Water and Forests for weapons and ivory tusks. CAR was suspended from exporting diamonds under the Kimberley Process in 2013. Armed groups control mining sites, with over $24 million worth of diamonds smuggled out between 2013 and 2014. The Kimberley Process established a framework for resuming diamond exports from compliant zones in CAR in July 2015. The resumption of rough diamond exports from compliant zones in CAR began in 2016, with Berb\u00e9rati being certified as compliant in March and exports resuming in June. Three more sub-prefectures were declared compliant in September. Efforts to certify additional zones are ongoing, but caution is advised in areas where anti-balaka groups are active. The IMF approved a $115.8 million financial assistance package in 2016 for CAR. The IMF approved a $115.8 million financial assistance package in 2016 to promote macroeconomic stability and growth in CAR. Despite structural reforms progressing well, GDP growth projections were lowered due to security concerns, leading to increased inflation. The World Bank has also provided significant financial support since 2013 to restore government services in CAR. Since 2013, CAR has received financial assistance from the IMF and World Bank to restore government services. Humanitarian organizations are the main providers of basic services. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a Ugandan militia led by Joseph Kony, has been operating in CAR since 2008, expanding into northeastern Haute-Kotto prefecture since 2014. LRA attacks have displaced hundreds of thousands in CAR, DRC, and South Sudan. The group is attracted to CAR's remoteness and lack of effective military. The LRA exploits CAR's borders to smuggle ivory to Sudan for trafficking to Asia. Ugandan military, supported by the US, has conducted counter-LRA operations in CAR since 2009. US assistance includes logistical support, intelligence, and funding for humanitarian aid and reconciliation programs. Uganda began withdrawing troops from CAR in 2016. The LRA has exploited instability in CAR to evade regional military operations and engage in illicit trafficking of gold and diamonds. In 2015, a top LRA commander surrendered to U.S. forces in CAR and was delivered to the International Criminal Court in The Hague to face war crimes charges. In April 2015, remains exhumed from a grave in CAR were confirmed to be those of another top LRA commander, Okot Odhiambo, indicating a weakening of the group's leadership. Only Joseph Kony remains at large among the five top LRA commanders sought by the ICC since 2005. Recent estimates suggest the LRA's strength is now fewer than 200 fighters, but concerns remain about a potential resurgence. U.S. engagement in CAR has historically been limited, with a small embassy staff and military advisors supporting Ugandan-led counter-LRA operations since 2011. In December 2012, U.S. diplomatic personnel were evacuated from Bangui as the Seleka rebel movement advanced towards the capital. The U.S. government resumed limited diplomatic operations in mid-2014, with a new U.S. Ambassador, Jeffrey Hawkins, taking up his position in Bangui in October 2015. The Obama Administration significantly scaled up U.S. aid and diplomatic efforts in 2013 to address the surge of violence in CAR, including issuing targeted sanctions and providing support to African peacekeepers and French troops. The Obama Administration increased aid and diplomatic efforts in the Central African Republic (CAR) in response to escalating violence. This included funding for conflict mitigation, reconciliation, and governance programs, as well as support for the establishment of MINUSCA. U.S. officials emphasized the importance of preventing \"mass atrocities\" and imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and armed groups involved in the conflict. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power stressed the need for immediate action to prevent mass violence during a visit to Bangui in 2014. The United States imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and armed groups involved in the conflict in CAR, including former presidents, militia leaders, the Lord's Resistance Army, and diamond companies. Despite U.N. sanctions, some individuals on the list travel freely in the region. The United States has been a leading humanitarian donor to CAR since 2013, providing over $404 million in aid. The U.S. is also the top financial contributor to MINUSCA's budget, with funding provided through the State Department's CIPA account. In early 2016, the U.S. allocated $286.7 million for MINUSCA from FY2016 funds, and requested $285 million for FY2017. Additionally, the State Department requested $18.1 million in bilateral aid for CAR in FY2017, including $8 million for Peacekeeping Operations and support for security sector reform. The United States has provided significant aid to CAR, including $5.7 million for criminal justice, $4.3 million for peacebuilding, and $150,000 for military professionalization. At a donors' conference in 2016, the U.S. pledged $11.7 million for justice, law enforcement, and economic livelihoods. Total donor pledges reached $2.2 billion, excluding emergency humanitarian aid. The State Department's annual Congressional Budget Justification does not include substantial funding allocated through regionally- and centrally-managed programs for conflict-mitigation and security sector reform in CAR. USAID and the State Department allocated roughly $27 million for development and peacebuilding programs in CAR between FY2013 and FY2016. The INCLE account has become a top source of U.S. aid funding for CAR since 2014, with at least $25 million notified to Congress in FY2015 alone to support CAR's police and judicial sector. Legal restrictions on aid to CAR under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 were waived due to CAR's poor ranking in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons report. President Obama waived legal restrictions on aid to CAR due to poor ranking in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons report. The 114th Congress shaped U.S. engagement with CAR through legislative provisions, including funding for reconciliation, peacebuilding programs, and assistance for civilians affected by the LRA. Similar provisions were included in the FY2017 foreign aid appropriations bill. In the 114th Congress, legislation such as H.R. 5912 and S. 3117, along with the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016, were enacted. Resolutions introduced included H.Res. 310, S.Res. 211, S.Res. 237, H.Res. 394, and S.Res. 204, addressing issues like genocide, mass atrocities, and the Lord's Resistance Army. In the 113th Congress, S.Res. 375 passed concerning the crisis in CAR and international efforts to address it. In the 113th Congress, Senate appropriators expressed concern about violence in CAR potentially leading to genocide. The State Department submitted a strategy to promote stability in CAR, focusing on preventing mass atrocities and helping CAR become a stable regional partner. U.S. response to the conflict in CAR is seen as averting a larger crisis, although the situation remains extremely challenging. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) remains challenging despite international efforts. Congress may influence U.S. humanitarian assistance and support for stabilization. There is a debate on the effectiveness of African Union versus U.N. stabilization missions in CAR and other African countries. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) remains challenging despite international efforts. Neighboring states may have greater political commitment to resolving crises in their backyard, but regional operations are often hindered by capacity and political rivalries. U.N. peacekeeping operations, while well-funded, can be slow to deploy and risk-averse, hindering effectiveness. International interventions in CAR have had mixed results despite efforts at military interventions, peace processes, and security sector reform. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) remains challenging despite international efforts. The disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) of combatants, investigation of human rights abusers, and creation of state security forces have not significantly advanced. New harmful dynamics among communities at the grassroots level may prove difficult to contain. Concerns about the CAR crisis impacting regional stability persist, especially with conflicts in nearby countries like South Sudan, Burundi, and DRC. CAR refugees have strained local resources and insecurity has hindered cross-border trade. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) remains challenging despite international efforts. Concerns persist about regional stability being impacted by conflicts in neighboring countries like South Sudan, Burundi, and DRC. Refugees have strained local resources, insecurity hinders cross-border trade, and there are worries about transnational violent extremist organizations seeking safe havens in CAR."
