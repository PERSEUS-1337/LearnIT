The \"Zero Downpayment Mortgages Pilot Program\" allows the Secretary to insure mortgages for single-family properties with zero downpayment requirements. The curr_chunk discusses the types of properties eligible for mortgage insurance, including single-family dwellings in multifamily projects, cooperative housing units, and manufactured homes meeting specific standards. The maximum principal obligation is limited to qualify for insurance. To be eligible for insurance, a mortgage must not exceed 100% of the property's appraised value plus approved fees. The mortgage insured under this subsection is not subject to certain loan-to-value requirements. The mortgagor must meet specific requirements for a mortgage insured under this subsection. The mortgagor must be a first-time homebuyer and receive counseling from an approved third party before applying for the loan. The mortgagor must receive counseling on homeownership responsibilities and financial management from an approved third party before applying for the loan. The counseling should cover information on homeownership options other than the insured mortgage and zero- or low-downpayment mortgage options. The mortgagor must receive counseling on homeownership responsibilities, financial management, available mortgage options, financial implications, and recovery details. The counseling for mortgagors includes information on costs financed under the mortgage, estimated costs of selling the property, and real estate property management for 2- or 3-family residences. To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, the mortgagee must offer the mortgagor an optional written agreement at the time of mortgage execution. This agreement allows the mortgagee to provide notice to a housing counseling entity if the mortgagor becomes 60 days delinquent on payments. Upon notice from a mortgagee that a mortgagor is 60 days delinquent with payments, the housing counseling entity must notify the mortgagor of the delinquency and offer foreclosure prevention counseling. Failure to provide the optional written agreement required under subparagraph (A) can be corrected by sending it to the mortgagor within 60 days of delinquency. Insurance cannot be terminated or penalties imposed if the failure is corrected. The Secretary may establish penalties for mortgagees failing to provide the required agreement. The optional written agreement required under subparagraph (A) must be provided within 60 days of delinquency. Mortgagees are not liable for housing counseling entity failures to provide notice. There is no private right of action for the mortgagor. The delinquency period starts when the mortgagor becomes delinquent and ends after the first subsequent payment. The mortgage insured under this subsection is not subject to downpayment requirements or any other cash payments for acquisition. The Secretary will review program performance annually and may adjust mortgage insurance premiums as needed. The mortgage insurance program may be adjusted to ensure the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund remains financially stable. Mortgages must meet underwriting standards using approved credit scoring systems. To be eligible for insurance under this subsection, a mortgage must be made to a mortgagee that meets criteria set by the Secretary to ensure appropriate standards for participation in the program. Additionally, for a mortgage to be approved, the mortgagor of a multi-unit property must meet additional underwriting standards established by the Secretary. The mortgagee must provide the mortgagor with a written disclosure at the time of loan application, specifying the cost of borrowing the excess amount under the insured mortgage compared to a non-insured mortgage, expressed as an annual interest rate over the first 5 years. The mortgagee must engage in loss mitigation actions for insured mortgages upon default, providing an alternative to foreclosure as required by regulations. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress comparing default rates. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress comparing default and foreclosure rates for mortgages insured under this subsection, single-family mortgages insured under this title, and mortgages for housing purchased with assistance under the downpayment assistance initiative. Additional requirements for mortgage insurance may be established as necessary. The program limits the number of insured mortgages to 10% of total mortgages and loans insured by the Secretary, with a cap of 50,000 mortgages. Insuring authority will be suspended if the claim rate exceeds 3.5%, remaining in effect until the rate is reduced. The FHA total single-family annual claim rate is the ratio of claims on insured mortgages to the total number of mortgages with insurance. A suspension on insuring mortgages applies but does not affect previously executed mortgages. No new mortgages can be insured after September 30, 2010, except for those executed before that date. The FHA may endorse or insure mortgages executed before a certain date. The Comptroller General must report on the performance of insured mortgages. The Secretary can implement this subsection on an interim basis and issue a final rule after considering public comments. Amendments are made to mortgage insurance premiums under the National Housing Act. The National Housing Act is amended to include authority to insure mortgages under section 203(l). The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the financial soundness of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund if the authority is expanded or extended. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the financial soundness of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and submit a report to Congress within 60 days of any expansion or extension of authority under the National Housing Act."
