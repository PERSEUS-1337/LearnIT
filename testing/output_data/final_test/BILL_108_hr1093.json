    "content": "The \"Code Talkers Recognition Act\" acknowledges and honors Native American Code Talkers for their crucial role in communication during World War I and II, ultimately saving lives and aiding in the end of the wars. The Sioux Code Talkers used their native languages as code during World War II, providing vital information that saved many American lives. Military commanders credit them with being instrumental to the success of the United States in battles. Congress acknowledges their contribution with the Congressional Gold Medal. The Sioux Code Talkers, including Eddie Eagle Boy and Simon Brokenleg, will be honored with a Congressional Gold Medal for their crucial role in using their native languages as code during World War II. Additionally, the Comanche Code Talkers will also be recognized. The Congress declared war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The United States military sought a new code after Axis powers deciphered their messages. The Comanche Nation was asked to recruit Comanche men to develop a secret code based on their language. The Comanches, who were second-class citizens, became known for their role in the 4th Signal Division. The Comanches of the 4th Signal Division, known as the \"Comanche Code Talkers,\" developed an unbreakable military code using their language during World War II. Their efforts were instrumental in the Allied war effort in Europe and contributed to winning the war, saving countless lives. Only one of the Comanche Code Talkers remains alive today. The United States Congress should honor the remaining Comanche Code Talker for their valor and service during World War II. Congressional gold medals are a recognition of their unique and successful communication operation that helped save lives and end the war in Europe. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate will present gold medals to the Comanche Code Talkers of World War II for their contributions. This includes individuals such as Charles Chibitty, Haddon Codynah, and Robert Holder. Additionally, there is a separate section honoring the Choctaw Code Talkers. Congress acknowledges the contributions of the Choctaw Nation members who enlisted in the Armed Forces during World War I, despite not being recognized as citizens of the United States at the time. They joined the American Expeditionary Force and participated in hostile actions in France starting in the fall of 1917. During World War I, Choctaw Nation members served in the 142d Infantry Company of the 36th Division, facing challenges due to German code deciphering. An American commander utilized their native language skills for secret communication, despite government discouragement. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers were recruited for secret communication using their native language, which the Germans couldn't decipher. They played a crucial role in transmitting field telephone communications, securing positions, protecting supplies, and gun emplacements for American soldiers in October 1918. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers used their native language to transmit messages, protecting gun emplacements and aiding in the assault on German positions. The use of Choctaw language saved men and munitions, with the Germans unable to break the code, marking the first time such tactics were used in modern warfare. The Choctaw Nation honored 18 Choctaw Code Talkers with a memorial at their tribal complex in Durant, Oklahoma, showcasing their commitment to defending the nation during World War I. The Congress will present a gold medal to honor the Choctaw Code Talkers, with arrangements made by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. Additionally, there will be medals awarded to other code talkers as well. The Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to any Native American Code Talker identified by the Secretary of Defense who has not previously received a congressional gold medal. Native American members of the US Armed Forces who served as Code Talkers in foreign conflicts during the 20th Century are eligible for this honor. Eligibility for receiving a gold medal as a Native American Code Talker in the US Armed Forces during the 20th Century will be determined by the Secretary of Defense within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 402. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL MEDALS UNDER THIS ACT. Medals authorized by this Act may be awarded posthumously to Native American Code Talkers, with suitable designs emblematic of tribal affiliation determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury can create and sell bronze duplicates of gold medals under this Act. The medals are considered national medals. Funding for the medals will come from the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund."
