    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Care Freedom of Choice Act\". The \"Health Care Freedom of Choice Act\" highlights the disparity in tax benefits between employer-provided health insurance and individual purchases, leading to increased costs and limited competition in the healthcare industry. This has hindered direct doctor-patient relationships and exposed individuals to greater health risks. The current tax treatment of medical expenses restricts individuals' control over their healthcare dollars, favoring employer-provided plans over individually purchased health care. This disparity in tax benefits discriminates against individual purchases, leading to limited competition and increased costs in the healthcare industry. The Tax Code's provision of benefits for employer-provided health insurance discriminates against individuals who work for companies that do not offer health benefits, especially small businesses. This results in limited health insurance options for employees, with 90 percent of American businesses only offering one health care plan. Employees of smaller businesses are less likely to have health coverage compared to those working for larger companies. The Tax Code's preference for employer-provided group health plans has led to the consolidation of healthcare delivery into a few conglomerates, eroding the doctor-patient relationship. Medical decisions should be returned to doctors and patients for higher quality treatment and patient protection. Consumers should have the freedom to choose their health insurance, doctors, and make their own healthcare decisions. By equalizing medical choices made by individuals and those made by employers and third parties, the Tax Code can promote competition, lower insurance costs, and expand access to quality healthcare for all Americans. The Tax Code is amended to allow deductions for medical expenses not covered by insurance for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependents, starting in the next taxable year after the enactment of the Act."
