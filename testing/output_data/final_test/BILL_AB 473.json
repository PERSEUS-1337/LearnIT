    "title": "AB 473",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The electronic benefits transfer system in California must allow recipients to access benefits statewide and be compatible with systems in other states. All reasonable measures must be taken to ensure recipients can access electronically issued benefits through various devices. Benefits under Chapter 2 of Part 3 will be staggered over three days, unless a waiver is approved or in cases of hardship. The system must provide alternative access methods for recipients unable to use electronic benefits transfer due to disability or other barriers, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The system allows recipients to choose a personal identification number (PIN) for accessing benefits. Third parties issued an electronic benefits transfer card must have a separate card and PIN. Recipients can choose to restrict third party access to their benefits. Each adult member of the household can receive an electronic benefits transfer card. The system provides a 24-hour toll-free hotline and an Internet website for reporting lost or stolen cards. Recipients can request card and PIN replacements, access transaction history for the last 10 transactions, and request history for the past two months by mail. The county human services agency must provide electronic benefit transaction history details to authorized representatives or head of households within 10 business days of receiving a request, at no extra cost. A recipient will not lose electronic benefits if their card or PIN is lost or stolen. The system will promptly replace lost or stolen cards and PINs, as well as any benefits not withdrawn using an authorized PIN. Cash benefits will also not be lost due to unauthorized withdrawals. The EBT card allows recipients to access benefits directly. The State Department of Social Services establishes a protocol for reporting electronic theft of cash benefits to ensure prompt replacement and program integrity. Recipients are informed on how to use and protect their EBT cards. The electronic benefits transfer system notifies recipients of any malfunctions, error resolution procedures are in place, no fees are charged to retailers, and recipients may be charged a fee for cash withdrawals exceeding four per month, except for CalFresh transactions. The electronic benefits transfer system ensures recipients have access to benefits with minimal fees, counties can exempt individuals from staggering requirements for hardship reasons, and recipients are informed of electronic delivery methods available. The curr_chunk discusses fees, charges, and protections related to electronic benefits transfer, ways to avoid fees, where to withdraw benefits without surcharges, and options for electronic delivery of benefits. The curr_chunk outlines provisions for alternative delivery methods and exemptions for recipients facing barriers or hardships in using electronic benefits transfer cards. A county can comply with the regulations by providing recipients with information developed by the department, either verbally or in writing, in addition to the required copy."
