    "content": "The \"Congressional Pay for Performance Act\" defines terms like \"Federal deficit\" and \"Member of Congress\" and temporarily suspends usual pay adjustment procedures for Members of Congress. The \"Congressional Pay for Performance Act\" reduces the rate of basic pay for Members of Congress based on factors reflecting the Federal deficit and success in reducing it. The reduction is calculated by multiplying the applicable factors for each year. The Congressional Pay for Performance Act adjusts the pay of Members of Congress based on the Federal deficit. The reduction percentage is determined annually, starting at 2 percent and increasing based on deficit reduction success. The size of the Federal deficit is determined based on the previous fiscal year's deficit and rounded to the nearest $100 billion. The Act ensures that basic pay rates cannot fall below $1 and suspends certain sections during times of war. During times of war, subsections (a) through (d) of the Act are suspended, preventing any reduction in basic pay rates for Members of Congress. After the war, these subsections are restored, and any scheduled adjustments are implemented accordingly. The initial rate of basic pay for a Member of Congress will remain the same as before the effective date of this Act. SEC. 5. EFFECT OF ELIMINATING THE DEFICIT. Effective as of the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1st of the first year with respect to which the deficit is determined to have been eliminated, certain provisions of law will be restored, the initial rate of basic pay for a Member of Congress will be doubled, and certain other provisions will cease to be effective. The deficit is considered eliminated when the applicable factor under section 4(b) is less than 1. Any legislation changing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after the effective date of this Act will prevent the deficit from being considered eliminated. The Act will take effect on January 1st following the first election of Representatives after the enactment. The term \"election of Representatives\" is defined in the Federal Salary Act of 1967."
