These benefits allow for earlier retirement and faster pension accrual compared to regular civilian federal employees. Other law enforcement-related positions have sought similar benefits through legislation to address attrition and perceived inequity. Expanding access to enhanced benefits may help alleviate these issues. Expanding access to enhanced retirement benefits for federal law enforcement officers (LEOs) raises concerns about additional expenditures. The current definition of a LEO for retirement purposes is limited to specific duties under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). LEOs and certain personnel with LEO-equivalent benefits can retire earlier with higher benefit accrual rates during the first 20 years of service. LEOs and employees with enhanced retirement benefits contribute more to their own benefits than regular federal employees and have a mandatory retirement age. The definition of a LEO under CSRS and FERS is similar, focusing on duties related to law enforcement and protection of officials. The FERS statutory definition of a Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) emphasizes rigorous duties focused on protecting officials of the United States. The definition excludes employees whose primary duties involve maintaining law and order, protecting life and property, or investigating non-criminal offenses. Enhanced retirement benefits eligibility is not tied to the law enforcement mission of an agency. The eligibility for enhanced retirement benefits under CSRS or FERS is not dependent on the law enforcement mission of an agency or the position classification within the Federal Classification and Job Grading System. This exclusion affects police officers, guards, and inspectors from being considered \"law enforcement officers\" for federal retirement purposes. To be eligible for enhanced retirement benefits, the employing agency must determine if the duties of the position meet the statutory definition of a LEO and submit their evaluation to OPM. OPM rarely overturns the agency's decision but retains the authority to do so. Some groups have gained access to enhanced retirement benefits through direct legislation that either adds them to the statutory definition of a LEO or provides alternative eligibility criteria. Employees who believe they have been unfairly excluded from the Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) definition and retirement benefits can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Table 1 lists employee groups eligible for enhanced retirement benefits as LEOs or similar positions. The left column shows groups meeting the statutory LEO definition, while the right column includes those added through direct legislation. LEO determinations are based on duties or legislation, and Table 1 is illustrative, not exhaustive. Table 2 provides details on major occupational groups with enhanced retirement benefits through legislation. These groups are collectively referred to as law enforcement personnel due to the unique physical and mental demands of their duties. Congress aims to maintain a youthful workforce in law enforcement to ensure service quality. Enhanced retirement benefits for law enforcement personnel were established by Congress to create a financially reasonable retirement system, encourage entry at a young age, and maintain a young and vigorous federal law enforcement workforce. These benefits are not meant as compensation for the stress and hazards of the job. In 1947, Congress legislated enhanced retirement benefits and an early retirement age for FBI agents to retain youthful individuals for career service. Other federal employee groups with similar duties began petitioning for similar benefits, leading to a House Committee report in 1948 supporting the extension of benefits to these groups. In 1948, Congress extended enhanced retirement benefits to law enforcement officers, defining them broadly to include various occupational groups. Subsequent legislation, such as the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) in 1986, maintained similar definitions and benefits for these individuals. FERS, similar to CSRS, provides enhanced retirement benefits for federal employees. Most federal employees are covered under either CSRS or FERS, depending on their hire date. The Civil Service Retirement Act of 1920 created a pension plan for federal employees, while the Social Security system was established in 1935 for private-sector workers. Federal employees were included in Social Security in 1983 and FERS was created in 1986 to incorporate all civilian federal employees into a new retirement system. The CSRS annuity is the primary retirement benefit available to eligible individuals under CSRS. Employees covered by CSRS generally do not pay Social Security taxes, nor do they claim Social Security benefits. The CSRS annuity is a monthly pension based on years of service, the average of the three highest consecutive years of pay, and the accrual rate for each year of service. Employees covered under CSRS may participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but they receive no matching contributions from employing agencies. The TSP is a defined contribution retirement plan much like plans authorized under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for private-sector employers. Contributions to the TSP are at the discretion of the employee up to an annual limit. Retirement benefits under FERS consist of the FERS basic annuity, Social Security, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). FERS employees receive smaller annuity portions compared to CSRS, supplemented with Social Security and TSP. Employees may participate in TSP with matching contributions up to 5% of pay. Eligibility for retirement and annuity under both CSRS and FERS depends on age and years of service. Congress has set a mandatory retirement age for law enforcement personnel at 57 or after 20 years of service. Air traffic controllers must retire at 56 with 20 years of service, but can be exempt until 60 or 61 with agency approval. The President or head of an agency can exempt law enforcement officers from mandatory retirement if in the public interest. Federal law prohibits age limits for most federal positions, but law enforcement personnel may have a maximum entry age of 37. Law enforcement personnel can be hired and complete 20 years of service by age 57. Exceptions to the maximum entry age of 37 exist, such as veterans entering Border Patrol positions at age 40. Retirement age is 50 with 20 years of service under CSRS and FERS. Law enforcement personnel contribute more to their retirement system than regular federal employees. Regular federal employees covered by CSRS contribute 7.0% of pay, while law enforcement personnel contribute 7.5%. For FERS, employees hired before 2013 contribute 0.8% of pay, and those hired in 2013 contribute 3.1%, increasing to 4.4% for employees hired in 2014 or later. Employing agencies contribute 7.0% for CSRS employees, 13.7% for pre-2013 FERS employees, and 11.9% for post-2013 FERS employees. Law enforcement personnel contribute 1.3% before 2013 and their agencies contribute 30.1%. Under P.L. 112-96 and P.L. 113-67, law enforcement personnel hired in 2013 or later contribute 3.6% to 4.4% of pay to FERS. Agencies employing these personnel contribute 28.4% of pay. Annuities under CSRS and FERS are based on years of service, average annual salary, and accrual rate. The salary used is the average of the highest three consecutive years of base pay. Special pay provisions may provide higher rates of pay for law enforcement personnel. Special pay provisions provide higher rates of pay for law enforcement personnel, leading to increased retirement benefits. Law enforcement personnel accrue benefits at a higher rate than regular federal employees in their first 20 years of service under both CSRS and FERS. Accrual rates increase with years of service under CSRS, with law enforcement personnel accruing benefits at a rate of 2.5% per year for the first 20 years and 2% for each year after. Regular federal employees under FERS accrue benefits based on years of service and average salary. Law enforcement personnel accrue FERS benefits at a higher rate than regular federal employees, with accrual rates of 1.7% per year for the first 20 years and 1% per year thereafter. The annuity for federal employees is calculated based on years of service and salary, with a special provision for air traffic controllers guaranteeing a minimum benefit. Law enforcement personnel under FERS receive a pension based on years of service and salary, with a higher accrual rate for the first 20 years. Air traffic controllers are guaranteed a minimum benefit, receiving the greater of the annuity calculated under the CSRS formula or 50% of their high-three average salary. Individuals transferring from CSRS to FERS with five or more years of civilian service will have a CSRS component to their annuity. The FERS basic annuity for law enforcement personnel is a complement to Social Security retirement benefits. Those retiring before Social Security eligibility may receive a temporary supplement equal to estimated Social Security benefits accrued from federal service, ending at age 62. The supplement is subject to an earnings test and reduced if earnings exceed a specified limit. The COLA for CSRS and FERS annuities is based on the rate of inflation measured by the CPI-W. CSRS retirees receive COLAs, while FERS COLA is contingent on changes in the CPI-W. FERS COLA is capped at 2.0% for CPI-W changes between 2.0% and 3.0%, and for changes greater than 3.0%, FERS COLA is CPI-W change less 1 percentage point. Under FERS, nondisabled retirees under 62 do not receive COLAs, except for law enforcement personnel who retire according to eligibility requirements. FERS employees eligible for Social Security receive a separate Social Security COLA. The replacement rate measures retirement benefit income adequacy, calculated as the ratio of annual retirement benefit to preretirement earnings. CSRS law enforcement personnel, not receiving Social Security benefits, have a higher replacement rate due to a more generous annuity. Law enforcement personnel under CSRS have higher replacement rates compared to regular federal employees, with rates ranging from 50% to 60% for 20 to 25 years of service. FERS annuity complements Social Security and TSP, leading to replacement rates varying from 54% to 91% depending on work history and TSP contributions. Specifically focusing on the annuity portion, law enforcement personnel with 20 years of service would replace 34% of preretirement earnings, while those with 25 years would replace 39%. Regular federal employees with 20 years of service would earn an annuity equal to 20%. Law enforcement personnel under CSRS have higher replacement rates compared to regular federal employees, with rates ranging from 50% to 60% for 20 to 25 years of service. FERS annuity complements Social Security and TSP, leading to replacement rates varying from 54% to 91% depending on work history and TSP contributions. Legislation has been introduced to expand the definition of LEOs for retirement purposes or grant them LEO-equivalent benefits. Legislation has been introduced to expand the definition of law enforcement officers (LEO) for retirement purposes, including employees who investigate or apprehend individuals suspected of criminal offenses, carry firearms, and IRS employees involved in tax collection. Reasons for this expansion include high attrition rates and similarities in duties to those currently receiving enhanced benefits. Extending enhanced retirement benefits to other occupational groups would result in higher costs to employing agencies and the federal government. The majority of personnel pursuing enhanced benefits in the future would be covered under FERS with most costs covered by higher agency contributions. Agency contributions are based on OPM's annual actuarial calculations and may be subject to change."
