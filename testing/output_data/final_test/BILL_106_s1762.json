The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act of 2000 allows for the rehabilitation of structural measures in covered water resource projects to extend their service life and meet safety standards. This includes protecting the integrity of the structure, correcting damage from catastrophic events, and upgrading to meet changing land use conditions. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Act of 2000 allows for the rehabilitation of structural measures in covered water resource projects to extend their service life and meet safety standards, including changing safety criteria, and decommissioning if necessary. The Food Act of 1981 allows for cost share assistance for the rehabilitation of structural measures like dams in covered water resource projects. Eligible local organizations can receive financial assistance from the Secretary to cover a portion of the total costs incurred for rehabilitation. The Food Act of 1981 allows eligible local organizations to receive federal funds for the rehabilitation of structural measures in covered water resource projects. The assistance covers 65 percent of the total costs, including land acquisition, administration, technical assistance, contracting, and construction costs. The local organization is responsible for securing necessary land, easements, or rights-of-ways for the project. The rehabilitation project funding covers 65% of total costs, not exceeding 100% of construction costs. The local organization is responsible for water, mineral rights, and permits. The Secretary may require proper zoning regulations for the project location. The Secretary can provide technical assistance for watershed project rehabilitation upon request from eligible local organizations. The assistance may include specialists in various fields such as engineering, geology, agronomy, and water quality. Rehabilitation assistance provided under this section may not be used for operation and maintenance activities specified in the agreement for the water resource project. The local organization remains responsible for these activities as per the project work plan. The Secretary may renegotiate the agreement regarding operation and maintenance responsibilities after the rehabilitation is completed. An eligible local organization may apply to the Secretary for technical and financial assistance for rehabilitation of structural measures on water resource projects. The Secretary will involve the State dam safety officer in the application process if needed, and the rehabilitation must meet standards set by the Secretary. Personnel from the Natural Resources Conservation Service may assist in preparing applications for assistance. The Department of Agriculture's service can help with preparing applications for rehabilitation assistance. The Secretary requires cost-effective rehabilitation projects that meet objectives without needing a benefit-cost ratio greater than 1. A system for approving rehabilitation requests will be established by the Secretary. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a system for approving rehabilitation requests, giving priority to decommissioning requests. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 for financial and technical assistance under this section. For fiscal years 2001-2005, funding amounts are allocated for rehabilitation projects. $5,000,000 is designated for assessing rehabilitation needs in states with water resource projects. The Secretary will track project benefits and expenditures for reporting purposes. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on activities conducted under this section. Grant recipients must report on the status of rehabilitation efforts within 90 days of completing a project funded under this section. The Senate passed S. 1762 on October 24, 2000, amending the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act to authorize cost share assistance for rehabilitating structural measures in water resource projects previously funded by the Secretary of Agriculture."
