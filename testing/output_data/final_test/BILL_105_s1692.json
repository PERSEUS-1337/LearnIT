    "content": "The Software Trade Secrets Protection Act, also known as the \"Software Trade Secrets Protection Act,\" introduces special procedures for summonses related to computer software under section 7612 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Software Trade Secrets Protection Act prohibits the production or examination of computer software source code without a summons. The exception is when the IRS cannot verify the correctness of a return without accessing the source code. The IRS can request access to computer software source code for verification purposes, but only if the need for it outweighs the burdens on the summoned person and the risks of disclosing trade secrets. This exception does not apply to inquiries related to offenses connected with the enforcement of internal revenue laws. The IRS can request computer software source code for verification, with exceptions for trade secrets. Compliance with a summons for software source code can be met by producing a hard-copy printout. In court proceedings to enforce a summons for software, protective orders can be issued to prevent disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information. The software can only be examined by the Secretary and may be placed under seal as directed by the court. The software for examination in connection with a taxpayer's return must be kept secure, disclosed only to authorized personnel, not copied except for examination purposes, and returned at the end of the examination. The software must be returned and all copies deleted, not decompiled, disassembled, or reverse engineered. A written agreement must be provided to the taxpayer and owner of the software for any examination access. The taxpayer must not disclose software to unauthorized individuals and refrain from competing with the software owner for 2 years after disclosure. Compliance with a summons for software executable code can be achieved by providing a read-only version. The term 'software' includes computer software source code and computer software executable code. Computer software source code is written by a programmer in a programming language that is comprehensible to trained persons and not directly usable by a computer. Computer software executable code is the code that can be directly used to give instructions to a computer. The term 'computer software executable code' refers to code readable by a computer to execute instructions, along with related user manuals. Unauthorized disclosure of such software is considered a felony under the Internal Revenue Code, punishable by a fine or imprisonment. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section regarding the costs of prosecution. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include special procedures for summonses for computer software and cross references. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of enactment of this Act."
