The Secretary has exclusive authority over the administration of the section regarding security countermeasures and pandemic products. There is a federal cause of action for claims related to the design, development, testing, manufacture, distribution, and use of qualified pandemic or epidemic products. The federal cause of action allows claims against the United States for pandemic or epidemic products and security countermeasures. No action can be taken against manufacturers, distributors, or healthcare providers for these claims. The federal cause of action provides protections for claims involving pandemic or epidemic products designated by the Secretary. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia has sole jurisdiction over claims for loss of property, personal injury, or death related to these products. The federal government is immune from liability in actions related to pandemic or epidemic products. The federal government is immune from liability for claims related to the design, development, testing, manufacture, distribution, and use of security countermeasures or pandemic products procured for the National Strategic Stockpile or by the Secretary.

The petitioner can request a judicial review of the Secretary's determination, which automatically stays the decision during the legal process. Only the Secretary and the petitioner are involved in the judicial proceeding. The petitioner can request a judicial review of the Secretary's determination, with no intervention by third parties allowed. No subpoenas or compulsory process can be issued. The court's review shall follow procedures for judicial review of administrative orders. The presumption under subparagraph (A) applies regardless of the claim against the United States. The United States is involved in the design, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, administration, or use of products during public health emergencies. The Secretary identifies the emergency and designates security countermeasures or pandemic products to be sold, purchased, or donated.

The Secretary may authorize emergency use of a product if it is effective in diagnosing, mitigating, preventing, treating, or curing a pandemic, epidemic, or a serious or life-threatening disease, and if there is no approved alternative available.
