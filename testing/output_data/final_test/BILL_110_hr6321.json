    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Home Energy Affordability Tax Relief Act of 2008\" or the \"HEATR Act of 2008.\" It introduces a refundable credit for residential energy costs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Home Energy Affordability Tax Relief Act of 2008\" introduces a credit for residential energy costs in the tax code. The credit allows individuals to claim 33% of their energy costs or $500, whichever is less. There is an income limitation where the credit is reduced based on adjusted gross income exceeding $50,000 for individuals or twice that for joint filers. Adjusted gross income is determined without considering certain sections. Definitions for residential energy costs and principal residence are provided in the context of the tax code. The term 'principal residence' is defined as the taxpayer's main place of abode during the heating season, excluding residences outside the US. The heating season is from October to March, and qualified fuel includes propane, heating oil, kerosene, wood, and wood pellets. Other special rules apply for individuals paying on a level payment basis. Individuals paying on a level payment basis can allocate amounts paid for natural gas, electricity, or qualified fuel based on usage during the heating season. Homeowners associations and members, as well as tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations, can also allocate residential energy costs incurred. The residential energy cost incurred can be allocated among individuals in a joint occupancy. The credit allowed by this section is treated as a refundable credit. Dollar amounts in subsections (a)(2) and (b)(1)(A) are subject to inflation adjustment for taxable years beginning in 2009. The amount is determined by multiplying a dollar amount by the fuel price inflation adjustment for 2009 and the cost-of-living adjustment for 2009. The fuel price inflation adjustment for 2009 is calculated based on the percentage increase in fuel prices. The fuel price inflation adjustment for 2009 is the percentage difference between the CPI fuel component for October 2008 and October 2007. The CPI fuel component refers to the fuel component of the Consumer Price Index. If the resulting dollar amount is not a multiple of $10, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The section applies to residential energy costs paid after enactment, in taxable years ending before January 1, 2010. Conforming amendments include adjustments to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. The amendments made by this section provide a refundable credit for residential energy costs and apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
