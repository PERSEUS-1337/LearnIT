The Federal Communications Commission shall reinstate each applicant as a tentative selectee and allow amendments to applications in a rural service area licensing proceeding. Amended applications are exempt from petitions to deny under section 309(d)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934. This relates to the Commission's proceeding In re Applications of Cellwave Telephone. The Federal Communications Commission reinstated applicants as tentative selectees and allowed amendments to applications in a rural service area licensing proceeding.

The Federal Communications Commission reinstated applicants as tentative selectees and allowed amendments to applications in a rural service area licensing proceeding. SEC. 2.

Applicants must provide cellular radiotelephone service to subscribers within 3 years, with waiver authority applicable. The Commission will establish a license fee. The Commission will establish a fee for licenses in the covered rural service area licensing proceeding based on factors like average price per person served in a previous auction and settlement payments required from permittees.

If an applicant is found ineligible, the license will be granted through competitive bidding. During the 5-year period after receiving a license, the Commission cannot authorize the transfer of that license. However, license holders can work with other licensees to enhance cellular service. The definitions in this Act include the term \"applicant\" for specific partnerships chosen by the Commission, the definition of \"Commission\" as the Federal Communications Commission, and the term \"Covered rural service area licensing proceeding.\" The term \"covered rural service area licensing proceeding\" refers to the Commission's grant of cellular radiotelephone licenses for specific rural service areas. A \"tentative selectee\" is a party selected for a license but pending qualification approval by the Commission."
