    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44977.5 of the Education Code is amended to allow employees in certified positions to use sick leave for parental leave for up to 12 workweeks per school year. In school districts using the differential pay system, when a certified employee exhausts sick leave and is on parental leave, the salary deduction should not exceed what a substitute would be paid. The district must try to find a substitute if needed. In school districts using the differential pay system, a certified employee on parental leave after exhausting sick leave should receive at least 50% of their regular salary for the remaining portion of the 12-week parental leave period. The 12-week period can be reduced by sick leave taken during parental leave, and only one 12-week period is allowed per 12-month period for employees with certification qualifications. Parental leave taken under this section runs concurrently with leave under Section 12945.2 of the Government Code, not exceeding 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. This applies regardless of a leave of absence granted by the school district. Employees in certified positions are not required to have 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months to take parental leave. Section 45196.1 of the Education Code allows classified employees to use sick leave for parental leave for up to 12 workweeks each school year. This leave is for the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care. The obligation to comply with any collective bargaining agreement providing greater parental leave rights remains. In school districts using the differential pay system, when an employee exhausts sick leave and is on parental leave, the salary deduction should not exceed the amount paid to a substitute filling their position. In school districts using the differential pay system, when an employee exhausts sick leave and is on parental leave, they shall be compensated at no less than 50% of their regular salary for the remaining portion of the 12-workweek period of parental leave. Parental leave taken under this section and Section 12945.2 of the Government Code cannot exceed 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. Classified employees do not need 1,250 hours of service to take parental leave. Section 87780.1 of the Education Code allows academic employees to use sick leave for parental leave for up to 12 workweeks each school year. This does not affect any collective bargaining agreements providing greater parental leave rights. In community college districts using the differential pay system, when an employee exhausts sick leave and is on parental leave, the deduction from their salary cannot exceed the amount paid to a temporary employee filling their position during the absence. When an employee in community college districts exhausts sick leave and is on parental leave, they must be compensated at a minimum of 50% of their regular salary for the remaining portion of the 12-workweek period. The 12-workweek period will be reduced by any sick leave taken during parental leave, and an employee is limited to one 12-workweek period of parental leave per 12-month period. Parental leave taken under this section runs concurrently with leave under Section 12945.2 of the Government Code, not exceeding 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. This applies regardless of a leave of absence granted by the community college district's governing board. Academic employees are exempt from the 1,250-hour service requirement for parental leave. Section 88196.1 of the Education Code allows classified employees to use sick leave for parental leave for up to 12 workweeks each school year. This parental leave is defined as leave for the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care. The obligation to comply with any collective bargaining agreement providing greater parental leave rights remains for public school employers. In community college districts using the differential pay system, when an employee exhausts sick leave and is on parental leave, the deduction from their salary cannot exceed the amount paid to a substitute filling their position. In community college districts with a differential pay system, employees on parental leave after exhausting sick leave will receive at least 50% of their regular salary for the remaining portion of the 12-week parental leave period. This compensation is subject to certain conditions, including a limit of one 12-week parental leave period per 12-month period. Parental leave taken under this section runs concurrently with leave under Section 12945.2 of the Government Code, not exceeding 12 workweeks in a 12-month period. It applies regardless of a leave of absence granted by the community college district's governing board. Classified employees do not need 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months to take parental leave under this section. Parental leave, as defined in this section, applies to the birth of an employee's child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care. Public school employers must still adhere to any collective bargaining agreements that offer greater parental leave rights than those outlined here."
