Congress finds that police officers and citizens are facing increased danger from criminals using deadly weaponry and body armor. Crime is worsened by the interstate movement of body armor. There is a traffic in body armor affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls are inadequate. Recent incidents, such as the murder of Officer James Guelff and a bank shootout in California, highlight the need for action. The serious threat posed by criminals wearing body armor during violent crimes is highlighted in California. Statistics show that a significant number of officers killed in the line of duty could have been saved by body armor. The Department of Justice estimates that 25 percent of State and local police do not have access to body armor. Congress has the power to grant local police departments access to surplus body armor from Federal agencies. The Constitution allows Congress to regulate interstate commerce for community safety. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce for community safety. SEC. 3 defines key terms. The Act defines key terms related to body armor, law enforcement agencies, and law enforcement officers. Law enforcement agencies are authorized by law to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute criminal violations. The Federal sentencing guidelines will be amended to increase the offense level by at least 2 levels for any offense involving the use of body armor. This enhancement will not apply to offenses related to civil rights violations by law enforcement officers. Additionally, violent felons are prohibited from purchasing, using, or possessing body armor. The definition of body armor is any product intended to protect against gunfire. Violent felons are prohibited from purchasing, owning, or possessing body armor. The prohibition on owning body armor applies to individuals convicted of violent crimes or offenses that would be considered violent under federal law. However, individuals whose safety or livelihood depends on body armor can petition the Secretary for an exception to this prohibition. The Secretary has the authority to grant relief or impose conditions on the possession of body armor. The Secretary can grant exceptions to the prohibition on owning body armor for individuals with a reasonable need and who are likely to use it safely and lawfully. Factors considered include continued employment, interests of justice, relevant evidence, and the totality of circumstances. Permission is granted with conditions. The Secretary can grant exceptions for owning body armor to individuals with a reasonable need and who can use it safely. The petitioner must carry a certified copy of the permission. The Secretary is not obligated to grant relief, and granted relief does not remove liability. Law enforcement officers enforcing the prohibition against those granted relief are immune from liability. The enforcement of the body armor prohibition grants immunity from liability for false arrest, except for those possessing certified permission. This immunity does not exempt individuals from other liabilities. The prohibition on violent felons purchasing body armor includes penalties of fines, imprisonment up to 3 years, or both. Additionally, federal surplus body armor can be donated to state and local law enforcement agencies. In this section, a Federal agency can donate surplus body armor to state or local law enforcement agencies if it is in good condition. The agency must notify the Administrator of General Services about the donation details. Certain officers, like those in the Department of Justice, can also make donations. In the administration of this section, certain officers from the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury can act as the head of a Federal agency for donation purposes. The Secretary of the Treasury designates certain officers to act as the head of a Federal agency, including the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Commissioner of Customs, and the Director of the United States Secret Service."
