    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"White House Conference on Children and Youth in 2010 Act\". The Congress finds that in 2005, there were over 3,000,000 reports of child abuse and neglect, with only 60% of substantiated cases receiving follow-up services. Nearly 900,000 cases of child abuse and neglect are reported each year, with neglect being the most common type. Additionally, almost 500,000 children were in foster care in 2004, and around 51,000 children are adopted from foster care annually. While 51,000 children are adopted from the foster care system each year, more than 117,000 children are waiting to be adopted. Approximately 22,000 youth leave the foster care system annually due to aging out. The child welfare system involves various entities such as governments, agencies, caseworkers, and advocates. Certain populations like Native Americans and African-Americans are over-represented in the system. Additionally, there is a growing number of children being raised by grandparents. The child welfare system recognizes kinship care as a permanency option through the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. State courts play a crucial role in making decisions for children in the system, including child abuse cases, parental rights termination, and placement options. The system's primary mission cannot be fully achieved without the courts being an integral part of a statewide care and protection system. The Congress policy emphasizes collaboration between the Government and States to develop plans for child welfare systems, focusing on enhancing the well-being of children and families. Federal, State, and local programs should align with these goals. Federal, State, and local programs should aim to reduce child abuse and neglect, decrease the number of children in foster care, and increase permanent placements through family reunification, kinship placement, and adoption.
