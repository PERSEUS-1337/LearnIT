    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Low-Emission Authorization Nationwide (CLEAN) Ports Act of 2009\". In fiscal year 2007, United States ports handled $3.95 trillion in international trade, generating $23.2 billion in Customs duty revenues. The transportation sector accounted for 27% of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2003. According to various reports, marine emissions account for a significant portion of diesel particulate matter in California, leading to premature deaths in the United States. Despite some improvements in vehicle engine efficiency, transportation energy use is projected to increase substantially in the coming years. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shipping vessels emit 0.9 teragrams of particle pollution annually. Implementing clean technologies at ports and using low-emission rail yard locomotives can significantly reduce air emissions and diesel fuel use. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have achieved major pollution reductions through clean port initiatives. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have achieved significant pollution reductions through clean port technologies, with examples such as a switch to cleaner fuel for auxiliary engines resulting in a 100% increase from 2005 to 2007. They are on track to reduce diesel-related particulate matter, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxide emissions by over 45% within the next five years. It is in the national interest to promote fuel-efficient and low-emission technologies to reduce pollution at ports. Enact environmentally friendly shipping regulations like lowering vessel speeds near ports to reduce pollution and improve air quality in port communities. Enact environmentally friendly shipping regulations like lowering vessel speeds near ports to reduce pollution and improve air quality in port communities. Additionally, focus on clean technology and vehicles at seaports. The Secretary of Transportation will develop competitive grants for seaport governing bodies, requiring them to demonstrate need, funding usage, environmental benefits, and project details to be eligible. Grants will prioritize projects that promote environmental, air quality, and fuel use reduction benefits. Preference will be given to seaport governing bodies with a successful track record of energy and pollution reduction activities when awarding grants. Funds can be used for purchasing low-sulfur fuels, smokestack filtration systems, electrical power equipment for vessels at berth, and hybrid tug boats. The grant funds can be used for purchasing hybrid tug boats, on-dock transportation including rail systems and low-emission locomotives, fuel efficient port vehicles, and diesel-electric container yard cranes. Up to 10 percent of the funds can be used for research and development of fuel efficient port vehicle or vessel technologies. The grant funds can be used to increase fuel efficiency in local port fleets and promote the production of fuel-efficient vehicles in the American manufacturing industry. Monitoring equipment for measuring air pollution levels around ports can also be purchased or retrofitted. The Federal share of the cost for grant activities should not exceed 90 percent, and the Secretary of Transportation will develop an application process for grants within 120 days of the Act's enactment. A report to Congress is required annually starting from December 31, 2011. The Secretary of Transportation will report annually to Congress on applications, approved activities, and results of the competitive grant program, focusing on environmental impact. Authorization of appropriations is provided for program implementation."
