    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 31468 of the Government Code is amended to define \"District\" as a district formed under state laws within a county, including institutions operated by multiple counties and organizations supported by county funds for retirement system inclusion. The definition of \"District\" in the Government Code includes sanitary districts, cities, public authorities, political subdivisions, public corporations, and nonprofit corporations conducting agricultural fairs within a county. The definition of \"District\" in the Government Code includes the Regents of the University of California for specific employees, as well as the South Coast Air Quality Management District established in 1977. Employees of the South Coast Air Quality Management District are considered new public agency employees as of February 1, 1977, with no prior retirement system coverage. No retirement system coverage can be established for South Coast Air Quality Management District employees hired between February 1, 1977, and December 31, 1978, unless they choose to join either the Los Angeles County or San Bernardino County retirement association by January 1, 1980. Failure to make a choice will result in automatic membership in the Los Angeles County retirement association. The South Coast Air Quality Management District employees hired between February 1, 1977, and December 31, 1978, must choose to join either the Los Angeles County or San Bernardino County retirement association by January 1, 1980, to establish retirement system coverage. Failure to choose will result in automatic membership in the Los Angeles County retirement association. Each electing employee at the South Coast Air Quality Management District may receive credit for their service, subject to payment determined by the retirement association. The employee's share of the payment is negotiated with the district's recognized employee organization, capped at 25% of the total amount. The retirement association's board may grant credit for prior service if requested and paid for between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1980, without affecting reciprocal benefits for employees under Article 15. Employees of the South Coast Air Quality Management District who started after December 31, 1978, will be covered by the retirement association for San Bernardino County. Those employed between February 1, 1977, and December 31, 1978, who leave between February 1, 1977, and January 1, 1980, will be considered members of the retirement association for Los Angeles County. The definition of \"District\" includes nonprofit corporations operating museums in a 15th class county under contract with the board of supervisors, and economic development associations funded by the county. The definition of \"District\" includes various retirement systems established in Orange County, San Bernardino County, Contra Costa County, and Ventura County under specific conditions and approvals. In addition to various retirement systems in specific counties, the definition of \"District\" also encompasses the Kern County Hospital Authority, a local government agency established under the Health and Safety Code. The Government Code now allows the board of retirement in certain counties to appoint key personnel such as a retirement administrator, chief financial officer, chief operations officer, chief investment officer, and general counsel. The personnel appointed under this section are not county employees but employees of the retirement system. Their compensation is covered by the retirement system's administration expenses. The board of retirement and board of supervisors can enter agreements to implement this section. Section 31522.2 does not apply to retirement systems appointing personnel under this section. This section only applies to the retirement system in Ventura County when the board of retirement makes it applicable. When a district joins the retirement system, personnel previously in county service will remain members without interruption. New employees will become members on the first day of the following month. Section 31580.2 of the Government Code is amended to require boards of retirement in certain counties to annually adopt a budget for the administration of the retirement system. The expense incurred cannot exceed a certain percentage of the accrued actuarial liability or a specified dollar amount. Expenditures for computer software, hardware, and technology consulting services related to computer products are not considered part of the retirement system's administration costs."
