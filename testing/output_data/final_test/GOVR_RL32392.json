    "content": "The 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, brokered by the United States, ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, creating two semi-autonomous entities within the country: the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. Each entity has its own government and armed forces, with most powers vested in them. The central government in Bosnia-Herzegovina has responsibility for foreign policy, foreign trade, and monetary policy. Decision-making is influenced by the three main ethnic groups. The Federation is divided into ten cantons with control over key areas like policing and education. The Dayton Peace Accords led to the deployment of a NATO-led peacekeeping force and the appointment of a U.N.-appointed High Representative for overseeing peace implementation efforts. The current holder of the post of High Representative in Bosnia is Paddy Ashdown of Great Britain, who also serves as the European Union's Special Representative in Bosnia. Since the Dayton Peace Accords, the international community has made progress in reducing inter-ethnic violence, restoring freedom of movement, and facilitating the return of refugees and displaced persons. However, the overall goal of creating a stable and united Bosnia remains a challenge. The goal of international efforts in Bosnia is to create a stable, united Bosnia that can integrate with Euro-Atlantic institutions. Progress on reforms and unity in Bosnia still requires intervention by Ashdown and the international community. Nationalist parties obstruct reform efforts, and critics argue that the Dayton Peace Accords' institutions are unworkable. International intervention has led to dependency among local elites, as troop and funding commitments have decreased. The Office of the High Representative infringes on Bosnia's sovereignty. The Office of the High Representative (OHR) infringes on Bosnia's sovereignty, hindering its path to European integration. Critics question Bosnia's ability to join NATO or the EU without full sovereignty. Concerns also arise about Bosnia's continued reliance on international support and its importance to U.S. interests, given other global commitments. The U.S. has invested significantly in stabilizing Bosnia, spending over $13.6 billion from FY1991 to FY2004 on military costs. The United States spent $13.6 billion on military costs in Bosnia, with additional aid totaling $1.5 billion. The European Union now plays a significant role in Bosnia, but the U.S. remains involved to ensure stability and prevent criminal activity. Bosnia has made progress since 1995 but still faces challenges. The restoration of freedom of movement and return of refugees in Bosnia has been a relative success, with over 1 million refugees and displaced persons returning to their homes by October 2004. While ethnic tensions exist, the main obstacle to refugee returns is economic, as the war destroyed local industries and jobs. Many young people want to leave Bosnia for better opportunities elsewhere. The international efforts in Bosnia focus on strengthening the rule of law to combat corruption and break down parallel structures connecting political parties, enterprises, and organized crime. High Representative Ashdown implemented new criminal codes and established the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council to ensure integrity and competence among judges and prosecutors. Corruption is seen as a significant issue in Bosnia, second only to unemployment. The High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) in Bosnia ensures integrity and competence among judges and prosecutors, with ethnic representation based on the 1991 census. The council also handles disciplinary actions and appoints new officials. Additionally, a State Court with special panels for organized crime, including both Bosnian and international officials, was established. Police training was initially conducted by a U.N. mission, later replaced by an EU mission. New central government law enforcement institutions were created, including a Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Security, and State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA). The Police Restructuring Commission recommended central government institutions take over police responsibilities in Bosnia, challenging entity control. Implementation of reforms has been slow due to lack of resources. Despite challenges, there have been successful prosecutions against organized crime in both entity courts. The Bosnian State Court has prosecuted cases against organized crime figures, including a major human trafficking case in March 2004. Economic reform and poverty reduction are crucial for Bosnia's stability, with praise from the International Monetary Fund for establishing macroeconomic stability. Laws have been passed to improve Bosnia's tax system to stimulate economic growth and aid in EU integration efforts. The international community is urging Bosnian leaders to reduce the size of government institutions. Bosnia faces severe economic challenges, with GDP at 60% of pre-war levels and half the population living in poverty. The economy is on the brink of crisis, with many industries collapsed and government spending accounting for over 50% of GDP. The international community is pushing for government restructuring to strengthen the central government's rule and aid in EU integration efforts. Bosnia's economy is struggling with government spending making up over 50% of GDP. Efforts to boost the economy and attract foreign investment have had limited success. Despite some progress, the country lacks a suitable legal framework to encourage investors. Foreign direct investment remains low at 5% of GDP in 2003. The slow privatization process is hindered by administrative and legal issues, posing long-term concerns for policymakers. The international community has played a crucial role in Bosnia's modest reform successes, as local leaders often focus on political maneuvering rather than implementing reforms. Analysts are concerned about the sustainability of Bosnia's reforms and long-term unity due to the lack of support from nationalist parties in power. Some analysts believe Bosnia's reforms face challenges due to the complex governing structures set up by the Dayton constitution. There are proposals to simplify the system, including creating a unitary state or a system of cantons within a federation. Bosniaks support a united Bosnia, but Serbs, and to a lesser extent Croats, do not. Polls show a majority of Bosnian Serbs favor independence from Bosnia, with former leader Radovan Karadzic being popular in the Republika Srpska. Radovan Karadzic is the most popular politician in the Republika Srpska. A poll found that 55% of Bosnian Serbs expect Bosnia to remain a single state despite their wishes. 41% of Bosnian Croats prefer to remain part of Bosnia, while 54% favor independence or union with Croatia. Efforts by international actors to influence domestic politics have been hindered by the continued popularity of nationalist groups. After the victory of nationalist parties in the 2002 elections, Ashdown intervened in Bosnian politics under the slogan \"Jobs and Justice.\" Despite angering Bosnian leaders, there was little public protest. A State Department poll showed low awareness of his program, with support from Bosniaks but opposition from Bosnian Croats and Serbs. Critics accuse him of neglecting non-nationalist issues. Critics of Ashdown in Bosnia accuse him of neglecting the non-nationalist opposition, leaving him at a political dead-end. Some analysts support his interventionism to establish a self-sustaining Bosnia, while others are concerned about OHR's undemocratic intervention hindering the development of local institutions. The 2003 EU summit in Thessaloniki held out the prospect of Bosnia joining the EU when ready, but as of early 2005, Bosnia still fell short in implementing the measures required for negotiations on EU membership. Bosnia's central government aims for EU membership by 2009, but observers are skeptical. Bosnia aims for EU membership by 2009, but observers doubt its feasibility. Concerns about reduced international intervention and economic assistance impacting reforms and potential conflict are present. The geopolitical landscape has changed since the civil war, reducing the likelihood of renewed fighting. A State Department poll shows varying levels of concern among ethnic groups about a return to conflict. The downfall of nationalist regimes in Serbia and Croatia in 2000 has lessened fears of partition. The downfall of nationalist regimes in Serbia and Croatia in 2000 reduced concerns about partition of Bosnia. The nationalist HDZ party in Croatia and nationalist forces in Serbia have caused some concern, but they have shown no interest in carving up Bosnia again. However, there are voices in Serbia raising the possibility of partition if Kosovo becomes independent. The Serbian political scene remains unsettled, and a victory by the ultranationalist Radical Party could pose a danger to Bosnia's future. The future stability of Bosnia is uncertain due to weak institutions that could foster organized crime and terrorist activities. NATO-led SFOR has reduced troops, with EUFOR taking over peacekeeping duties. Few U.S. military personnel remain to assist with defense reform and counter terrorism. The EU successor force in Bosnia may lack the credibility of SFOR, especially without the U.S. presence. Bosniaks see the U.S. as their best ally, while European countries are viewed less favorably due to past failures. U.S. and international efforts focus on defense reforms to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Bosnia is urged to implement defense reforms to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which includes unifying its two armies under a single command structure. The new army would consist of three brigades representing Bosniak, Serb, and Croat populations, with the supreme command held by Bosnia's collective presidency. The necessary legislation has been passed, and a new defense minister was approved in March 2004. The approval of a new defense minister in March 2004 was necessary for Bosnia to implement defense reforms and join NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Reforms include staffing state-level defense institutions with qualified personnel, providing adequate funding, and eliminating entity Defense Ministries. Bosnia's lack of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is a key hindrance to its EU membership. Efforts are focused on apprehending indicted war crimes suspects like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. The RS government has not fully cooperated with the ICTY, failing to arrest any indicted war criminals. The US and allies are actively searching for these criminals to support justice and reforms in Bosnia. Mladic and Karadzic are believed to be hiding in Bosnia. High Representative Ashdown has taken steps to weaken the support network for war criminals in Bosnia by removing officials and freezing assets of those suspected of aiding them. Both Mladic and Karadzic move within Bosnia and between Bosnia and Serbia and Montenegro, with EUFOR and NATO assisting in developing intelligence for possible seizure of suspects. The United States has also barred entry to individuals suspected of helping war criminals. High Representative Ashdown took actions to punish Republika Srpska for non-compliance on war crimes issues, including removing Bosnian Serb officials and announcing plans to abolish entity Interior and Defense Ministries. He warned of further steps if Bosnian Serb leaders continued to block Bosnia's PFP membership. High Representative Ashdown took actions to punish Republika Srpska for non-compliance on war crimes issues, including freezing SDS assets in the United States and imposing a visa ban on key members. The United States also introduced measures to penalize RS for non-cooperation with the ICTY. Del Ponte claimed Karadzic narrowly escaped capture during an SFOR raid. Del Ponte claimed that Karadzic narrowly escaped capture during an SFOR raid in Pale in February 2004. SFOR raids have failed to capture Karadzic, with critics saying they lack useful intelligence. Efforts are being made to have war criminals tried by local courts as part of the international \"completion strategy\" for the ICTY. The international community held a conference in October 2003 to establish a war crimes chamber in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United States pledged financial support for the new court, but its effectiveness remains uncertain. The court will have international judges and prosecutors initially to address criticisms of delays, lack of witness protection, and ethnic bias in Bosnian courts. Local police forces will assist in investigations, and the success of domestic war crimes prosecutions will rely on efforts to reform Bosnia's judicial system. Efforts to improve Bosnia's judicial system include dismissing corrupt and ineffective prosecutors and judges, and imposing tougher criminal laws. Bosnia has been a focus of U.S. policy on terrorism, with ties to Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. During the 1992-1995 war, Bosnia had Islamic fundamentalist fighters, some of whom stayed and became Bosnian citizens. Al Qaeda ties have been found among some Islamic charities and humanitarian organizations. Al Qaeda ties have been found among some Islamic charities and humanitarian organizations in Bosnia, used for planning attacks. Some Al Qaeda operatives in Bosnia have connections to Bosnia's intelligence service. The issue of terrorism has been politicized in Bosnia, with each ethnic group labeling its adversaries as \"terrorists.\" Despite ethnic divides, Bosnian opposition to terrorism is broad. The United States has strong support in Bosnia, especially among Bosniaks, for bringing peace and providing post-war aid. Bosniaks are known for being secular and European in outlook, causing friction with foreign Islamic extremists. Efforts to recruit Bosniaks into extremist organizations have had limited success, as Bosniaks fear tarnishing Bosnia's reputation in Europe. The Bosnian constitution delegates domestic anti-terrorism powers to entities, while the central government handles international efforts. However, Bosnia's anti-terrorism efforts are hindered by government weakness and inefficiency. Bosnian anti-terrorism efforts are hindered by weak government institutions and corruption. Ashdown is working to strengthen state-level institutions and the rule of law to improve effectiveness. With support from the EU and US, Bosnia has deployed a State Border Service and is pushing for legislation to enhance the State Information and Protection Agency. However, local politicians resistant to central government power have slowed progress. The 2003 State Department report on Patterns of Global Terrorism highlighted Bosnia's commitment to fighting terrorism has slowed since nationalist forces won the 2002 elections. Despite this, the Federation Financial Police continues to shut down NGOs and bank accounts linked to terrorists. The presence of international officials in Bosnia, such as NATO troops, has aided in the fight against terrorism by collaborating with Bosnian counterparts to track down and arrest suspected terrorists. This international influence gives the United States more freedom to arrest and deport terrorists compared to other countries. After SFOR's withdrawal in December 2004, a NATO headquarters in Bosnia and the EU successor force continue to play a role in anti-terrorist efforts. U.S. aid to Bosnia has decreased gradually, with a focus on developing democratic institutions and a free market economy. The United States has been the largest bilateral donor to Bosnia, providing $1.56 billion in aid from 1992 to FY2002. In FY2004, $44.7 million was provided under the SEED program, and an estimated $41 million for FY2005. The United States has been a significant donor to Bosnia, providing aid for strengthening the legal system, supporting businesses, and facilitating refugee returns. Funding for Bosnia under the SEED program decreased to $40 million in FY2006."
