The section defines terms related to campaign advertising, eligible congressional candidates, general election period, and primary election period. The primary election period is defined as starting 30 days before the primary election and ending on the date of the election. A candidate must meet filing requirements certified by the Commission for both the primary and general elections to be considered eligible for election to the Senate or House of Representatives. The primary election filing requirement states that a candidate must file a declaration with the Commission stating they will only participate in campaign advertising during the primary election period and that at least one other candidate has qualified for the same primary election ballot. The deadline for filing this declaration is before the primary election date. The general election filing requirement states that a candidate must file a declaration with the Commission stating they will not participate in campaign advertising except during the general election period. The deadline for filing this declaration is 7 days after the candidate qualifies for the general election ballot. If an eligible congressional candidate has an opponent who qualifies for the ballot, they are entitled to broadcast media rates under the Communications Act of 1934. The candidate must use this benefit for communication purposes. The Commission will certify if a candidate meets the requirements for broadcast media rates under the Communications Act of 1934. Certification for primary election candidates must be done within 7 business days of filing a declaration.

Any misuse of benefits will result in the candidate having to repay the provider. Commission determinations are final unless subject to judicial review. Candidates who misuse benefits will have to repay the provider an amount equal to the difference in cost between what they paid and what they would have paid if not an eligible congressional candidate.
