    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2009\" or the \"FOARAM Act\" with the purpose outlined in Section 2. The \"Federal Ocean Acidification Research And Monitoring Act of 2009\" aims to develop a comprehensive plan for monitoring and researching ocean acidification, establish a program within NOAA, assess ecosystem and socioeconomic impacts, and research adaptation strategies for marine ecosystems. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Ocean acidification refers to the decrease in pH of the Earth's oceans caused by chemical inputs from the atmosphere. Secretary means the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Subcommittee refers to the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council. The Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology coordinates Federal activities on ocean acidification and establishes an interagency working group comprised of senior representatives from various Federal agencies. The interagency working group is chaired by the representative from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Subcommittee on Ocean Acidification, under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is responsible for developing a strategic research plan, assessing impacts on marine organisms, coordinating federal research, and engaging with stakeholders. The Subcommittee on Ocean Acidification coordinates the US Federal research program with other nations and establishes an Ocean Acidification Information Exchange to provide accessible information on ocean acidification. Reports to Congress are required within one year of the Act's enactment. The Subcommittee on Ocean Acidification provides biennial reports to Congress on federally funded research activities and progress in developing required plans. The reports are submitted to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the House Committee on Science and Technology, and the House Committee on Natural Resources. The Subcommittee on Ocean Acidification submits biennial reports to Congress on federally funded research activities, including a summary of the budget for each activity and an analysis of progress towards goals. Within 2 years of enactment, a strategic research plan is transmitted to relevant Senate and House committees. The Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives must submit a revised plan every 5 years. SEC. 5. STRATEGIC RESEARCH PLAN. The Subcommittee must develop a strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification within 2 years of this Act's enactment. The plan will assess impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, develop adaptation strategies, and consider recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences. Interdisciplinary research and coordinated activities in the ocean sciences will be emphasized. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification will focus on improving understanding of its impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, assessing socioeconomic impacts, and developing adaptation and mitigation strategies. Specific activities will include determining user needs. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification includes efforts to determine user needs, research activities, monitoring activities, technology development, data collection, database development, modeling activities, assessment of impacts, and participation in international research efforts. It also involves identifying relevant programs of Federal agencies, utilizing reports and studies, and making recommendations for coordination. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification includes recommendations for coordination with other nations and international organizations, budget requirements for research and monitoring activities, prioritizing monitoring systems, and facilitating outreach with stakeholder communities. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification includes program elements such as monitoring ocean chemistry and biological impacts, researching species-specific responses of marine organisms, and modeling changes in the ocean carbon cycle. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification includes modeling changes in the ocean carbon cycle, technology development for carbonate chemistry measurements, assessing socioeconomic impacts, and developing adaptation strategies. The plan will be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences and public participation is encouraged in its development. The strategic plan for Federal research on ocean acidification involves consulting with various groups and allowing public participation. The plan must be published in the Federal Register for a 60-day public comment period before submission to Congress. SEC. 6. NOAA OCEAN ACIDIFICATION ACTIVITIES. The Secretary will establish an ocean acidification program to conduct research, monitoring, and activities consistent with the strategic plan. This includes interdisciplinary research, long-term monitoring, and adaptation research. Research will focus on developing adaptation strategies for conserving marine ecosystems facing increased ocean acidification. Educational opportunities and national outreach activities will promote interdisciplinary understanding of ocean acidification's impacts. Coordination with other monitoring and research efforts will be prioritized. The program collaborates with international ocean science bodies, provides grants for research on ocean acidification effects, and uses a merit-based process for awarding grants. The Secretary may enter into contracts, leases, grants, or cooperative agreements as necessary for the Partnership Program under section 7901 of title 10, United States Code. The Director of the National Science Foundation will conduct research on ocean acidification, focusing on its impacts on marine organisms, ecosystems, biogeochemistry, and developing evaluation methodologies. Research activities will align with the strategic research plan and promote coordination with other nations and international organizations. NASA, in coordination with other agencies, will use space-based monitoring assets to monitor ocean acidification and its impacts. Research and monitoring activities will align with the strategic research plan, and coordination with other nations and international organizations will be encouraged. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for NOAA and NSF to carry out the purposes of the Act includes specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2009 to 2012."
