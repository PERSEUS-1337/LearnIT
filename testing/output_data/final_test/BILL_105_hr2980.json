    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Beverage Container Recycling Initiative Act\". It includes findings related to beverage container recycling. Congress finds that the failure to reuse and recycle empty beverage containers wastes national energy and resources, contributes to littering and imposes unnecessary costs on public agencies and businesses. Solid waste from these containers adds to municipal waste management challenges, and local communities struggle to fund recycling programs. The reuse and recycling of empty beverage containers can help reduce burdens on individuals, local governments, and the environment. Several States have enacted laws requiring a refund value on beverage containers, which has proven to be cost-effective and efficient in reducing financial burdens on communities. A national system for refund value on beverage containers would incentivize individuals to clean up the environment. A national system for refund value on beverage containers would result in high levels of reuse and recycling, reducing costs associated with waste management. It would also lead to significant energy conservation and resource recovery, eliminating unnecessary burdens on governments and the environment. Unclaimed refunds could fund comprehensive recycling programs nationwide. A national system of beverage container recycling is consistent with the goals of the Solid Waste Disposal Act and the Environmental Protection Agency's national goal of 35 percent source reduction and recycling by 2005. SEC. 3. BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include Subtitle K - Beverage Container Recycling. SEC. 12001 defines key terms related to beverage container recycling. The term 'beverage' includes various drinks for human consumption, excluding milk. A 'beverage container' is a sealed glass, metal, or plastic container holding 4 liters or less. A 'beverage distributor' sells beverages to retailers for resale. The term 'beverage retailer' refers to a person who sells beverages in containers to consumers. The term 'consumer' is defined as a person who buys a beverage container for personal use. The term 'refund value' is the amount refunded for returning a beverage container. The term 'refund value' refers to the specified amount refunded for returning a beverage container, as defined under section 12002. An 'unbroken beverage container' includes containers opened as designed and compressed metal or plastic containers with readable refund value statements. A 'wine cooler' is a drink with less than 8 percent alcohol by volume, made of wine, water, non-alcoholic beverages, flavorings, and fruit juices. The term 'spirits' refers to liquor produced by distillation or fortified with distilled spirits, including fortified wine. 'Wine' is any liquor with up to 15.5% alcohol by volume, fermented from fruit or agricultural products with sugar and no added spirits, including table wine, still wine, sparkling wine, and champagne under 15.5% alcohol by volume. Required beverage container labeling is mandated under SEC. 12002. Beverage distributors and retailers must label beverage containers with refund values of 15 cents for wine and spirit containers and 5 cents for all other containers. The size and location of the label must adhere to uniform standards set by the Administrator. The Administrator adjusts the refund value of beverage containers every 10 years based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor. Rounding rules apply to the adjustments. The Administrator adjusts the refund value of beverage containers every 10 years based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor, rounding adjustments to the nearest 5 cent increment. SEC. 12003 requires beverage distributors to collect refund value from retailers and redemption centers for beverage containers sold in interstate commerce. Retailers must also collect refund value from consumers. No one other than distributors or retailers can collect a deposit on beverage containers. The legislation requires retailers to promptly pay consumers the refund value for returning empty, unbroken, and clean beverage containers of the same brand and size. Retailers can limit the number of containers accepted per person per day and refuse containers for up to 8 hours. The legislation mandates that retailers must promptly pay consumers the refund value for returning empty, unbroken, and clean beverage containers of the same brand and size. Retailers can limit the number of containers accepted per person per day and refuse containers for up to 8 hours, with posted hours of acceptance. Distributors must pay at least 2 cents per container for handling costs. The legislation allows for beverage containers to be tendered to persons other than distributors. Agreements can be made to establish centralized collection centers or for crushing/bundling containers. SEC. 12005. ACCOUNTING FOR UNCLAIMED REFUNDS AND PROVISIONS FOR STATE RECYCLING FUNDS. At the end of each calendar year, beverage distributors must pay states the difference between total refund value of containers sold for resale and total sum paid under section 12004(b). Unclaimed refunds received by states can be used for pollution prevention and recycling programs. If payments made by a distributor exceed refund values, provisions are made for state recycling funds. If the values of containers sold by a distributor for resale in the State exceed the amount required to be paid to the State, the excess will be credited for the following year as designated by the distributor. SEC. 12006 prohibits the sale of metal beverage containers with detachable openings and mandates proper disposal of labeled beverage containers to prevent landfill disposal. Exemption from certain requirements for States with similar beverage container regulations. Prohibition on taxing refund value of beverage containers. No impact on State laws regarding refund values on non-beverage containers or regulation of redemption centers. The curr_chunk discusses regulations on redemption centers that purchase empty beverage containers from retailers or consumers. The curr_chunk outlines penalties for violating specific sections related to beverage container recycling and the timeline for regulations to be implemented. The effective date for the subtitle is set for two years after enactment, with a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation. Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling includes definitions, required labeling, collection of refund value, return of refund value, accounting for unclaimed refunds, prohibitions on disposal, exempted States, penalties, and regulations. The effective date is set for two years after enactment with a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation."
