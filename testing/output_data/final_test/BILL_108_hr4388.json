    "content": "The Act titled \"Special Exposure Cohort Fairness Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 aims to provide compensation for workers exposed to hazards in nuclear weapons production and testing, including those in New Mexico. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish procedures for radiation dose reconstruction and compensation. Workers can petition to be part of a Special Exposure Cohort when accurate dose estimation is not possible and there is a likelihood of radiation exposure endangering their health. Special Exposure Cohort status presumes causation automatically. The Special Exposure Cohort status provides automatic presumption of causation for radiation-related cancers without the need for estimating radiation dose. Designated cohorts include Paducah, Kentucky, Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Amchitka Island Test site in Alaska. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducts radiation dose reconstructions, completing 15 out of 571 for workers at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and 18 out of 765 in New Mexico. Senator Jeff Bingaman explained the Congressional intent behind allowing additional Special Exposure Cohorts for workers exposed to radiation in cases where dose reconstruction is infeasible due to missing records or prohibitive costs. Dose reconstruction for claimants at Los Alamos National Laboratory is being significantly delayed due to missing records and prohibitive costs. The laboratory has not provided the necessary individual bioassay data or detailed external dosimetry data, hindering the process. Hearings and investigations reveal inadequate worker monitoring and unreliable radiation dosimetry reports at Los Alamos National Laboratory. A worker described challenges in reconstructing dose amounts due to the disposal of over 80 radionuclides at the facility. During the atomic weapons program at Los Alamos, health-related documents were withheld to protect the Government and its contractors from criticism and liability. Air concentrations of radionuclides at Area G were underreported in environmental surveillance reports. New Mexico legislature enacted Joint Memorials in 2003 and 2004 to address these issues. Representative Ray Ruiz enacted Joint Memorials urging Congress to reform the Act to compensate workers sick from exposure at Los Alamos. The memorials emphasize the need to provide benefits to employees with past exposure records and those facing denial of claims due to scientific uncertainty. Special exposure cohorts are recommended for employees in Area G under the proposed Federal reform legislation. The Special Exposure Cohort for Los Alamos workers has been established due to missing or incomplete dose records, costly research efforts, and delays in determining radiation doses, leading to justice being denied through interminable delays for claimants. New Mexico's large population of potentially eligible claimants at Department of Energy facilities should not have to suffer from these issues. Claimants at Department of Energy facilities should not have to wait another generation or more to be compensated for their occupational illnesses. SEC. 3. Definition of member of special exposure cohort to include workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico. SEC. 3 amends the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act to include workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory who were employed for at least 250 work days between 1945 and 2000 as cohort-eligible workers. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act now includes workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory who were exposed to radiation through external or internal means, and had comparable exposures to monitored jobs under Department of Energy standards. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act has been amended to include cohort-eligible Los Alamos workers, defined as those who worked in specific areas or roles at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and have not had their radiation dose records received within 200 days of filing a claim."
