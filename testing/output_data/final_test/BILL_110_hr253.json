The \"No More Tulias: Drug Law Enforcement Evidentiary Standards Improvement Act of 2007\" acknowledges that programs funded by the Byrne grants program have perpetuated racial disparities, corruption in law enforcement, and civil rights abuses due to inadequate monitoring by the Department of Justice. A 2001 report found deficiencies in monitoring and reporting for Byrne grants. A 2002 Heritage Foundation report questioned the program's effectiveness in reducing crime. The ACLU of Texas identified 17 scandals involving antidrug task forces funded by Byrne grants. Recent scandals involving misuse of Byrne grants program money in various states include falsification of government records, witness tampering, fabricating evidence, false imprisonment, drug theft, racial profiling, sexual harassment, and other abuses of power. Notable incidents include wrongful convictions due to police perjury in Missouri and negotiations with drug offenders for dropped charges in several states. The most infamous scandal occurred in Tulia, Texas, where numerous African American residents were wrongly targeted. Several African American residents in a town were arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced to prison based on the testimony of an undercover officer with a questionable background. The officer worked alone without providing evidence, leading to convictions and lengthy sentences. Some defendants accepted plea bargains, but suspicions arose about the legitimacy of the charges. Several African American residents in Hearne, Texas were wrongfully arrested on drug charges, leading to a case against the county government. A Byrne-funded anti-drug task force was found to have targeted African Americans, similar to the Tulia defendants who were eventually pardoned by Governor Rick Perry. These scandals highlight issues with Byrne grant program spending. The anti-drug task force in Hearne, Texas targeted African Americans based on uncorroborated informants' tales, leading to wrongful arrests and prosecution of innocent citizens. Counties settled the case, agreeing to pay financial damages to the plaintiffs. Scandals related to the Byrne grants program prompted Texas legislature to pass reforms outlawing racial profiling and prohibiting drug offenses. The Texas legislature passed reforms to outlaw racial profiling and prohibit drug offense convictions based solely on the word of an undercover informant. The Criminal Jurisprudence Committee recommended abolishing federally funded antidrug task forces due to corruption risks. The Texas legislature passed reforms to outlaw racial profiling and prohibit drug offense convictions based solely on the word of an undercover informant. Legislation transfers authority for drug task forces to the Department of Public Safety and allocates asset forfeiture proceeds to support drug abuse prevention programs. Texas's \"corroboration\" law, supported by Christian conservatives and civil rights activists, aims to prevent false witness against neighbors. The Texas legislature passed reforms to outlaw racial profiling and prohibit drug offense convictions based solely on the word of an undercover informant. Legislation transfers authority for drug task forces to the Department of Public Safety and allocates asset forfeiture proceeds to support drug abuse prevention programs. Texas's \"corroboration\" law, supported by Christian conservatives and civil rights activists, aims to prevent false witness against neighbors by requiring multiple witnesses for establishing guilt. The \"Sheetrock\" scandal in Dallas involved corruption and civil rights abuses by the police force, where officers and informants framed innocent people, mostly Mexican immigrants, with fake drugs made of chalk-like material. This led to the dismissal of over 40 cases and a former narcotics detective being sentenced to five years in prison. Charges against others are still pending. Many regional antidrug task forces heavily rely on funding from the Byrne grant program, with the US Government being responsible for corruption and civil rights abuses within their operations. Congress believes that states must have effective control over these task forces to receive grants, criminal convictions should not be based solely on law enforcement testimony, and corroborative evidence should always be required for convictions to be upheld. LIMITATION ON RECEIPT OF BYRNE GRANT FUNDS AND OTHER DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE. Limitation on State funding under law enforcement assistance programs unless no antidrug task forces are funded or specific evidence requirements are met. The Attorney General must ensure that law enforcement officers in antidrug task forces have high levels of honesty and integrity. Regulations will be prescribed to enforce this requirement, and funds not allocated due to non-compliance will be reallocated to compliant states. \nSEC. 4. COLLECTION OF DATA.\n\nA State receiving Federal funds under section 3(a)(2) must collect data on racial distribution, nature of charges, and location of charges. The State must submit this data to Congress 180 days before funds are awarded for a fiscal year."
