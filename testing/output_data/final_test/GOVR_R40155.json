    "content": "Dependence on foreign crude oil, climate change concerns, and promoting domestic rural economies have led to increased interest in renewable biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the U.S. transportation sector. U.S. policymakers have implemented various policies at state and federal levels to support biofuels production and use, including tax credits, import tariffs, research grants, loans, and minimum usage requirements. The U.S. has implemented policies to support biofuels production, including tax credits and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandating biofuels use. Despite significant growth in biofuels production, consumption remains low in the U.S. transportation sector. The report focuses on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) established in 2005 to mandate biofuels use in the national transportation fuel supply. It addresses sustainability issues and unintended consequences of the rapid growth in U.S. biofuels production to meet the expanding RFS mandate. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 greatly expanded the biofuels mandate to 36 billion gallons by 2022, supporting U.S. biofuels production by providing a mandatory market for qualifying biofuels. This reduces the risk associated with biofuels production and stimulates capital investment in biofuels plants. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the biofuels mandate, stimulating growth in the biofuels industry. The Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) increases mandated usage volumes and extends the timeframe to 2022. RFS2 subdivides renewable fuel requirements into four categories, each with its own volume standard. The Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) sets minimum thresholds for biofuels' lifecycle greenhouse gas emission performance and requires renewable fuels to be made from feedstocks meeting a revised definition of renewable biomass. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the RFS, with detailed compliance standards, a tracking system using renewable identification numbers (RINs), and specific deadlines for announcing annual requirements. The Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) includes specific deadlines for annual standards, waiver requests, and RIN oversight. It has four biofuel categories with volume mandates and GHG emission reduction thresholds. The mandate increases from nearly 13 billion gallons in 2010 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. Biofuels must reduce GHG emissions by at least 20% to qualify as renewable fuels. Corn-starch ethanol is capped at 13.8 billion gallons in 2013, increasing to 15 billion gallons by 2015. The advanced biofuels mandate grows from 1 bgals in 2010 to 21 bgals in 2022, requiring a 50% reduction in GHG emissions. It includes biofuels from non-corn feedstocks like sorghum and wheat, as well as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol and biomass-based biodiesel. The total mandate for 2013 is 2.75 bgals. Cellulosic and agricultural waste-based biofuel mandate increases from 100 million gallons in 2010 to 16 bgals in 2022. In 2022, RFS mandates were lowered for several years. Cellulosic biofuels must reduce GHG emissions by 60% to qualify. This includes cellulosic biomass ethanol and biomass-to-liquid fuels. The mandate for biomass-based biodiesel grows from 0.5 bgals in 2009 to 1 bgals in 2012. EPA established the 2013 mandate at 1.28 bgals and proposes the same volume for 2014. BBD produced from cellulosic feedstocks could meet both cellulosic and BBD requirements. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) sets limits on corn-starch ethanol inclusion and encourages the use of non-corn-based biofuels. Any renewable fuel meeting cellulosic biofuels or biomass-based diesel (BBD) requirements also counts towards the advanced biofuels mandate, reducing the need for excess volumes. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) mandates the use of non-corn-based biofuels to reduce the need for excess volumes of corn-starch ethanol. It also requires qualifying renewable fuels to have lower lifecycle GHG emissions compared to 2005 baseline gasoline or diesel. The RFS2 mandates emission thresholds for biofuels categories, including GHG assessments for lifecycle emissions. A key point of contention is the inclusion of indirect land use changes in the GHG assessment. The EPA faced criticism for its initial assessment of biofuel lifecycle GHG emissions in the proposed RFS2, particularly regarding indirect land use changes (ILUC). Stakeholders debated the impact of ILUC costs on corn ethanol's eligibility under the RFS2. Despite arguments that ILUC was too vague to measure accurately, EPA made adjustments to its analytical tools in the final RFS2 rule of February 3, 2010. EPA's final RFS2 rule of February 3, 2010, established qualifying fuel pathways for GHG reduction compliance determinations. Future reassessments may alter the status of these fuel pathways, with EPA planning to evaluate additional biomass crops and their fuel pathways. In a February 2013 rule, EPA qualified new fuel pathways for cellulosic biofuel production to increase advanced, low-GHG renewable fuels. EPA encourages parties to utilize other biofuel pathways not yet modeled. The EPA encourages parties to use a petition process for additional biofuel pathways. Facilities existing before December 19, 2007, are exempt from the 20% GHG threshold. Ethanol facilities built before December 31, 2009, using natural gas or biofuels are also exempt. New production capacity expansions must meet the 20% GHG reduction threshold to generate RINs. EISA requires renewable fuels to be made from feedstocks qualifying as \"renewable biomass.\" EISA limits the types of feedstocks for renewable fuel production, excluding certain agricultural land and biomass materials from federal lands. The restrictions apply to domestic and foreign producers. EPA identified five feedstock categories with minimal indirect land use change for cellulosic biofuels to qualify as renewable biomass. The EPA is responsible for implementing regulations to ensure the national transportation fuel supply in the US contains the mandated volume of renewable fuel. This includes various types of renewable biomass such as crop residues, forest material, secondary annual crops, separated food and yard waste, and perennial grasses. EPA calculates annual percentage standards for biofuel categories under the RFS2 to apply to refiners, blenders, and importers of gasoline and diesel fuels. The EPA implements regulations for renewable fuel in the US, including biofuels like crop residues and perennial grasses. Standards apply to refiners, blenders, and importers of gasoline and diesel fuels to determine renewable volume obligations (RVO). Tradable RINs are used to meet requirements, considering regional biofuels production. EPA estimates total fuel usage in the US annually and calculates the percentage obligation as the mandated renewable fuel amount as a percentage of expected total transportation fuel use. The EPA sets biofuel standards annually based on information from the EIA. The RFS mandates are enforced on gasoline and diesel fuel refiners, blenders, and importers. EPA aims to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking by summer and finalize it by November 30 of the preceding year. This includes information on cellulosic biofuel waiver credits and the status of land-use restrictions for renewable biomass in the US and Canada. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates are enforced on gasoline and diesel fuel suppliers, requiring them to include a percentage of biofuels in their annual fuel sales. This renewable volume obligation (RVO) is calculated based on EPA standards for different biofuel categories. Suppliers must have enough Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to prove compliance, with penalties for failure to meet RVO requirements. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires a specific volume of renewable fuel to be used in the U.S. transportation fuel market. RINs associated with exported renewable fuel cannot be used for RFS compliance. Exporters are assigned an RVO equal to the volume of fuel they export. EPA sets RFS standards annually through a rulemaking process. EPA evaluates market conditions to determine the standards each year. The EPA Administrator has the authority to waive RFS requirements if there is inadequate domestic supply or if implementation would harm the economy or environment. Waiver requests can also be made due to unusual circumstances, such as high grain prices in 2008 and 2012. In 2012, the governors of Arkansas and North Carolina petitioned for waivers from RFS requirements, which were ultimately denied. The EPA administrator can waive carve-outs for cellulosic biofuel and biomass-based diesel fuel under certain conditions. EPA has chosen to limit waivers to the cellulosic category through 2013, while leaving advanced and total renewable mandates unchanged. For example, in 2010 and 2011, EPA lowered RFS mandates for cellulosic biofuels. In 2010, EPA lowered the 2011 RFS for cellulosic biofuels to 6 mgals (ethanol equivalent), down from its original 250 mgals. In December 2011, EPA further reduced the 2012 RFS for cellulosic biofuels to 8.65 mgals (ethanol equivalent), down from its original 500 mgals. In August 2013, EPA again lowered the 2013 RFS for cellulosic biofuels to 6 mgals (ethanol equivalent), down from its original 1 billion gallons. EPA cited a lack of production capacity and investment in commercial-scale refineries as reasons for the revisions. EPA proposed 2014 RFS mandates with waivers for cellulosic, advanced, and total renewable biofuels. The agency plans to lower the advanced biofuel mandate by 1.55 billion gallons and the overall RFS by 2.94 billion gallons due to the \"blend wall\" limitation of 10% ethanol in gasoline. This move would also decrease the corn-ethanol cap by roughly 1.4 billion gallons below the statutory level for 2014. Ethanol proponents argue that EPA may have exceeded its legislative waiver authority. The EPA's proposed 2014 RFS mandates include waivers for cellulosic, advanced, and total renewable biofuels. If the EPA reduces the required volume of cellulosic biofuel according to the waiver provisions in EISA, they must offer credits to obligated parties. These waiver credits cannot be traded or banked for future use and are only allowed to be used to meet the cellulosic biofuel standard for the year they are offered. The value of the credits is determined by the difference between $3.00 per gallon adjusted for inflation and the average wholesale price of gasoline in the US. In 2012, the American Petroleum Institute challenged the obligation under the RFS to use cellulosic biofuels that were not available in sufficient amounts or pay a fee. After EPA lowered the cellulosic biofuels mandate for three years, API petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C., and the appeals court ruled in favor of API, vacating the 2012 cellulosic biofuels mandate. EPA announced the 2012 cellulosic biofuel standard was dropped to zero in February 2013. The EPA vacated the cellulosic biofuel standard in 2012 and proposed lowering the 2011 RFS to zero in November 2013. RINs are unique 38-character numbers issued by biofuel producers or importers for each gallon of renewable fuel. The RIN formulation includes codes for year, company ID, batch number, biofuel equivalence value, and renewable fuel category. The RIN formulation includes codes for identifying the RFS category of biofuel batches, such as total, advanced, cellulosic, or biodiesel. RIN gallons are calculated by multiplying the liquid volume of renewable fuel by its equivalence value. For example, 1,000 gallons of biodiesel equals 1,500 RIN gallons of advanced biofuels. The end number for a batch is determined by the RIN block start and equivalence value, with the RR code indicating the total RIN gallons. Biofuel producers and importers must register with the EPA and follow RIN guidelines for record-keeping and reporting. RINs are generated based on feedstock meeting renewable biomass definitions. RINs are reported to the EPA and transferred when biofuels change ownership. RINs are separated from fuel for compliance or trade purposes. Under EISA, a permanent exemption is available to parties producing or importing less than 10,000 gallons of renewable fuel annually. This exemption is extended for up to three years to producers generating less than 125,000 gallons per year from new facilities. RINs can be used for current or future year's RVO requirements. RINs can be used to meet current or future year's RVO requirements, with a lifespan of up to two years. Up to 20% of the current year's RVO can be met with RINs from the previous year. RINs can be used for credit trading and can be sold to other entities if surplus biofuels are supplied. A market for RINs has developed due to varying biofuels supply and demand. The market for RINs has developed due to varying biofuels supply and demand. RINs have value as a replacement for the actual purchase and supply of biofuels, with their value varying across different biofuel categories and geographically. The value of RINs reflects the binding nature of biofuel mandates on the market equilibrium. If biofuel supply exceeds the mandate, RIN value is zero. If the mandate exceeds market supply, prices adjust to incentivize production and consumption. The RIN's core value is determined by the difference between biofuels producer price and blender price. The blender pays the full price, including the RIN's core value, to acquire the mandated RFS. RIN prices escalated sharply in 2013 as biofuels mandates became binding. RIN prices surged in 2013 due to binding biofuels mandates, reaching over $1.00/gallon before dropping. Market conditions determine how added biofuels acquisition costs are distributed along the supply chain. Fraudulent activity involving RINs has been reported, leading to criminal prosecutions. The EPA's final rule determination on renewable fuels under the RFS2 standards shows reduced dependence on foreign oil, lower domestic transportation fuel prices, and decreased greenhouse gas emissions by 2022. The expanded market for agricultural products resulting from biofuels production is expected to increase annual net farm income by $13 billion by 2022. This will lead to a reduction in corn and soybean exports, an increase in the cost of food in the United States, and both increased and decreased emissions of certain air contaminants. The effects of increased biofuels production include changes in air contaminants such as hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, acetaldehyde, and ethanol, with decreases in carbon monoxide and benzene. This is expected to lead to up to 245 cases of adult premature mortality. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is supported for reducing investment risks in renewable biofuels, enhancing U.S. energy security, and providing additional demand for U.S. agricultural products. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) supports renewable biofuels, benefiting U.S. agriculture and rural economy. Biofuels offer environmental advantages over fossil fuels, emitting lower greenhouse gases. Critics argue that picking biofuels as the winner may hinder other energy sources' development. Critics argue that biofuels receive excessive subsidies, distorting investment markets and hindering the development of alternative energy sources. They suggest a technology-neutral policy like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system instead of continued federal incentives for corn-starch ethanol production. This shift could have unintended consequences on energy security, emissions, agricultural markets, and land use. Taxpayers are asked to finance biofuels subsidies for infrastructure affecting federal budget choices. Federal costs include tax credits for biofuels, with most expiring in 2011. Cellulosic biofuels production tax credit is set to expire in 2013. In 2011, federal subsidies for ethanol production were estimated at over $7.8 billion, including nearly $7.5 billion in tax credits. After the expiration of the ethanol tax credit, federal support fell sharply, with a preliminary estimate of approximately $1.3 billion in 2012, mainly attributed to the biodiesel tax credit. The biodiesel and renewable diesel fuel tax credit of $1.00 per gallon was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayers Relief Act of 2012. There is currently no proposed legislation in the 113th Congress to renew or extend these biofuel tax credits. However, bills are being proposed to alter RFS mandates and EPA's waiver of E15 blending ratios. The U.S. biofuel production is mainly ethanol from corn starch, which has increased its share of the annual corn crop over the years. The supply of Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGs) has increased with the expansion of the ethanol industry, leading to its incorporation into animal feed. Corn use for ethanol peaked in 2010 at 5,019 million bushels, decreased during the 2012 drought, and is estimated at 4,900 million bushels in 2013. With the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), ethanol production is expected to use a declining share of U.S. corn production in the future. The shift towards greater corn use for biofuels from 2006 to 2010 led to higher prices for other corn users, including livestock and export sectors. This increased competition for cropland between biofuels feedstocks and other field crops, resulting in more intense agricultural activity to meet growing demand for food, feed, and fuel resources. The U.S. corn industry relies on productivity gains to meet demand, with bio-engineered advances in seed technology improving yields. Despite weather-related challenges like the 2012 drought, corn production is expected to rebound with a record crop in 2013. The severe drought of 2012 significantly reduced corn yields below trend, but they are expected to return to normal in 2013. This return to normal growing conditions is projected to replenish corn supplies, lower prices, and restore a more traditional supply and demand balance. Corn prices spiked during the 2006-2010 period due to the rapid expansion of the U.S. ethanol industry surpassing corn production growth. Unfavorable weather in 2010 and 2011 also impacted yields, but the 2012 drought caused a 23% drop below trend. This led to a temporary increase in prices to $6.29 per bushel from 2011 to early 2013. The outlook for corn yields in 2013 is positive, with prices expected to remain between $4.00 to $5.00 per bushel through 2020. Research investments are likely to increase as farm prices trend upwards. The U.S. cropland planted with corn has increased in recent years, reaching a high of 97.2 million acres in 2012. Expansion in crop area may be limited due to corn's preference for specific growing conditions. Recent seed developments have allowed for significant expansion in corn production. Recent seed developments have enabled significant expansion of corn production into the central and northern Plains states, with new acreage likely coming from shifts in crop rotation from soybeans to corn. However, investing in high operating costs upfront for strong returns at harvest poses risks as production moves into less traditional regions. Corn yields tend to suffer when farmers shift away from the traditional annual rotation with soybeans, impacting productivity in successive corn-on-corn cultivation. Corn-on-corn cultivation can lower yields by 5% to 15% compared to rotation with soybeans or fallow. Sustainable corn planted area is estimated to be around 90-95 million acres, leading to increased dependence on yield growth for future production. Advanced biofuels, as defined by EISA, include biofuels with a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, such as Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol and home-grown biodiesel. Under the RFS2, advanced biofuels must reach a minimum of 21 billion gallons by 2022, with at least 16 billion gallons from cellulosic biofuels. Corn stover is likely to be a primary biomass for cellulosic biofuels production due to existing ethanol plants in corn production zones. However, challenges remain in achieving commercially competitive cellulosic biofuels production, including potential environmental trade-offs like sacrificing soil fertility by harvesting stover instead of returning it to the soil. There are uncertainties in producing cellulosic feedstocks and biofuels, with challenges in establishing dedicated perennial crops and developing new harvesting machinery. Harvesting, transporting, and storing bulky cellulose-rich crops pose significant problems. Seasonality issues and the need for year-round operation of biofuels plants highlight the importance of storage. Marginal lands may be used for biomass production, but soil fertility may be sacrificed by harvesting stover instead of returning it to the soil. Following uncertainties in producing cellulosic feedstocks and biofuels, challenges include establishing perennial crops and developing harvesting machinery. Marginal lands, located far from urban markets, pose difficulties in plant location and fuel distribution costs. Despite uncertainties and the 2008 financial crisis, 2013 may see substantial commercial production of cellulosic biofuels, with the EPA finalizing a 6 million gallon RFS for two plants. The EPA finalized a 6 million gallon RFS for two biofuels plants in 2013, but production has been below mandate levels. Despite this, the industry is seeing growth with new plants planned or under construction in multiple states and provinces. Uncertainties in cellulosic ethanol production could impact fuel supply and prices. If cellulosic ethanol production does not meet the RFS mandate, other biofuels sources like sorghum-starch ethanol, sugar-beet ethanol, biodiesel, or Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol may need to fill the void. Biofuels require energy for conversion and the type of energy used and feedstocks impact their net energy balance and environmental impact. The net energy consumption of ethanol, including all inputs and processes in the fuel cycle, is crucial for determining its environmental benefits. For corn-based ethanol, energy inputs for production, conversion, and distribution are considered. The energy output/input ratio for corn-starch ethanol production varies, with a recent USDA study estimating a ratio of 2.3, indicating a 130% higher energy content in a gallon of corn ethanol. The energy balance of corn ethanol is debated, with some sources claiming a 130% higher energy content than needed for production. Alternative feedstocks and biomass for process energy could greatly improve energy balance, with estimates suggesting cellulosic ethanol could reach 8.0 or higher. Ethanol's displacement of gasoline offers potential energy security benefits. The potential for biofuels to enhance energy security is uncertain, with 40% of the U.S. corn crop used for ethanol in 2012. If the entire crop were used, it could account for 16% of national gasoline use. However, the overall impact on fossil fuel consumption is questionable, especially with a heavy reliance on corn-based ethanol. The EISA RFS mandate aims for biofuels to make up 20% of gasoline energy transportation fuel demand and 2.4% of diesel demand by 2022. An expanded RFS could lead to increased imports of sugar-cane ethanol and biodiesel from tropical countries, diversifying fuel sources but not necessarily enhancing domestic energy security. The impact of the expanded RFS on energy prices remains uncertain. If petroleum prices are high, some biofuels may help mitigate gasoline prices, but current production costs for certain biofuels are high. Technological advances or increased petroleum prices are needed to make them competitive. A carbon tax could shift economics in favor of biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions despite high production costs. Expanding ethanol production raises concerns about feedstock supply, distribution, and infrastructure. Ethanol use beyond 10% blend requires new infrastructure or retrofitting existing equipment. Drop-in fuels like bio-butanol or biomass-based diesel substitutes could mitigate some infrastructure issues. Unlike petroleum products, ethanol and ethanol-blended gasoline cannot be transported in existing U.S. pipeline infrastructure. Ethanol-blended gasoline faces challenges in U.S. pipeline transportation due to separation and corrosiveness. Current distribution relies on rail cars, tanker trucks, and barges, with no major pipelines investing in large-scale ethanol shipments. Ethanol must be moved from rural Midwest areas to coastal cities for blending with gasoline before delivery to retailers. Some pipeline operators are looking to modify their systems for ethanol transportation, such as coating pipelines with corrosion-resistant materials or replacing components. These modifications could be costly and increase ethanol transportation costs. As non-corn biofuels become more prominent, supply infrastructure concerns may lessen. Cellulosic biofuels offer potential from various feedstocks. Cellulosic biofuels can be produced from a variety of feedstocks distributed throughout the country, reducing dependency on corn. Municipal solid waste could be a potential feedstock for biofuels production. Increased biofuel imports could allow for greater use, especially along the coasts. Most gasoline in the US contains up to 10% ethanol, which is compatible with existing vehicles and infrastructure. Automakers warrant their vehicles to run on gasoline with up to 10% ethanol. The U.S. market currently warrants vehicles to run on gasoline with up to 10% ethanol, known as the \"blend wall.\" To meet RFS mandates, higher blending ratios like 15% or 20% are needed, which the ethanol industry supports. This would expand the blend wall to 20-27 billion gallons. The EPA issued a partial waiver for gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol blend (E15) for model year 2001 and newer light-duty vehicles. However, no waiver was granted for E15 use in older vehicles, motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines. The approval of E15 for newer vehicles covered 62% of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads in 2010. Fuel producers must register new blends and submit health effects testing to the EPA for higher blending ratios. The EPA acknowledged infrastructure limitations for selling E15, stating that ethanol will likely dominate the renewable fuel pool. The market's ability to consume higher ethanol blends like E85 is constrained due to infrastructure and market factors. The EPA does not foresee the market consuming enough ethanol in blends greater than E10 or producing sufficient volumes of non-ethanol biofuels to meet renewable fuel requirements. The EPA requires E15 suppliers to submit misfueling mitigation plans (MMP) due to concerns raised by engine manufacturers. A new MMP approved in February 2013 eliminates the four-gallon purchase requirement, as long as a fuel station has at least one dedicated E10 pump for older vehicles. The blend wall issue is exacerbated by changes in EIA's projections for U.S. transportation fuel. The EPA requires E15 suppliers to submit misfueling mitigation plans (MMP) due to concerns raised by engine manufacturers. EIA's projections for U.S. transportation fuel consumption rates have changed significantly since the RFS was enacted in 2007. Initially, EIA estimated 145 billion gallons of gasoline consumption per year, growing to 176 billion gallons by 2022. However, due to various factors, EIA now projects gasoline consumption to decrease to about 120 billion gallons by 2022, causing the RFS mandate's share of the gasoline transportation fuel market to increase to nearly 20% of annual consumption. The transportation fuel market is projected to grow to nearly 20% of annual consumption in gasoline-equivalent gallons. Two options to resolve this bottleneck include increased use of ethanol in flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) at high blend ratios like E85, requiring infrastructure development and significant investments, or expanding processing technologies at biofuel plants. The biofuel plant can produce biofuels like butanol for existing vehicles, but it is more expensive than ethanol. The 10% blend wall on ethanol in gasoline limits its consumption beyond 14 billion gallons per year. To increase ethanol use, vehicles need to be certified for higher blends or more FFVs need to be available. The turnover of the U.S. automobile fleet has slowed during the recession, making it difficult to integrate FFVs. The status of available RIN stocks of renewable and advanced biofuels for mandate compliance is crucial. Current RIN stocks in mid-2013 are estimated at 2.5 billion gallons, with 2 billion gallons being D6 RINs for renewable mandate compliance. RIN stocks were expected to tighten in 2014 due to increased mandates, leading to a dramatic price increase for renewable fuel RINs. In early 2013, ethanol RIN prices surged from $0.07 to over $1.00 per gallon by July. RIN prices then dropped in the second half of the year amid concerns about EPA mandates for 2014. The U.S. biofuels industry aims to enhance energy security and environmental goals, but there are limitations on biofuel production from current feedstocks like corn, raising questions about their net energy and environmental benefits. The rapid expansion of biofuels production from traditional crops like corn may lead to unintended consequences for agricultural costs, energy use, and environmental degradation. Alternative strategies for energy conservation and production, including biofuels from nontraditional sources, are being considered due to these concerns."
