    "content": "Congress has prioritized global health for years, with significant funding increases during the George W. Bush Administration. Funding for global health programs like PEPFAR and PMI rose from less than $2 billion in FY2001 to almost $8 billion in FY2008. Priorities in global health remained aligned under the Bush and Obama Administrations, with some debates emerging on specific issues like HIV/AIDS interventions and international family planning support. The Obama Administration saw steady congressional support for global health programs, with an average annual appropriation of $9 billion. U.S. support for global health was driven by concerns about infectious diseases like SARS, HIV/AIDS, and pandemic influenza, leading to the launch of various health initiatives. Congress backed these initiatives by meeting requested funding levels. In 1996, President Bill Clinton issued a directive recognizing infectious diseases as a threat to security and established a health advisor on the National Security Council. President Clinton later requested $100 million for the LIFE Initiative in 1999 to expand global HIV/AIDS efforts. President George W. Bush also addressed infectious diseases in his national security strategy papers and created initiatives like PEPFAR and PMI. In 2003, PEPFAR was established, followed by PMI in 2005 and the NTD Program in 2006. President Obama recognized the threat of infectious diseases and emphasized the importance of global health programs in the 2010 QDDR and National Security Strategy. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) was announced in 2009 to enhance coordination of U.S. global health efforts, although its implementation was short-lived. Integration of global health programs continued during the Obama Administration, spurred by the West Africa Ebola epidemic. The 115th Congress has been deliberating on strengthening weak health systems and preserving key global health programs like PEPFAR, prompted by the West Africa Ebola epidemic. There is consensus on the importance of health system strengthening for global health advancements and international security, but debates persist on the approach and the role of the United States in these efforts. Legislative and executive commitment to global health has been strong during the Bush and Obama administrations. The Trump Administration proposed cuts to global health funding in FY2018 and FY2019, seeking reductions of over $2 billion each year. Congress responded by funding global health programs above the administration's requests. The Trump Administration proposed cuts to global health funding in FY2018 and FY2019, seeking reductions of over $2 billion each year. The $7.1 billion request for FY2019 includes funding for State Department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to challenge the global community to devote resources to building healthier nations in the developing world. The international community adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, with health being the third goal. Intensified efforts have reduced maternal deaths by 43% between 1990 and 2015, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Nigeria and India accounted for one-third of all maternal deaths. Human resource constraints hinder efforts to reduce maternal mortality. Efforts to reduce maternal mortality in developing countries are hindered by human resource constraints. Severe bleeding is a leading cause of maternal death, accounting for 27% of all cases. Preexisting conditions like HIV/AIDS and malaria contribute to roughly 28% of maternal deaths. Child deaths have decreased from 12.7 million to 5.9 million between 1990 and 2015, with many being preventable through low-cost interventions. The risk of child mortality is highest in the first month of life, with 45% of deaths occurring then. Children in sub-Saharan Africa are 14 times more likely to die before age five compared to those in developed countries. In 2016, almost 37 million people were living with HIV worldwide, with 1 million deaths from AIDS, down from 1.9 million in 2003. Expanded access to antiretroviral treatments has decreased AIDS deaths. In 2016, roughly 53% of HIV-positive individuals worldwide were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), a significant increase from 4% in 2003. The United States played a key role in improving global ART access through initiatives like PEPFAR and support for the Global Fund. By the end of 2016, an estimated 19.5 million people were on ART globally, with the U.S. supporting treatment for nearly 11.5 million individuals. Various infectious diseases like SARS, Avian Influenza, Ebola, Zika, and Yellow Fever have caused outbreaks and pandemics in recent years, impacting thousands of people worldwide. The United States has been involved in global health initiatives such as the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to address diseases with pandemic potential. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant threat to global health security, with multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB posing challenges in treatment. Funding for MDR-TB is insufficient, and weaknesses in health systems complicate efforts to control the disease. The United States funds global health assistance through appropriations bills like State-Foreign Operations and Labor-HHS, supporting efforts by USAID, CDC, and PEPFAR to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Majority of funds go towards fighting HATM through bilateral programs and the Global Fund. The United States funds global health assistance through appropriations bills like State-Foreign Operations and Labor-HHS, supporting efforts by USAID, CDC, and PEPFAR to combat HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Funding is used for fighting HATM through bilateral programs and the Global Fund. Congress funds global health programs implemented by CDC and global HIV/AIDS research conducted by NIH through Labor-HHS appropriations. Agencies like USAID, State, and CDC receive specific funding for global health activities. USAID groups its global health activities into three areas: saving mothers and children, creating an AIDS-Free generation, and fighting other infectious diseases. Saving Mothers and Children involves reducing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable deaths, malaria, and undernutrition, supporting vulnerable children, increasing access to family planning and reproductive health services. Creating an AIDS-Free Generation includes supporting voluntary counseling and testing, awareness campaigns, and providing antiretroviral medicines. Fighting Other Infectious Diseases addresses various diseases like malaria, TB, NTDs, pandemic influenza, and emerging threats with specific funding from Congress. CDC global health activities include support for HIV/AIDS care, treatment services, laboratory services, research, and developing public health systems. They also focus on reducing death and illness from parasitic diseases like malaria through capacity building, surveillance, vector control, and diagnostic testing. Additionally, CDC works on global immunization efforts. CDC works on global immunization initiatives to prevent diseases like polio, measles, rubella, and meningitis. They accelerate the introduction of new vaccines and strengthen immunization systems in priority countries through technical assistance, monitoring, social mobilization, and vaccine management. CDC also helps MOHs develop Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) to enhance health systems and build capacity to monitor, detect, and respond to disease threats globally. The State Department leads PEPFAR and oversees U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS through OGAC. In 2012, the Obama Administration launched the Office of Global Health Diplomacy (OGHD) to guide diplomatic efforts in global health. OGHD aims to provide expertise and support to ambassadors for working on global health issues and building diplomatic strategies and partnerships. The Department of Defense (DOD) implements health activities abroad, including infectious disease research, health assistance post disasters, and training foreign health workers. The DOD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP) is funded by Congress and operates as part of PEPFAR. President George W. Bush launched PEPFAR in 2003, a $15 billion initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. OGAC was created to oversee U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS programs. OGAC distributes funds for global HIV/AIDS programs, including those by the Global Fund. The Lantos-Hyde Act authorized $48 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts from FY2009 to FY2013. The PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act in 2013 did not specify funds but has bipartisan support. President George W. Bush announced PMI in 2005 to expand U.S. malaria efforts in Africa. The Obama Administration expanded the goals of PMI to halve the burden of malaria among at-risk populations in Africa by 2014 through four prevention and treatment techniques: indoor residual spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), and intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPTp). The Leadership Act authorized the establishment of the U.S. Malaria Coordinator at USAID to oversee related efforts. The USAID program for fighting Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) received funding from appropriations and was jointly implemented with CDC. Under the George W. Bush Administration, the program aimed to provide treatments for NTDs in multiple countries. Subsequent administrations, including Obama's, adjusted the program's targets. Global health assistance funding has increased over the past decade, with some fluctuations during economic recessions. Global health aid increased due to funding to curb the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak. The United States leads in providing health aid, allocating 30.5% of its foreign aid to health assistance in 2016. Other top donors include the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Congressional support focuses on specific health conditions like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. Global health appropriations in FY2018 focused primarily on controlling HIV/AIDS (61%), TB (3%), and malaria (10%). Concerns have been raised about the ability of low- and middle-income countries to prevent infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola and yellow fever, as well as the vulnerability of Western nations to imported diseases like Zika and dengue fever. The future of support for the Global Health Security Agenda under the Trump Administration remains uncertain, with proposed budget cuts of almost $2 billion. The Trump Administration proposed a $2 billion reduction in global health spending, while Congress maintained funding levels in FY2018 and is considering the FY2019 budget request. Debates are ongoing regarding the Mexico City Policy and the extension of PEPFAR. Recent disease outbreaks like Ebola and Zika have sparked discussions on disease-specific funding versus systems-focused support for global health. In the year 2000, global health experts advocated for targeting health assistance through NGOs instead of host governments to improve health outcomes. This targeted approach was agreed upon by the international community and focused on achieving the Millennium Development Goals, although the health-related goals were not fully met. This approach aimed to address weaknesses in health systems and ensure that health assistance was effectively utilized. Despite progress made on achieving the MDGs, health-related goals were not fully met due to weak health systems. Efforts are being made to address global health challenges like noncommunicable and infectious diseases. World leaders are working towards the Sustainable Development Goal for \"good health and well-being\" by 2030, including universal health coverage. Congressional interest in strengthening health systems was heightened during the Ebola outbreak, with discussions and legislative drafts aimed at improving global health. Since 1980, infectious diseases have caused outbreaks occurring more frequently and with higher human infection rates. Legislative actions in the 115th Congress, such as H.R. 244 and H.Res. 342, have shown support for strengthening health systems worldwide. Since 1980, infectious diseases have caused outbreaks with higher human infection rates. Diseases like Ebola and Zika are spreading through international travel, while tuberculosis and malaria are becoming drug-resistant. The United States has supported global pandemic preparedness efforts, committing over $1 billion to the Global Health Security Agenda. USAID and CDC have used emergency funds to advance GHSA. The Trump Administration's support for the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is uncertain. While former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson advocated for extending GHSA until 2024, recent budget requests proposed eliminating regular appropriations for global health security. Emergency funds used by CDC and USAID for GHSA will expire in FY2019, leading to concerns about scaling back activities without additional funding. Recent efforts to rescind $252 million in unobligated Ebola emergency funds may further constrain available resources for pandemic preparedness. It is uncertain if the 115th Congress will provide supplemental funds for ongoing global health security efforts. The House Committee on Armed Services emphasized the need for a prompt response to infectious disease outbreaks and directed the development of an action plan to counter emerging threats. The plan aims to address infectious disease threats by identifying capability gaps, improving diagnostics, and enhancing emergency response teams. Congressional appropriations for global health programs have mostly exceeded budget requests, with the Trump Administration seeking significant cuts in FY2018 and FY2019. Congress maintained funding for global health programs despite the administration's requests. The Trump Administration proposes significant cuts to global health programs in the FY2019 budget request, including a 40% reduction in USAID global health budget and cuts to PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and CDC programs. Former President Ronald Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984. The Mexico City policy, implemented by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, required organizations receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. The policy was reinstated by the Trump Administration as Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA), expanding to all global health programs. Global health experts are assessing the impact of the PLGHA policy, with opponents concerned about potential risks to integrated health services. NGOs were encouraged to colocate services in one facility, including contraceptive care, HIV/AIDS services, prenatal checkups, immunizations, and information or referrals on safe abortion. Global health experts warned that the PLGHA policy could reduce access to reproductive health services. Some Members of Congress believe implementing PLGHA would reduce efficiencies and worsen health outcomes. Supporters argue that the policy closes loopholes in existing laws banning U.S. funds from being used for abortions abroad. The Trump Administration maintains that the impact on service providers will be minimal. The Department of State released a report on the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, indicating that some partners declined funding due to the policy terms. The Administration plans to conduct another assessment in December 2018 to determine the policy's effects on programming. In December 2018, legislation was introduced to permanently enact or repeal the Mexico City Policy. PEPFAR, a global health initiative, continues to receive bipartisan support but at lower funding levels under the Trump Administration. The budget request for global HIV/AIDS programs in FY2018 was about $5 billion, including $1.1 billion for the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The Senate Appropriations Committees disagreed with the budget proposal for HIV/AIDS funding in FY2018, recommending levels to remain mostly at FY2017 levels. Some advocates and Members of Congress questioned the Administration's commitment to controlling the global AIDS epidemic and expressed concerns about potential coverage loss for people on ART due to spending cuts. The Administration stated that requested levels would enable PEPFAR to accelerate efforts in high impact countries and maintain current treatment levels outside of those countries. The Trump Administration's proposal for PEPFAR diverges from previous administrations by maintaining treatment levels instead of increasing them. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about this approach, questioning the consensus on expanding PEPFAR's reach and achieving an AIDS-free generation. The current PEPFAR legislation lacks performance targets and specified countries, indicating a broad consensus at the time. Concerns about the Administration's priorities may lead to new discussions about PEPFAR's direction. Key discussions about extending PEPFAR have focused on performance targets, focus countries, and the Mexico City Policy. The Lantos-Hyde Act mandated support for ART for 4 million people by FY2013, with President Obama later aiming for 6 million on ART by 2013. Concerns have been raised about the Trump Administration's plans to increase treatment levels in priority countries while maintaining levels elsewhere. The Leadership Act and the Lantos-Hyde Act identified focus countries for PEPFAR investments, with the Trump Administration proposing to concentrate efforts in 13 countries. The Oversight Act did not specify countries for investment but defined partner countries as those receiving at least $5 million in HIV/AIDS assistance from the U.S. government. The Trump Administration plans to focus PEPFAR efforts in 13 countries, aiming for 95% of HIV-positive individuals to know their status, be on ART, and maintain suppressed viral loads. This strategy has received mixed reactions, with some concerned about a potential resurgence of the epidemic and others finding it reassuring. Congress may consider evaluating PEPFAR funding distribution and prioritizing certain countries, as done in previous acts. The PLGHA policy's impact on global HIV/AIDS programs, including PEPFAR, is uncertain. Congress may need to monitor and assess the policy's effects and consider including exemption language in legislation. Global health programs, including PEPFAR, continue to receive bipartisan support despite debates on foreign assistance levels. Concerns arise over rising noncommunicable diseases in many countries, posing challenges alongside existing health issues. Strengthening health systems may become more crucial without increased funding. Bolstering health systems will gain importance in U.S. global health programs with higher spending levels."
