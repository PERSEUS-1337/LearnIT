    "content": "The disposition of records from federally funded research by academic and nonprofit institutions is governed by OMB Circular A-110, which applies to federal grants to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations. It also applies to subawards to covered organizations and may apply to grants awarded to commercial organizations, foreign governments, and international organizations. OMB circulars are instructions issued by OMB with a lasting effect of two years or more, and all agencies must observe their provisions. Circular A-110 includes provisions on retention and access to records pertinent to an award. Records must be kept for a minimum of three years from the date an awardee submits the final expenditure report, and agencies must request transfer of records with long-term retention value to their custody. Awarding agencies are prohibited from limiting public access to recipient records unless the agency can demonstrate that such records must be kept confidential. Agencies can also obtain, reproduce, publish, or use the data first produced under an award for Federal purposes. The Shelby amendment requires that all data produced under an award be made available to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. Agencies must provide access to research data upon request, collect data in anticipation of public requests, and may charge fees for data access. This amendment aims to make federally funded research data accessible to the public, with a focus on environmental regulations. The Shelby amendment aims to make federally funded research data accessible to the public, focusing on environmental regulations. The dispute over data access for the \"Six Cities\" study highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in public access to data that influences policy decisions. The Shelby amendment aims to make federally funded research data accessible to the public, focusing on environmental regulations. Reviewers argue for the right to examine data supporting agency regulations to ensure scientific validity and prevent undue burdens. The Forsham v. Harris case established criteria for classifying records created by nonagencies as agency records. The court in Forsham v. Harris ruled that data sought by a private organization from a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare grantee were not agency records under FOIA, as federal grantees were excluded from FOIA coverage. The court concluded that the data requested by a private organization from a federal grantee were not agency records under FOIA. The legislative history of the Shelby amendment is limited, with indications of intent from Senate floor statements. The Committee on Government Reform held a hearing on H.R. 88, a bill to repeal an amendment. Proponents cited concerns about compliance costs and lack of public review of data used in regulations. Opponents raised privacy, proprietary information, data misinterpretation, research inhibition, and compliance costs. Research performers must provide completion reports and share data with other researchers. Agencies have policies to encourage data sharing. Policies encourage researchers to share data, but agencies didn't require data to be provided to the sponsoring federal agency. Principles for federal support of science were outlined in Science, the Endless Frontier by Vannevar Bush. Post-World War II, Congress funded scientific research through programs like the National Science Foundation. Post-World War II enactments led to the development of governmental grants for research and education in U.S. colleges and universities. Federal funding for R&D in FY2009 was about $133 billion, with half allocated for research and three-quarters provided to nonfederal researchers. More than three-quarters of R&D funds were extramural, with universities receiving half of research funds and industry receiving over two-thirds of development funds. Congress chose to finance research in the private sector rather than create a state system, preserving grantee autonomy and incorporating federal interests. Grant research values include competitive priority, peer recognition, and grantee autonomy. The federal grants system supports scientific research with principles like peer review, replication of results, and protection of scientific inquiry. Public discussion of findings is crucial to scientists, ensuring autonomy from political interference. Circular A-110 allows data sharing for federal purposes, but ownership policies for grant data remain undefined. Federal agencies generally endorse sharing of research data by researchers, with access limited to other researchers and safeguards for confidential information. Some agencies allow public access to research data via databases. Major research funding agencies like NSF, NIH, and NASA encourage or require researchers to share data after publication of research. Federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, require researchers to retain and share data for a specified period after publication. Researchers must make unique research resources available to others, such as specific cell lines and cloned DNA. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) released a policy in 2003 requiring grant applications over $500,000 to address data sharing. Researchers are expected to deposit data in data banks for efficient access by the scientific community. NIH supports timely release of final research data for use by other researchers, with privacy requirements considered. Data must be made available by the time of publication of main results. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the second largest federal funder of research at universities and colleges, supporting research in all areas of science. Since its inception in 1950, NSF had no written policy on data sharing until 1989 when a policy was adopted by the National Science Board. NSF grantees are expected to promptly submit findings for publication and share primary data with other researchers at no more than incremental cost. Grantees funded by NSF are expected to share primary data and materials at minimal cost. There is a push for increased public access to research data, with calls for freely available information and sharing of software and inventions. Various science policy groups advocate for data disclosure after publication, with considerations for privacy and intellectual property rights. The 1998 statement by the Academy presidents urged the development of clear standards for open communication in scientific research, anticipating public pressures. The Council on Governmental Relations (COGR) advised universities to create policies for public access to federally sponsored research data. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Council adopted similar measures in 1999. The AAAS Council resolution in early 1999 supports public disclosure of scientific findings and regulatory decisions with appropriate safeguards. Authors submitting articles to Science must provide all necessary data and computer codes, with large data sets deposited in a repository. Other professional groups like the American Sociological Association and American Economic Association also encourage data sharing. Nature publishers adopted a requirement for publication in 2009. In 2009, Nature publishers required authors to make materials, data, and protocols available without preconditions. A 2009 Academy report emphasized the importance of publicly accessible research data and methods for verification and building on published results. It recommended that researchers share data unless there are compelling reasons not to, with explanations provided in such cases. Each research field should have standards for data sharing. In 2009, a report emphasized the importance of publicly accessible research data and recommended that each research field have standards for sharing data. It also recommended the development of a structured approach to preservation and access to scientific data, stating that preservation and access capabilities are critical for progress in science and society. The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010 required the development of data policies to maximize information access and provide cost-efficient data management. The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010 mandated the coordination of agency policies for the dissemination and stewardship of research results. A report to Congress in March 2012 highlighted public support for increased access to digital data and the inclusion of data management plans in funding proposals. Most federal agencies lacked policies on public accessibility for data generated through various funding mechanisms. The OSTP Director affirmed the Obama Administration's commitment to public access to federally funded research results, including publications and data. Federal agencies funding over $100 million in R&D annually must develop plans for increasing data access. FOIA allows access to government agency information without requiring a reason for the request. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) grants access to government agency information for any purpose, with exemptions including national defense secrets, internal personnel issues, trade secrets, and privacy concerns. It also restricts access to certain law enforcement and financial supervision information. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows agencies to withhold or redact records, but discretionary disclosures can be made as good public policy. Exemptions do not include a specific public interest provision, and courts interpret them narrowly to promote disclosure. Agencies can charge for complying with requests, but only direct costs are reimbursed, limited to search, duplication, and review. Lower charges apply to certain requesters like educational institutions and the media. Before the Shelby amendment, private performers of federally funded research were not required to provide federal agencies with raw data in response to FOIA requests. Intramural research by federal agencies is accessible to the public, unless FOIA exemptions apply. All states have laws on public access to government information, with varying levels of access. Some observers have referenced state laws in response to changes in federal regulations. Georgia's open records law allowed R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to try to obtain data records of a Georgia researcher's study on children identifying the company's cartoon camel with cigarettes. The researcher refused, leading to litigation and a conflict with the university administration. Some states permit the release of specific scientific research data, with California, Massachusetts, and Michigan allowing epidemiological data. The laws vary in terms of data disclosure, with some states having more restrictive laws than the Shelby amendment. For example, the California Public Records Act allows agencies to withhold records if the public interest outweighs disclosure. OMB revised Circular A-110 in response to the Shelby amendment, with language narrowing the definition of data. The Shelby amendment narrowed the definition of data in Circular A-110, with the final revision broadening its applicability to research used in developing agency actions with the force of law. The revision was effective on November 8, 1999, and sought comments on whether it should apply only to regulations with impacts of $100 million or more. The final revision of the Shelby amendment broadened the definition of data in Circular A-110 to include research used in developing agency actions with the force of law. It sought comments on whether the revision should only apply to regulations with impacts of $100 million or more. The revision defined the term \"published\" as in the second proposed revision and defined research data more restrictively to prevent the release of certain information. The implications of these language differences are discussed in the section on issues. The Shelby amendment allows for cost reimbursement via a reasonable user fee equaling the incremental cost of obtaining the data if the agency obtains the data solely at the request of a private party. The OMB language allows for reimbursement of the full incremental cost of obtaining research data, including costs incurred by the agency, the recipient of the research funding, and applicable parties. The final revision of the Shelby amendment in Circular A-110 allowed federal agencies to retain fees to reimburse themselves, recipients, and subrecipients for costs incurred in obtaining data in response to a FOIA request. This revision became effective in November 1999. Federal agencies issued conforming regulations to allow public comments on the reimbursement process. The OMB received over 9,000 public comments on the first draft revision of agency regulations, with 55% in support and 45% opposed. The second revision proposal received over 3,000 comments, with support from various groups advocating for broad public access to research data for transparency and accountability. The Wall Street Journal and various groups support new government rules for research data transparency. Objections raised by NSF, NIH, National Academy of Sciences, AAAS, PhRMA, Semiconductor Industry Association, and Boston Chamber of Commerce. OMB addresses concerns in response. OMB responded to concerns raised by various groups, including NSF, NIH, National Academy of Sciences, AAAS, PhRMA, Semiconductor Industry Association, and the Boston Chamber of Commerce, regarding research data transparency. OMB emphasized the need to balance public access to research data with protecting the research process, ensuring validation of Federally-funded research findings, maintaining the traditional scientific process, and implementing a practical public access process. The OMB did not require scientists to make research data public while ongoing to protect the research process. Two attempts to repeal the Shelby Amendment failed, with one proposed amendment rejected by the House Appropriations Committee. H.R. 88, introduced in 1999, aimed to repeal the amendment but died in committee after subcommittee hearings. Within months, 16 agencies had incorporated the revision. Since the revision of Circular A-110, 16 agencies have implemented the changes, and research institutions have established procedures for handling FOIA requests related to the revision. Concerns about increased burden on researchers due to FOIA requests have not materialized, with only NIH and EPA receiving requests in the first three years after the revision. After the revision of Circular A-110, only NIH and EPA received FOIA requests, but none met the criteria. Out of 42 requests, 11 were for pre-revision data, 7 had unavailable data, and the rest were either for different information or withdrawn. Only two requests to EPA under the Shelby Amendment were found between 2002 and 2012, both granted. One request involved litigation regarding lead health effects data, but no cost information was provided. No evidence of widespread FOIA requests or significant impacts was found. The use of the Freedom of Information Act for federally funded research has both potential benefits and disadvantages. Benefits include well-established mechanisms and case law, while opposition focuses on issues like timing of access, cost of administration, and potential for abuse. Some suggest that requests should meet a public need. Serious negative impacts on research related to regulatory issues have been claimed, making conclusions about the impact of the Shelby Amendment tentative. Some suggest that requests for data under FOIA should meet a public interest test before release. The issues raised by the amendment and OMB revisions to Circular A-110 can be categorized into whether desired information is available to the public, protection of proprietary information and privacy, benefits and costs of compliance, and impact on the research process. Factors affecting the achievement of the Shelby amendment's goals include the extent to which the revisions to Circular A-110 fulfill the intended objectives. The final revision to Circular A-110 is more restrictive than the legislative provision, limiting access to selected federally funded research data relating to published research findings used in developing agency actions with the force of law. The proposed revision to Circular A-110 is less restrictive than the final version, which limited access to federally funded research data used in developing agency actions with the force of law. OMB based its first proposal on Senators' statements supporting the provision but received criticism for its narrow approach. Senators argued that all federally funded research data should be subject to FOIA, not just data supporting federal rules or policies. The final revision to Circular A-110 broadened applicability to federal actions that can impact the public, including when research findings are cited in support of agency actions with the force of law. OMB decided not to extend the scope to agency guidance documents and other issuances without the force of law. The amendment to FOIA broadened its applicability to all data produced under an award, but the definition of data was not clearly defined. The OMB proposed revisions were more restrictive, causing concern in the scientific community about the interpretation of the term. Federal agency definitions of data included recorded information in any form or medium. The definition of data includes computer software and copyrightable materials, but not physical specimens. Senators emphasized the importance of replicating and verifying results. Circular A-110 revisions focused on research data as recorded factual material. The final version of the definition of research data focused on recorded factual material needed to validate research findings, excluding certain types of information and materials. Despite objections, exclusions similar to FOIA exemptions were retained in the final revision. The final revision of the definition of research data included exclusions similar to FOIA exemptions, such as for trade secrets, commercial information, and materials protected under law. One exclusion was for information that would invade personal privacy, with clarification that the word \"information\" covers various materials like video or audio tapes. Grant recipients are not required to submit excluded records to the funding agency. The final revision of the definition of research data included exclusions similar to FOIA exemptions, such as for trade secrets, commercial information, and materials protected under law. Grant recipients are not required to submit excluded records to the funding agency. OMB noted that agencies can withhold entire records to ensure privacy. Limiting public access to data from federally funded research may create imbalances in public debate, especially when privately funded research is also used. One suggestion to address this imbalance is to expand the reach of the Shelby Amendment. The final OMB revision limits public access to research data, excluding preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, and communications. It also excludes physical objects, trade secrets, confidential information, and personnel and medical information. Materials must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The final OMB revision limits public access to research data, excluding preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, and communications. It also excludes physical objects, trade secrets, confidential information, and personnel and medical information. Materials must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Only a small proportion of federally funded R&D is potentially covered by the revisions to Circular A-110, which mainly focuses on basic research that may not produce results used in developing actions with the force of law. The OMB's final revision of Circular A-110 limits public access to research data, excluding certain types of information. There was a suggestion to narrow data access only to regulations with a $100 million impact threshold, but this was met with mixed feedback. Some believed that much research used in developing agency actions would still not be accessible to the public due to the limitations of Circular A-110. The OMB's final revision of Circular A-110 limits public access to research data used in developing agency actions, excluding certain types of information. Data from contracted research and grants to state and local governments would not be available under the amendment unless specified in the contract. Some suggested extending the revisions to cover contracts and grants under Circular A-102 as well. The first OMB revision narrowed the amendment's applicability to \"data relating to published research findings,\" without clearly defining \"published.\" The OMB's final revision of Circular A-110 limits public access to research data used in developing agency actions, excluding certain types of information. The definition of \"published\" research findings was narrowed down to those appearing in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal or cited in support of an agency action with the force of law. Critics argue that the OMB's final revision of Circular A-110, which limits public access to research data, does not adequately address concerns. They suggest that access should be based on whether the cited research was integral to developing the regulation, rather than just being cited. NIH proposed restricting access to \"significant scientific findings\" to reduce the burden of FOIA requests on agencies citing numerous research studies in regulations. The final revision of Circular A-110 by OMB limits public access to research data, raising concerns about researchers benefiting from their efforts. Despite some worries, the trend towards increasing public access seems to address these concerns. Senators Shelby, Lott, and Campbell recommended that the public should have access to data in sufficient time. Senators Shelby, Lott, and Campbell recommended that OMB should ensure the public has early access to underlying data before issuing a rule or policy. This includes notifying the public of studies used and processing data requests before the comment period closes. The proposed revision also covers risk assessments and federal reports, allowing the public to review data before it is used in rulemaking. The revisions propose a \"reasonable time\" standard for responding to data requests. Some argue that using FOIA to obtain data for commenting on regulations may not be timely enough. Comment periods for regulations are typically 30, 60, or 90 working days. Agencies must notify requesters within 30 working days if they will comply with a request. Once data is obtained, requesters must analyze it to develop comments. OMB defends the \"reasonable time\" standard for public access to data, considering the circumstances of each case. Section 53 of Circular A-110 requires retention of papers or records related to an award for three years. If data is kept longer, the federal government can still access it. Questions arise about who, the university or researcher, should retain the data. The debate surrounding data custodianship for federally funded research has led to requirements for data management plans. Public access to data is advocated for transparency and accountability in policymaking. As public policy decisions rely more on scientific information, there is a growing need for public scrutiny. Some argue for increased access to research data to enhance public understanding and support for science, while others believe it would ensure confidence in governmental actions. Peer review may not always be sufficient to validate research, especially for findings impacting public policy decisions, particularly when using meta-analysis or research synthesis methods. Some question the techniques and validity of research methods like meta-analysis used in policy analysis. Public skepticism exists towards government representation of scientific findings, citing past instances of misrepresentation in medical experimentation and radiation exposure levels. There are doubts about federal agency findings and policies in areas like science education and genetic engineering. Advocates call for public access to research data for replication. Access to research data is important for replication and verification of findings. Public involvement in the research process is limited, with evaluations typically not involving examination of raw data. Granting agencies perform merit reviews before awarding scientific study grants. The scientific research process involves merit reviews of proposed studies by independent scientists, reporting progress to colleagues, adjusting methodologies based on feedback, preparing results for publication, and evaluating drafts of articles by other scientists. Once published, the scientific community and the public may challenge the findings. The scientific community and the public may challenge research findings, including testing validity through replication by independent researchers. Replication can be challenging for large-scale studies or those using unique data sets. Evaluation of data by others is crucial for judging research validity. Public access to data can enhance research credibility. Public access to research data can lead to alternative evaluations, validating conclusions and detecting errors. However, evaluating data requires expertise, as using inappropriate procedures can lead to false conclusions. Some argue that FOIA exemptions may not adequately protect research data. The final revision to OMB Circular A-110 allows researchers to withhold trade secrets, confidential information, and personnel/medical data from agencies in response to FOIA requests. This revision excludes proprietary information and trade secrets from research data that must be sent to comply with FOIA requests. The final revision to OMB Circular A-110 allows researchers to withhold trade secrets, confidential information, and personnel/medical data from agencies in response to FOIA requests. This is to ensure that public access will not infringe on intellectual property rights protected under the law. The Shelby amendment and Exemption 3 protect trade secrets and confidential business information from public access. Exemption 4 specifically safeguards commercially sensitive data in pending patents. Challenges to information release can be made through reverse FOIA lawsuits. Concerns exist about compromising commercially relevant information in joint university/government/industry partnerships, regardless of funding sources. NAS President Alberts testified on the strict requirements for federally funded researchers to not share data further, highlighting concerns about commercial interests using FOIA requests to obtain university-based research data for competitive advantage. This could discourage independent university research and harm joint research projects with industry partners. Foreign governments could also access federally funded basic research data for their own use. Foreign governments accessing federally funded basic research data for their own R&D raises concerns about protecting university data under FOIA, with exemptions like Exemption 4 being effective in safeguarding scientific and commercial interests. Testimony from legal experts highlights the existing protections under FOIA, court and case law, and agency rules. The exemptions to FOIA, court and case law, agency rules, and special exempting statutes have been effective in protecting privacy and commercial interests. Recommendations have been made to allow private sector participants in federally funded projects to make recommendations on data disclosure. Concerns about conflicts over research interests and volunteer human subjects have not significantly materialized. Many scientific studies involve volunteer human subjects, raising concerns about privacy protection with advancements in information technology. Legislation has been enacted to address inadequate safeguards for personal medical and health information collected during research. FOIA Exemption 6 provides additional privacy protection, but agencies are not required to withhold information covered by exemptions, and courts may prioritize public interest in disclosure over privacy concerns. Some fear that confidential information given to human research subjects could become public due to FOIA exemptions. Concerns also exist about technology enabling subject identification even with personal identifiers removed. NIH Director Varmus noted that FOIA could still allow subject identification through other information like birthplace or occupation. Researchers are concerned about the potential for confidential information given to human research subjects to become public under FOIA exemptions. They also worry about technology enabling subject identification even with personal identifiers removed. The amendment could result in net savings for the public and private sector by preventing agency actions that may not justify their expense. The revision to Circular A-110 and the Shelby amendment aimed to increase public access to research data used in federal actions. This could lead to savings and improved federal actions through public scrutiny and error identification. The amendment also allowed for cost recovery for fulfilling FOIA requests, with reimbursements going to the Treasury. The Circular A-110 revision and Shelby Amendment aimed to increase public access to research data. The revisions allowed agencies to charge fees for obtaining research data, with the fees covering costs incurred by the agency and recipients. The Shelby Amendment did not specify whether fees should go to the agency or the Treasury. Several objections were raised to the reimbursement provisions in the Circular A-110 revision and Shelby Amendment, including concerns about how reimbursement would occur if the agency fulfilling the FOIA request were not the grant-making agency, the potential costs of litigation, and the burden on researchers and universities. Some also feared an expansion of the federal bureaucracy and overhead at research universities to handle FOIA requests. Some concerns were raised about the potential costs of litigation related to the implementation of reimbursement provisions in Circular A-110 revision and Shelby Amendment. It was noted that universities may have to absorb the expenses unless OMB Circular A-21 is revised to allow for reimbursement of full incremental costs. In a letter to OMB, Senators expressed concerns about the broad discretion given to researchers and agency officials in interpreting new exceptions in the final revision of Circular A-21. This could have disastrous consequences for public access to important information, as terms like privacy and confidential business information are subjective. The OMB proposed revision aims to protect privacy in particulate matter epidemiology studies by not releasing raw data, citing FOIA exemptions and case law. Proponents believe it may encourage independent reanalysis of data and more transparency in research findings. The Shelby Amendment was controversial but did not have significant impacts. Increased public access to federally funded research data may have lessened its effects. However, a rise in FOIA requests could bring back concerns about the amendment's influence."
