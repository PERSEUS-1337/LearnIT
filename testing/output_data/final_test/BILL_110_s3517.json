    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prosthetics Parity Act of 2008\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The \"Prosthetics Parity Act of 2008\" findings highlight the significant number of people living with limb loss in the United States, the increasing need for amputation procedures, especially among military personnel, and the importance of prosthetic devices in enabling amputees to lead productive lives. Insurance reimbursement limitations are also noted. Prosthetic parity legislation in 41 states addresses insurance reimbursement limitations for prosthetic equipment costs, reducing reliance on Medicare and Medicaid programs without increasing insurance premiums or government costs. Prosthetic parity legislation in 41 states has led to positive outcomes such as enabling amputees to return to productive lives, saving state funds, and allowing the health insurance industry to prosper. Prosthetic services help individuals quickly resume their preexisting work. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that group health plans offering coverage for prosthetic devices do so on par with other medical benefits. Group health plans must provide coverage for prosthetic devices and components on terms no less favorable than those for other medical benefits under the plan. SEC. 3. PROSTHETICS PARITY. Amends ERISA to include provisions for prosthetics parity. The provision ensures that group health plans offering prosthetic device benefits must provide them under terms no less favorable than other medical benefits and cannot impose separate financial requirements specific to prosthetic benefits. Group health plans must provide prosthetic device benefits under terms no less favorable than other medical benefits, including financial requirements and treatment limitations. Group health plans must provide prosthetic device benefits with in-network and out-of-network coverage separately. This does not require eliminating out-of-network provider options. Additional requirements may include prior authorization. Prior authorization is required for prosthetic devices and components under group health plans. Coverage is limited to the most appropriate device or component model as determined by the treating physician. Benefits for prosthetic devices and components under group health plans include coverage for repair or replacement as determined by the treating physician. Annual or lifetime dollar limitations cannot be imposed unless they apply in the aggregate to all medical and surgical benefits provided. The term 'prosthetic devices and components' includes devices used to replace an arm or leg, as well as services required for this purpose. Financial requirements encompass deductibles, coinsurance, and treatment limitations. Treatment limitations refer to restrictions on the frequency, number of visits, or duration of treatment. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Prosthetics parity is added to the Public Health Service Act, ensuring equal coverage for prosthetic devices. The Public Health Service Act now includes provisions for equal coverage of prosthetic devices under group health plans, ensuring that benefits for prosthetic devices are provided on terms no less favorable than other medical and surgical benefits, and without separate financial requirements specific to prosthetic benefits. The financial and treatment requirements for prosthetic devices under group health plans must be no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. The requirements for prosthetic devices under group health plans must provide in-network and out-of-network benefits separately. This does not mandate the elimination of out-of-network provider options. Additional requirements may include prior authorization. Prior authorization is required for prosthetic devices under group health plans, with coverage limited to the most appropriate device determined by the treating physician. Benefits for prosthetic devices and components under group health plans include coverage for repair or replacement as determined by the treating physician. Annual or lifetime dollar limitations cannot be imposed unless they apply in the aggregate to all medical benefits provided. The term 'prosthetic devices and components' includes devices used to replace an arm or leg, as well as services required for this purpose. Financial requirements encompass deductibles, coinsurance, and treatment limitations such as frequency restrictions. The amendments in this section set limits on treatment frequency, visits, and coverage duration for group health plans. Effective for plan years starting after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will assist enrollees with questions regarding compliance with the new requirements. Random audits of group health plans will be conducted to ensure compliance. A study will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the amendments on health insurance costs and access. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the impact of health insurance coverage, access to in-network providers, quality of care, benefits for prosthetics, and cost implications for group health plans. A report will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. Additionally, the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish regulations within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will promulgate final regulations to implement the Act and its amendments."
