    "content": "This report updates the version issued on September 10, 2001, just prior to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that killed about 3,000 persons. It analyzes Near Eastern terrorist groups and countries on the U.S. \"terrorism list,\" which includes countries providing repeated support for international terrorism. The definition of terrorism used in the report aligns with that of the State Department, focusing on premeditated politically-motivated violence against non-combatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents. Five out of the seven states on the terrorism list are located in the Near East region. The report analyzes Near Eastern terrorist groups and countries on the U.S. \"terrorism list,\" which includes countries providing repeated support for international terrorism. The list consists of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Sudan. The report discusses significant themes in U.S. efforts to combat terrorism in the region, using sources such as the State Department's Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2000 report. The September 11 attacks have placed Near Eastern terrorist groups at the center of U.S. anti-terrorism policy. Near Eastern terrorist groups have been a focus of U.S. counter-terrorism policies for decades. The September 11 attacks, attributed to the Al Qaeda network, were a significant event that led to the defeat of the group in late 2001. Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2000 reported an increase in worldwide terrorism-related casualties to 405 in 2000 from 233 in 1999, with a slight increase in the number of attacks from 392 in 1999 to 423 in 2000. Only 16 attacks and 19 casualties occurred in the Middle East, while 31 attacks and 12 deaths occurred in Eurasia (Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Russia). Terrorist groups analyzed vary in motivations, objectives, ideologies, and levels of activity. The Islamist groups are the most active terrorist groups in the Near East, aiming to overthrow secular, pro-Western governments, disrupt the Arab-Israeli peace process, and remove U.S. forces from the region. Other groups, like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), fight for cultural and political rights or the formation of separate ethnically-based states. The State Department designates 20 Near Eastern groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs), with the list being updated periodically. Al Qaeda, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and two Pakistan groups have been added to the list in recent years. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Lashkar e-Tayyiba, and Jaish e-Mohammad were designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) in 2000 and 2001. Designation blocks assets in the US and criminalizes providing support to these groups. Executive Orders 12947 and 13224 impose financial restrictions on FTOs and individuals named as \"Specially Designated Terrorists.\" Non-compliant foreign banks can be closed down by the US under these orders. The report analyzes the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the debate over its involvement in terrorism. Discussions have focused on whether certain PLO factions should be named as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). The report discusses the removal of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) from the FTO list due to reconciliation with Arafat. It also covers the Abu Sayyaf Group in the Philippines and Pakistani Islamist groups in Kashmir. Additionally, it mentions the redesignation of Jewish extremist groups Kach and Kahane Chai as one group post-October 2001. Since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, radical Islam has gained attention as the driving ideology of many Middle Eastern terrorist groups. Hizballah in Lebanon is debating its future direction after achieving its goal of ousting Israel from southern Lebanon, with some members advocating for a focus on political and social work while others push for continued conflict with Israeli forces. Hizballah continues to engage in military attacks on Israeli forces in the disputed Shib'a farms area, despite Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The group's guerrilla tactics have inspired Palestinian groups in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Despite being certified by the United Nations, Hizballah claims that Israel still occupies Lebanese territory, leading to ongoing conflict. Hizballah has conducted military attacks on Israel, captured soldiers, and provided support to Palestinian groups fighting against Israel. Israel accused Hizballah of serving as an intermediary in the shipment of weaponry from Iran. Hizballah, founded in 1982, aimed to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon. Recent incidents suggest Hizballah's involvement in smuggling weapons to Palestinian militants, sparking concerns in Jordan and Israel. Hizballah, founded in 1982, aimed to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon. During the 1980s, Hizballah sponsored anti-Western terrorism, including attacks on U.S. targets in Beirut. It was involved in suicide truck bombings and hijackings, holding American and Western hostages. In the early 1990s, Hizballah expanded its terrorism activities beyond the Middle East, as seen in Argentina in 1999. Argentina's Supreme Court blamed Hizballah for the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires and issued an arrest warrant for terrorist leader Imad Mughniyah. FBI Director Louis Freeh stated that Hizballah, with Iranian diplomats, was also responsible for the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Jewish Mutual Association building. Argentine investigators charged 20 suspects in the AMIA bombings, with the trial starting in 2001. Hizballah maintains connections with similar groups in the Persian Gulf. Saudi and Bahraini investigations have uncovered local chapters of Hizballah in the Gulf, composed of Shiite Muslims with ties to Iran and Lebanon. Saudi officials suspect Saudi Shiite Muslims, possibly linked to Lebanese Hizballah, were behind the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing. Bahraini authorities also found links to Hizballah in a bomb plot in 1998. Hizballah receives support from Syria and Iran, according to Patterns 1999. Iran and Syria provide significant financial and organizational support to Hizballah. Iran reportedly gives Hizballah around $100 million annually, with 150 Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon coordinating aid. Syria allows Iran to supply weapons to Hizballah through Damascus airport. Key Hizballah members designated as terrorists include Hasan Nasrallah, Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, and Subhi Tufayli. Imad Mughniyah, a former Hizballah intelligence officer, was implicated in the TWA 847 hijacking and the 1996 attack on the U.S. housing complex in Khobar Towers. He was included in a list of entities under Executive Order 13224 in 2001. The Treasury Department seized $283,000 in assets belonging to individuals arrested for smuggling goods to fund Hizballah. Since the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Hamas leaders have increased terrorist attacks against Israelis, including suicide bombings in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have escalated violence, with Hamas claiming responsibility for multiple deadly attacks. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) has conducted several recent suicide bombings in Jerusalem and Haifa, resulting in the deaths of about 25 people. The renewed terrorist activity is believed to be partly due to a breakdown in security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Israel has adopted a controversial policy of assassinating Hamas and PIJ activists to prevent their attacks. Hamas receives funding from various sources, including businesses it runs in Palestinian areas, Iran, private donors in the Gulf monarchies, and Palestinian expatriates. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) conducts fundraising and propaganda activities in Western Europe and North America. PIJ receives funding from state sponsors, especially Iran, and some logistical support from Syria. Hamas, formed in 1987 by Muslim Brotherhood activists, has a spiritual leader, Shaykh Ahmad Yassin, who serves as a bridge between extremists orchestrating terrorist attacks and more moderate elements. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is a Sunni Muslim organization inspired by the Iranian revolution of 1979. Led by Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, PIJ remains a guerrilla organization with no overt component. Hamas and PIJ have not directly targeted the United States, but Americans have died in attacks by these groups. Hamas is characterized by an unknown number of hardcore members and tens of thousands of supporters, while PIJ's strength is unknown. Although Americans have died in attacks by Hamas and PIJ, along with Israelis and the bombers themselves, the bombings in Israel during February - March 1996 had a significant impact on public opinion, leading to Benjamin Netanyahu's election victory as Prime Minister. The two groups have conducted about 80 suicide bombings since 1993, killing over 450 Israelis. The United States blocked assets of alleged Hamas/PIJ leaders following the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles in 1993. Assets totaling about $17,000 belonging to PIJ leader Shallah were blocked. Three financial entities linked to Hamas were designated for increased financial restrictions in 2001. Several Hamas and PIJ activists were named as SDTs, including Hamas founder Shaykh Ahmad Yassin and PIJ leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah. Egyptian security authorities are gaining control over opposition groups like the Islamic Group and Al-Jihad, who have been underground for decades. The defeat of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan could further weaken these groups, which have not carried out large-scale attacks since 1997. The groups have been on the defensive and unpopular due to terrorism. In late 1997, leaders of the Islamic Group and Al-Jihad declared a ceasefire with the Egyptian government. Muhammad Hamza, in operational control of the Islamic Group in Egypt, abided by the truce. Factions of the groups in exile have aligned with Al Qaeda, with some members becoming top lieutenants of bin Laden, including Ayman al-Zawahiri and Abu Hafs Masri. Mohammad Atef, one of bin Laden's top lieutenants, was killed by a U.S. airstrike. Mohammad Atef, a top lieutenant of bin Laden, was killed by a U.S. airstrike during the war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He opposed truce with the Egyptian government and sought to attack U.S. interests. Shaykh Umar Abd al-Rahman was not convicted for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing but for related plots in New York. There were speculations about his relationship with bin Laden during the bombing. Both recruited fighters for the Afghan conflict through organizations like Al Kifah. Abd al-Rahman, also known as Al Kifah, had close connections to the Islamic government of Sudan. His sons were associated with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, with one killed and one captured during the U.S.-led war. The CIA found no evidence of direct assistance to bin Laden or Abd al-Rahman during the Afghan war. The Islamic Group and Al-Jihad, offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood, aim to establish an Islamic state in Egypt. Al-Jihad was behind the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981, while the Islamic Group has carried out attacks on Egyptian officials. The Islamic Group also has a nonviolent arm that operates openly in poor neighborhoods, running social service programs. Al-Jihad operates clandestinely and focuses on militant activities. Al-Jihad operates clandestinely, focusing on assassinations. Egyptian Islamist figures like Shaykh Umar Abd al-Rahman and Ayman al-Zawahiri have been named as SDTs or subject to financial restrictions. Mohammad Atef was apparently killed in the U.S.-led war on Al Qaeda. Abbud al-Zumar is serving a 40-year sentence in Egypt. Al Qaeda, founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden, has evolved into a global threat to U.S. national security. The September 11, 2001 attacks led to a U.S. military campaign against Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, resulting in the ouster of the Taliban regime. Jihadist leaders like Talat Qasim and Muhammad Shawqi Islambouli have been associated with Al Qaeda and its activities. The war in Afghanistan led to the ouster of the Taliban and the capture of Al Qaeda fighters. Bin Laden's fate remains unknown, with conflicting reports on his status. The disruption of Al Qaeda's operations is believed to have occurred, with key members killed or in custody. Some believe that Al Qaeda's network extends beyond Afghanistan and still poses a threat to the US and other targets. The fate of top operatives like Abu Zubaydah and Safl al-Adl is unknown, raising concerns about the group's potential to reconstitute. Bin Laden's coalition of radical Islamic groups aimed at expelling non-Muslim influence from Muslim lands has led Al Qaeda to sponsor fighters against various forces. Al Qaeda's ideology continues to inspire fighters against various forces in different regions, with experts believing it can outlast bin Laden or the organization itself. The backbone of Al Qaeda is the bond among Arab volunteers recruited by bin Laden during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The group was not mentioned in U.S. government reports until Patterns 1993. Several thousand non-Afghan Muslims fought in the war against the Soviets and Afghan Communist government from 1979 to 1992, with many becoming involved in Islamic opposition and terrorism. Al Qaeda may have a presence in up to 60 countries worldwide, varying in scope from Afghanistan to Western and Latin American countries. Some governments are aware of Al Qaeda's presence but may be unwilling or ill-equipped to take action. Al Qaeda activists are linked to opposition movements in the Persian Gulf countries. Al Qaeda has a presence in multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates. They are linked to various affiliate groups such as Egypt's Islamic Group, Algeria's Armed Islamic Group, Abu Sayyaf Organization in the Philippines, and others. Bin Laden followed Dr. Abdullah al-Azzam, who was influential in the founding of both Hamas and Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda, founded by Osama bin Laden, has affiliates in various countries and has been involved in wars and insurgencies in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Kashmir, and other regions. Uighur activists in western China, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, Chechen guerrillas in Azerbaijan, and Abu Sayyaf in Indonesia and Malaysia are said to have ties to Al Qaeda. There are also alleged connections between Al Qaeda and an Azeri Islamist opposition group. Al Qaeda has affiliates in various countries and has been involved in wars and insurgencies in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Kashmir, and other regions. Uighur activists in western China, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, Chechen guerrillas in Azerbaijan, and Abu Sayyaf in Indonesia and Malaysia are said to have ties to Al Qaeda. In Indonesia and Malaysia, an alleged Al Qaeda plot against the U.S. embassy in Singapore was reportedly uncovered in January 2002. There are also alleged connections between Al Qaeda and an Azeri Islamist opposition group. The September 11 attacks revealed that Al Qaeda cells can operate even in countries considered hostile to them, like the United States. Countries worldwide are cooperating to uncover and dismantle these cells. Al Qaeda has been linked to terrorist activities in various countries, including in Europe, Poland, South America, and the U.S. Bin Laden's network has been involved in acts of terrorism prior to 9/11. Bin Laden has claimed responsibility for the December 1992 attempted bombings against U.S. servicemen in Yemen during Operation Restore Hope. He provided weapons to anti-U.S. militias in Somalia and his loyalists fought against U.S. forces there. Al Qaeda's involvement with Somali militias strengthened bin Laden's belief in using terrorism to make the U.S. withdraw from military involvement abroad. In a street battle in Mogadishu in October 1993, 18 U.S. special operations forces were killed by militiamen allegedly supplied by Al Qaeda. The four Saudi nationals confessed to the 1995 bombing in Riyadh, inspired by bin Laden and other radicals. Three were veterans of conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya. Bin Laden's organization may have aided an assassination attempt against Egyptian President Mubarak in Ethiopia. Bin Laden's network was linked to plots in Asia orchestrated by Ramzi Ahmad Yusuf, convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The failed plots in Asia included attempts to assassinate the Pope and President Clinton, bomb embassies, and target trans-Pacific flights. The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people, led to U.S. cruise missile strikes on bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan. The bombings were in response to bin Laden's open threats and involvement in the attacks. In December 1999, U.S. and Jordanian authorities thwarted alleged plots to attack U.S. citizens celebrating the new millennium. The U.S. plot involved bombing Los Angeles airport orchestrated by a pro-bin Laden cell from Canada. Jordan also tried 28 persons planning to attack tourists during millennium festivities, with 15 still at large. Lebanon placed 29 alleged followers of bin Laden under arrest in June 2000. In June 2000, Lebanon placed 29 alleged followers of bin Laden on trial for planning terrorist attacks in Jordan. Al Qaeda cells in Jordan and Lebanon, along with arrests in the West Bank and Gaza, suggest possible terrorism ties to the Palestinian uprising. Reports indicate some Al Qaeda members fled to Lebanon after the U.S. war in Afghanistan, possibly benefiting from the Asbat al-Ansar network. Supporters of bin Laden are suspected in the 2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, killing 17 and injuring 39 Navy personnel. The blast on the U.S.S. Cole killed 17 and injured 39 Navy personnel. There is uncertainty regarding the responsibility for the anthrax mailings that followed September 11, with no arrests made. President Clinton's Executive Order named Al Qaeda as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, banning financial transactions with the group. The Executive Order banned U.S. financial transactions with bin Laden's organization and allowed law enforcement to freeze his assets in the U.S. Bin Laden was named as an SDT along with others. Al Qaeda initially relied on bin Laden's fortune and later became self-sustaining through various sources. Executive Order 13224 in 2001 expanded these measures. Executive Order 13224, issued in September 2001, expanded financial restrictions on Al Qaeda entities and penalized foreign financial entities conducting transactions with them. The Deputy Treasury Secretary reported uncovering and seizing $80 million in Al Qaeda assets worldwide. Additionally, $221 million in Taliban assets were blocked under Executive Order 13129 but later released to the new Afghan interim administration in January 2002. The Armed Islamic Group in Algeria is facing similar pressure. The Islamic Group (GIA) in Algeria is facing pressure similar to Egyptian Islamist groups. The Salafi Group for Call and Combat is now the more active armed group in Algeria, with both groups facing increased financial restrictions linked to Al Qaeda. Some GIA members were involved in a thwarted plot to bomb Los Angeles international airport in December 1999. The GIA is highly fragmented due to a lack of authoritative leadership. The GIA in Algeria, lacking authoritative leadership, has conducted civilian massacres and terrorist attacks since its formation in 1992. Despite regime counter-terrorism efforts, over 100 expatriates have been killed by the GIA. The group aims to intimidate rivals and show government weakness through violence. The GIA, a terrorist group in Algeria, has been responsible for numerous attacks and civilian massacres. Its leaders have been killed in battles with security forces, including the latest leader Antar Zouabri in 2002. The group has also carried out attacks outside Algeria, such as hijacking an Air France flight in 1994 and bombing the Paris subway in 1996. The GIA's strength is estimated to be between several hundred to several thousand members, with support from Algerian expatriates. The organization receives aid from Algerian expatriates in Western Europe and Canada. Three Islamic militant groups based in Pakistan, including Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Lashkar e-Tayyiba, and Jaish e-Mohammad, seek to end Indian control in Kashmir. These groups were designated as foreign terrorist organizations after an attack on India's parliament. Harakat ul-Mujahidin is the largest Pakistani extremist movement. The HUM, a militant Islamist group in Pakistan and Kashmir, was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 1997. It changed its name from Harakat al-Ansar to Harakat ul-Mujahidin to evade sanctions. The group was involved in the kidnapping of Western tourists in 1995 and the hijacking of an Indian airliner in 1999. It is allied with Al Qaeda and focuses on expelling Indian control in Kashmir. The HUM, a militant group in Pakistan and Kashmir, is allied with Al Qaeda but primarily focuses on expelling Indian troops from Kashmir. The leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, signed bin Laden's call for attacks on Americans in 1998. Khalil stepped down in 2000, distancing the group from Al Qaeda. The HUM, a militant group in Pakistan and Kashmir, has been in hiding since October 2001 due to fear of arrest by Pakistan for cooperating with the U.S. in the war on the Taliban. Other Islamist groups in Pakistan that the HUM fights alongside include Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Masood Azhar formed JEM in 2000, which is politically aligned with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the pro-Taliban Islamic Scholars Society party of Pakistan. Pakistan detained Masood Azhar in December 2001 in response to Indian demands to curb Kashmir-related terrorism. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, led by Professor Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, is a prominent militant group in Kashmir, operating through the MDI organization. Saeed was detained by Pakistan in late December 2001 after the attack on India's parliament building. Other groups like Harakat-ul Jihad Islami and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi are also mentioned, with the latter declaring itself an ally of bin Laden and calling for attacks on the United States. The Hizb-ul Mujahedin is an older, more moderate group with few links to bin Laden. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan was designated as a terrorist organization after kidnapping U.S. citizens in Kyrgyzstan. Their goal is to replace the government of Uzbekistan with an Islamic regime and they are believed to be responsible for bombings in Tashkent. The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) led by Namangani and Yuldashev, sought refuge in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Namangani was reportedly killed in the U.S. war against the Taliban in 2001, while Yuldashev's fate remains unknown. The IMU received support from Al Qaeda and other extremist groups in Central Asia. In 1999, Namangani led 800 guerrillas in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a base in Kyrgyzstan for cross-border attacks into Uzbekistan, which included kidnapping Japanese geologists and Kyrgyz soldiers. In early August 2000, 100 guerrillas linked to the IMU seized villages on the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border. The Abu Sayyaf Group, an Islamic separatist organization in the Philippines, is discussed for its ties to Al Qaeda. Led by Khadafi Janjalani, it kidnaps foreign hostages to raise funds for operations. Holding about 12 hostages, some members have trained in Afghanistan. The Abu Sayyaf Group, an Islamic separatist organization in the Philippines, is holding about 12 hostages, including two American citizens. They have expanded their kidnappings into Malaysia and are suspected of shipping weapons to Muslim extremists in Indonesia. The United States is concerned that Al Qaeda fighters fleeing Afghanistan may gather in the Philippines, where approximately 600 U.S. military officers are advising the Filipino military on combating the group. The Islamic Army of Aden, a Yemen-based radical Islamic organization, is not designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization but is subject to financial restrictions. The Islamic Army of Aden in Yemen advocates for Islamic law, opposes Western presence in Yemen, and was involved in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in 2000. The group gained notoriety in 1998 for kidnapping tourists, resulting in casualties during a rescue attempt. The leader, Zein al-Abidine al-Midhar, was executed in 1999. The Yemeni government, led by President Ali Abdullah al-Salih, vowed to eradicate terrorism and denied supporting radical Islamist groups. However, experts believe that the government tolerated Islamic extremists in certain areas. Some government workers had personal ties to individual Islamists. Yemen cooperated in interrogating individuals and making arrests related to the U.S.S. Cole attack, but some U.S. officials were unsatisfied with their level of cooperation. In December 2001, Yemeni forces attacked tribes in central Yemen suspected of harboring associates of bin Laden. Government forces in central Yemen attacked tribes believed to be harboring associates of bin Laden, leading to U.S. requests for military advisory assistance. The former South Yemen was on the U.S. terrorism list for supporting left-wing Arab terrorist groups before merging with North Yemen to form the Republic of Yemen. Some radical Jewish groups, supported by settlers in occupied territories, oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process and have engaged in terrorism. Incidents involving these groups have decreased in recent years. In October 2001, the State Dept. combined Kach and Kahane Chai into a single designation, suggesting they have merged or are closely associated. Kach was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane, while Kahane Chai was founded by his son, Binyamin, after his father's assassination. Both groups seek to expel Arabs from Israel, expand its boundaries, and implement Jewish law. They have organized protests against the Israeli government. The groups Kach and Kahane Chai have organized protests against the Israeli government and threatened Palestinians. They were declared terrorist organizations after supporting an attack in Hebron by Baruch Goldstein, a Kach affiliate. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli extremist shortly after signing an agreement with the Palestinians. Patterns 2000 states that the groups receive support from sympathizers in the US and Europe. Amir and his accomplices, not formal members of Kach or Kahane Chai, share similar ideologies. $200 of Kahane Chai's assets have been blocked since 1995. Some Middle Eastern terrorist groups are guided by Arab nationalism or left-wing ideologies. Left-wing and nationalist groups became less active in the 1980s and 1990s but have reactivated operations since 2000. The PLO renounced terrorism in 1988. The PLO, not designated as an FTO by the State Department, is analyzed in this report due to concerns over its role in preventing terrorist attacks by Hamas and PIJ. The debate has intensified since the Palestinian uprising in 2000, with increased cooperation between Hamas, PIJ, and elements linked to the PLO in attacks against Israel. The Bush Administration has become more critical of the Palestinian Authority. The Bush Administration has increased criticism of the Palestinian Authority following Hamas suicide attacks in Jerusalem and Haifa in December 2001. Israel seized a ship carrying Iranian arms bound for the PA, raising concerns of terrorist attacks or building a military option. PA's cooperation with Israel to disrupt Hamas and PIJ attacks in 2000 was noted, but Israel was dissatisfied with anti-terrorism cooperation after the uprising began. The Bush Administration criticized the Palestinian Authority for lack of anti-terrorism cooperation after the uprising began. Factions of the PLO, including Fatah's Tanzim and Force 17, were accused of encouraging violence against Israel. Some Members of Congress suggested designating these factions as FTOs. Despite some Israelis no longer seeing Arafat as a peace partner, many Palestinians still look to him and the PLO for leadership. Yasir Arafat, born in 1929, used Fatah guerrilla organization to become PLO chairman in 1969. After being forced out of Jordan, attacks on Israel became harder. Arafat limited terrorism mainly to Israel, Lebanon, and occupied territories. Ahmad Jibril formed PFLP-GC in 1968 as a breakaway faction of PFLP, believing in a mix of military and terrorist operations. The PFLP-GC, led by Ahmad Jibril, has a small tank force in Lebanon and fought against Israeli forces alongside Hizballah. Jibril claimed responsibility for a failed weapons shipment to Palestinians in 2001. Syria and Iran provide logistical, military, and financial support to the group. Persistent reports suggest Iranian involvement in the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing. After the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing, there were reports of Iran approaching the PFLP-GC to bomb a U.S. passenger jet in retaliation for the downing of an Iranian passenger airplane by the U.S. Navy. The PFLP-GC initially pursued the operation but may have handed it off to Libya. The PFLP is reviving its attack operations against Israel following the killing of its leader by Israel in 2001. Israel killed PFLP Secretary-General Mustafa with a missile strike in his West Bank office. The United States criticized the killing as excessive force. In retaliation, the PFLP assassinated Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Zeevi. Mustafa's successor, Ahmad Saadat, was later arrested by PA authorities. The PFLP was founded in December 1967 after the Arab defeat in the Six Day War. The PFLP, founded in December 1967 by George Habash, was active in international terrorism during the late 1960s and 1970s. They opposed the Palestinians' decision to join the Madrid peace process and suspended participation in the PLO after the 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles. In August 1999, they held reconciliation talks with Arafat, but refused to send a delegate to the U.S.-brokered summit talks with Israel at Camp David in July 2000. The PFLP, led by George Habash, had been inactive but has conducted car bombings and attacks on Israelis since the latest Palestinian uprising. The group receives support from Syria and has training facilities in Lebanon. The DFLP has also revived operations, claiming attacks on Israeli patrols and settlers, and supporting the Palestinian uprising. The DFLP, formed in 1969 as an offshoot of the PFLP, conducted a notable terrorist attack in 1974. Led by Nayif Hawatmeh, the group abandoned its call for the destruction of Israel in the 1980s. Recent reports estimate the DFLP's total strength to be around 500 members, with possible financial assistance from Syria. The DFLP abandoned its call for the destruction of Israel in the 1980s and began reconciling with Arafat in 1999. The group was removed from the list of FTOs in October 1999 and participated in the U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian final status summit in July 2000. The PLF, a Palestinian group founded in 1976, was dormant for five years until late 2001 when Israel uncovered a 15-member Iraq-trained cell responsible for attacks. The leader, Abu Abbas, had close ties to Arafat and opposed peace with Israel initially but later accommodated to the decision. In 1996, Abbas voted to amend the PLO Charter, and in 1998, Israel allowed him to relocate. The PLF, a Palestinian group founded in 1976, was dormant for five years until late 2001 when Israel uncovered a 15-member Iraq-trained cell responsible for attacks. Abu Abbas, the leader with close ties to Arafat, was allowed to relocate to GazaStrip from Iraq in 1998. The PLF conducted high-profile attacks, including the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, where U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer was murdered. Abu Abbas surrendered to Egyptian forces but was later released by the Italian government. A warrant for his arrest is outstanding in Italy. The Justice Department dropped a U.S. warrant in 1996 due to lack of evidence. Four hijackers were convicted in Italy. The PLF attempted a seaborne landing in Tel Aviv in 1990. Arafat's refusal to condemn the raid led to a break in dialogue with the PLO. Abu Abbas, born in 1948, underwent guerrilla training in the Soviet Union. The Abu Nidal Organization's terrorist threat has decreased due to health issues, internal splits, and clashes with Arafat loyalists. The Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) has decreased its terrorist threat due to internal splits, friction with state sponsors, and clashes with Arafat loyalists. It has a presence in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and reported headquarters in Iraq. The ANO carried out over 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries during the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in about 300 deaths. Notable attacks include the 1985 airport attacks in Rome and Vienna, hijacking of Egypt Air 648, and the 1986 synagogue attack in Istanbul. The group is suspected of assassinating top Arafat aides in Tunis in 1991 and a Jordanian diplomat in Lebanon in 1994. Also known as the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the ANO was created in 1974 by Abu Nidal. Abu Nidal, born in 1937 in Jaffa, broke with the PLO in 1974 over compromise with Israel. He was expelled from Iraq to Syria in 1983, then from Syria to Libya in 1987. After a schism in 1998, he moved to Cairo and later to Iraq. There is no evidence of him reviving his terrorist network. Abu Nidal, born in 1937 in Jaffa, is the only ANO member named an SDT. He is wanted in Britain and Italy, with his aide Nimer Halima arrested in Austria. The PKK, founded in 1974 by Abdullah Ocalan, aims to establish a Marxist Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey but now focuses on cultural and political rights within Turkey. The PKK, founded in 1974 by Abdullah Ocalan, aimed to establish a Marxist Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey but has shifted its focus to greater cultural and political rights within Turkey. The United States considers PKK a terrorist organization but supports a peaceful resolution and urges Turkey to provide more rights to Kurds. Ocalan was expelled from Syria in 1998 and captured by Turkey in 1999, leading to his sentencing to death for treason and murder. In 1999, Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason and murder of 30,000 Turks since 1984. The sentence is pending appeals to the European Court of Human Rights. Ocalan called for a ceasefire in 1999, and PKK violence against the Turkish government has subsided but not ended. The DHKP/C, a Marxist organization opposing Turkey's pro-Western stance, has become more active recently. The DHKP/C, a Marxist organization, has targeted Turkish military and foreign interests since the late 1980s. They have carried out attacks on US military contractors, the US consulate in Istanbul, and Incirlik air base. In 2001, they attacked an Istanbul police station, killing a police officer. The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) is a left-wing group within the National Council of Resistance (NCR) with no ethnic minority composition. The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) is a left-wing group within the National Council of Resistance (NCR) that was formed in the 1960s as an opponent of the Shah's authoritarian rule. In 1981, the PMOI turned against the Islamic revolutionary regime of Ayatollah Khomeini. The group claims to have abandoned its left-wing past and is committed to free markets and democracy, but there are doubts about its sincerity. The PMOI publicly supports the Arab-Israeli peace process and the rights of Iran's minorities. The State Department's mistrust of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) is based on its past activities, including killing U.S. military officers and civilians. The PMOI was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in 1997 for killing civilians in anti-regime operations in Iran. Despite claiming responsibility for high-profile attacks, the group does not target civilians intentionally. In 1999, the State Department named the National Council of Resistance (NCR) as an alias of the PMOI. In response to an Iranian government request, the NCR was named as an alias of the PMOI, subjecting it to FTO-related sanctions. Some supporters of the group were arrested for soliciting donations in violation of FTO regulations. Despite concerns, some Members believe the PMOI deserves U.S. support as an alternative to the current regime in Tehran. The PMOI, led by Masud and Maryam Rajavi, is considered an alternative to the current regime in Iran. U.S. officials have made progress in reducing state sponsorship of terrorism, with five Middle Eastern countries on the terrorism list. Sudan is closest to being removed from the list. Sudan is closest to being removed from the terrorism list, with the State Department working with them to meet requirements. Iran and Syria continue to support terrorist groups despite U.S. efforts. Removal from the list requires notification to relevant committees and a pledge to cease support for terrorism. Iran's sponsorship of terrorist groups hinders its prospects for removal. Iran's sponsorship of terrorist groups is hindering reconciliation between the United States and Iran. The U.S. and Israel alleged that Iran sold arms to the Palestinian Authority, leading to increased concerns about Iran's support for terrorism. President Bush criticized Iran in his 2002 State of the Union address, labeling it as part of an \"axis of evil.\" Iran has been consistently identified as the most active state sponsor of international terrorism. Patterns 2000 report identifies Iran as the most active state sponsor of international terrorism, attributing support to specific institutions controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i. The report suggests President Mohammad Khatemi aims to overcome Iran's terrorist state reputation, despite aligning with hardline positions. Iran is cited as a victim of terrorism due to PMOI attacks. Iran has been accused of supporting terrorist groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process and encouraging attacks on Israel. It has also been accused of sponsoring assassinations and supporting Islamic opposition movements in the Persian Gulf states and Iraq. Despite this, Iran has improved relations with its Gulf neighbors in recent years. Iran has improved relations with Gulf neighbors and reduced support for opposition movements. The Department of Justice indicted 14 people in connection with the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, with Iranian involvement suspected. Eleven suspects are in custody in Saudi Arabia, with no extradition to the US planned. Syria supports the U.S. war on terrorism but also hosts terrorist groups, justifying them as resistance movements against Israeli occupation. The U.S. has been critical of Syria, with hopes fading for improved relations under President Bashar al-Assad. Patterns 2000 report criticized Syria for allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to operate in Damascus and not stopping attacks against Israel. Syria also facilitated Iran's support for Hizballah and opposed disarmament efforts by U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. Syria provides sanctuary to non-Islamist Palestinian groups and exercises influence over Lebanon. Asbat al-Ansar, linked to Al Qaeda, operates in Lebanon but has no apparent government approval. Syria upholds its pledge to Turkey not to support the PKK, possibly out of fear of Turkish retaliation. Syria maintains ban on attacks from its territory and against Western targets. Despite being on the terrorism list, the US has normal relations with Syria, exchanging ambassadors and allowing non-military trade and investment. The Pan Am 103 bombing issue continues to impact US policy towards Libya. Reports suggest the Bush Administration may consider easing sanctions on Libya. The Bush Administration may consider easing sanctions on Libya, including removing it from the terrorism list, if Pan Am 103 issues are resolved. Experts believe Libya has reduced its ties with terrorist groups, expelled Abu Nidal, and shown support for Yasir Arafat. Despite uncertainties about Libya's intentions, the US began diplomatic meetings in 1999 and modified trade bans to allow food and medicine exports. Libya's distancing from its \"terrorist past\" is uncertain if it signifies a true policy change. The Pan Am 103 attack in 1988 led to U.N. resolutions urging Libya to hand over suspects and resolve related cases. Sanctions were suspended in 1999 upon the handover of the suspects. The trial of al-Megrahi and Fhimah began in the Netherlands in 2000, with Megrahi convicted and Fhimah acquitted in 2001. The conviction reinforced the belief that Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi had foreknowledge of the bombing. President Bush maintained sanctions on Libya and opposed lifting U.N. sanctions until Libya accepts responsibility for the act. The U.S. opposes permanently lifting U.N. sanctions on Libya until it accepts responsibility for the bombing, compensates victims' families, renounces terrorism support, and discloses all information about the plot. There is no evidence of Libya supporting Al Qaeda, and it has cooperated with the U.S. on terrorism issues. Libya has tried to appear cooperative in resolving past acts of terrorism, including compensating victims' families and restoring diplomatic relations with Britain. Libya has attempted to mediate conflicts in Africa and improve its international image. However, there are concerns that Libya is seeking to expand its influence rather than promote peace. The US has not lifted restrictions on travel to Libya, and Sudan is facing criticism for its actions against rebels. Sudan has shown cooperation with the US in investigating Al Qaeda and the September 11 attacks, leading to the lifting of UN sanctions in 2001. The country has also taken steps to address concerns about its support for terrorism, including handing over a terrorist to France in 1994 and sidelining a leading Islamist figure in 1999. Sudan's ties to various Islamic movements led to its placement on the terrorism list in 1993. By the end of 2000, Sudan had signed all 12 international conventions on combating terrorism and resolved issues related to compliance with Security Council resolutions. The Bush Administration concluded that Sudan has ended its support for terrorists involved in a bomb plot. The United States has increased engagement with Sudan on terrorism, including sending counter-terrorism experts and appointing a U.S. envoy. Some Sudanese still harbor resentment towards the United States. The United States destroyed the al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum in 1998, leading to lingering resentment among some Sudanese. The Clinton Administration justified the strike, but critics argued the plant was a legitimate pharmaceutical factory with no ties to chemical weapons. The plant owner's assets were unfrozen in 1999, suggesting a mistake. U.S.-Iraq differences over Iraq's regional ambitions and compliance with ceasefire requirements may keep Iraq on the terrorism list. Iraq's compliance with post-Gulf war ceasefire requirements and its human rights record are poor, leading to its inclusion on the terrorism list. Despite lack of hard evidence linking Iraq to the September 11 attacks, some U.S. officials want to expand the \"war on terror\" to Iraq. International pressure has constrained Iraq's ability to use terrorism, but it continues to plan and sponsor international terrorism. Iraq continues to plan and sponsor international terrorism, targeting anti-regime opposition, those responsible for past defeats, and bodies implementing sanctions. Recent CIA judgments suggest Iraq's terrorism policy aligns with these activities. The CIA has no evidence of Iraq planning anti-U.S. terrorism since a failed assassination plot in 1993. There is no indication that Iraq has provided chemical or biological weapons to terrorist groups. In October 1998, Iraqi agents allegedly planned to attack Radio Free Iraq in Prague. In October 1998, Iraqi agents allegedly planned to attack the Prague-based Radio Free Iraq service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, although no attack occurred. Czech officials say an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague met with September 11 lead hijacker Muhammad Atta in early 2001, reportedly to discuss an attack on the radio facility. Iraq has close ties to Yasir Arafat and supports anti-peace process Palestinian groups. Iraq hosts various militant groups and provides some support to the PMOI's army, the National Liberation Army (NLA), near the border with Iran. However, Iraq has reduced support for the group in recent years as its relations with Tehran have improved. Prior to September 11, there was little agreement on countering terrorism threats. The success of the US military campaign in Afghanistan has led to wider acceptance of military force. Cooperation with US efforts is crucial for continued success against terrorist groups. Diplomatic efforts are also considered important by some experts. Some experts believe diplomatic engagement with state sponsors and addressing terrorists' grievances could be more effective in the long term. The US is incorporating greater engagement into its policy framework while still refusing to make concessions to terrorists. The success of the US military against the Taliban in Afghanistan is highlighted as a key theme in efforts to reduce terrorism threats. The success of the US military against the Taliban in Afghanistan has validated the use of military force against terrorism. Many governments are now taking action against terrorist groups in their countries, fearing potential military intervention. Military action in Afghanistan has disrupted Al Qaeda's operations, but skeptics argue that the situation there is unique and not easily replicated elsewhere. US officials suggest that future campaigns against Al Qaeda may involve military advisers assisting governments in destroying terrorist sanctuaries. The US military conducted retaliatory attacks against Libya and Iraq for sponsoring terrorist acts, including the bombing of a Berlin nightclub in 1986 and an assassination plot against former President George Bush in 1993. The use of military force against terrorism was validated by the success in Afghanistan, leading to the possibility of future campaigns with military advisers assisting in destroying terrorist sanctuaries. The 1998 U.S. cruise missile strikes targeted the bin Laden network in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. The effectiveness of U.S. military action against terrorist groups or state sponsors is uncertain. Iraq has avoided attacking high-profile U.S. targets since 1993 but continues to challenge the U.S. on issues related to its invasion of Kuwait. The 1998 airstrikes did not lead the Taliban to extradite bin Laden or deter his network from further activities. The United States has applied economic sanctions against state sponsors of terrorism in an effort to pressure them to expel terrorist groups. Analysts doubt the effectiveness of unilateral U.S. sanctions in changing the behavior of these states. While major U.S. allies did not join a trade ban on Iran in 1995, Middle Eastern states on the terrorism list have protested their inclusion, suggesting some political and economic impact. U.S. officials claim that sanctions have made some state sponsors of terrorism \"think twice.\" The Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would allow commercial sales of U.S. food and medical products to Libya, Sudan, and Iran on a case-by-case basis to reward improvements in behavior. Countries on the terrorism list face various U.S. economic sanctions, including bans on foreign aid and sales of certain items. The United States imposes strict licensing requirements on sales to countries on the terrorism list, prohibiting exports of items with military applications. U.S. trade bans have been imposed on most Middle Eastern terrorism list states, except Syria. Foreign aid appropriations bills since the late 1980s have barred assistance to terrorism list countries. The U.S. also maintains leverage by blocking some assets of terrorism list states and groups. The US imposes strict licensing requirements on sales to countries on the terrorism list, prohibiting exports of items with military applications. U.S. trade bans have been imposed on most Middle Eastern terrorism list states, except Syria. Foreign aid appropriations bills since the late 1980s have barred assistance to terrorism list countries. The US also maintains leverage by blocking some assets of terrorism list states and groups. Some US sanctions are \"secondary sanctions,\" penalizing countries that aid terrorism list countries. The Anti-Terrorism Act created a \"Non-Cooperating List\" for states not cooperating with US anti-terrorism efforts, barring them from sales of US Munitions List items. The Anti-Terrorism Act created a \"Non-Cooperating List\" for states not cooperating with US anti-terrorism efforts, barring them from sales of US Munitions List items. Afghanistan and seven terrorism list countries have been designated as not cooperating since 1997. President Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 39 in 1995 to enable US law enforcement authorities to capture suspected terrorists by force from foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in their extradition. The Clinton Administration rejected recommendations to place US allies on the \"Non-Cooperating List.\" The National Commission on Terrorism recommended placing Afghanistan on the terrorism list due to the Taliban's harboring of bin Laden. President Clinton imposed sanctions on the Taliban, including a ban on U.S. trade and freezing Taliban assets in the U.S. Greece and Pakistan were also named as not fully cooperating with anti-terrorism efforts. The Commission on Terrorism recommended naming Greece and Pakistan as not fully cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts. Despite this, the Clinton Administration rejected the recommendations. Pakistan and Lebanon were potential candidates for the terrorism list in Patterns 2000, but were also credited with anti-terrorism cooperation in selected cases. After the September 11 attacks, Pakistan aligned itself with the U.S. war effort, leading to praise from the United States, lifting of sanctions, and new foreign assistance programs. The U.S. also sought multilateral sanctions against Middle Eastern terrorism. The United States and Russia collaborated to impose international sanctions on Libya, Sudan, and the Taliban for supporting terrorism. U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1333 were adopted to freeze assets and ban flights of the Taliban. This multilateral approach aimed to combat terrorism effectively. The United States imposed an international arms embargo on the Taliban, not on opposition factions, following U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1267 and 1333. Despite counter-terrorism cooperation with friendly countries, the Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden. The U.S. provided military assistance to Lebanon to contain Hizballah and non-lethal aid to Palestinian Authority security forces against Hamas and PIJ. The United States expanded counter-terrorism dialogue with Russia and Central Asian states against Islamic militant groups linked to Al Qaeda. Countries aligned with the U.S. in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. State Department hosted annual conferences focusing on combating terrorism threat from Afghanistan, resulting in agreements to exchange information and improve counterterrorist efforts. U.S. provided detection equipment and financial assistance to Central Asian states to prevent terrorism. The United States provided financial assistance to Central Asian states to prevent smuggling of nuclear material to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. This led to the detection and seizure of radioactive material bound for Pakistan. The US also worked with the EU to pressure Iran to stop sponsoring terrorism, resulting in a pledge for increased cooperation against Iranian terrorism. EU countries agreed on a non-legally binding \"code of conduct\" to limit arms sales to states supporting terrorism. The United States prioritizes cooperation against terrorism fundraising, particularly in Middle Eastern countries where Al Qaeda fundraising occurs. The US engages with state sponsors to incentivize them to reduce support for terrorism. The United States engages in bilateral dialogue with most Middle Eastern terrorism list countries, except Iran and Iraq. Iran refuses dialogue due to perceived hostile U.S. policies, while Iraq's request for talks is rejected due to non-compliance with Gulf war-related requirements. Legal action against terrorist groups and state sponsors is a priority. Legal action against terrorist groups and state sponsors is a key component of U.S. counter-terrorism strategy. The Bush Administration chose international legal action over military retaliation in cases like the Pan Am 103 bombing and the Khobar Towers bombing. The United States plans to try captured Al Qaeda fighters, with Congress working to provide legal options for victims of international terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 created an exception to Foreign Sovereign Immunity, allowing victims of terrorism to sue state sponsors. U.S. courts have awarded multimillion dollar compensations to victims of terrorism sponsored by Iran, with the Clinton Administration using general revenues to pay damages and seeking to recoup funds from Iran. The \"Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act\" was included in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The Clinton and Bush Administrations opposed tapping frozen Iranian assets in the US, citing diplomatic sovereignty concerns. The September 11 attacks highlighted the US's vulnerability to Middle Eastern terrorism, while the anthrax mailings in October-November 2002 exposed further vulnerabilities. The September 11 attacks led to increased law enforcement scrutiny of Islamic networks in the US, with concerns about fundraising for Middle East terrorism. Some believe terrorist groups like Al Qaeda have political networks in the US, operating from religious and research institutions. Security measures are debated to uncover potential Al Qaeda cells, while others argue that most American Muslims oppose violence and donate for humanitarian purposes. Some U.S. domestic counter-terrorism efforts post-September 11 have faced criticism for excessive intrusions on civil liberties, particularly regarding immigration and investigative powers. Arab-American and American Muslim organizations have complained about unfair suspicion towards individuals of Arab descent, citing erroneous accusations linking Islamic extremists to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995."
