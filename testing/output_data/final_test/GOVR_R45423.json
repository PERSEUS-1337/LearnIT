    "content": "President Donald J. Trump signed the SUPPORT Act into law on October 24, 2018, in response to the growing concern over rising opioid overdose deaths in the United States. The bill was approved by the House 393-8 and the Senate 98-1, reflecting bipartisan support for addressing the epidemic. Opioid-related deaths have increased significantly over the past 15 years, with an estimated 49,068 deaths in 2017 alone. The SUPPORT Act aims to prevent substance use disorders and promote recovery and treatment for patients and communities affected by opioids. The SUPPORT Act, signed into law by President Trump, addresses the opioid epidemic in the US through tighter oversight of opioid production and distribution, additional reporting and safeguards against fraud, and limits on prescription opioids coverage. It also expands access to opioid addiction treatment services and authorizes programs for consumer education and provider training. The legislation includes various changes affecting direct spending and revenues. The SUPPORT Act, signed into law by President Trump, aims to address the opioid epidemic in the US through tighter oversight of opioid production and distribution, additional reporting and safeguards against fraud, and limits on prescription opioids coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the SUPPORT Act would increase the on-budget deficit by $1,001 million over five years but reduce it by $52 million over 10 years. The legislation excludes budgetary effects from PAYGO scorecards, preventing possible sequestration. The SUPPORT Act builds on previous legislation like CARA and the Cures Act to address the opioid epidemic through public health, law enforcement strategies, and medical innovation. It includes provisions for combating opioid addiction and mental health issues. The SUPPORT Act builds on previous legislation like CARA and the Cures Act to address the opioid epidemic through public health, law enforcement strategies, and medical innovation. It includes provisions for combating opioid addiction and mental health issues. The SUPPORT Act consists of eight titles, including Title VII - Public Health Provisions and Title VIII - Miscellaneous. Title VII aims to improve information collection on opioid abuse. The SUPPORT Act includes provisions to improve information collection on opioid abuse, increase access to treatment, and support treatment programs and providers. Title VIII covers miscellaneous provisions related to child welfare, the Department of Justice, and drug testing by the Department of Transportation. The report summarizes the budget effects of the act and describes Section 4003, an offset related to religious exemptions from health insurance coverage. The appendix lists deadlines, effective dates, and reporting requirements. The SUPPORT Act, enacted on October 24, 2018, focuses on opioid-related overdose deaths, particularly due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl. There are two types of fentanyl - pharmaceutical and illicit. Pharmaceutical fentanyl is a Schedule II narcotic used for severe pain, while illicit fentanyl is used illegally as a recreational drug. Illicit fentanyl, a nonpharmaceutical form diverted from legitimate use, is a major contributor to fentanyl-related overdoses. The SUPPORT Act mandates a report on the health effects of new psychoactive substances, including synthetic drugs like fentanyl analogues, to be submitted within three years of enactment. The PHSA Section 546 requires grants to train first responders in administering FDA approved drugs for opioid overdose. Grants also cover technical assistance, urban and rural areas, and program evaluation. $12 million was authorized for FY2017-FY2021, with SAMHSA awarding 21 cooperative agreements in FY2017. Section 7002 allows grant funds for training first responders. The amendment to PHSA Section 546 allows grant funds to train first responders and key community sectors on safety around dangerous drugs like fentanyl. It also provides technical assistance for better protection. The annual authorization of appropriations is increased from $12 million to $36 million for FY2019 through FY2023. Key community sectors are defined as SUD treatment providers and emergency medical service agencies. Public health laboratories monitor health threats like infectious diseases, contaminants, and bioterrorism agents. Forensic laboratories assist with crime investigations. Federal agencies provide support to state and local labs. Section 7011 mandates grants to improve detection of synthetic opioids. The Secretary, in consultation with federal agencies, must develop best practices for synthetic opioid testing, reference materials, and quality control standards. Laboratories receiving grants must follow these practices and cooperate with law enforcement and public health authorities. $15 million is authorized for FY2019 through FY2023 for this purpose. Section 7021 establishes a new PHSA Section 1711 for a Substance Use Disorder Information Dashboard, requiring the Secretary of HHS to create and maintain a public dashboard in consultation with the ONDCP. This dashboard will coordinate HHS efforts on prevention and treatment strategies for reducing opioid abuse. The provision establishes a Substance Use Disorder Information Dashboard to coordinate HHS actions on prevention and treatment strategies for reducing opioid and other substance use disorders. It includes links to HHS programs, access to data sources, information on prevention and treatment strategies in different regions, alternatives to controlled substances for pain management, and guidelines for healthcare providers. The Secretary must establish the dashboard within six months of enactment. No formalized interagency body currently exists to coordinate federal activities in this area. CARA established the Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force to identify gaps in pain management practices. Section 7022 requires the establishment of an Interdepartmental Substance Use Disorder Coordinating Committee to improve coordination for substance use disorders. The Interdepartmental Substance Use Disorder Coordinating Committee, established by CARA, is chaired by the Secretary and includes federal and nonfederal members to improve coordination and make recommendations for SUD-related federal programs. Federal members consist of Cabinet officials and representatives from various agencies, while nonfederal members include public representatives, SUD treatment professionals, and public safety personnel. The Interdepartmental Substance Use Disorder Coordinating Committee, established by CARA, includes federal and nonfederal members to improve coordination for SUD-related federal programs. Nonfederal committee members serve three-year terms, publish annual reports on the HHS website, and may establish working groups. The committee will terminate six years after establishment and is subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. HHS's Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion develops HealthyPeople.gov to improve the health of the U.S. population. The current version, Healthy People 2020, includes measures to track and reduce substance use and rates of substance abuse as measured through progress on a number of objectives. SAMHSA tracks its programs to measure effectiveness relative to measures developed in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 and goals included in HHS's strategic plan. The President's Commission on Combating Addiction and the Opioid Crisis noted the challenge of measuring progress on addressing opioid misuse and abuse due to the lack of opioid-specific measures. The President's Commission on Combating Addiction and the Opioid Crisis highlighted the need to strengthen data collection activities to measure progress in addressing opioid misuse and abuse. Section 7023 requires the development of national indicators to measure success in curtailing the opioid epidemic, including milestones to track progress in reversing opioid abuse and related morbidity and mortality in the United States. The Secretary is required to identify these milestones within 180 days of enactment. The provision mandates the development of national indicators to measure success in addressing the opioid epidemic, including milestones to track progress in reversing opioid abuse and related morbidity and mortality. The Secretary must identify these milestones within 180 days of enactment, set a reasonable goal to achieve within five years, and provide annual progress reports. Extensions to the timeline for meeting goals are allowed if necessary. The Secretary must identify milestones to track progress in reversing opioid abuse within 180 days of enactment. Reports on the impact of laws limiting opioid prescriptions must be submitted to Congress within two years. SAMHSA defines substance use recovery housing as a safe environment promoting recovery. Recovery housing promotes recovery from substance use disorders in a safe, sober environment. Regulation varies by state, with no federal standards currently in place. A new provision requires the Secretary to develop best practices for operating recovery housing, involving consultation with various entities. The provision requires the Secretary to identify indicators for fraudulent recovery housing operators and disseminate best practices to state agencies, tribal organizations, and the public. Consultation with specified entities is required to ensure recovery housing supports recovery and improves access to treatment. The provision authorizes $3 million for FY2019-FY2021 for unique research initiatives under the Cures Act. OT authority allows NIH to fund R&D through transactions other than contracts or grants. OT is used by certain federal agencies to obtain cutting-edge R&D from commercial sources. The Cures Act added OT authority under a new PHSA Section 402(n) for unique research initiatives funded by NIH, including the Precision Medicine Initiative and other important areas of research. This authority allows NIH to obtain leading-edge R&D from commercial sources through transactions other than contracts or grants. Examples of important areas include emerging scientific opportunities, public health challenges, and knowledge gaps. PHSA Section 402(n) requires internal NIH reporting on the use of this authority. The Cures Act added OT authority under PHSA Section 402(n) for unique research initiatives funded by NIH, allowing the Director to carry out high-impact research. The Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) was established to coordinate efforts related to pain within HHS and other federal agencies. The Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) is responsible for coordinating pain research efforts within HHS and federal agencies. It includes members from federal agencies, nonfederal scientists, physicians, and health professionals. The IPRCC meets annually to summarize research advances, identify gaps, prevent duplication of research, recommend dissemination of information, and expand partnerships for collaborative research. Section 7042 amends the duties of the IPRCC under PHSA 409J(b). Section 7042 amends the duties of the IPRCC under PHSA 409J(b) by requiring the inclusion of best practices for alternative pain management therapies in its research summary. It also specifies gaps in research on biomarkers, screening models for pain epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute and chronic pain, as well as risk factors for substance use disorders in populations with pain. The IPRCC must make recommendations to the NIH Director on disseminating pain care information and epidemiological data. Section 7042 of the Public Health Service Act amends the duties of the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) by including best practices for alternative pain management therapies in its research summary. It also addresses gaps in research on biomarkers, screening models for pain epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and management of acute and chronic pain, as well as risk factors for substance use disorders in populations with pain. The Secretary is required to ensure that recommendations and actions taken by the NIH Director on these topics are included in reports to Congress. Federal regulations protect the privacy of patient records at federally assisted alcohol and drug treatment programs under 42 C.F.R. Part 2. Section 7051 of the Public Health Service Act requires the Secretary to identify best practices for displaying a patient's history of OUD in the medical record only at the patient's request. This information should be disseminated to healthcare providers and state agencies, considering various factors. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows health care providers to disclose protected health information to individuals involved in a patient's care if the patient does not object or if it is inferred they would not object. If the patient objects, providers cannot share PHI with caregivers unless in emergency circumstances. The HIPAA Privacy Rule allows health care providers to disclose protected health information to individuals involved in a patient's care in emergency circumstances. HHS released guidance on sharing mental health information and updated guidance on responding to the opioid crisis. The Part 2 Rule protects patient records at federally assisted alcohol and drug treatment programs. The Part 2 regulations protect patient records at alcohol and drug treatment programs, restricting disclosure without patient consent. Recent amendments aim to align Part 2 with HIPAA for better information exchange. Cures Section 11004 mandates further changes for data disclosure. Section 11004 of Cures Act requires the Secretary to develop model programs for training on permitted uses of PHI for mental health and substance use disorders. Section 7052 mandates annual notification of permitted disclosures of health information during emergencies to family, caregivers, and providers, utilizing the model training programs developed under Section 11004. Section 7053 of the Cures Act requires the Secretary to identify model programs and materials for training healthcare providers on information disclosures and educating families and patients on their rights under 42 C.F.R. Part 2. $4 million is authorized for FY2019, with decreasing amounts for subsequent years. The prevalence of pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD) at delivery has increased in the United States, with the rate of OUD cases among women delivering in hospitals quadrupling from 1999 to 2014. Infants born to women with OUDs are at risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), where newborns experience withdrawal after being exposed to drugs in the womb. Section 7061 of the Cures Act requires the Secretary to submit a report on opioid use disorder. The Secretary is required to submit a report on opioid use during and after pregnancy to congressional committees within 18 months. This is in coordination with HHS agencies and does not involve additional appropriations. The Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015 mandated a review of HHS planning on prenatal opioid use, including NAS, with a strategy to address research gaps and federal program issues. Another section required a study on preventing and treating prenatal OUDs. The Secretary submitted a report in response to requirements on preventing and treating prenatal OUDs, outlining a strategy to address gaps and recommendations. HHS released a follow-up report in June 2017, detailing steps to implement the recommendations, contingent upon funding. The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) promotes community-based treatment and recovery services for substance use disorder. Grants are awarded to public and nonprofit entities through the Residential Treatment for Pregnant and Postpartum grant program to provide medical services for pregnant and postpartum women (PPW) and their infants. State substance abuse agencies receive competitive grants under the Treatment for PPW state pilot grant program to support family-based services and a coordinated state system for PPW with substance use disorder. The PHSA Section 508 authorizes funding for programs to deliver care to pregnant and postpartum women with substance use disorder. The funding levels for FY2018 were $29.9 million, and for FY2019 through FY2023, it is authorized at $29.9 million each year. The Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention is responsible for improving behavioral health through evidence-based prevention approaches. The Director of CSAP is responsible for evidence-based prevention approaches. PHSA Section 515(b) does not require activities for pregnant women and infants, while Section 507(b) mandates activities for pregnant women and infants by the Director of CSAT. Amendments require the development of educational materials on pain management and SUD prevention during pregnancy, and the implementation of recommendations from the Final Strategy. The Final Strategy recommends educating pregnant women and healthcare providers about substance use disorders (SUDs). The Secretary is required to collect data, provide public information on cessation programs, and award grants to entities for prevention efforts. Funding was authorized for FY2001 through FY2005. Section 7064 amends PHSA Section 317L to require the CDC Director to collect data on prenatal substance abuse and misuse, NAS, and maternal and child health outcomes. It also mandates examining long-term outcomes, assessing treatment programs, and issuing public reports. The term \"illegal drug use\" is replaced with \"substance abuse and misuse.\" Section 317L of the Public Health Service Act is amended to address prenatal substance abuse and misuse, NAS, and maternal and child health outcomes. The Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance, ensure data sharing, and coordinate with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Section 7064 authorizes funding for these activities from FY2019 through FY2023 under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Funding for research, technical assistance, and demonstration projects related to infants affected by substance abuse or Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is authorized under Section 112 of CAPTA and administered by the Children's Bureau within HHS's Administration for Children and Families. States receiving CAPTA formula grants must have policies for substance-exposed infants, including notifying child protective services and developing a \"plan of safe care.\" Congress revised and strengthened the requirement for a plan of safe care for opioid-exposed infants with NAS under CAPTA. CARA clarified that the plan should ensure the safety and well-being of the infant post-healthcare, including addressing SUD treatment needs. States were directed to monitor the implementation of these plans, with many initially struggling to comply. A 2018 GAO report highlighted the need for additional guidance for states to overcome challenges in implementing plans of safe care. The FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations included $85 million for CAPTA state grants, with $60 million intended for developing plans of safe care. The Secretary is directed to provide technical assistance on best practices and evaluate states' work on plans of safe care. Section 7065(a) authorizes grants to facilitate collaboration among various agencies in implementing and monitoring plans of safe care. The section outlines the distribution and use of funds for developing safe care plans for substance-exposed infants. It includes application requirements, data reporting, and duties of the Secretary. Permissible uses of funds include improving systems, training providers, and establishing partnerships. The Secretary must submit annual reports to congressional committees based on state-reported data and provide recommendations on challenges and successes. The Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988 responded to concerns about infants born with exposure to HIV and drugs due to parental drug use. Funding for local projects to prevent infant abandonment was last provided in FY2015. The act is repealed, and the Secretary's authority to award grants under the plan of safe care grant program sunsets on September 30, 2023. The federal government supports health workforce programs administered by HHS's HRSA, including the NHSC providing scholarships and loan repayment for health care providers in HPSAs. Eligible providers include psychiatrists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, health service psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, and marriage and family therapists. The NHSC loan repayment program is available for psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, psychiatric nurse specialists, marriage and family therapists, and licensed professional counselors. The program offers scholarships covering attendance and living expenses, with repayment awards of $30,000 for a two-year commitment and $50,000 for sites in shortage areas. Expansion in 2018 includes physician assistants and SUD counselors, with higher repayment awards of $75,000 for three years of service. Section 7071 establishes a new loan repayment program for the Substance Use Disorder Treatment Workforce. The Secretary, through the HRSA Administrator, is creating a new loan repayment program for SUD treatment providers in mental health HPSAs or high overdose death areas. This program expands eligibility to a wider range of behavioral health providers and allows service at non-NHSC sites. Participants commit to a minimum of two years and receive one-sixth of their loan balance, up to $250,000, for a six-year commitment. The loan repayment program for Substance Use Disorder treatment providers allows for a maximum repayment amount of $250,000. It specifies eligible loans, penalties for breaching agreements, and permits additional criteria as needed. An appropriation of $25 million is authorized annually from FY2019 to FY2023. Providers can fulfill service commitments in out-patient facilities, including school-based health centers. Section 7072 of the PHSA allows NHSC scholarship and loan repayment recipients to provide behavioral or mental health services in schools or community-based settings located in HPSAs. This time can count towards their service commitment, with the Secretary able to limit the number of hours in alternate settings counting towards the commitment. This change is authorized under PHSA Section 759. The NHSC program authorized funding for training health professionals in pain care, covering topics such as assessment, treatment, laws on controlled substances, interdisciplinary approaches, barriers to care, and recent developments. Despite authorization from FY2010 to FY2012, no funds were appropriated, and the program was never implemented. The Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET) Program, authorized by PHSA Section 756, provides grants for training the behavioral health workforce, including paraprofessionals. The program was funded at $75 million annually in FY2018 and FY2019. Additionally, Section 7073 amended PHSA Section 759 to include tribal health programs as eligible entities for pain care grants, with a focus on nonaddictive and nonpharmacological pain treatment methods and opioid abuse prevention. The section authorizes funding for opioid abuse treatment programs and extends the Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training program's authorization through FY2023. SAMHSA collects data on substance use-related emergency department visits but does not typically fund treatment protocols. In 2018, SAMHSA awarded funds for improving access to overdose treatment. The program awarded funds to opioid treatment programs or providers with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to expand access to FDA-approved drugs for emergency opioid overdose treatment. Grantees partnered with community providers to develop best practices for prescribing overdose reversal drugs and train other prescribers. Section 7081 mandates competitive grants to develop best practices for emergency overdose treatment, recovery coaching, care coordination, and treatment referrals after a nonfatal drug overdose. Entities eligible for a grant must apply to the Secretary for funds to provide treatment and referrals for individuals after a nonfatal drug overdose, as well as overdose reversal medication. The grant program has specific requirements, preferences, and reporting obligations. Federal and state privacy laws apply to data requirements, and $10 million is authorized for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023. The NIH is implementing the HEAL initiative with a $10 million appropriation for FY2019-FY2023 to research nonaddictive pain treatments. Section 7091 mandates a demonstration program awarding grants to hospitals and emergency departments for opioid alternatives in pain management. The section mandates a demonstration program awarding grants to hospitals and emergency departments for opioid alternatives in pain management. Grantees must adhere to specified program elements in accordance with federal and state privacy requirements. The Secretary must ensure a geographic distribution of grantees and may implement a similar program for acute care settings. Grant recipients are encouraged to share best practices and consult with experts in opioid alternative programs. The Secretary is tasked with identifying best practices, providing technical assistance, and promoting consultation with hospitals and acute care settings. Section 7101 of the PHSA creates Regional Centers of Excellence in Substance Use Disorder Education, authorizing an appropriation of $10 million for FY2019 through FY2021. HRSA programs support training for SUD treatment providers and aim to increase diversity in the healthcare workforce. The new program focuses on educating eligible entities in substance use disorder education. The PHSA authorizes cooperative agreements for Regional Centers of Excellence in Substance Use Disorder Education to improve health professional training in SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery. $4 million is authorized for each FY2019 through FY2023. HHS and the Department of Education do not have a grant program specifically targeting SUD interventions in schools. Other grant programs may support similar activities but are not explicitly authorized for substance use prevention and treatment efforts, including those for children affected by the opioid epidemic. The PHSA authorizes cooperative agreements for Regional Centers of Excellence in Substance Use Disorder Education to improve health professional training in SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery. $4 million is authorized for each FY2019 through FY2023. HHS and the Department of Education do not have a grant program specifically targeting SUD interventions in schools. PHSA Section 514 establishes a grant program within SAMHSA's CSAT for SUD screening and treatment for children and adolescents, and related assistance to pregnant women and mothers. Section 7102(c) requires the Secretary to administer a youth prevention and recovery initiative to provide support for communities to prevent, treat, and recover from SUDs. The provision authorizes grants for evidence-based SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery programs for children, adolescents, and young adults. It outlines program eligibility, evaluation requirements, and reporting guidelines for grantees. The Secretary must identify best practices for substance abuse prevention in specified populations, including prevention, MAT, and effective strategies. The Secretary is required to disseminate best practices for substance abuse prevention to specified entities and establish a resource center for technical support. $10 million is authorized for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023. The program focuses on children, adolescents, and young adults. SAMHSA's National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory, authorized under PHSA Section 501A, includes young adults in grants for mental health and substance use disorders. The Laboratory promotes evidence-based practices, coordinates policy changes, evaluates programs, and encourages innovation. SAMHSA's National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy Laboratory has appointed a Director and launched the Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center to encourage innovation and dissemination of evidence-based practices. Section 7111 amends PHSA Section 501A(b) to add new responsibilities for the Laboratory in providing information to grant applicants for SAMHSA to promote implementation of evidence-based practices and offer technical assistance. Substance use treatment facilities in the US vary in ownership, affiliation, and services offered. Some substance use treatment facilities in the US offer a range of evidence-based services for individuals with substance use disorders, while others may specialize in specific treatments. Not all facilities provide comprehensive services, with varying percentages offering detoxification, community outreach, and FDA-approved medications for opioid use disorder. A new section in the PHSA, titled \"Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers,\" has been established to address the need for comprehensive treatment options. A new PHSA Section 552 establishes a grant program for Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers, requiring the Secretary to award at least 10 competitive grants. These centers must provide a full range of treatment services, including FDA-approved MAT, counseling, testing for infections, and residential rehabilitation. The new PHSA Section 552 establishes a grant program for Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers, requiring centers to offer outpatient programs, recovery housing, peer recovery support services, and job training. Centers must also provide medication access, family support services, and maintain an electronic health information system. Outreach activities are required, and annual data submission is mandatory. $10 million is authorized for FY2019 through FY2023. The report to Congress on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is due within three years of enactment, with a final report two years later. ACEs include abuse, neglect, and traumatic experiences before age 18. Studies show a link between ACEs and adult chronic conditions. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects data on health behaviors and conditions, with 32 states adding ACE-related questions since 2009. In 2009, 32 states added questions on adverse childhood experiences to BRFSS surveys. The CDC Director can collect biennial ACE data through BRFSS and YRBSS, with a focus on rural areas. $2 million is authorized annually for this from FY2019 to FY2023. Federal agencies like SAMHSA, HRSA, and ACF offer trauma-informed programming and grants to support state and local governments. The Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care, established by Section 7132, provides recommendations on best practices for children and families affected by trauma and substance use disorders. It consists of 29 federal task force members from various agencies and is responsible for coordinating responses and making recommendations to federal agencies and the public. The Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care, established by Section 7132, provides recommendations on evidence-based best practices for trauma-informed care, a national strategy for collaboration among federal agencies, and dissemination of best practices and training programs. The task force aims to support individuals experiencing substance use or related trauma by identifying guidelines for professional development and procedures for front-line service providers. The Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care provides recommendations for practices to avoid custody loss or criminal penalties for parents with traumatized children, opportunities for local and state-level partnerships, and procedures for referring families to trauma-informed support services. The task force must hold its first meeting within 120 days and submit an operating plan within two years. The Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care will carry out activities, submit reports to federal agencies and Congress, and sunset by September 30, 2023. The task force was authorized in the Children's Health Act of 2000 and focuses on the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative (NCTSI). The National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative (NCTSI) under the Health Act of 2000 raises awareness about trauma's impact on children. It authorizes grants for evidence-based practices in treating trauma-related disorders, collecting outcome data, and facilitating training initiatives. Funding of $63.9 million is authorized for FY2018 through FY2022. The NCTSI authorizes $63.9 million for FY2019-FY2023 to address mental health needs. SAMHSA operates Project AWARE grant program, including SEA grants, Mental Health First Aid Grants, and ReCAST Grants for promoting mental health services in schools and communities. The Project AWARE grant program aims to increase student access to trauma support services and mental health care through grants awarded to state and local educational agencies. Funds are used for collaborative efforts, school-wide interventions, professional development, and other evidence-based activities. The Project AWARE grant program provides funding for various services such as professional development, full-service community schools, engaging families, technical assistance, program evaluation, and partnerships with Head Start agencies. Grants can be awarded for up to four years with a focus on increasing awareness of child and youth trauma. Services should supplement existing services and grants must be equitably distributed across the United States. The NCTSI program under SAMHSA aims to improve trauma treatment for children and families by raising awareness and disseminating evidence-based interventions. Funding of $50 million annually is authorized for FY2019 through FY2023, with provisions for evaluation and promotion of trauma support practices. The NCTSI program provides technical assistance and resources to professionals working with young children on recognizing and responding to trauma. It aims to educate providers on identifying early signs of trauma, promoting trauma-informed care practices, recommending resources for children impacted by trauma, and supporting whole-family approaches. The provision in PHSA Section 317N aims to improve prevention, detection, and treatment of hepatitis C infections, especially in light of the opioid epidemic increasing the incidence of blood-borne infections. CDC is authorized to carry out programs or award grants for this purpose, with a focus on addressing opioid-related infectious diseases. The PHSA Section 317N aims to address hepatitis C infections related to illicit drug use by providing testing, counseling, referrals, public outreach, and education for health professionals. The section authorizes $40 million for FY2019 through FY2023. Additionally, the Building Communities of Recovery (BCOR) grant program was established to support recovery community organizations with resources and long-term recovery services. SAMHSA awarded BCOR grants to enhance recovery support services and education, with a federal share of costs not exceeding 50%. CARA authorized $1 million for each year. The BCOR grant program, authorized by CARA, now allows for a federal share of costs up to 85% and expands allowable uses of funds. Special consideration is required for rural areas with unique needs, increasing the authorization of appropriations to $5 million per year. The SUPPORT Act increases authorization of appropriations for peer support services in substance use disorder recovery to $5 million annually from FY2019 through FY2023. It establishes a Peer Support Technical Assistance Center to provide support and assistance for peer recovery organizations. The Peer Support Technical Assistance Center is required to provide technical assistance and support to recovery community organizations and peer support networks, including training, data collection, capacity building, and evaluation activities. It also issues best practices for use by these organizations. $1 million is authorized for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2023. The CDC conducts various activities to address the opioid overdose epidemic, such as providing tools for healthcare providers, public education on opioid risks, and funding for states. Section 102 of CARA focuses on educating the public, providers, and patients about the risks of prescription drug abuse, including the dangers of opioid abuse, prevention strategies, and early detection of addiction. It also emphasizes the connection between prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Section 7161 adds a new PHSA Section 392A to address opioid-related issues. Section 7161, subsection (a), adds a new PHSA Section 392A, allowing the CDC Director to conduct activities related to preventing overdoses of controlled substances. This includes prevention programs, surveillance, data collection, education, and awarding grants for evidence-based prevention activities. Activities may involve improving prescription drug monitoring programs, promoting interventions, evaluating overdose prevention strategies, and implementing innovative prevention projects for emerging public health crises. The new PHSA Section 392A allows the CDC Director to fund various purposes related to PDMPs, including registering users, flagging opioid misuse, and enhancing interoperability. Grants can be awarded for innovative projects and evidence-based activities to prevent substance misuse and overdoses. The CDC Director can also study substance use disorders and conduct controlled substance overdose data collection activities. The new PHSA Section 392A allows the CDC Director to fund various purposes related to PDMPs, including registering users, flagging opioid misuse, and enhancing interoperability. Grants can be awarded for innovative projects and evidence-based activities to prevent substance misuse and overdoses. It also allows the CDC Director to coordinate with the ASMHSU to collect data on emergency department visits resulting from alcohol or drug abuse. $496 million is authorized for each of FY2019 through FY2023 for new PHSA Section 392A, PHSA section 399O, and CARA Section 102. Section 7161(b) of the SUPPORT Act amends CARA Section 102, making changes to the authority for opioid abuse awareness campaigns. The CDC Director can fund various purposes related to PDMPs, including flagging opioid misuse and enhancing interoperability. Grants can be awarded for innovative projects to prevent substance misuse and overdoses. PHSA Section 399O requires the Secretary to award grants to states for monitoring controlled substance dispensing. Grantees must meet specified requirements to manage, protect, and share information from the monitoring program. The section authorizes the appropriation of $10 million for each of FY2017 through FY2021 for monitoring programs known as PDMPs, which replace the earlier NASPER program. States must implement monitoring programs with specified reporting requirements and privacy protections. The amended PHSA Section 399O establishes a program under the CDC Director to support state and local PDMPs, focusing on required attributes and activities. System attributes include timeliness of data, ease of use, and interoperability with other data systems. States must provide for the implementation of PDMPs to receive support. The amended PHSA Section 399O requires states to implement PDMPs to receive support, with strategies such as reporting dispensing within 24 hours and consulting the PDMP before prescribing controlled substances. States must also establish notifications to prevent misuse and may access PDMP data to avoid diversion. The amended PHSA Section 399O requires entities receiving support to report specified information to the CDC Director, provide aggregate nonidentifiable data from the PDMP to the Secretary, offer education on PDMP access to prescribers and dispensers, and follow guidelines issued by the Secretary. It also clarifies that the section does not restrict law enforcement or preempt state regulatory activities related to controlled substances. The amended PHSA Section 399O requires the Secretary to study and report on states' implementation of PDMPs, their effectiveness in addressing substance abuse issues, and the impact on patient access to care. It also mandates the establishment of PDMP advisory councils at the state and local levels, funded independently from federal sources. Section 7161 authorizes $496 million for FY2019-FY2023 for behavioral health programs. SAMHSA disseminates provider information, unrelated to federal payments. HRSA assesses the behavioral health workforce. Section 7171 mandates review of entities receiving federal funding for SUD treatment services. The Secretary is required to review entities receiving federal funding for SUD treatment services, including history, population served, and treatment capacity. A plan must be submitted to Congress within two years to allocate resources to address inadequacies in services or funding. The \"Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis\" allocated $500 million for FY2017 and FY2018 for grants to states to support responses to the opioid epidemic. The State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis (Opioid STR) grant program was established to address the opioid abuse crisis. SAMHSA administered formula grants to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other territories in FY2017 and FY2018. The grants supported states in supplementing opioid-related activities and were exempt from budget controls. The Opioid STR grant program provided funding outside of spending limits for FY2017 and FY2018. Section 7181 reauthorizes grants for states, tribes, and territories to address opioid abuse. Grants can now support PDMPs, practitioner training, and local needs related to substance use disorders. Section 7181 reauthorizes grants for states, tribes, and territories to address opioid abuse, providing technical assistance and funding up to $500 million annually for FY2019 through FY2021. This includes set-asides for Indian Tribes and states with high drug overdose mortality rates. Section 1003 of the Cures Act addresses the opioid abuse crisis by transferring funds from the Treasury to the account and exempting it from budget controls. Appropriations for this grant would be included in budget estimates, and Section 13003 requires a report on violations of parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits. Section 13003 of the Cures Act requires annual reports to Congress on violations of parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits. The reports now summarize investigations on compliance with parity requirements in general, including the number of complaints received and closed federal investigations. The reports also detail which agency conducted the investigation and whether the health plan under investigation is fully insured. The Cures Act mandates annual reports to Congress on violations of parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits. The reports summarize investigations on compliance with parity requirements, including the number of complaints received and closed federal investigations. It details the agency conducting the investigation, whether the health plan is fully insured, and any coordination between agencies. SAMHSA supports mental health and substance abuse treatment through grants and programs, as well as workforce development and data collection efforts. The Department of Labor's National Dislocated Worker Grant Program allows funds to be used for employment and training activities for populations affected by opioid use. Grants are awarded to treatment and recovery service providers for evidence-based programs supporting individuals in substance use disorder treatment and recovery to live independently and participate in the workforce. Coordination with state or local stakeholders is required for applicants. The provision allows grant funds to be used by state or local stakeholders for hiring personnel to provide treatment and recovery services, using innovative technologies, and workforce training activities. The application procedures, reporting requirements, and grant award formula consider states' rates of drug overdose deaths, unemployment rate, and labor force participation rate. The Secretary must submit reports to Congress within specified timelines. The provision authorizes $5 million for each of FY2019 through FY2023 for the Synthetics Trafficking and Overdose Prevention Act of 2018. It requires the USPS to obtain advance electronic data on inbound packages to prevent illegal drug entry into the US. Section 8002 mandates a $1 fee on each Inbound Express Mail item. Section 8002 mandates a $1 fee on each Inbound Express Mail item sent to the US through the international postal network. The fee proceeds are split between USPS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to cover processing costs. The Universal Postal Union aims to enhance postal integrity and security by promoting consistency and reliability in the exchange of advance electronic customs data. The Universal Postal Union does not require all member countries to provide advance electronic data as the SUPPORT Act mandates. Many member countries lack the capability to gather, format, or transmit this data. Section 8003 of the Trade Act of 2002 now requires the USPS to transmit select customs information to CBP for inbound international mail shipments. The regulations for mandatory advance electronic information for postal shipments may allow phased implementation with incremental targets. Factors considered include risk, volume of mail from a country, and foreign postal operator capability. By December 31, 2018, USPS must transmit advance electronic data for 70% of all inbound international mail and 100% from China. By December 31, 2020, data for 100% of inbound international mail shipments must be provided. The regulations for mandatory advance electronic information for postal shipments may allow phased implementation with incremental targets based on risk, volume of mail, and foreign postal operator capability. Exclusion from the requirement is possible for countries with low-risk, low-volume shipments that can be screened effectively through alternate means, and whose postal operators lack the capability to provide advance electronic data. U.S. international postal policy is governed by various international postal arrangements, including bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements. Additionally, Section 8003 mandates the development of a Joint Strategic Plan to enhance the capacity of foreign postal operators to collect and transmit advance electronic customs data through technical assistance, equipment, technology, and training. The United States is party to numerous international postal arrangements, including bilateral and multilateral treaties. President Trump announced the intention to withdraw from the UPU due to lack of progress on key priorities, such as advance electronic customs data collection. The UPU received a notice of denunciation from the U.S. Secretary of State, leading to the U.S. withdrawal from the Union. The Trump Administration plans to renegotiate postal arrangements. Section 8004 prohibits future conflicting international postal agreements, while Section 8005 instructs renegotiation of existing treaties. Section 8005 of the UPU agreement states that any additional costs incurred by USPS in relation to the agreement are to be charged to foreign shippers or operators. Incoming international mail is processed at USPS international centers, with different screening processes for letter and parcel post. The USPS processes incoming international mail, which is subject to customs control and screened by USPS and CBP for potential customs duties. Technology is used to detect illicit narcotics and hazardous materials in international packages. Section 8006 instructs the Postmaster General and the Commissioner of CBP to develop technology for detecting illicit substances entering the US by mail. Section 8006 of the SUPPORT Act instructs the Postmaster General and the Commissioner of CBP to develop technology for detecting illicit substances entering the US by mail. Section 8007 amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to hold USPS liable for civil penalties for accepting shipments that violate clearance and reporting requirements. Section 8008 requires CBP to submit an annual report on violations of the Tariff Act. Section 8007 of the SUPPORT Act amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to hold USPS liable for civil penalties for accepting shipments that violate clearance and reporting requirements. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" is defined, and regulations necessary to carry out the amendments must be prescribed within one year of enactment. In 2016, over 2 million people received substance use disorder treatment at specialty facilities. The opioid crisis has led to nearly $30 billion in increased healthcare and treatment costs. Fraud and abuse have been reported in the multibillion-dollar substance use treatment industry, with investigations by federal agencies like the FTC, FBI, and EBSA uncovering fraudulent acts. The FTC regulates advertising of foods, cosmetics, devices, and drugs, excluding prescription drugs. Joint warning letters have been sent by the FDA and FTC to companies marketing unapproved opioid cessation products. The FTC has the authority to prohibit false claims and seek civil penalties for violators under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Fraud Prevention Act prohibits deceptive acts related to substance use disorder treatment services or products. The Opioid Addiction Recovery Fraud Prevention Act authorizes the FTC to penalize opioid treatment programs for false claims about cost, efficacy, or safety. State officials can also take legal action for violations. SAMHSA supports community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment. SAMHSA provides grants for mental health and substance abuse treatment, prevention services, and other activities like technical assistance and workforce development. DOL funds employment and training programs for populations affected by opioid use through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The DOL provides funding for employment and training activities for populations affected by opioid use through the WIOA Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities grant program. The National DWG Program offers funding for employment and training activities and supportive services, excluding in-patient drug treatment and rehabilitation programs. Section 8041 mandates a pilot program to award competitive grants to eligible entities for providing employment and supportive services to individuals in communities impacted by opioid and other substance use disorders. The section requires eligible entities to demonstrate the impact of opioids and substance use disorders on the community, including economic and employment problems. Demonstration grants range from $500,000 to $5 million per fiscal year, with recipients required to make subgrants to local Workforce Development Boards. The grant allows for subgrants to local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) to provide services to workers affected by substance use disorders (SUDs). Participating partnerships must offer services such as connecting participants with employment opportunities, screening for substance use, providing treatment, supportive services, and job training. Grantees can use up to 10% for administrative costs and 10% for treatment and recovery. The section mandates that grant recipients allocate funds appropriately, with limits on administrative, treatment, and supportive service costs. Quarterly reports are required, and the Secretary of Labor will evaluate the program. Additionally, the Secretary of Labor is authorized to use up to $100 million from the National Dislocated Worker Grant program for fiscal years FY2019 through FY2023. The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 required the VA to establish a peer support counseling program for suicide prevention among veterans, with volunteer veteran-peer support counselors assisting with mental health issues and readjustment. Under P.L. 111-163, the VA Secretary was not required to recruit women veteran-peer support counselors for gender-specific services. Section 8051 now mandates the recruitment of women peer support counselors with expertise in gender-specific issues and employment mentoring. This aims to assist women veterans with reintegration and reduce stigma, especially for those who have experienced sexual trauma or have post-traumatic stress. The VA Secretary is mandated to recruit women veteran-peer support counselors with expertise in gender-specific issues and employment mentoring to provide peer counseling services for women veterans who have experienced sexual trauma, PTSD, homelessness, or are at risk of suicide. No additional appropriations are authorized for this program, and existing funds for the Peer Support Counseling Program will be used. A report must be submitted to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees within two years of the enactment of this act. Section 8062 of the \"Treating Barriers to Prosperity of 2018\" act mandates a report on the Peer Support Counseling Program within two years. The Appalachian Regional Commission focuses on economic development and health projects, including addressing opioid use in the region. The Appalachian Regional Commission is authorized to provide assistance for projects addressing drug abuse, including opioid abuse. Grants can be given for various activities, with different funding limits based on county distress levels. Amounts for this purpose can come from various sources. The Appalachian Regional Commission can provide assistance for projects addressing drug abuse, including opioid abuse. Funding can be used to increase the federal share as determined appropriate. Federal housing funding primarily supports permanent housing, not temporary housing for individuals in recovery for substance use disorders. Transitional housing funding is targeted for homeless individuals, with programs like HUD's Continuum of Care and Community Development Block providing assistance. The Section 8071 authorizes a new grant program for states to provide stable, temporary housing for individuals in recovery from substance abuse disorders. States with a drug overdose mortality rate above the national average are eligible for assistance, with funding allocated based on a formula established by the HUD Secretary. Temporary housing can be provided for up to two years or until the individual secures permanent housing. The provision establishes a grant program for states to provide stable, temporary housing for individuals in recovery from substance abuse disorders. Funding is allocated based on factors like unemployment rates, labor force participation, and drug overdose deaths. States do not need to provide matching funds to receive a grant, and the HUD Secretary can waive or alter requirements under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The HUD Secretary must notify congressional committees and the public before using grant authority. States must spend 30% of funds within a year and can use 5% for administrative costs. The Secretary can allocate up to 2% for technical assistance in the first two years. Appropriations are authorized for FY2019 through FY2023. Subtitle G addresses SUD treatment services for pregnant women, children, and families, including residential services. It references changes made by the Family First Prevention Services Act. The Family First Prevention Services Act allows Title IV-E funding to be used for SUD treatment and related services for child-welfare involved families starting in FY2020. This program provides assistance to eligible children in foster care and supports their transition to permanent homes through adoption or legal guardianship. Administered by ACF, the program also allows room and board payments for children in foster care for up to 12 months. The Family First Prevention Services Act allows Title IV-E funding to be used for SUD treatment and related services for child-welfare involved families starting in FY2020. States may elect to use funds for 12 months of foster care prevention services for children at risk of entering foster care, pregnant or parenting youth in foster care, and their parents or kin caregivers. Prevention services include trauma-informed SUD and mental health treatment, parent education, and counseling. Medicaid is a federal-state program that finances medical services for low-income populations, including substance use disorder treatment. States have flexibility in coverage and services provided. Various federal programs, such as SAMHSA's Residential Treatment Programs, support SUD treatment for children and families. SAMHSA's Residential Treatment Programs and Regional Partnership Grants aim to improve outcomes for families affected by substance use disorder. Section 8081 mandates the Secretary to issue guidance on family-focused residential treatment programs within 180 days, including services like MAT, counseling, and parenting training, utilizing funding from programs like Medicaid and Title IV-E. The section discusses family-focused residential treatment programs for substance use disorder, emphasizing the importance of timely assessment and specialized caseworkers for positive outcomes. Funding from Medicaid, Title IV-E, and other HHS programs can be utilized for these programs. The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program (PSSF) supports child welfare services to strengthen families and keep children safely at home. A one-time mandatory appropriation of $15 million is allocated for a family recovery and reunification program under SSA Section 435. The Secretary must award a contract or grant to conduct an evaluation of a family recovery and reunification program using a recovery coach model. The program aims to help parents with substance use disorder reunite with their children by providing treatment and support services. The evaluation must include a random assignment experiment measuring various indicators for at least five years. Additionally, reports on the pilot phase, impact study, and program implementation must be published on an HHS-maintained website. Beginning in FY2020, states can use Title IV-E funding for SUD and mental health treatment services, skills-based programs for in-home parents, and support for children at risk of foster care entry. Previously, these services were not available to child-welfare involved families. The Secretary must publish a report analyzing the impacts of the reunification program and may recommend legislative and administrative actions if necessary. The Medicaid program can be used to provide SUD and mental health treatment, as well as in-home parent skills-based programs for child-welfare involved families. Section 8082(b) and (c) addresses situations where an individual may be eligible for services under multiple programs, ensuring that Title IV-E prevention services do not reduce assistance available under other programs. The Family First Prevention Services Act allows states to use Title IV-E funds to provide services to prevent delay in service provision, even if costs would have been covered by another source. This provision is effective as of the enactment of the Family First Act in February 2018. The Family First Prevention Services Act allows states to use Title IV-E funds to provide 12 months of specified foster care prevention services to children at imminent risk of entering foster care, pregnant or parenting teens in foster care, and their parents or kin caregivers. To be eligible for funding, services must be trauma-informed and meet specific criteria. Grants will be given to eligible public and private entities for prevention services meeting the highest evidence standard. The Family First Prevention Services Act allows entities to develop family-focused residential treatment programs using a one-time discretionary appropriation of $20 million. Programs must meet evidence-based practice criteria for Title IV-E prevention services and be evaluated to determine their effectiveness. \"Family-focused residential treatment\" is defined as a trauma-informed program primarily for substance use disorder treatment of pregnant individuals. The \"REGROUP Act of 2018\" authorizes a residential program for substance use disorder treatment of pregnant and postpartum women, parents, and guardians, allowing children to reside with them. Section 201 of CARA established the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program (COAP) to support projects related to opioid abuse. The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program (COAP) supports various projects related to opioid abuse, including overdose outreach, support for individuals with opioid misuse history, prescription drug monitoring programs, and comprehensive strategies to address the opioid epidemic. The Bureau of Justice Assistance administers this grant program, with funding authorized through the REGROUP Act of 2018. The \"Fighting Opioid Abuse in Transportation Act\" allocates $330 million annually from FY2019 to FY2023 to address the increasing opioid use among transportation workers. Concerns about public safety and opportunities for improvement in drug and alcohol testing requirements for transportation workers are highlighted. The Federal Railroad Administration's drug and alcohol testing program covers \"safety-sensitive\" positions but excludes mechanical workers, unlike the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. The Transit Administration includes mechanics in federal drug and alcohol testing requirements. The Secretary of Transportation must publish a rule to cover railroad employees performing \"mechanical activities.\" Drug and alcohol testing is required for safety-sensitive transportation workers, but data on violations is not easily accessible. The Secretary of Transportation must define \"mechanical activities\" by March 31, 2019. The Secretary of Transportation is required to establish a database of drug and alcohol testing data reported by employers for each mode of transportation by March 31, 2019. Employers must submit their testing data through the DOT Drug and Alcohol Testing Management Information System, with certain elements required to be included in the database. Reporting requirements vary across modes and do not include test results not required by DOT, but could provide valuable information on drug use trends among transportation workers. Commercially sensitive and personally identifiable data cannot be released by DOT. The Department of Transportation is required to establish a database of drug and alcohol testing data reported by employers for each mode of transportation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will review the DOT's Drug and Alcohol Testing Management Information System and the public drug and alcohol testing results database. Prior to 2018, DOT drug testing was limited to five categories of drugs, but as of 2018, four opioids were added to the list. The Department of Transportation is required to establish a database of drug and alcohol testing data reported by employers for each mode of transportation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will review the DOT's Drug and Alcohol Testing Management Information System and the public drug and alcohol testing results database. The Secretary must determine whether to include fentanyl and other drugs in the testing guidelines within 180 days of enactment. If the guidelines are revised, the rulemaking must be completed within 18 months. The DOT Secretary is required to add new substances to the drug-testing panel if the list of tested substances is expanded. The DOT Secretary must add new substances to the drug-testing panel within 18 months of the final rule's publication. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act allows motor carriers to conduct preemployment testing for alcohol and controlled substances, including hair testing as an alternative to urine testing. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act allows for an exemption for commercial motor vehicle operators with religious beliefs against cutting hair. The Secretary is required to issue guidelines for hair testing to detect controlled substances, but as of now, the guidelines have not been published. The Secretary must report to Congress on the status of the guidelines until they are finalized. The SAMHSA issued proposed guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs using oral fluid, which received over 100 public comments. These guidelines conflict with the requirements of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act regarding drug testing using saliva. The SAMHSA proposed guidelines for federal workplace drug testing using oral fluid conflict with OTETA requirements. The Secretary must publish final guidelines by December 31, 2018, ensuring tests only determine drug use, not exposure. Guidelines should eliminate the risk of positive results from exposure to others' drug use. The section specifies that the Secretary is not required to reissue a notice proposing scientific and technical guidelines for workplace drug and alcohol testing in the transportation industry. Procedures for drug testing include using the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form, with electronic submission of results allowed. Plans are in place for an electronic alcohol testing form with electronic signatures pending approval. The section mandates the Secretary to approve electronic Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Forms for certified laboratories within a year of enactment. It also sets a deadline for laboratories to request approval, without limiting the Secretary's authority to grant approval for electronic forms. The DOT Secretary is required to approve electronic Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control forms for certified laboratories within a year of enactment. A final rule will be issued to allow the use of electronic or digital signatures on forms instead of handwritten signatures. Congress directed the establishment of a national clearinghouse for records of commercial drivers' violations of drug and alcohol testing, with a compliance date of January 6, 2020. The section requires the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to submit annual status reports on the implementation of the Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse. The compliance date is set for January 6, 2020, or when the national clearinghouse is operational. The subtitle may be cited as the \"Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018.\" Congress aims to prevent improper influences on healthcare provider decision-making. The \"Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018\" aims to prevent improper influences on healthcare provider decision-making by establishing criminal penalties for offering or receiving remuneration for patient referrals in federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Violators may face fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Reports have highlighted abusive payment arrangements between recovery home operators and substance use disorder treatment facilities. The \"Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018\" addresses patient brokering and excessive billing in SUD treatment facilities. It establishes criminal penalties for remuneration for patient referrals to recovery homes, treatment facilities, and laboratories. The new Section 220 in Title 18 of the U.S. Code prohibits solicitation, receipt, or payment of remuneration for patient referrals to recovery homes, treatment facilities, and laboratories. Violators may face a $200,000 fine, up to 10 years imprisonment, or both. This section applies to services covered by \"health care benefit programs.\" Section 8122 of Title 18 prohibits remuneration for patient referrals under health care benefit programs, with exceptions for certain business arrangements. The criminal penalties do not apply to conduct prohibited by the anti-kickback statute, and state laws addressing similar misconduct are not preempted. The ONDCP, established in 1988, is responsible for U.S. drug control policies to reduce illicit drug use, manufacturing, and trafficking. It develops a National Drug Control Strategy and Budget, evaluating implementation by agencies contributing to the Federal Drug Control Program. The ONDCP oversees the implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy by agencies, focusing on reducing illicit drug use and its consequences. It manages programs like HIDTA and DFC, with an authorization of $18.4 million for FY2018-FY2023. The DFC Program, co-administered by ONDCP and SAMHSA, funds community coalitions to prevent youth substance use. Section 8203 amends and reauthorizes the DFC Program, replacing \"substance abuse\" with \"substance use and misuse\" in statute. It sets new conditions on grant renewals and authorizes $99 million in appropriations for ONDCP for the DFC Program for FY2018 through FY2023. It also amends the termination provision for ONDCP by adding Sections 1021 through 1035 to the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988. The NCI program provides assistance for coalition leaders and community teams, evaluates coalition performance, and bridges research with practice. It is administered by ONDCP and SAMHSA, with funding continuing despite authorization expiration in FY2011. Section 8204 authorizes a $2 million grant annually from FY2018 to FY2023 for NCI. However, a code citation in Section 8204 appears inconsistent with this goal. The HIDTA program, authorized by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, provides assistance to law enforcement agencies in critical drug trafficking regions. Funds support enforcement initiatives, drug treatment, and prevention programs. Congress prohibited the use of HIDTA funds for drug treatment programs in 2006. The HIDTA program's authorization of appropriations expired in FY2011 at $280 million. Despite this, it has received appropriations in subsequent years. Section 8205 allows up to 5% of funds for substance use disorder treatment and drug prevention programs, with $280 million authorized for FY2018-FY2023. It also expands allowable uses for HIDTA funds to ensure community safety. The HIDTA program's authorization of appropriations expired in FY2011 at $280 million, but has received appropriations in subsequent years. Section 8205 allows up to 5% of funds for substance use disorder treatment and drug prevention programs, with $280 million authorized for FY2018-FY2023. HIDTA funds can be used to ensure community safety and protect communities. HIDTA Director must develop best practices for assisting governments with witness protection in drug-related cases. DOJ administers the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program to establish and enhance drug courts for nonviolent offenders with substance abuse issues. Funding is authorized under CARA for the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program. Section 8206 authorizes $75 million for the Drug Courts Program for FY2018-FY2023, providing training and technical assistance for drug courts. Section 8207 authorizes $2 million annually for the Drug Court Training and Technical Assistance Program under ONDCP. ONDCP develops the National Drug Control Strategy to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences. The Drug Control Strategy in the United States aims to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences by limiting availability and reducing demand for illegal drugs. Section 8208 authorizes the ONDCP Director to implement a drug overdose response strategy in HIDTA, coordinating efforts to prevent, reduce, and respond to drug overdoses. ONDCP administers grant programs related to drug control but does not currently have one addressing protection. Section 8209 authorizes the ONDCP Director to use $10 million to provide grants to HIDTAs for purchasing equipment, training law enforcement officers, and purchasing protective gear for handling fentanyl and other substances. The COPS program funds community policing, new crime-fighting technologies, and innovative policing strategies. Authorized appropriations expired in FY2009, but Congress has continued to provide funding. Since FY2014, funding has also been allocated for Anti-Methamphetamine and Anti-Heroin Task Force programs. Starting FY2019, a portion of COPS program funding will be used for competitive awards to state law enforcement agencies. Section 8210 authorizes competitive awards of at least $1 million to state law enforcement agencies with high seizures of precursor chemicals, methamphetamine, and laboratories for investigating illicit activities. Section 8211 amends the COPS program to allocate funding for state law enforcement agencies in high per capita states to combat heroin and fentanyl distribution. The CARA provisions authorized new opioid-related activities and grants to address the opioid epidemic, including support for substance use disorder treatment, prevention, and recovery activities administered by SAMHSA. Title VII of CARA authorized new opioid-related activities and grants for substance use disorder treatment, prevention, and recovery. Section 8212 of CARA allows the Secretary to provide grants to entities focusing on substance use disorders, family and patient services, advocacy, and education. Grants can be used for expanding clinical services, developing health information technology systems, enhancing treatment resources, providing education materials, and offering technical assistance. The curr_chunk discusses the payment variations for substance use disorder treatment services, influenced by factors like service type, location, provider type, and billing entity. HRSA's National Center for Health Workforce Analysis focuses on health workforce access, while CMS establishes payment policies for programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The curr_chunk discusses Section 8213 requiring a report on substance use disorder service reimbursement, and the START program for families affected by SUD and child abuse. The program provides quick access to services, assessment, and treatment, aiming to keep children with their parents. The START program works with the multidisciplinary team to provide necessary supports for families affected by substance use disorders (SUDs) and child abuse. Some states use the RPG program model to improve outcomes for children and families impacted by SUDs. NCSACW offers technical assistance to RPG grantees, funded by SAMHSA and ACF. Section 8214 allows grants for states to establish START or similar programs for families facing SUDs and child abuse. The section specifies the permissible uses of funding under this program to provide families with peer support, intensive treatment, and child welfare services for those facing co-occurring SUDs and child abuse. The Secretary may reserve up to 5% of funds for technical assistance on establishing or expanding START programs. S.Rept. 114-239 directed the Attorney General to coordinate with the HHS Secretary to limit opioid overprescribing and regulate DEA involvement. The DOJ and HHS were directed to submit a plan to Congress within 90 days on limiting opioid overprescribing. Medical professionals must certify training in proper opioid prescribing to the DEA. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, must complete the plan within 60 days. ONDCP was created by the Anti-Drug Act. Section 8217 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) makes amendments related to the office's responsibilities, ethics guidelines, and administration. It establishes the Director's rank and status, appoints various positions, requires consultation with agencies and committees, and allows for the formation of advisory groups. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is authorized to form advisory councils, request data, and appoint new positions. It sets requirements for ONDCP funds, prohibits funds for advocating ballot initiatives, limits fund transfers, and allocates $1.25 million for the Model State Drug Laws grant program. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign was launched in 1998 to change youth attitudes about drug use but had no favorable effects on youth behavior or beliefs. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, initially unsuccessful, was replaced by the \"Above the Influence\" (ATI) campaign, which showed potential positive impacts on youth attitudes and behavior. ATI targeted female 8th grade students in discouraging marijuana use but had limited influence on male students and those in grades 10 and 12. The campaign last received funding in FY2011, and a new Emerging Threats Coordinator and Committee were established to monitor evolving drug threats. The new committee must monitor evolving drug threats in the United States and authorizes $25.0 million for the National Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The U.S. Interdiction Coordinator is responsible for coordinating interdiction efforts and developing an annual National Interdiction Command and Control Plan. The coordinator evaluates U.S. interdiction efforts and reports to Congress on the National Interdiction Command and Control. The Interdiction Committee oversees U.S. interdiction efforts, coordinates with federal drug control agencies, and advises on drug interdiction strategy and policy. The committee head, designated by the ONDCP director, must meet annually and review the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan. The ONDCP director appoints the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator, who must be in a senior position. Relevant agencies may provide staff to assist the coordinator. The National Interdiction Command and Control Plan is due by September 1 each year. Section 8219 of the ONDCP director's responsibilities includes issuing the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan by September 1 each year, with a report to Congress that may recommend changes to agency authorities and laws governing interagency relationships. The report must now also include information on federal drug control agencies' engagement with international partners. Section 8219 of the ONDCP director's responsibilities includes changing the language for the head of the Interdiction Committee to \"chairperson\" and adjusting the meeting schedule. It also allows for classified information to be included in congressional reports. In 2017, GAO released audit findings on the government's progress in achieving National Drug Control Strategy goals. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported mixed progress in achieving goals outlined in the 2010 National Drug Control Strategy. ONDCP and SAMHSA improved management of the DFC program but could enhance grantee compliance and performance monitoring. GAO is required to conduct an audit on ONDCP's programs and operations within four years of enactment. The National Drug Control Strategy aims to reduce illicit drug consumption and its consequences through collaboration with various stakeholders. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) collaborates with stakeholders to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences. ONDCP has not released its Strategy in recent years, but Section 8221 now requires the Director to outline drug control policy priorities by April 1 following a presidential inauguration. The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy must submit a Strategy by April 1 following a presidential inauguration, outlining drug control policy priorities. The Strategy must include a mission statement, quantifiable goals, performance evaluations, challenges, and a five-year budget projection. The ONDCP Director must submit a Strategy outlining drug control policy priorities, including a mission statement, budget projection, and counternarcotics strategies for the Southwest and Northern borders. This includes a plan to collect data on illicit drug use in the United States and strategies to end the construction and use of tunnels for illegal drug purposes. The ONDCP Director must submit a Strategy outlining drug control policy priorities, including a mission statement, budget projection, and counternarcotics strategies for the Southwest and Northern borders. This includes recommendations for criminal penalties for illegal drug trafficking through tunnels and subterranean passages across the US-Mexico border. Additionally, a strategy to end drug trafficking to or through Indian reservations near the US-Canada border must be specified, along with recommendations for assistance to tribal law enforcement agencies. The ONDCP Director is also required to establish a Drug Control Data Dashboard for public access to relevant data. The Drug Control Data Dashboard must provide machine-readable and searchable data on illicit drug use, including quantities, drug seizure, flow, production, pricing, substance use, criminal activity, overdose fatalities, SUD prevalence, treatment statistics, prescription drug issues, and other relevant measures determined by the Director. The Director is required to develop and submit an Annual National Drug Control Assessment, assessing the progress of each National Drug Control Program agency towards achieving goals. The Counter-narcotics Technology Center (CTAC) was established in 1993 but discontinued in FY2011. Section 8222 makes technical and conforming amendments. Section 8222 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 made changes to the maximum amount of funds allowed to be transferred without approval from the Director of ONDCP, increasing it from $1 million to $5 million or 10% of a specific program or account. The amendment states that no National Drug Control Program agency can submit a reprogramming or transfer request exceeding $5,000,000 or 10 percent of a specific program or account without approval from the Director. Section 8222 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 increased the maximum amount of funds allowed to be transferred without approval from the Director of ONDCP. If the Director does not respond to a reprogramming request within 30 days, it is deemed approved and forwarded to Congress. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act excludes budgetary effects from PAYGO scorecards, preventing sequestration. The act is estimated to increase the on-budget deficit by $1,001 million over five years but reduce it by $52 million over 10 years. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act exempts individuals from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage if they qualify for a religious conscience exemption. To qualify, individuals must be members of a recognized religious sect opposed to accepting insurance benefits for medical care. The individual mandate under the 2017 tax revision eliminated the penalty associated with not having minimum essential coverage starting in 2019. However, the requirement to maintain coverage remains. Section 4003 expands the religious conscience exemption to include individuals who rely solely on religious healing methods and have beliefs against medical services. To qualify for this exemption, individuals must apply for it. To qualify for a religious conscience exemption, individuals must apply through an exchange and attest to not receiving medical health services in the previous taxable year. Excluded services include routine dental, vision, and hearing services, vaccinations, and necessary medical services for children. This provision applies to taxable years after December 31, 2018 and is estimated to decrease direct spending outlays by $26 million from FY2019 through FY2028. The report includes only public or Congress-delivered reports, not internal reports required by grantees."
