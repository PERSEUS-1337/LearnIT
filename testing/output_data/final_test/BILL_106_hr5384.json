    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Alternative Fuel Vehicles Intermodal Transportation Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines an \"alternative fuel vehicle\" as a motor vehicle powered by electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, or methanol at 85% volume, excluding vehicles that operate solely on gasoline or diesel. The pilot program, established under section 4(a), is for alternative fuel vehicles, excluding those operating solely on gasoline or diesel. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Transportation. The purpose of this Act is to establish a pilot program for alternative fuel vehicles in transportation systems, enhance public transportation, protect the environment, and encourage public-private partnerships. The Secretary will establish a grant program to help purchase and operate alternative fuel vehicles in transportation systems. Projects must offer new options for moving passengers or goods in alternative fuel vehicles and enable transfers between vehicles in a linked system. Funding is limited to 15 grants. The Secretary will provide grants up to $20,000,000 to more than 15 applicants for alternative fuel vehicles. Federal assistance will cover up to 50% of project costs, with states using funds for the remaining share. Grants are limited to a maximum period. The pilot program provides Federal assistance for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles, including passenger vehicles, buses, delivery vehicles, ground support vehicles at airports, and two-wheel bikes for law enforcement or government employees. The maximum period for grants is 5 years. The pilot program offers Federal assistance for purchasing alternative fuel vehicles for local government employees, infrastructure support, and operation and maintenance of vehicles. The Secretary will issue requirements for grant applications, including estimates of ridership, emissions reduction, and fuel displacement. The projects must include a plan to collect environmental data, connect to other modes of transportation, demonstrate sustainability without Federal assistance, detail all project costs, and specify which costs will be supported by Federal assistance and which by non-Federal partners. The Secretary will evaluate applications for a pilot program involving alternative fuel vehicles based on previous experience. Approved proposals should prioritize environmental protection, enhancement of public transportation systems, and deployment of innovative transportation technology. The Secretary will evaluate applications for a pilot program involving alternative fuel vehicles based on previous experience. Approved proposals should prioritize environmental protection, enhancement of public transportation systems, and deployment of innovative transportation technology. The program will focus on configurations of intermodal transportation systems that increase the use of alternative fuel vehicles, the amount of goods transported or number of riders served, and stimulation of the national or regional economy. The applicant must demonstrate a strong commitment to funding the proposal and ensuring project sustainability after Federal assistance ends. Additionally, a broad geographic distribution of project sites is required. The Secretary will publish a request for proposals within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Proposals for projects under the pilot program must be submitted within 180 days of the notice. The Secretary will select the proposals to be carried out within 180 days after the application deadline. The pilot program requires project proposals to be submitted within 180 days. Selected proposals will be implemented within 180 days after the deadline. Additionally, a report must be submitted to Congress. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 36 months of the Act's enactment, evaluating the pilot program's effectiveness, identifying other applicants, and describing mechanisms for knowledge sharing. The pilot program aims to transfer gained information and know-how among participants and other interested parties, including applicants who submitted project applications. Authorization of $200,000,000 for the Act with funds remaining available until expended."
