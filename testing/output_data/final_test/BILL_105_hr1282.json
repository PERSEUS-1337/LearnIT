The Secretary will transfer ownership of canals, drains, roads, pumps, and other facilities to Burley without compensation. The first $80,000 in administrative costs will be shared equally between the United States and Burley. Additional administrative costs will be covered by the United States. The Secretary will transfer water rights to Burley, including natural flow, waste, seepage, return flow, and ground water rights. Burley will also receive allocation of storage space in various reservoirs, subject to covering operation and maintenance costs. The Secretary will provide Burley with a permanent right to project reserved power from multiple reclamation power plants at the cost of production and delivery. If the United States decides to transfer ownership of the Minidoka plant, Burley will have the right of first refusal. The Secretary will grant entities with storage water rights in Lake Walcott a right of first refusal to acquire the Minidoka Power Plant or Dam. Burley must recognize Minidoka Irrigation District's joint use rights in the Southside Canal. Effective on the date of conveyance, the United States shall not be liable for damages related to the conveyed lands, except for negligence or tortious conduct. This does not increase liability beyond what is provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Secretary is required to complete the conveyance process. The Secretary must complete the conveyance within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. If not done by January 1, 2000, the land will be automatically conveyed to Burley."
