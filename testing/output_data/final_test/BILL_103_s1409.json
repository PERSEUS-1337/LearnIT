    "content": "Sec. 2 of Public Law 94-241 is amended to limit payments for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 to the provisions set forth in the 1992 Agreement of the Special Representatives on Future Federal Financial Assistance of the Northern Mariana Islands. After fiscal year 1998, the annual amount shall be $27,720,000 unless Congress provides otherwise. No funds made available in accordance with the 1992 Agreement. The Secretary of the Interior must certify to Congress that certain conditions have been met before funds from the 1992 Agreement can be obligated for projects in the Northern Mariana Islands. The Northern Mariana Islands must limit the number of alien workers in the garment industry to 75% in 1994, 70% in 1995, and 65% in 1996 and beyond, as determined by the INS Commissioner. The Northern Mariana Islands must implement a petitioning mechanism similar to the Immigration and Nationality Act to measure alien admissions and provide necessary information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Additionally, the islands must enforce measures to raise revenues for public purposes in each year of funding provided under the Agreement. The Northern Mariana Islands must raise an amount of net revenue equivalent to what would have been raised in 1992 under the Covenant, minus revenues retained from income taxes. This can be achieved through developer taxes, taxes on visitor services, reducing tax rebates, income taxes, or public benefit taxes or fees. The Northern Mariana Islands is implementing a rate schedule approved by the Secretary of the Interior to phase in charges for all users of utilities over a five-year period. The Secretary has approved the plans for the fiscal year indicating the priority and purpose of projects and their financing arrangements. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines that the Northern Mariana Islands must enforce laws to provide no greater deductions from wages for various expenses than those in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and allow for the same exemptions from minimum wage payments."
