The Global Free Internet Act of 2015 emphasizes the importance of a single, open, global Internet for the free flow of information and products. It supports policies that encourage technology standards, respect user security and privacy, promote innovation, and avoid restricting Internet service providers. Certain governments and international bodies are adopting policies that go against a free, open Internet, including mandating unique technology standards favoring domestic producers and sponsoring the use of Internet-related tools for unauthorized access to networks in the United States.

The current policies threaten the free flow of information on the Internet, promote national Internets, harm US workers and businesses, and risk the utility of the Internet for communication and commerce.
