    "content": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules in 2006 regarding the disclosure of executive compensation to address concerns about shareholder value and corporate governance. Congress has also examined ways to address escalating pay for corporate executives. The SEC issued rules in 2006 requiring companies to disclose details about executives' stock-option grants and corporate stock-option programs in their proxy statements, annual reports, and registration statements. Companies had to provide tabular and narrative disclosure about all aspects of stock option grants, including grant date fair value and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Rule No. 123 (FAS 123R) grant date. The SEC adopted changes in 2006 to align stock and option award reporting with FASB Statement No. 123R. This requires recognizing equity award costs over the service period. The amendment aimed to provide investors with a clearer picture of executive compensation during a reporting period. The SEC revised reporting requirements for executive compensation in alignment with FASB Statement No. 123R. This includes disclosing the compensation cost of stock and option awards over the service period, with forfeitures noted in footnotes. Grant date fair value of equity awards must be disclosed in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. The SEC revised reporting requirements for executive compensation to include disclosure of re-priced or modified stock options and stock appreciation rights. Some investor groups criticize these amendments for potentially obscuring executive pay packages. An example is given of a CEO receiving a $24 million option grant with vesting over four years. The CEO's stock option at American company is valued at $500,000, with a four-year vesting schedule. In comparison, the CEO at National Widget receives a $5 million option, despite being eligible for retirement. This discrepancy in executive compensation highlights the disparity between the two companies. The SEC revised executive compensation disclosure requirements to provide a more accurate picture of annual compensation. The \"Proxy Disclosure Enhancements\" rule changes address overall employee compensation policies and practices. Congressional proposals focus on additional disclosure to shareholders and limiting deferred amounts under nonqualified plans. Example legislation includes H.R. 4291 from the 109th Congress. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was amended to require reporting issuers to include a comprehensive statement of their compensation plan for executive officers in annual reports and proxy solicitations. This would include details on types of compensation, performance measures, and shareholder approval of the plan. Additionally, disclosure of golden parachute compensation would be required in proxy materials related to acquisitions or mergers. In the 110th Congress, proposals were made to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Internal Revenue Code regarding executive compensation. These proposals aimed to require shareholder votes on executive compensation, impose limitations on deferred compensation, and extend the look-back period for reimbursement under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the 110th Congress, proposals were made to amend laws for executive compensation, including requiring shareholder votes, limiting deferred compensation, and extending reimbursement look-back periods under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, two laws were enacted with executive compensation provisions for specific types of businesses. The Secretary of the Treasury has temporary authority to purchase obligations from federal home loan banks, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, with limitations on executive compensation. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency can prohibit and withhold executive compensation for wrongdoing, including limiting golden parachute payments. Tax deductions for excessive employee remuneration are prohibited, and financial institutions with troubled assets must meet standards for executive compensation, including limits on incentive-based pay. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced to limit executive compensation, including recovery of bonuses, prohibition of golden parachutes, and setting standards for institutions receiving assistance. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 also imposed restrictions on executive compensation for companies receiving funds. The Secretary of the Treasury must establish standards for executive compensation, including limits on incentives for top executives of TARP recipients to avoid excessive risks. Recovery of bonuses and prohibition of golden parachutes are also mandated for executives and highly compensated employees of TARP recipients. The TARP recipient is prohibited from paying bonuses, retention awards, or incentive compensation to the highest paid executives or the next five highest paid employees. However, long-term restricted stock can be paid as compensation under certain conditions. The prohibition does not apply to bonus payments required by written employment contracts before February 11, 2009. Financial institutions receiving $25 million or less in assistance are subject to the prohibition for the highest paid person and at least the five highest paid employees. The TARP recipient must comply with compensation standards set by the Secretary of the Treasury, including limits on bonuses and incentives for top executives and employees based on the amount of financial assistance received. Additionally, a prohibition on manipulating earnings for compensation purposes and a requirement for a Board Compensation Committee are mandated. CEO and CFO certification of compliance is also necessary. The Board Compensation Committee, required for each TARP recipient, must consist of independent directors and review employee compensation plans semiannually. If a TARP recipient's stock is not registered with the SEC and received $25 million or less of TARP assistance, the recipient's board of directors will perform the Committee's duties. The board of directors must have a policy on excessive expenses, including entertainment and office renovations. The TARP recipient's annual shareholder meetings must include a separate vote on executive compensation, which is nonbinding. The Secretary of the Treasury reviews and may require reimbursement of excessive payments to top executives and employees. TARP recipients can repay assistance without restrictions. The Treasury Department issued a rule on executive compensation for firms receiving TARP assistance, limiting bonuses and golden parachute payments. A special master was appointed to review compensation for top executives of companies receiving exceptional government assistance. Treasury and the SEC proposed giving the SEC more authority over executive compensation at publicly traded companies. The SEC may gain more authority over executive compensation at publicly traded companies, including requiring shareholder votes and ensuring independence of compensation committees. Bills have been introduced to recover bonuses paid, with different methods such as authorizing the Attorney General to recover excessive compensation and imposing high taxes on bonuses, like a 90% tax on bonuses from businesses receiving TARP assistance. S. 651 and H.R. 1664 aim to regulate executive compensation for companies receiving federal economic assistance, with measures such as excise taxes on bonuses and limits on deferred compensation. Other bills in the 111th Congress propose say-on-pay rules and shareholder approval for large pay packages. The House Committee on Financial Services also discussed H.R. 3269 regarding executive compensation. The House Committee on Financial Services introduced H.R. 3269, the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009, which included provisions for Say-on-Pay, Independent Compensation Committee, Incentive Based Compensation Disclosure, and Compensation Standards for Financial Institutions. The bill was passed by the House on July 31, 2009, and included in H.R. 4173. Section 2002 of the bill required annual shareholder votes on executive compensation disclosures, but these votes were non-binding. The Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009 introduced provisions for Say-on-Pay, Independent Compensation Committee, Incentive Based Compensation Disclosure, and Compensation Standards for Financial Institutions. The bill required annual shareholder votes on executive compensation disclosures, with non-binding votes. Additionally, there would be disclosure requirements for agreements or understandings executive officers have concerning compensation based on acquisitions, mergers, or sales of the issuer, with a nonbinding shareholder vote on this compensation. Institutional investment managers would need to disclose their votes on executive compensation and golden parachutes. The SEC could exempt certain issuers from the shareholder vote requirements, considering the impact on smaller companies. The Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009 introduced provisions for Say-on-Pay, Independent Compensation Committee, Incentive Based Compensation Disclosure, and Compensation Standards for Financial Institutions. The bill required every national securities exchange or association to prohibit the listing of equity securities of an issuer without a compensation committee of independent members. The committee would have the authority to retain a compensation consultant and independent counsel, who must meet SEC's independence standards. Additionally, federal regulators would issue regulations requiring covered financial institutions to disclose incentive-based compensation arrangements to ensure alignment with sound risk management. The federal regulators covered under the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009 include the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and others. Covered financial institutions must align their incentive-based compensation arrangements with sound risk management to reduce excessive risks that could threaten financial stability. The proposal in Subtitle E of Title IX of the Chairman's Mark on financial regulatory reform requires a separate resolution to approve executive compensation in shareholder meetings, with a non-binding vote. The SEC would prohibit listing securities of issuers not complying with compensation committee rules. The proposal aims to study the link between compensation structures and excessive risk-taking. The proposal on executive compensation disclosures mandates clear description of compensation and relationship to financial performance. Issuers must disclose incentive-based compensation recovery after accounting restatements. Disclosure on employee hedging instruments related to equity securities is required. Prohibitions on excessive compensation and potential financial loss for holding companies of depository institutions are included. The House and Senate passed bills with provisions on executive compensation as part of financial regulatory reform. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act was signed into law in 2010, and the JOBS Act exempted certain companies from regulations for up to five years. The JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion from complying with Dodd-Frank's requirement on shareholder votes for executive compensation. The President signed the bill on April 5, 2012. In Jones v. Harris Associates, the Supreme Court granted certiorari on a case involving mutual fund shareholders suing investment advisers for excessive fees under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Supreme Court decision in Jones v. Harris Associates focused on whether a shareholder's claim of excessive fees under Section 36(b) can be recognized without showing that the adviser misled the fund's directors. The lower court found the fees were not excessive as they were in line with industry standards and shareholders could not prove adviser misconduct. This case may provide insight on how the Court views excessive executive compensation. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a case involving government actions limiting executive compensation. The Court ruled that investors must prove an adviser charged a fee disproportionately large to services rendered to violate fiduciary duty."
