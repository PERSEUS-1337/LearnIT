    "content": "The \"Ponzi Scheme Investor Protection Act of 2010\" adds additional protections for investors in Ponzi schemes by amending the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to include special provisions related to Ponzi schemes. The trustee appointed after a Ponzi scheme determines if the debtor is involved in such a scheme. If confirmed, SIPC is notified, the information is made public, and a timeline for claim consideration is submitted to relevant committees. Indirect Ponzi scheme investors can file a statement of claim. Indirect Ponzi scheme investors have 1 year to file a written claim with the trustee, stating the type and amount of securities held, as well as funds invested but not received statements for. Indirect Ponzi scheme investors must file a claim with the trustee within 1 year, detailing securities held and funds invested without receiving statements. The trustee will coordinate with Ponzi scheme investors to ensure proper payments to indirect investors. After filing a claim, the trustee will deliver securities to indirect Ponzi scheme investors if available to satisfy claims, with partial deliveries made pro rata. The trustee will pay the indirect Ponzi scheme investor a cash amount equal to the value of any securities and funds identified in the claim but not delivered, to the extent practicable. The Ponzi scheme investor may receive a maximum amount of $100,000 in cash and securities recovered from the trustee. The trustee can use funds from SIPC to make payments. The trustee can use funds from SIPC to make payments to the Ponzi scheme investor, who may receive up to $100,000 in cash and securities. By accepting these payments, the indirect Ponzi scheme investor waives the right to sue the Ponzi scheme investor. The value of securities is determined based on the last statement received before the trustee identified the debtor as part of a Ponzi scheme. The trustee determined the debtor was a Ponzi scheme. Securities delivered under certain subsections cannot be used for double payments. Recovery of funds from Ponzi scheme investors is limited to those who were complicit or negligent. The section does not apply if a lawsuit has been filed by an indirect Ponzi scheme investor. The trustee determined the debtor was a Ponzi scheme and customers invested over $1 billion. The Secretary of the Treasury may require future payments under this section to include interest. SIPC will issue regulations for implementation. SIPC will advance funds to the trustee for Ponzi schemes to pay claims and carry out necessary actions under section 8A of the Act. SIPC will modify Fund assessment levels to cover costs of amendments. Definitions will be updated. Section 16 of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 is amended to include definitions related to Ponzi schemes, such as the terms 'Ponzi scheme', 'Ponzi scheme investor', and 'indirect Ponzi scheme investor'. The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 is amended to define terms related to Ponzi schemes, including 'indirect Ponzi scheme investor' as a person who is an investor in a Ponzi scheme investor and has a claim on securities held by the Ponzi scheme for safekeeping or other purposes."
