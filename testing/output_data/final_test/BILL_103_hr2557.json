    "content": "SECTION 1. AMENDMENT. Section 403 of the Social Security Act is amended to allow the Secretary to reduce a State's funding by 50% if they are operating certain welfare assistance programs. The Secretary can reduce a State's funding by 50% for certain welfare programs if they determine that a local government is not complying with the regulations. When a State operates a general welfare assistance program not meeting certain criteria, the State must reduce payments to the administering office by 50% of the Federal share of administrative expenses, which is then paid to the Secretary. The program must provide benefits to able-bodied individuals aged 18 and above without dependents and must not have a workfare program. The State must reduce payments to the administering office by 50% of the Federal share of administrative expenses if it does not have a workfare program meeting participation rate requirements. The participation rate for workfare programs is set to increase by 2% each year. The participation rate for workfare programs must increase by 2% each year. The participation rate is the percentage of able-bodied individuals receiving welfare who participate in a workfare program, with a maximum limit of 50%. The Secretary shall review State and local participation rates in workfare programs and submit recommendations to Congress within 5 years of enactment. The amendment made by section 1 applies to calendar quarters starting on or after July 1, 1994, with exceptions for States needing legislation to comply. States with 2-year legislative sessions are given flexibility in meeting the requirements."
