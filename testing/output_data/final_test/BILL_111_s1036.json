    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009\" and establishes a national surface transportation policy and plan. The \"Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009\" amends Chapter 3 of title 49, United States Code to establish a national surface transportation policy that focuses on advancing national interests, defense, commerce, mobility, and environmental protection through a partnership between government and the private sector. The Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 establishes a national transportation policy focusing on connectivity, safety, security, environmental protection, energy conservation, and international trade. The Secretary of Transportation is responsible for defining the government's role in the transportation system. The Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 focuses on international trade, job creation, responsible land use, sustainable development, system-critical asset preservation, access to the transportation system, financing, and innovation in transportation services and technology. The goals include reducing national per capita motor vehicle miles traveled and motor vehicle-related issues. The Federal Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 aims to reduce national motor vehicle-related fatalities by 50% by 2030, decrease carbon dioxide levels by 40%, reduce transportation delays, improve the state of repair of critical transportation assets, increase public transportation usage, and enhance non-highway freight transportation. The National Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009 aims to reduce non-highway freight transportation by 10% by 2020, decrease transportation delays at international points of entry, ensure adequate transportation of domestic energy supplies, and maintain or reduce the percentage of GDP consumed by transportation costs. The Secretary will develop baselines and methods of data collection to measure goal attainment within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary, under the National Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009, must develop performance criteria and data collection systems for Federal surface transportation programs to assess their consistency with established policy goals. Annual evaluations of these programs will be conducted using the criteria developed. The Secretary must annually evaluate Federal surface transportation programs, make necessary improvements for consistency and effectiveness, align funding with established criteria, and ensure compliance with relevant sections of the law. The section requires the review and update of surface transportation planning requirements to align with established policy goals. Recipients of Federal funds must report annually on fund usage, including project funding rationale and consistency with policy objectives. The Secretary has the authority to amend or develop additional goals to meet policy objectives under the National Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009, with public notice and comment. Recommendations can also be made to relevant committees. The Secretary of Transportation can recommend reorganizing the Department of Transportation to achieve policy goals. Within 2 years of the National Surface Transportation Policy and Planning Act of 2009, a National Surface Transportation Performance Plan must be developed to assess the current system's performance. The National Surface Transportation Performance Plan must include an analysis of trends, impediments, a strategy, initiatives for improvement, and a plan for any necessary reorganization of the Department of Transportation. The Secretary must consult with various stakeholders and provide public notice and hearings when developing the transportation plan. The completed plan must be submitted to specific congressional committees, and biennial progress reports on the plan's implementation are required. The progress report for the transportation plan must describe progress, challenges, updates, and make policy recommendations. The Secretary has the authority to gather necessary data and may use funds from the Department of Transportation for implementation. The Department of Transportation will use funds for surface transportation programs to complete and update the plan and issue progress reports. Conforming amendments are made to sections of title 49, United States Code. The Department of Transportation will use funds for surface transportation programs to complete and update the national surface transportation policy and performance plan."
