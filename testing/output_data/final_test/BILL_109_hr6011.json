    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Coordinated Youth Education, Employment Training, and Residential Treatment Act of 2006\". It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that serious mental, psychological, behavioral, and emotional difficulties affect 1 in 5 United States youth, requiring specialized treatment for successful lives, education, and employment training to prevent delinquent behaviors. However, there is a lack of effective treatment programs for these youth. Many youth with serious mental, psychological, behavioral, and emotional difficulties are kept in juvenile detention facilities and jails for extended periods due to the lack of appropriate treatment options. This confinement can worsen their conditions, despite the lack of professional treatment. Additionally, youth entering residential treatment programs often have experienced multiple placement disruptions and failures in alternative care levels. Residential treatment programs for youth with serious mental, psychological, behavioral, and emotional difficulties provide caring, therapeutic, and cost-effective approaches. These programs offer 24-hour care with professional counseling, therapy, specialized education, and employment training under the supervision of highly trained staff. Multiple placements prior to residential treatment are predictive of poor outcomes and future disruptions affecting a youth's growth.
