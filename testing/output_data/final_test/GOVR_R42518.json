    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits such as medical care, disability compensation, education, and home loan guarantees to eligible veterans. The VA operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), including the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) responsible for maintaining veterans' cemeteries and providing burial benefits. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services and medical research programs to veterans based on military service and disabilities. Veterans must enroll in the VA health care system to receive care, and are assigned to specific categories for services. Not all enrolled veterans receive health care services from the VA each year. In any given year, not all enrolled veterans obtain health care services from VA. Some veterans rely on VA for care, while others use Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, or TRICARE. VA-enrolled veterans do not pay premiums for care but may have out-of-pocket costs for non-service-connected conditions. This report focuses on VHA appropriations, providing an overview of the VA budget, VHA's budget formulation, funding accounts, FY2012 VHA budget summary, and recent legislative developments for FY2013 VHA budget. Recent legislative developments have focused on the FY2013 VHA budget, with Congress enacting the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-81) to authorize advance appropriations for three VHA accounts. The fourth account, for medical and prosthetic research, does not receive advance funding. Advance appropriations were first provided in the FY2010 cycle, with subsequent funding in FY2011 through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117). The legislative developments focused on advance appropriations for VHA accounts starting in FY2010 through various Acts, including P.L. 111-117, P.L. 112-10, P.L. 112-74, and P.L. 113-6, scoring new budget authority in the fiscal year funds become available for obligation. The VA budget for FY2013, authorized by P.L. 112-74, includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. Funding for FY2013 also includes supplemental funding from P.L. 113-2 and P.L. 113-6. In FY2012, the VA budget authority was $122.2 billion, with discretionary funding accounting for 48% ($58.5 billion) and mandatory funding for 52% ($63.8 billion). Discretionary funding mainly supported VA health care programs, while mandatory funding went towards disability compensation and pension programs. The FY2013 President's budget request for the VA included approximately $135.6 billion, with $61 billion in discretionary funding and $74.6 billion in mandatory funding. The VA formulates its budget request based on the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model to estimate resources needed for healthcare services. The Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) is used by the VA to estimate resources needed for healthcare services based on the projected number of veterans enrolled, utilization of services, and unit cost. Projections are made three to four years into the future and updated annually with the most recent data. VHA is funded through four appropriations accounts. The VHA is funded through four appropriations accounts, supplemented by other revenue sources. Congress changed the appropriations structure in FY2004 for better oversight, funding VHA through accounts for medical services, medical administration, and medical facilities. The VHA is funded through four appropriations accounts: medical services, medical administration (now known as medical support and compliance), medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans and dependents, including care in non-VA facilities, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, employee salaries, hospital food service operations, aid to state veterans' homes, and support services for family caregivers of veterans. Funding for biomedical engineering services was proposed to be transferred from the medical facilities account to the medical services account in FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 approved a transfer of funds to the account for expenses related to the management, security, and administration of the VA health care system. This account funds VA medical centers, community-based outpatient clinics, Vet Centers, VISN offices, facility director offices, and various programs related to quality management, training, security, and human resources. The medical facilities account covers expenses for the operations and maintenance of the VHA's capital infrastructure. The expenses covered by this account include utilities, administrative expenses for construction projects at VHA facilities, leases, laundry services, maintenance, housekeeping, and research funding for various types of research conducted by VA investigators. VA researchers also receive funding from other sources such as the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and private sources. VA investigators conduct research at VA facilities and approved off-site locations. Unlike other federal agencies, VA does not have the authority to make research grants to non-VA entities. Congress allows VHA to bill veterans and health insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover medical service costs. Total revenue from medical care cost recovery collections has increased by 25% over the past four fiscal years. Total revenue from medical care cost recovery collections has increased by 25% over the past four fiscal years, reaching nearly $2.8 billion in FY2011. VHA is expecting MCCF total collections to approximate $2.8 billion in FY2012, with a decline in first-party copayments due to fewer veterans with billable insurance. VHA has also experienced a decline in third-party collections as commercial health insurers shift more responsibility to patients for healthcare costs. The VHA's revenue from medical care cost recovery collections has increased by 25% over the past four fiscal years, reaching nearly $2.8 billion in FY2011. In FY2012, VHA expects MCCF total collections to be around $2.8 billion, with a decrease in first-party copayments. The President's FY2012 budget request for VHA was $51.4 billion, reflecting the shift in workload for aging Vietnam-era veterans to Medicare coverage. The President's budget proposed a contingency fund of up to $953 million for additional funds if needed due to economic changes in 2012. $52.5 billion in advance appropriations was requested for medical care accounts for FY2013. The House passed a bill providing $51.1 billion for VHA for FY2012. The Senate passed the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2012, providing $51.2 billion for VHA. Both the House and Senate versions did not approve the President's proposal for a $953 million contingency fund. The bill was not passed before the fiscal year began, leading to short-term funding through continuing resolutions. On December 15, 2011, a conference agreement was reported, titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74) provided $51.2 billion for VHA in FY2012 and $52.5 billion in advance appropriations for FY2013.
