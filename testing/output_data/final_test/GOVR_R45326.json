    "content": "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is led by a civilian Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works (ASACW) who reports to the Secretary of the Army. A military Chief of Engineers oversees civil and military operations, with a civilian Director of Civil Works reporting to them. The agency's civil works responsibilities are organized into eight divisions and 38 districts. The Trump Administration proposed removing USACE civil works from the Department of Defense in June 2018, but this was opposed by Congress in the FY2019 appropriations. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives federal funds for water resource projects, which are not distributed by formula or competitive grants. USACE is directly involved in planning and constructing projects authorized by Congress, including dams, levees, harbors, and waterways maintenance. Congress oversees and funds these geographically specific projects. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) manages deep-draft channels and inland waterways, with nonfederal sponsors sharing project costs. Nonfederal entities are frustrated with USACE's slow completion of studies and construction. Only a subset of authorized USACE projects receive federal funding, leaving many projects unfunded. Approximately $96 billion in authorized USACE construction projects await federal appropriations. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) manages deep-draft channels and inland waterways, with nonfederal sponsors sharing project costs. Congress enacted laws in 2014 and 2016 to expand authorities for USACE projects, increasing flexibility in funding and project delivery options. This has led to increased interest in alternative project delivery and innovative financing for USACE studies and projects. Interest in alternative project delivery and innovative financing, including private financing and public-private partnerships, has increased due to new financing mechanisms authorized by Congress in WRRDA 2014 for water resource projects. Nonfederal entities leading these projects may be eligible for credit or reimbursement for investments exceeding the required nonfederal share of costs, subject to federal appropriations. Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to USACE projects is required for nonfederal entities. Congress typically funds USACE water resource activities through an annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. Since the 112th Congress, site-specific project line items added by Congress have been subject to earmark moratoriums, resulting in competition for funds among authorized activities during the budget development and appropriations processes. Appropriators have refrained from inserting funds for specific projects not requested in the President's budget, leading to post-enactment agency work plans. In post-enactment agency work plans, Congress guides the Administration on prioritizing activities for USACE projects. Congress also authorizes flood fighting activities and repairs for nonfederal flood control works, often providing supplemental funds for these purposes. Additionally, Congress has funded new flood control projects in areas affected by recent disasters, including in BBA 2018. Congress has funded construction of new flood control projects in response to recent disasters, providing almost $45 billion in supplemental appropriations since FY2005. This includes $24 billion for construction projects, with $15 billion allocated in BBA 2018. Congress often appropriates more for USACE civil works than requested by the President, specifying projects to receive funds in accompanying reports. USACE projects receive appropriated funds primarily through the Construction and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) accounts in annual appropriations bills. Congress has limited new project-specific funding amounts since FY2010, focusing instead on providing additional funding for various USACE activities and guiding its use. The O&M account has seen a growing portion of annual appropriations, increasing from 39% in recent years. The O&M account for USACE projects has seen a significant increase in annual appropriations, rising from 39% in recent years to 53% in FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019. This shift reflects a focus on completing existing projects and addressing aging infrastructure, with limited funding for new construction activities. Congress has allowed the initiation of a specified number of new construction projects using enacted appropriations bills since FY2014. Additionally, the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE) account is used for flood fighting, emergency response preparedness, and repair of certain nonfederal flood control works. The Mississippi River and Tributaries account (MR&T) includes flood control and navigation projects for the lower Mississippi River Valley. The President's budget request for USACE typically includes funding information at the account level. Detailed information can be found in the agency's budget justification, which identifies funding levels for specific activities such as studies and construction projects. USACE also publishes a summary of this information in a document known as the press book. The press book displays funding requests for USACE projects by state and how the President's requests are distributed across agency business lines. Congress has historically funded projects not in the President's request and provided more funding than requested for others. Congressional funding for site-specific projects has been subject to earmark moratoriums since the 112th Congress. Since the 112th Congress, Congress has provided additional funding for specific categories of work within some USACE budget accounts instead of earmarks. Recent appropriations cycles have included additional funding categories for various types of USACE projects, with directions and limitations on fund use. USACE reports back to Congress on how these funds will be allocated at the project level. Recent levels of additional funding are detailed in work plans developed after the appropriations bill is enacted. For example, in P.L. 115-244, Congress provided $2.21 billion more than the President's request for FY2019. The Congress has provided additional funding for specific categories of work within USACE budget accounts instead of earmarks since the 112th Congress. Recent appropriations cycles have included additional funding categories for various types of USACE projects, with directions and limitations on fund use. In P.L. 115-244, $2.21 billion more than the President's request for FY2019 was provided, with $2.07 billion identified for 25 categories of USACE activities in four budget accounts. The accompanying conference report calls for USACE to issue a work plan within 60 days of enactment, detailing the specific amount of additional funding for each project. These work plans typically consist of tables listing the projects, the amount of additional funding for each project, and sometimes a brief description of the project goals. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) administers two trust funds, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF), which require annual appropriations for federal navigation infrastructure. HMTF funds are mainly for maintenance, while IWTF funds are for construction. HMTF is funded by taxes on waterborne cargo, while IWTF is funded by a fuel tax on barge fuel. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has developed a surplus balance of nearly $10 billion, while the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) has had limited funds for waterway construction. Both trust funds were addressed in 2014 legislation, and spending from both has increased. Future appropriations legislation will determine if there will be increased spending on navigation. H.R. 1908 proposes to make harbor maintenance tax collections available for authorized harbor maintenance. In January 2017, USACE estimated the cost of coastal navigation channels maintenance at $7.6 billion over five years, with $1.2 billion used in FY2017. The economic benefits vary depending on dredging costs and improved navigation conditions. Inland waterway costs are shared by the federal government and commercial users through the IWTF. The IWTF funding comes primarily from a fuel tax on commercial vessels on designated federal waterways. Congress authorized a $0.09 per gallon increase in the fuel tax in P.L. 113-295, resulting in a barge fuel tax of $0.29 per gallon. The Administration proposed a new user fee on vessels transporting commercial cargo on inland waterways in FY2019. Congress, in P.L. 115-244, decreased the IWTF contribution to the Chickamauga Lock construction from 50% to 15% during FY2019 to expand funding for other inland navigation projects. In FY2019, Congress decreased the IWTF contribution to the Chickamauga Lock construction from 50% to 15% to expand funding for other inland navigation projects. This cost-sharing model is similar to what was enacted for the completion of the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River. The Olmsted project, with a total construction cost of $2.78 billion, is expected to be completed in FY2019. Additionally, USACE receives supplemental appropriations for flood disaster response and recovery activities, totaling almost $50.63 billion from FY1990 through FY2018. Since FY1990, USACE has received almost $50.63 billion in supplemental appropriations, with over $49.20 billion provided from FY2005 through FY2018. Of this amount, nearly $44.63 billion (91%) was allocated for disaster response and recovery, with $4.58 billion (9%) for economic stimulus under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The majority of the disaster funding was for storms in three years, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) received around $23.10 billion for flood-related activities from FY2005 to FY2018 through Energy and Water Development appropriations. Congress considers various issues when deliberating on USACE supplemental appropriations, such as supporting flood damage reduction efforts, authorizing construction of projects, and determining nonfederal cost sharing requirements. Funding provided to USACE through supplemental appropriations has increased over the last three decades. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives funding for flood-related activities, with Congress deliberating on supplemental appropriations for projects and cost-sharing requirements. Policy topics include transparency in funding use, supporting nonfederal interests in flood control projects, and determining construction funding levels. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) receives funding for flood-related activities, with Congress deliberating on supplemental appropriations for projects. P.L. 113-2 required reports on USACE funds for Hurricane Sandy recovery. ASACW provided policy guidance for BBA 2018 funds implementation. USACE released tables listing projects receiving BBA 2018 funding. The ASACW guidance for BBA 2018 funds includes a statement encouraging non-Federal participation in projects funded through various accounts. Section 1043 of WRRDA 2014 allows for federal funds to be transferred to nonfederal interests for studies and projects. Section 1043 of WRRDA 2014 allows federal funds to be transferred to nonfederal interests for studies and projects, with upfront funding. USACE has not released implementation guidance for this provision, and there is no indication of its use for transferring annual or supplemental appropriations. Congress has provided supplemental funding for various USACE accounts, including the FCCE, O&M, and Construction accounts. BBA 2018 allocated 87% of funds for USACE. BBA 2018 allocated 87% of its funding to the USACE Construction account, with $55 million for flood damage repairs and $15.0 billion for flood risk reduction projects. Supplemental funds for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy also went to the Construction account. However, Congress has not provided supplemental appropriations for other post-disaster USACE construction projects. Total supplemental construction appropriations from FY2005 to FY2018 amounted to $23.76 billion. In FY2018, supplemental construction appropriations totaled $23.76 billion, with almost $12.83 billion allocated for riverine and coastal flood control projects. The enactment of BBA 2018 led to increased funding for flood-related construction projects, surpassing annual appropriations from FY2005 to FY2018. These supplemental appropriations are typically designated for USACE activities in flood-affected areas, states, or territories, with a significant portion allocated to projects not previously funded for construction. Supplemental appropriations for USACE flood control projects in natural disaster-affected areas may waive standard requirements like cost shares and project cost increase limitations. Supporters see these projects as part of recovery efforts to improve flood resilience. Congress may provide special considerations for these funds, such as designated emergency funding and waiving nonfederal cost-share requirements. The report describes four shifts in the funding of USACE activities, including a shift to Operations and Maintenance where an increasing share of annual discretionary appropriations is used for O&M activities. Congress has also provided additional funding categories of work through Administration Work Plans. Since FY2005, Congress has allocated over $44.6 billion in supplemental appropriations to USACE for flood-related projects, with nearly $23.8 billion for control projects. The Administration determines which projects receive these funds, with limited project-level details provided in post-enactment work plans. Nonfederal entities may lead studies and construction activities funded by USACE. Since 2014, Congress has expanded authorizing authorities for nonfederal entities to lead USACE studies and construction projects, with the Administration showing interest in using this authority to provide federal funds upfront for nonfederal-led projects. BBA 2018 eliminated the nonfederal cost share for studies and may fund ongoing construction projects, raising questions about Congress's role in USACE appropriations and the agency's use of funds. In the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123), Congress provided $17.398 billion in supplemental appropriations to various U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) accounts for flood risk reduction projects. This raises questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of annual and supplemental appropriations processes in supporting priority investments in reducing the nation's flood risk. In the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Congress allocated $17.398 billion in supplemental appropriations to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers accounts for flood risk reduction projects. This includes $15 billion for expedited construction of flood and storm damage reduction projects, with specific allocations for various purposes such as Mississippi River and Tributaries, Operations and Maintenance, Flood Control, and Coastal Emergencies. These funds are designated as emergency requirements and are not subject to statutory limits on discretionary spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocated $17.398 billion to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood risk reduction projects. $15 billion is for expedited construction of flood and storm damage reduction projects in states affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. $4.575 billion is for flood and storm damage reduction construction activities in states with multiple flood-related major disaster declarations in recent years. Some states and territories are eligible for all funding, some for some of the funds, and some do not qualify. Some states and territories qualify for funding from both the $10.425 billion and the $4.575 billion for USACE projects. A total of 33 states and 3 territories are eligible for $4.575 billion in BBA 2018 funds for construction projects. Seventeen states, including North Carolina, do not qualify for USACE supplemental construction appropriations provided by the BBA 2018. The BBA 2018 provides funding for construction projects in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with ongoing projects being 100% federally funded. Most of the $15 billion in funds have been assigned to specific USACE projects, leaving $1.131 billion unassigned. Policy guidance was issued on the implementation of these appropriations. The BBA 2018 provides funding for ongoing construction projects, with specific criteria for identifying such projects. $135 million is allocated for the Investigation account, with $75 million designated for states affected by hurricanes and $60 million for high-priority studies in any state or territory. The BBA 2018 provides funding for high-priority studies of projects in states with multiple flood-related disaster declarations in CY2014-2017. Study costs are 100% federal when using these funds. The legislation amends Congress's role in authorizing construction projects that receive supplemental USACE funds. Title IV of BBA 2018 allocates $15 billion for flood and storm damage reduction projects, allowing some projects to proceed to construction without specific congressional authorization. This includes projects currently authorized, those authorized after the enactment of the subdivision, and projects with signed Chief's Reports or studied using funds under \"Investigations\" if deemed feasible, justified, and acceptable by the Secretary. The legislation also deviates from the standard authorization process for using USACE funds from the Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriation, while still involving the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Division B, Title X, Chapter 4. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 allocates funds for Hurricane Sandy-related construction projects along the Atlantic Coast. The Act transfers unobligated balances to the USACE accounts for this purpose. The August 9, 2018, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works guidance for BBA 2018 does not specify how transferred funds for Hurricane Sandy-related construction projects are to be used."
