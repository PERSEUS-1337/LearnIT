    "content": "Modern U.S. government-funded international broadcasting began during World War II with the creation of the Voice of America, expanding its services to regions like the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Debates over the effectiveness and necessity of U.S. international broadcasting have persisted since the 1990s. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) has faced criticism for its structure, including weak leadership, overlapping management structures, duplicative programming, and inefficient administrative management. Current legislation in Congress aims to address these issues and debates surrounding U.S. international broadcasting persist. Issues surrounding the BBG and U.S. international broadcasting include problems with Board operations, strategic direction, shifts in communication technologies, efficiency improvements, role in foreign policy, and effectiveness assessment. The structure and aims of U.S. government-funded broadcasting have evolved over seven decades. U.S. government-funded broadcasting to foreign countries has evolved over seven decades, adapting to global political shifts and technological advancements. Beginning in World War II, broadcasting aimed to inform audiences, initially established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt without congressional authorization. During World War II, the Office of War Information created the Voice of America (VOA) to broadcast accurate news to Europe. VOA continued its operations after the war, eventually being transferred to the Department of State in 1945. President Eisenhower later placed VOA under the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) until its abolition in 1999. The U.S. government established Radio in the American Sector (RIAS) in 1946 in West Berlin, broadcasting to East Germany. RIAS operated as a partnership between the U.S. and West Germany, providing radio and television programming. With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, funding for RIAS ceased, and the service ended in the early 1990s. Additionally, the U.S. government supported Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) for broadcasting to Central and Eastern Europe. Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) were established in the early 1950s to broadcast to Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Both services were overseen by private U.S. corporations but were conceived by the State Department and received funding from the CIA. They aimed to encourage liberation from communist rule and counter propaganda from the Soviet and other communist governments. Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) utilized \u00e9migr\u00e9 broadcasting professionals to provide programming focused on the domestic matters of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. By the late 1950s, their focus shifted to encouraging gradual liberalization and democratization of communist systems in the region. They also developed internal research departments for intelligence and analysis based on media sources from the Communist Bloc and Western Europe. In 1971, the CIA stopped funding Radio Free Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL). In 1973, the Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) was created to oversee and fund RFE and RL. The BIB was an independent federal agency that provided funding to RFE and RL. In 1976, RFE and RL merged to form RFE/RL, Inc., adapting their programming for Soviet and European audiences. Critics had accused RFE/RL of broadcasting propaganda, but they transitioned to a surrogate broadcaster role. In 1963, USIA began producing television programming for the first time and created its WORLDNET satellite television service in 1983. WORLDNET transmitted its programming through USIS posts, U.S. embassies, and foreign television networks. In 2004, WORLDNET merged into VOA. Congress authorized separate services targeting Cuba, leading to the creation of Radio Mart\u00ed in 1983 and TV Mart\u00ed in 1988 under the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) within USIA's Bureau of Broadcasting. The Mart\u00eds were established as surrogate broadcasters in Cuba under the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) within USIA's Bureau of Broadcasting. Congress abolished the BIB and reorganized U.S. international broadcasting services under the Broadcasting Board of Governors within USIA with the enactment of the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994. The USIB Act aimed to ensure broadcasting independence while receiving guidance from the Secretary of State to produce credible international broadcasting supportive of U.S. foreign policy objectives. Radio Free Asia (RFA) was authorized by Congress in 1994 to provide accurate news to countries in East Asia with restricted press access, including China, Tibet, Xinjiang, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, and North Korea. Radio Free Asia (RFA) was authorized in 1994 to provide accurate news to countries in East Asia with restricted press access, including China, Tibet, Xinjiang, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, and North Korea. The Foreign Affairs Agencies Consolidation Act of 1998 abolished USIA and streamlined U.S. government entities in international affairs after the Cold War. The act preserved the BBG as an independent government agency overseeing U.S. international broadcasting, including the International Broadcasting Bureau. After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government enhanced communication with the Middle East and North Africa to counter extremism. The BBG increased VOA broadcasting to the region in 2002, creating the Middle East Radio Network (MERN) for larger, younger audiences. Plans were made to establish a new nonprofit corporation for broadcasting to the Middle East, separate from VOA. The BBG, funded by Congress, oversees the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN) which includes Alhurra television and Radio Sawa. It is an independent agency of the U.S. government that operates global broadcasting organizations with varied missions and programming. The Broadcasting Board of Governors directs and oversees all U.S. government-funded nonmilitary broadcasting, providing executive leadership for individual broadcasters under its authority. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) oversees U.S. international broadcasting programs with a bipartisan membership of eight appointed governors. The Secretary of State serves as the ninth voting member, with the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs as the Secretary's representative. The Board is assisted by an Executive Director and oversees the International Broadcasting Bureau responsible for maintaining the broadcasting network. The BBG oversees U.S. international broadcasters like VOA, OCB, RFE/RL, RFA, and MBN, serving as a \"firewall\" to ensure their independence. While required to consider U.S. foreign policy, broadcasters must adhere to diverse broadcasting standards and principles outlined in the USIB Act. The BBG oversees U.S. international broadcasters like VOA, OCB, RFE/RL, RFA, and MBN, ensuring their independence and adherence to broadcasting standards. VOA aims to represent America comprehensively, promote human rights, provide diverse programming, and avoid undue influence from the State Department. The Secretary of State and the Board respect the professional independence of broadcasters, with the Secretary providing foreign policy guidance to the Board. The USIB Act ensures representation of U.S. foreign policy interests in strategic decision making. The BBG oversees the International Broadcasting Bureau and is transitioning to a new Chief Executive Officer position. Currently, an interim three-person IBB management team is in place. The IBB implements the BBG's strategic vision, supports broadcasting services like Voice of America and Office of Cuba Broadcasting, and provides oversight over grantee broadcasters. The International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) provides technology and transmission services to U.S. international broadcasters overseen by the BBG. It conducts audience research, financial tasks, and media training programs. The IBB maintains broadcast networks, contracts with media affiliates, combats foreign jamming, and supports anti-censorship efforts for targeted populations. VOA broadcasts in 45 languages. The U.S. government blocks Internet access to news sites, including VOA broadcasts in 45 languages reaching 165 million people. VOA aims to provide reliable news and American perspectives, with editorial comments allowed by the government. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting also airs Radio and TV Mart\u00ed programs. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) broadcasts Radio and TV Mart\u00ed programs to Cuba from its facilities in Florida, aiming to provide news and information to the Cuban people. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) oversees Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, promoting freedom and democracy in Cuba. BBG also supervises other grantee broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and Radio Free Asia (RFA), funding their operations targeting different regions. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia are surrogate broadcasters operating under grants from the BBG. They provide news and information in multiple languages to countries in Eastern Europe, Russia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, where free media is limited or transitioning from totalitarian control. Radio Free Asia focuses on delivering accurate news to Asian countries with restricted press freedom. Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Inc. provides news and information to the Arabic-speaking population of the Middle East. Operating under a grant agreement with the BBG, MBN's mission is to provide news about the region, the world, and the United States, including U.S. government policies. MBN networks include Alhurra, which serves as a surrogate programming for VOA's Arabic service. MBN, funded by Congress, provides news to the Middle East through networks like Alhurra and Radio Sawa. BBG measures performance using audience size and reach. In FY2016, VOA, RFE/RL, and MBN saw audience growth, while RFA's decreased. Audience reach is a key metric for BBG. The BBG measures performance through audience reach and qualitative aspects like program credibility, understanding, and uniqueness. Performance measurements are provided under these metrics. The BBG measures performance through audience reach, program credibility, understanding, and uniqueness. Positive results were shown in performance measurements for FY2013. Some critics suggest that high numbers may be due to relying on regular audience members for credibility. Measuring broadcasting to Cuba is challenging as audience research is not accessible. The BBG conducts annual reviews of each language service, including data on performance criteria and information from independent sources on stability and political freedom. The BBG evaluates performance based on audience reach, credibility, understanding, and uniqueness. It reviews language services annually, considering stability, political freedom, and press freedom in target countries. The agency also assesses media competition and government restrictions on distribution. The BBG independently submits budget requests and may recommend eliminating services in countries with improved freedoms. Appropriations and budget numbers for the BBG, IBB, and U.S. international broadcasters are detailed from FY2015 to the FY2017 request.

The agency also assesses media competition and government restrictions on distribution. Appropriations and budget numbers for the BBG, IBB, and U.S. international broadcasters are detailed from FY2015 to the FY2017 request. The BBG recently reported worldwide audiences for U.S. international broadcasters of over 200 million people. U.S. international broadcasters are effective sources of news and information, especially in times of crises. While the goals and objectives of U.S. international broadcasting have been broadly supported, the BBG as an agency has often faced criticism. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) for not effectively countering extremist narratives and abdicating the ideological arena. She highlighted the importance of conveying a positive narrative globally and emphasized the need for the BBG to fulfill its role in promoting American values and ideals. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) for not effectively countering extremist narratives and abdicating the ideological arena. Recommendations for reform have been proposed to make the BBG more effective, citing flaws in its structure and leadership. The current part-time, rotating, volunteer Board members are seen as less effective than full-time executive leadership. Several reports have recommended changes to the composition of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), calling for more experienced members and experts in various fields. Recommendations also include reforms to increase member engagement and attendance at meetings. The BBG has made changes to address these issues, including potentially replacing the current Board with an executive board consisting of representatives from major U.S. news organizations. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is a U.S. international broadcaster funded by the government. Critics argue that individual Governors interfere with operations instead of focusing on oversight. Plans were made in 2011 to create a CEO position to centralize authority and oversee broadcasting efforts more effectively. The BBG proposed creating a CEO position to centralize authority and oversee U.S. international broadcasting operations, allowing the Board to focus on strategic direction. Critics question if this reform is sufficient for coordinating overall broadcasting direction and reducing duplication. The CEO role aims to increase efficiency and cooperation among independent broadcasters. The BBG proposed creating a CEO position to centralize authority and oversee U.S. international broadcasting operations, aiming to increase efficiency and cooperation among independent broadcasters. The CEO may face opposition from entrenched broadcasting units, but steps have been taken to improve effectiveness and realize cost savings through streamlining language services and transitioning to new technologies. The Board is tasked with deciding whether to end a language service based on access to free press and other factors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlights the opportunity for the BBG to consolidate overlapping language services to achieve cost savings. The BBG does not consider international broadcasting activities of other democracies, such as the BBC, Deutsche Welle, and RFI. U.S. legislation suggests winding down redundant government-funded efforts. The BBG acknowledges the need for further streamlining but cites various reasons for not doing so. The BBG has proposed streamlining language services, but Congress has directed to maintain current levels. US legislation requires overlap in services and different communication missions, making US international broadcasting necessary. The BBG is facing criticism for plans to refocus resources on new technologies for U.S. international broadcasting, reducing radio programming while increasing online dissemination. Some argue that short-wave radio is still the best option for reaching audiences in countries with jamming efforts by repressive governments. The BBG is facing criticism for plans to refocus resources on new technologies for U.S. international broadcasting, reducing radio programming while increasing online dissemination. Some argue that short-wave radio is still the best option for reaching audiences in countries with jamming efforts by repressive governments. However, maintaining a mix of dissemination technologies, including traditional media like radio, is essential for broad reach and effective penetration of target markets. The BBG and VOA have proposed cuts to radio broadcasts in certain countries and languages, but overall U.S. international broadcasting provides a mix of different dissemination methods. The BBG is considering consolidating its broadcasting entities to improve strategic direction and efficiency. This would result in an organization similar to the BBC World Service, providing a mix of dissemination technologies tailored to target audiences. Market research shows high radio usage in African countries, where radio broadcasting, including short-wave, will be maintained. Critics argue that creating a CEO may not be enough to improve efficiency and resource utilization. Some suggest consolidating U.S. international broadcasting to resemble the BBC World Service for better efficiency and credibility. This entity could be de-federalized but still funded by the U.S. government, possibly under a strong foreign policy agency like the State Department. Proponents argue that maintaining separate broadcasters like VOA, RFE/RL, RFA, OCB, and MBN is crucial to fulfill the mission of U.S. international broadcasting. Consolidation may reduce the effectiveness of individual broadcasters' programming, as a large entity may prioritize different regions or types of programming. Most observers believe that maintaining the individual broadcaster brands is important even in the case of consolidation. The importance of maintaining individual broadcaster brands like VOA and RFE/RL is crucial for U.S. international broadcasting to provide balanced reporting and fill gaps in coverage in countries with limited media freedom. U.S. international broadcasters are required to offer complete and balanced coverage, including all sides of important issues and government policies, not just the official U.S. government position. U.S. international broadcasting is mandated to advance U.S. foreign policy by informing foreign audiences in a balanced and objective manner. The mission is to inform, engage, and connect people worldwide in support of freedom and democracy, benefiting U.S. foreign policy by demonstrating the U.S. government's commitment to empowering repressed populations through a free media. U.S. international broadcasters provide a necessary counterweight to one-sided public diplomacy efforts, promoting open discussion and dissenting views on U.S. policies. Concerns exist about the effectiveness of U.S. international broadcasting in advancing foreign policy goals and national security interests. Some argue for U.S. international broadcasting to counter anti-American sentiment with balanced programming and better coordination with public diplomacy efforts. Recommendations include involving higher-level officials in programming decisions and potentially placing broadcasters under a new coordinating agency. Some argue for U.S. international broadcasters to remain independent from the State Department to maintain credibility and journalistic integrity. If broadcasters lose credibility, they may not effectively promote democracy through demonstrating a free press in nondemocratic countries. The effectiveness of U.S. international broadcasting in promoting democracy and U.S. interests is measured through professional programming and performance evaluations. However, global research shows low favorability towards the United States in regions targeted by U.S. surrogate broadcasters, such as the Middle East, Russia, and China. Critics argue that U.S. international broadcasting has not effectively advanced U.S. foreign policy and democracy in regions like the Middle East, Russia, and China. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) emphasizes the importance of quality, objective programming to reach a wider audience and fulfill its mission. In 2015, the United States International Communications Reform Act was introduced in Congress. The United States International Communications Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 2323) was introduced by co-sponsors and aims to restructure U.S. international broadcasting due to operational deficiencies. The bill seeks to address issues within the BBG and redefine the missions of international broadcasters. If enacted, it would repeal the USIB Act and implement new provisions to improve broadcasting effectiveness. The new bill aims to abolish the BBG and establish the United States International Communications Agency (USICA). The USICA Board, mirroring the BBG's bipartisan structure, would have an advisory role while the CEO would hold most authorities. The bill would dissolve the IBB, integrating its functions into the USICA under the CEO's authority to enhance coordination and focus on the mission of broadcast entities. The bill requires the USICA and the new grantee surrogate \"Freedom News Network\" (FNN) to coordinate operations, share resources, and align U.S. international broadcasting with foreign policy interests. Broadcasting standards are restated in the bill for all broadcasters, VOA, and FNN, with a sharper focus on explaining the United States, government policies, and international news. The bill emphasizes a public diplomacy mission for VOA, requiring reporting on the impact of U.S. foreign assistance. It integrates elements of the historic VOA charter into new VOA principles, emphasizing its role in providing objective news coverage. The bill also establishes a new VOA director position under the supervision of the USICA CEO and consolidates grantee broadcasters into the \"Freedom News Network\" (FNN). The bill establishes a new VOA director position under USICA, integrates VOA principles, and consolidates grantee broadcasters into the \"Freedom News Network\" (FNN). FNN's board would be separate from current grantees, with plans to expand programming into new regions. OCB will remain within the federal government under USICA. The bill's mission provision for FNN sharpens the legislative vision for surrogate programming, promoting democracy, civil society, free media, political freedom, and uncensored information flows in areas lacking democratic rule and press freedom. Eligibility for U.S. international broadcasters supervised by USICA is defined, with an aim to efficiently eliminate language services as media freedom increases in targeted countries. No USICA employee, except the CEO, can mandate under the bill. The bill mandates that USICA employees, except the CEO and VOA director, cannot be paid above grade GS-15, step 10. It also freezes GS-14 and GS-15 positions for five years. Reporting to Congress on workforce size, organization structure, contracting methods, and language services performance is required. The House version of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 includes reforms to U.S. international broadcasting and the BBG. The House adopted an amended version of S. 2943, which included provisions from H.R. 4909. The enacted 2017 NDAA broadens the role of the BBG CEO, replacing the BBG Board with a permanent CEO position and creating a successor advisory board. The CEO is authorized to direct broadcasting and reform efforts within the agency. The 2017 NDAA broadens the CEO's role within the agency, giving them personnel appointment and procurement authority, the ability to change the agency's name, establish a new grantee broadcaster, and merge existing grantees into one surrogate broadcaster. The CEO can also appoint the board of any grantee broadcaster."
