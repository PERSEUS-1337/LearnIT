The USDA's FSIS inspects meat, poultry, and processed egg products for safety and labeling. Changes in meat and poultry inspection programs were made in the 2008 farm bill, allowing state-inspected products to enter interstate commerce and mandating USDA inspection for catfish. Recently, there have been discussions about improving safety oversight of meat and poultry production, including requiring establishments to notify USDA of adulterated products and preparing recall plans. The law requires USDA inspection of all amenable species for human consumption, including cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry. Catfish was added as an amenable species in 2008. Poultry inspection is mandatory for domesticated birds like chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese. FSIS also offers voluntary inspection for buffalo. Under the law, FSIS provides voluntary inspection for buffalo, antelope, reindeer, elk, migratory waterfowl, game birds, and rabbits on a fee-for-service basis. These species fall under FDA jurisdiction under the FFDCA, even if inspected by FSIS. FSIS ensures the safety of liquid, frozen, and dried egg products, while FDA regulates shell eggs in restaurants and stores. FSIS inspection begins when animals arrive. FSIS is responsible for inspecting slaughterhouses and processing plants to ensure compliance with regulations. Approval is required before any meat or poultry products can be processed for human consumption. Plants must follow strict rules regarding sanitation, equipment cleanliness, and operational procedures, including having a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan in place. Under HACCP regulations, plants must identify critical control points, have a plan to control contamination, and maintain records. USDA inspectors ensure compliance with site-specific SOPs for sanitation. FSIS inspects meat and poultry animals before and after slaughter for signs of disease and contamination on a continuous basis. Federal inspectors are present during all operating hours, with no animal slaughtered without examination. Inspection statutes do not specify how frequently USDA inspectors must visit facilities producing processed products like hot dogs and lunch meat. Under current policies, processing plants producing products like hot dogs, lunch meat, and soups are visited daily by FSIS inspectors for continuous inspection. Inspectors monitor operations, check sanitary conditions, examine ingredients and packaging, review records, verify HACCP processes, and conduct microbial testing for E. coli and Salmonella. Test results help verify plant sanitation procedures and identify areas for improvement. FSIS has enforcement tools to prevent adulterated meat and poultry from reaching consumers, including halting plant operations for unsanitary conditions, condemning contaminated products, and requesting voluntary recalls. The agency relies on establishments to recall potentially dangerous products and can resort to court-ordered seizures if necessary. FSIS has enforcement tools to prevent adulterated meat and poultry from reaching consumers, including halting plant operations for unsanitary conditions, condemning contaminated products, and requesting voluntary recalls. The agency can resort to court-ordered product seizures and criminal prosecution if necessary, potentially leading to plant closure. FSIS is funded through federal appropriations and industry fees, with approximately $1 billion allocated in FY2010. The agency has about 9,400 staff members, including 1,000 veterinarians. Approximately 7,800 FSIS employees, including 1,000 veterinarians, work in 6,200 establishments nationwide. Twenty-seven states have their own inspection programs, funded partially by FSIS. State-inspected products are limited to intrastate commerce. FSIS takes over inspection in states without programs, but state personnel conduct the inspections. The Talmadge-Aiken Act of 1962 established a federal-state program for meat and poultry inspections in remote locations. FSIS evaluates foreign meat safety programs to ensure they meet U.S. standards before allowing imports into the country. Meat and poultry import shipments must clear the Department of Agriculture at U.S. ports of entry. When meat and poultry import shipments reach U.S. ports of entry, they undergo Department of Homeland Security inspection to ensure they come from disease-free countries. This responsibility was transferred from USDA to DHS in 2002. After DHS inspection, the shipments are cleared by FSIS at one of 150 nearby facilities for interstate commerce. Despite efforts to prevent foodborne infections, progress in national health objectives has stalled. Progress toward national health objectives has plateaued, indicating ongoing issues with bacterial and parasitic contamination. Despite some declines in pathogen incidence before 2004, current data shows Salmonella is far from its 2010 target. The lack of recent progress highlights gaps in the food safety system, necessitating continued development and evaluation of safety practices. In 2006, a CDC report identified multiple foodborne disease outbreaks not solely linked to meat and poultry consumption. In 2006, there were 243 foodborne disease outbreaks linked to a single commodity. The most outbreaks were associated with fish, poultry, and beef, while the most cases were linked to poultry, leafy vegetables, and fruits/nuts. Pathogens like Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella, and norovirus were found in specific commodities. Recent recalls of meat and poultry products due to contamination have raised concerns about pathogen detection and prevention. Despite government claims of declining recalls and illnesses, there are ongoing issues with food safety. In the early 1990s, FSIS implemented testing for pathogenic bacteria on meat and poultry to address public health risks. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system was proposed in 1995 to analyze and monitor production risks, ensuring corrective actions are taken when necessary. Record-keeping and verification are essential components of this system. FSIS implemented testing for pathogenic bacteria on meat and poultry in the early 1990s. The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system was proposed in 1995 to monitor production risks and take corrective actions when necessary. Since January 2000, all slaughter and processing operations are required to have HACCP plans in place. CDC reports that Salmonella infections from poultry and other foods have not significantly decreased. In the early years of HACCP implementation, USDA could shut down plants failing Salmonella tests, but a court ruling in 2000 prevented this. USDA can still use Salmonella standards for verification of sanitation and HACCP plans, but enforcement actions are debated until safe Salmonella levels are determined. FSIS launched an initiative in 2006 to reduce Salmonella in meat and poultry products by increasing inspection resources and implementing quarterly reporting of test results. This was in response to concerns about rising Salmonella rates in poultry products from 2003-2005. FSIS implemented new policies in 2008 for Salmonella sampling and testing, including posting test results online for establishments with substandard records. The agency took this action due to inconsistent testing practices in young chicken slaughter establishments. Plants are categorized based on their Salmonella test results, with Category 1 having results below 10% of the standard. In 2008, FSIS implemented new policies for Salmonella sampling and testing, categorizing plants based on test results. Category 1 has results below 10% of the standard, Category 2 above 10% but below 20%, and Category 3 above 20%. In 2009, 21 Category 2 or 3 plants out of 195 tested were named, with 12 in Category 2 and 4 in Category 3. The CDC credited the industry's response to the FSIS Salmonella initiative for reducing the percent-positive rate in raw broiler chicken from 11.4% in 2006 to 7.3% in 2008. The Obama Administration announced new food safety actions in 2009 to reduce Salmonella in poultry, specifically young chickens and turkeys. The FSIS planned to establish new standards and verification programs by 2010. Additionally, new standards for Campylobacter in poultry were being developed. This initiative was in response to concerns about Salmonella contamination, as seen in recalls of ground beef. Recalls of ground beef products in 2009 raised concerns about food safety, including Salmonella outbreaks. The recalls were associated with investigations of illness outbreaks. Danielle International of Rhode Island also had recalls through February 2010. Danielle International of Rhode Island recalled 30 Italian-style meat products totaling 1.4 million pounds due to a Salmonella outbreak affecting 252 people in 44 states. Black pepper used in the products tested positive for Salmonella, highlighting the risk of outside ingredients. The FDA is working with FSIS on the recall. Concerns about E. coli O157:H7 in beef products have led to calls for improved testing and control measures. Critics advocate for more mandated tests, while the meat industry emphasizes the importance of effective sampling and testing programs. E. coli O157:H7 is a harmful strain of Escherichia coli that can cause severe illness. It was first identified in 1982 during an outbreak linked to contaminated hamburgers. Infections can also come from undercooked ground beef, contaminated bean sprouts, and leafy vegetables. Person-to-person transmission is possible, as well as infection from raw milk or sewage-contaminated water. Testing can help determine the effectiveness of pathogen control measures, but it cannot guarantee safety. The CDC reported that infections from E. coli O157:H7 can occur after consuming raw milk or swimming in sewage-contaminated water. The incidence of foodborne infections caused by this strain had declined significantly until 2004 but not since then. The CDC highlighted the need for more effective prevention after outbreaks in 2006 linked to contaminated spinach and lettuce. Efforts are needed to control the pathogen in cattle and prevent its spread to other food products like produce. The CDC reported an increase in E. coli O157:H7 contamination in ground beef samples from 0.24% in 2007 to 0.47% in 2008. FSIS announced multiple recalls in 2006, 2007, and 2008 due to E. coli concerns, with some linked to human illnesses. The recalls totaled millions of pounds of ground beef products. In 2008, Nebraska Beef had two large recalls totaling 6.66 million pounds of beef products due to E. coli contamination, leading to illnesses. In 2009, FSIS announced 15 E. coli-related recalls, with four linked to illness outbreaks. In October, 26 E. coli-related illnesses were linked to fresh ground beef products from a New York State establishment, leading to a recall of 248,000 pounds of beef cuts from an Oklahoma establishment in December. FSIS began testing raw ground beef for E. coli O157:H7 in 1994, declaring contaminated products as adulterated. Industry groups challenged this in court, but the program was upheld in December 1994. FSIS has conducted extensive sampling since the program's inception, with hundreds of positive E. coli O157:H7 samples. In response to increased prevalence, FSIS required all raw beef manufacturers to reassess HACCP plans for E. coli control. Inspectors now verify corrective actions and conduct random testing at all beef processing plants, including grinders. Guidelines were issued for increased pathogen testing and product segregation in grinding plants. In June 2007, FSIS increased pathogen testing on ground beef by over 75% due to an uptick in positive E. coli O157:H7 samples, recalls, and illnesses. They also implemented various E. coli prevention initiatives, including testing beef trim, verifying control measures in beef plants, and using a new checklist for inspection procedures. FSIS implemented new initiatives to improve E. coli testing in ground beef, focusing on components like bench trim and issuing directives for verification activities. They were considering labeling all beef cuts as adulterated if they tested positive for E. coli O157:H7. The FSIS is taking steps to address E. coli O157:H7, including testing for the pathogen, holding products until testing is completed, labeling mechanically tenderized meat cuts, and enhancing traceback capabilities. Positive tests for E. coli have declined significantly since 2000. In 2000, positive E. coli samples were at 0.86%, but decreased due to FSIS policies. However, increases were seen in 2007 and 2008. Speculation arose about the cause, possibly due to testing method changes. In 2009, 0.32% of ground beef samples tested positive for E. coli. FSIS proposed performance standards in 2001 for meat processing. In 2001, FSIS proposed performance standards for meat and poultry processing firms to reduce Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods. The proposal covered various meat and poultry products, aiming to decrease the estimated 2,500 illnesses and 499 deaths caused by Lm annually. The rule sparked controversy among industry stakeholders, with the meat industry arguing against the cost of additional testing, food manufacturers criticizing the broad coverage of some food categories, and consumer groups expressing concerns about the rule's effectiveness. In 2001, FSIS proposed performance standards to reduce Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat foods. Interest in the Listeria issue grew following reports of foodborne illnesses linked to Sara Lee meats. In October 2002, Pilgrim's Pride recalled poultry lunch meats for Lm contamination, leading to 46 confirmed cases of listeriosis with seven deaths. FSIS issued a directive in December 2002 regarding inspection programs. In December 2002, FSIS issued a directive to inspection program personnel for monitoring processing plants producing hot dogs and deli meats. In June 2003, an interim final rule was announced to reduce Listeria in ready-to-eat meats by requiring plants to add control measures specific to Listeria in their HACCP and sanitation plans. FSIS inspectors conduct random tests to verify establishments' programs, with different degrees of verification testing based on control steps adopted. On January 4, 2005, the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) criticized USDA's Listeria efforts. The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) criticized USDA's Listeria rulemaking in 2005, accusing the Department of siding with the meat industry by weakening the final rule. CFA pointed out the increase in Listeria illnesses in 2003, while USDA and meat industry officials argued that product recalls related to Listeria had decreased. The CDC's reports in 2006 and 2007 showed that the incidence of foodborne illness caused by Listeria had not significantly declined in recent years. In 2005, there were numerous recalls of FSIS-regulated products, including a major recall of 2.8 million pounds of lunchmeat by ConAgra. The following years saw additional Listeria-related recalls, with 28 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 11 in 2007, 15 in 2008, and 8 in 2009. Congress halted FSIS's work on a risk-based inspection system in 2007. The initiative aimed to improve public health by focusing inspection resources on higher-risk meat and poultry establishments. The Risk-Based Inspection System (RBIS) categorized establishments based on risk levels, allowing for more targeted inspections. The USDA planned to implement RBIS in 2007 at 30 locations, reallocating resources to plants with poor safety records and higher-risk products. The USDA planned to implement the Risk-Based Inspection System (RBIS) in 2007 at 30 locations, reallocating resources to plants with poor safety records and higher-risk products. Public concerns were raised about the lack of specifics on implementation, data needed, and potential undermining of safety oversight. Interest groups reiterated their concerns following the USDA announcement. The major meat packers expressed concerns about the hasty launch of the Risk-Based Inspection System (RBIS) initiative by the USDA, questioning the validity of the data used to rank product risk and plant performance. The Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted an audit in December 2007, highlighting issues with FSIS's ability to assess risk in a timely manner due to lacking management control processes and IT support. The OIG report presented 35 new recommendations to improve the use of food safety assessment data and enhance risk estimation. FSIS has been retooling RBIS into a \"Public Health Risk-Based Inspection System\" (PHRBIS) to address these recommendations. Implementation is expected to start in late FY2010. The agency plans to implement the Public Health Risk-Based Inspection System (PHRBIS) in late FY2010, following 35 new recommendations from the OIG. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) commended FSIS for its commitment to developing a risk-based system but found challenges in evaluating process control indicators without a clear rationale from the agency. Provisions in appropriations measures have directed USDA to hold off on implementing its risk-based inspection system until data evaluation is completed. Bills introduced in Congress aim to address microbiological contamination, including S. 2792 which would require minimum testing for E. coli O157:H7 in beef facilities. The new provisions in S. 2819 and H.R. 4750 aim to address microbiological contamination in beef facilities by requiring E. coli O157:H7 testing, reporting positive results to USDA within 24 hours, and prohibiting the marketing of unprocessed food without pathogen reduction treatment. H.R. 4750 also includes penalties for firms that prevent further examination of meat products. The USDA is considering measures to ensure the safety of meat and poultry products, following reports of firms prohibiting testing for pathogens. Lawmakers are calling for more rigorous testing and procedures for products destined for school meals programs. The USDA purchases commodities for school meal programs, with at least 12% of assistance provided through commodities. USDA purchased 450,000 pounds of ground beef for school lunches, with one order testing positive for Salmonella. Lawmakers are calling for more rigorous testing for products in school meals programs. The Department rejected three orders that did not produce positive test results for Salmonella, citing the uneven distribution of the pathogen in beef. The remaining lots were not rejected as they were produced after the recalled beef and the assembly lines were cleaned nightly. USDA's safety rules for school-bound meat are stricter than commercial products, while fast food and supermarket chains have their own testing protocols. Many fast food and supermarket chains have higher testing and safety standards than required by AMS. For example, McDonald's, Burger King, and Costco test their ground beef more frequently than the Department. The New York Times reported E. coli and Salmonella found in meat produced for the school lunch program by Beef Products Inc. Despite multiple suspensions, the facility remains in production for other customers, using beef trimmings once considered unfit for human consumption. The company treated fatty trimmings with ammonia gas to kill pathogens, balancing effectiveness with taste concerns. Government did not require labeling of the treated meat as an additive. Food safety expert defended the program's zero-tolerance policy for pathogens. Marsden emphasized AMS's \"zero-tolerance\" policy for pathogens in products, requiring suppliers to hold products until tests confirm pathogen-free samples. The AMS purchasing program mandates two pathogen intervention steps in slaughter plants and regular E. coli O157:H7 testing on carcasses. However, Marsden noted a potential weakness in the program's reliance on microbiological test results. The Agriculture Secretary must seek court orders to seize contaminated products if firms refuse voluntary recalls, with the GAO criticizing agencies' recall efficiency for high-risk products. The 2004 GAO report highlighted the ineffective tracking of recalls by agencies, leading to unrecovered recalled items that may pose health risks if consumed. Consumer and food safety advocacy groups advocate for new enforcement tools, such as civil fines, to improve food safety and strengthen USDA's enforcement of the HACCP system. They argue that civil penalties would serve as a quicker and more effective deterrent against processors who consistently violate food safety standards. Food safety advocates argue for FSIS to have authority for product recalls as a backup guarantee. Industry opposes new enforcement powers, stating current authorities are sufficient. They believe USDA's ability to withdraw inspection and shut down a plant is a strong enough penalty. New enforcement powers could lead to financial losses from false contamination incidents. Voluntary procedures are seen as encouraging cooperation. In August 2004, the consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) launched a campaign urging USDA to disclose retail outlets where recalled meat was distributed. USDA and industry leaders argued that distribution records are proprietary and should be limited to public officials for monitoring recalls. FSIS proposed posting retailers' names with products subject to recalls on its website in 2006. Starting in August 2008, FSIS began listing retailers involved in Class I recalls. USDA's OIG found improvements in recall procedures but recommended a science-based sampling protocol. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires a food registry for reporting adulteration. The omnibus farm bill (H.R. 2419) required USDA to establish \"reportable food registries\" for meat and poultry products. The final conference substitute, P.L. 110-246, mandates meat and poultry establishments to notify USDA of adulterated or misbranded products and prepare recall plans. Proposed rules for these requirements were under review in September 2009. Bills for mandatory recalls of meat and poultry products were introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress but not enacted. In the 111th Congress, bills by Representative DeGette (H.R. 815) and Senator Brown (S. 425) proposed amending the FMIA and PPIA to require notification to the Secretary of adulterated or misbranded meat and poultry products. Similar objectives were also introduced by Senator Udall (S. 1527). These bills outline steps for voluntary recall and consumer notification, with mandatory recall provisions if necessary. Mandatory recall provisions for food safety legislation have been included in bills by Senator Udall (S. 1527), H.R. 2749, and S. 510. These provisions focus on FDA-regulated foods and not FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products. Improved traceability capabilities are seen as crucial for quick product tracing in cases like BSE outbreaks and agroterrorism prevention. The debate on traceability also extends to verifying the U.S. origin of live cattle and meat products for export and facilitating recalls to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks. Supporters of animal ID and meat traceability argue that most major meat-exporting countries already have domestic animal ID systems. The U.S. meat industry initially opposed such a system, citing concerns about feasibility and scientific basis. However, after a domestic BSE case, efforts were made to implement a national animal ID system focused on disease control rather than food safety. Progress on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) has been slow, with some Members of Congress pushing for mandatory participation while facing opposition from producers. The USDA announced the abandonment of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) on February 5, 2010. Instead, a new approach will allow states to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock populations, including the option of no mandatory system or utilizing existing systems for disease control. This flexibility aims to address concerns about cost, liability, and privacy of records raised by opponents of the NAIS. The USDA abandoned the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in 2010. A new approach allows states to choose their own level of animal identification and traceability for livestock. Under the proposed revision, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have a form of ID for traceability. Various animal ID proposals were considered in the 110th Congress, with some bills aiming to establish a mandatory system while others focused on creating a livestock identification board. Congressional reports questioned USDA's progress in implementing NAIS, with concerns raised about the direction and funding of the program. The USDA abandoned the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in 2010. The FY2009 USDA appropriation provided $14.5 million for the program, with specific objectives outlined. The FY2010 appropriation allocated $5.3 million for NAIS, expressing concern over APHIS's lack of progress. The conference report expressed concern over APHIS's slow progress in registering animal premises for the national animal ID system, stating that higher participation levels were needed. Approximately 37% of premises were registered by mid-2009 out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. The report warned that funding for the program could be eliminated if significant progress was not made. Proposed legislation in the 111th Congress included broader food traceability provisions. Both DeGette and Brown's bills require FSIS to establish a traceability system for animals and meat products from slaughter to consumer. This is different from previous traceability provisions for FDA-regulated foods. FSIS has faced staffing challenges due to factors like new technologies increasing production speeds. The staffing challenges at FSIS are due to shortages in inspectors, funding issues, and difficulties in finding qualified personnel. User fees have been proposed to cover inspection costs and hire new inspectors as needed. The USDA proposed user fees to cover inspection costs and hire new inspectors. The cost to consumers would be minimal, around one cent per pound. However, industry and consumer groups have opposed these fees, arguing that food safety is a public health concern that should be supported by taxpayers. Previous administrations have requested user fees, but Congress has consistently opposed them. The enacted omnibus provides increased funding for FSIS in FY2008 and FY2009, with additional user fees. The FY2010 appropriation meets the Administration's request. Congressional consideration for FY2011 budget was ongoing. Language in appropriations measures continued to prohibit FSIS from allowing importation of poultry products from China. The FY2008 and FY2009 omnibus increased funding for FSIS with additional user fees. The FY2010 appropriation met the Administration's request, while Congressional measures continued to prohibit FSIS from allowing poultry product imports from China. China criticized the ban and planned to challenge it in the WTO. China formally requested WTO consultations on the issue of poultry product imports from China. The House and Senate had differing approaches, with the final measure stating that funds cannot be used to implement the rule unless certain conditions are met. The USDA will conduct audits and reviews of Chinese facilities before allowing them to ship products to the US. There will be increased reinspections at US ports of entry and an information sharing program with other countries. Reports on the audits and reviews must be provided to Congress regularly. The USDA will conduct audits and reviews of Chinese facilities before allowing them to ship products to the US. There will be increased reinspections at US ports of entry for Chinese poultry imports. Food safety advocates support banning the poultry rule due to concerns about China's food safety protections. Opponents argue that a ban would undermine US trade commitments and may lead to trade retaliation by China. The ban on state-inspected meat and poultry plants shipping products across state lines has led to trade retaliation by China. State-inspected plants argue that their programs are equivalent to the federal system and should be allowed to participate in interstate commerce. Critics claim that state programs lack the same level of safety oversight as federal or foreign plants. Foreign-processed products are subject to U.S. import reinspection at ports of entry. In the 110th Congress, a new opt-in program for state-inspected plants was authorized by the farm bill (P.L. 110-246) to supplement the existing federal-state cooperative inspection program. Eligible plants with 25 or fewer employees can participate, with federal reimbursement for state costs set at 60%. The new opt-in program for state-inspected plants authorized by the farm bill sets federal reimbursement for state costs at 60%, requires products to carry the federal mark of inspection, and establishes a technical assistance division. It reflects a compromise between proponents and opponents of ending the interstate ban on state-inspected meat. The farm bill required final rules for the new state program by December 2009. FSIS published proposed rules on September 16, 2009, outlining standards for employee numbers, eligibility criteria, and application processes. Participating establishments must correct violations to maintain eligibility. As of mid-March 2010, a final rule had not been issued. As of mid-March 2010, there have been twenty-one reported cases of BSE in North America, with the most recent case in Canada being announced on March 10, 2010. The United States reported its first case in December 2003, with two additional cases found in U.S.-born cattle. Despite difficulties in tracking down related animals, those located tested negative for the disease. Some meat from the first U.S. BSE cow may have been consumed despite a beef recall. The USDA stated that the first U.S. BSE cow may have been consumed, but the highest-risk tissues did not enter the food supply. The other two U.S. cows did not have materials enter the food supply. It was initially thought that all North American cases were due to BSE-contaminated feed, but now the USDA believes the U.S. cattle had \"atypical\" BSE. FSIS, along with APHIS and FDA, are responsible for keeping BSE out of the food supply. Effective immediately, new rules were implemented to enhance U.S. BSE protection systems. Nonambulatory cattle are banned from inspected slaughter facilities, and cattle for testing must test negative for BSE before being marked as \"inspected and passed.\" Specified risk materials (SRM) are prohibited from the human food supply, and slaughter facilities must develop procedures to remove and dispose of SRM. The USDA implemented new rules to enhance BSE protection systems, including banning nonambulatory cattle from inspected slaughter facilities and prohibiting SRM from cattle 30 months or older in products labeled as \"meat.\" Additionally, mechanically separated meat for human consumption is not allowed, and air injection stunning is banned to prevent brain dislocation into the carcass. These actions complement existing BSE regulatory safeguards such as import controls, BSE surveillance, and restrictions on feeding mammalian proteins to cattle. A nationwide animal identification program was implemented for tracing cattle movements in cases of disease, along with a one-time BSE testing program for higher-risk cattle. Concerns about BSE focused on trade rather than food safety, with Japan and Korea taking years to accept U.S. beef. A new U.S.-Korea agreement in 2008 aimed to open Korea's market to most U.S. beef products. In 2008, Korea initially delayed and then limited the types of U.S. beef products it would accept due to anti-government protests. However, by July, U.S. beef started entering the Korean market again. This development was seen as a positive step that could help ease frustrations among Members of Congress. The issue of U.S. access to Korea's beef market has been a key point in the debate over the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement. Members of Congress had indicated that their support for the agreement was dependent on Korea fully opening its market to U.S. beef. In early January 2010, Taiwan's parliament voted to reverse provisions in a U.S.-Taiwan agreement allowing U.S. ground beef and offal to enter the country. This unilateral action, deemed unscientific by U.S. trade officials, may lead to congressional proposals for sanctions. California recalled 143 million pounds of beef products distributed to school lunch and federal nutrition programs in 45 states due to violations of FSIS regulations and the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The facility failed to notify inspectors about nonambulatory cattle and was found to be handling downer cattle inhumanely before slaughter. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) requires that cattle be handled humanely before slaughter. FSIS now mandates that cattle slaughter establishments must notify inspectors when cattle become nonambulatory, condemning them from the human food supply. The 110th Congress debated the effectiveness of the HMSA and USDA's implementation, with bills like H.R. 661, S. 394, and S. 2770 aiming to prohibit the slaughter of nonambulatory livestock for food, though they were not passed. The Senate-passed version of the American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 included a provision to permanently prohibit the use of federal funds for inspecting nonambulatory disabled cattle for human food. This provision was removed before final enactment. A bill was introduced to ban such cattle from the food supply and ensure humane euthanization. A House subcommittee held a hearing on the issue, where the Government Accountability Office testified on inconsistent enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act by FSIS inspectors. The curr_chunk discusses the HMSA and refers readers to a CRS report for more information."
