    "content": "The White House requested $25 billion in a \"contingent emergency reserve fund\" for FY2005 to cover costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress needs to determine the level of flexibility the Defense Department requires while ensuring funds are used as approved. Congress has responded to DOD's requests for funding flexibility in various ways over the years. Since 9/11, Congress has been more willing to grant the Administration flexibility in allocating funds for the \"global war on terrorism,\" but has imposed reporting requirements and reduced the amount of funding in flexible accounts. The Administration requested $25 billion for a contingent emergency reserve fund in FY2005 to cover operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration requested $25 billion for a contingent emergency reserve fund in FY2005 for military operations. Congress has not provided most of the funding in flexible accounts despite Administration requests. The Administration requested $25 billion for a contingent emergency reserve fund in FY2005 for military operations. Congress appropriated a total of about $165 billion for Iraq, Afghanistan, and enhanced security, with $40 billion in flexible accounts and $124 billion in regular accounts. The current request for $25 billion in a flexible account is larger than any amount DOD has received so far. Congress provided $2 billion in flexible funding requested by DOD, about 3% of the total in the bill. Appendices A and B provide detailed information on military operations funding since 9/11. The FY2004 Administration request was analyzed, with both authorization and appropriation bills setting allocations for most of the $25 billion requested. Additional reporting requirements were also imposed. Congress is expected to vote on the FY2005 DOD Appropriations bill soon. The Congress is likely to vote on the conference version of the FY2005 DOD Appropriations bill, H.R. 4613, before going on recess on July 26, 2004. The White House requested $25 billion as \"contingent emergency funds\" in the Iraq Freedom Fund, with proposed allocations for different accounts. The FY2005 DOD Appropriations bill, H.R. 4613, includes ceilings for various Operation and Maintenance accounts totaling $25 billion. The Secretary of Defense has discretion to transfer funds among accounts with notification to committees. This allows for funding of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2005 DOD Appropriations bill allows the Secretary of Defense to transfer up to $5 billion between accounts with approval from OMB and notification to defense committees. Transferred funds can be retransferred back to the original account if not needed, with no time limit on availability. The White House must submit an official budget request designating the funds as emergency. The Administration plans to submit an official budget request to Congress for $25 billion in emergency funds to support operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. No reports to Congress are required before or after the funds are transferred. The Administration plans to request $25 billion in emergency funds to support activities in Iraq or Afghanistan. The funds may be transferred for various operation and maintenance purposes within the Department of Defense, including reimbursement of other appropriations. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense has the authority to transfer the funds to any appropriation or fund within the Department of Defense or classified programs. The funds provided can be transferred within the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance purposes. The Secretary of Defense must notify committees before any transfers are made. Congressional concerns focused on funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense initially planned to wait until January 2005 to submit a supplemental request for funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. Members questioned the total funding needed for FY2005, leading to the submission of an amendment. The Administration requested a contingency fund due to uncertain costs for operations in the upcoming year. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld mentioned the increased violence in Iraq during a testimony on May 12, 2004. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld requested $25 billion for additional troops in Iraq due to increased violence. Senate Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about the request being a \"blank check.\" Deputy Director of OMB stated the request aimed to address pressure points in Army O&M accounts while providing flexibility to commanders and officials. In response to concerns about flexible funding for war-related expenses, there have been allegations of misuse of funds and questions about spending priorities within the Department of Defense. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz denied allegations of misusing funds for Iraq preparation, stating they were used to strengthen U.S. capabilities in the region. Members have raised concerns about initial shortages of force protection equipment, such as body armor and uparmored Humvees. The Administration has provided limited information on the allocation of spending for force protection equipment and troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some have criticized the lack of detail in DOD reporting on flexible funding, which may hinder congressional oversight. Both the House and Senate have approved the $25 billion requested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration requested $25 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the FY2005 DOD authorization and appropriation bills. Appropriations conferees met to resolve differences, and a conference report was filed. The House and Senate are expected to vote on the appropriations bill before the recess. The bill provides funding in regular appropriation accounts, allowing DOD flexibility to allocate about 14% of the $25 billion. Congress is not expected to address the authorization bill until after the recess. The $25 billion requested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the FY2005 DOD authorization and appropriation bills is being allocated with funding levels reflecting a compromise between the House and Senate versions. The bill includes more extensive reporting requirements on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both houses authorize the amount requested but do not provide the Administration with the funding flexibility requested. The House authorization bill distributes all the funds but gives DOD $2.5 billion. The House authorization bill (H.R. 2400) allocates $25 billion for \"emergency contingency operations\" for the global war on terrorism, with $2.5 billion in transfer authority. The Senate version (S. 2400) also designates $2.5 billion for transfers but requires advanced notification and consultation before transfers can be made. Funding would only be available in the Senate version after the Administration submits a request and designates the funding as emergency. Funding mix differs between the two versions. The House authorizers provide $3.4 billion for force protection equipment procurement, including $1 billion for uparmored HUMVees. The Senate authorizers allocate more for operation and maintenance funding, with no procurement funding. The Administration has been hesitant to provide reconstitution funding in supplementals, but has transferred funds for force protection items in previous supplementals. The House allocates funds by appropriation account, while the Senate allocates funds at more general title levels following the Administration's guidelines. Reporting requirements and funding limits are also addressed. The Senate has more extensive reporting requirements than the House for the $25 billion funding for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other operations in the Global War on Terrorism. Both houses set a funding limit of $300 million and require reporting on the Commanders Emergency Response Fund. Neither bill requires reporting on past, current, or future funding by mission or operation, or on troop levels. The Senate has extensive reporting requirements for the $25 billion funding for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Global War on Terrorism. They require reports on the Commanders Emergency Response Fund, contractor personnel, body armor reimbursement, post-major combat operations, DOD's prisoner population, and facilities. The House allows the Secretary of Defense to spend up to $25 million to support irregular forces. The House and Senate authorizers rejected the Administration's request to train and equip foreign forces for peace enforcement missions. The Senate did provide up to $150 million to train Iraqi security forces. There is a disagreement between the Administration and Congress on whether to increase active-duty personnel in the Army and Marine Corps to address the stresses from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Both authorization bills play a key role in setting endstrength levels, which are then funded in the DOD appropriation bill. Both authorization bills allocate $25 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan, with the House mandating increases in active-duty personnel while the Senate makes them optional. The Administration opposes mandatory ceilings set by Congress, preferring flexibility. Both appropriation bills would make funds available upon enactment. The Senate and House appropriations bills allocate funds for Iraq and Afghanistan, with the House including $2.0B in classified programs in the Iraqi Freedom Fund (IFF) and the Senate providing $25.0 billion in the IFF. The bills require DOD to inform congressional defense committees of transfers from the IFF in advance and report quarterly. The Senate bill puts $2.5 billion in a transfer account for allocation by DOD. The House and Senate versions of the FY2005 appropriation bill (H.R. 4613) differ in funding priorities, funding flexibility mechanisms, reporting requirements, and funding for the Darfur region of Sudan and the new Iraqi embassy. The conference version funding levels reflect these differences. The conference version of the FY2005 appropriation bill provides $1.2 billion for military personnel, with lower funding for procurement. The House allocated more funding for military personnel ($3.9 billion) compared to the Senate, reflecting higher special pays for combat personnel and a requirement for the Army to increase endstrength by 10,000. The Senate version provided $4 billion more in funding overall. The conference version of the FY2005 appropriation bill provides additional funding for operation and maintenance activities, including body armor for troops and procurement for force protection items. The bill also includes $3.4 billion in flexible funding, with $1.9 billion in unallocated funding in the Iraqi Freedom Fund and $1.5 billion in transfer authority. Both the House and Senate appropriation bills provided similar levels of flexibility. The FY2005 appropriation bill provides additional funding for operation and maintenance activities, including body armor for troops and force protection items. The House version includes $2 billion in the Iraq Freedom Fund for intelligence activities, leaving $1 billion for DOD to allocate. The Senate version gives DOD $2.5 billion in the Iraqi Freedom Fund with no additional transfer authority. The conference version makes $25 billion available upon enactment for Army operations in FY2004. The conference bill designates funds as emergency without requiring executive branch approval. There is a debate about the Army's shortfall in funds for operations in Iraq in FY2004. Estimates range from $5.3 billion to $7.1 billion, with plans to transfer funds from other accounts to cover shortfalls. The conference version of the FY2005 DOD appropriation bill (H.R. 4613) increases DOD's general transfer authority to $2.8 billion to accommodate shifts in funding. Most of the funding is provided in regular appropriations bills, with $2.0 billion allocated to the Iraq Freedom Fund, subject to reporting requirements. Extending the availability of funds beyond one year gives DOD additional flexibility. The conference version of the FY2005 DOD appropriation bill increases DOD's transfer authority to $2.8 billion for funding shifts. Most funds are in regular appropriations bills, with $2.0 billion allocated to the Iraq Freedom Fund. Funds are available for one year in the conference version. DOD is required to report on expenditures for Iraq and Afghanistan, progress in preventing attacks, effects on readiness, and estimates of costs for military operations and reconstruction. The House provision on treatment of prisoners in Iraq was dropped in conference. The conference version of the FY2005 DOD appropriation bill includes funding for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, with specific allocations for various programs such as the Commanders Emergency Response Fund, assistance to Iraqi and Afghan armies, and training and equipping the Iraqi Army and Afghan National Army. Additionally, funds are provided for embassy operations and support for Darfur, Sudan. The conference bill for FY2005 DOD appropriation includes $70 million for disaster assistance and $25 million for refugee assistance for Darfur, Sudan. It also provides $665 million for embassy operations and $20 million for construction, designated as emergency funding. Additionally, $100 million is allocated for wildfire management and $400 million for suppression. Congress has given DOD discretion to allocate funds through flexible transfer accounts since 1990. Congress generally requires DOD to follow standard reprogramming practices for funding in regular accounts, with prior approval needed for transfers above specified thresholds. For the FY2005 $25 billion budget amendment for Iraq, Congress could apply different options, ranging from extensive flexibility to more restrictive measures. Option 1 mirrors the provisions for the initial $20 billion provided after 9/11, requiring consultation with appropriations committees and a 15-day notification period for transferring funds. The $10 billion allocated required a 15-day notification period for transfer, with the OMB reporting quarterly to appropriations committees. Funding was split between regular appropriations and a transfer account, as seen in previous emergency supplementals. Transfer from the flexible account required 5-7 days advance notification to defense committees. Option 3 proposes putting most funds in regular accounts with longer notification and more extensive reporting, similar to previous supplementals. Option 4 suggests providing all funds in regular accounts with some flexibility and longer reporting requirements. Option 4 suggests providing additional general transfer authority and special higher reprogramming thresholds for DOD to make funding changes more easily. This option reflects features of previous emergency supplementals and requires DOD to provide planning assumptions to Congress. Option 4 proposes giving DOD more flexibility in transferring funds and higher reprogramming thresholds. This would require DOD to provide detailed planning assumptions to Congress. The approach involves standard peacetime reprogramming restrictions, monthly cost reports, and advance notice of transfers to Congress. Previous funding precedents for war and contingency operations serve as the basis for these options. Regular peacetime DOD spending serves as a baseline for funds provided in regular appropriation bills. DOD can move monies within restrictions established by statute, congressional reports, and Department of Defense regulations. Prior approval is required from congressional defense committees for fund transfers between accounts and changing funding levels within appropriations accounts. Congress provides most of DOD's annual funding in regular appropriation accounts covering broad expense categories. The Defense Department can transfer or reprogram funds between appropriation accounts or specific programs within accounts after annual congressional appropriations acts specify the amounts available. Transfers between accounts are subject to strict limits set by Congress each year. Congress sets specific limits on the Defense Department's ability to transfer funds between accounts each year through annual appropriations acts. These limits include requirements for prompt notification, transfers being necessary in the national interest, and only for higher priority items based on unforeseen military requirements. Additional restrictions are imposed by Congress on changing funding levels specified in appropriation acts or report language. Congress requires prior approval from the four congressional defense committees for reprogramming funds, including moving funds between accounts, starting or ending programs, and changing funding levels above certain thresholds. These thresholds vary by appropriation account, such as $20 million for procurement programs and $10 million for RDT&E programs. DOD must obtain prior approval for changes in RDT&E programs above $10 million, military personnel budget activities above $10 million, or O&M activities above $15 million. Congressional interest items designated by defense committees also require approval. Changes below the thresholds or for non-congressional interest items are reported internally. Reprogramming limits are stringent for procurement and RDT&E programs due to individual line item restrictions. The thresholds for military personnel and O&M budget activities provide flexibility to services. In O&M, the $15 million threshold applies to four budget activities within each service, allowing discretion in fund allocation between Activity Groups and Subactivity Groups. Congress has required DOD to provide written notification of changes in funding to certain \"sub activity groups\" within budget activities for O&M to prevent funds from being moved out of readiness-related activities. Establishing new reprogramming rules for war-related spending could provide DOD with greater flexibility in adjusting appropriations. Congress could establish special thresholds for war and occupation-related expenses in DOD's reporting categories, requiring the department to provide planning assumptions and report changes to those assumptions. This would aid congressional oversight and accountability. The Defense Department's planning assumptions, including manpower levels and operational tempo, are crucial for estimating costs. Congress lacks access to the Contingency Operations Support Tool model used for cost estimates. Transfer accounts allow flexibility in funding peacetime activities with fluctuating costs. The FY2004 Department of Defense Appropriations Act provides funding for the Army's environmental restoration programs that can be transferred to other accounts as needed. Transfer accounts, like the Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account, allow flexibility for responding to shifts in exchange rates. The Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) is another transfer account established for specific purposes. The Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) and the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) have been problematic. Transfer accounts allow DOD to respond to unforeseen circumstances, but Congress may not approve of how the funds are used. Controversy arose when funds from the post 9/11 Emergency Terrorism Response Supplemental were allegedly used for projects related to a future war with Iraq. Controversy arose in 2001 over the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund (OCOTF) being used for non-related expenses. Congress provided substantial flexible funding to DOD for combat operations post 9/11 attacks. The Defense Department received $2 billion to $14 billion in post-9/11 supplemental funds through special accounts. Congress has used various oversight tools, rejecting requests for broad discretion during combat operations. In 1990 and 1991, Congress rejected Administration requests for full freedom to allocate funds for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The first Bush Administration requested $2.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for Operation Desert Shield in FY1990. They proposed establishing a \"National Defense Gift Fund\" to deposit monetary contributions from allies, allowing the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds to the Department of Defense without further congressional approval. The Administration requested general authority for the Secretary of Defense to allocate funds from allies, but Congress provided $2.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for Operation Desert Shield in FY1991. Congress established the \"Defense Cooperation Account\" to receive contributions from allies and individuals, refusing to give general authority to the Secretary of Defense. The Administration requested broad authority for the Secretary of Defense to allocate funds for the Persian Gulf operations. Congress established the \"Desert Shield Working Capital Account\" with $15 billion for the Secretary of Defense to draw from if allied contributions were not available. The Administration requested broad authority for the Secretary of Defense to allocate funds for the Persian Gulf operations. Congress established the \"Desert Shield Working Capital Account\" with $15 billion for the Secretary of Defense to draw from if allied contributions were not available. Funds were transferred from that account to regular appropriation accounts, with justification materials provided for requested funding levels, including contributions from allies. The Persian Gulf Conflict Supplemental Authorization was enacted on April 6, 1991. The Persian Gulf Conflict Supplemental Authorization and Personnel Benefits Act of 1991 established a Working Capital Fund with $15 billion as a \"bridge loan\" until allied contributions were available. The Act required detailed reporting and monthly reports on war costs and allied contributions, setting the basis for current contingency and war-related cost reporting. The FY1991 Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm Appropriations Act (P.L. 102-28) allocated $34.6 billion by account, rejecting the Administration's request for broad funding flexibility and setting up the Persian Gulf Regional Defense Fund with $15 billion in appropriated funds. Congress required that these funds could only be used if allied contributions were insufficient, and specified the amounts that could be used by appropriation account. The FY1991 Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm Appropriations Act allocated $34.6 billion by account, with $6.0 billion for operation and maintenance and $1.9 billion for procurement specifically for combat operations. Congress required the Secretary of Defense to inform the congressional defense committees before transferring these funds. During the FY1991 supplemental appropriations, DOD estimated baseline costs for deploying forces to the Gulf but had not fully identified combat costs. Congress responded in the 1992 supplemental appropriations bill by allowing DOD to move funds between accounts. At the end of FY1994, the US unexpectedly deployed forces simultaneously. At the end of FY1994, the US deployed forces to Haiti and Southwest Asia using emergency funds, resulting in reduced readiness levels for some operational units. The Clinton Administration's proposal for \"Readiness Preservation Authority\" was rejected in response to this experience. The Administration proposed a \"Readiness Preservation Authority\" to allow the Secretary of Defense to incur obligations 50% in excess of the total amount appropriated for Operating Forces in Operation and Maintenance accounts for certain readiness-related military activities in the second half of the fiscal year. These obligations would be offset by rescissions unless emergency conditions exist. The Administration proposed a \"Readiness Preservation Authority\" to allow the Secretary of Defense to incur obligations for readiness-related military activities without specific congressional approval. This funding could cover operational training, weapons repair, and maintenance, as well as facility operations. In 1995, there was support for this authority, but no action was taken by Congress. Congress later adopted the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund despite being unsympathetic to DOD's request for increased O&M spending authority. The Administration proposed a \"Readiness Preservation Authority\" for the Secretary of Defense to incur obligations for readiness-related military activities without specific congressional approval. In 1995, there was support for this authority, but no action was taken by Congress. The following year, Congress agreed to raise DOD's general transfer authority to cover costs for military operations in support of the NATO-led Peace Implementation Force in former Yugoslavia. Congress then established the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund to fund contingency operations, providing annual appropriations between $1 billion to $5 billion for operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia. In FY2000, Congress added the requirement that OCOTF funds be spent strictly on contingency operations, with detailed reporting on manpower levels, costs, and weapon systems deployed. DOD incorporated these reporting categories in its Contingency Operations Support Tool (COST) model for Iraq, Afghanistan, and other contingencies. Congress gradually became disenchanted with the OCOTF due to consistent overestimates in costs and misuse of funds for non-contingency expenses. In 2001, GAO found funds were used for items like cappuccino machines and golf memberships. As a result, Congress cut funding for the OCOTF in FY2002 and transferred funding for Balkan operations and Southwest Asia to regular appropriation accounts. After 9/11, Congress provided broad authority for disaster assistance, countering terrorism, and national security support. In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress provided broad authority for disaster assistance, countering terrorism, and national security support by allocating $20 billion for various purposes including improving airport security, repairing damage, and supporting national security. Congress gradually reduced flexible funding and increased restrictions in subsequent emergency supplementals for the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to the 9/11 attacks, Congress swiftly approved $40 billion in emergency funds, granting the Administration discretion to allocate $20 billion to any federal agency. The first $20 billion was placed in an Emergency Response Fund, with the second $20 billion requiring allocation in a subsequent appropriations act, asserting congressional control. The government approved $40 billion in emergency funds after 9/11. The President could transfer $10 billion immediately and another $10 billion after 15 days. Funds were for national security and disaster recovery, with quarterly reports required. After approving $40 billion in emergency funds post-9/11, the President could transfer $10 billion immediately and another $10 billion after 15 days. The remaining $20 billion required an additional appropriations request and approval. There was debate over meeting recovery and assistance activity requirements, with questions raised about consultation. Of the $20 billion allocated at the President's discretion, $14.0 billion went to the Department of Defense for upgrading intelligence systems and prosecuting the war in Afghanistan. In the aftermath of 9/11, $20 billion was appropriated to various federal agencies, with $3.5 billion allocated to the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) by Congress. The funds were designated for specific functional categories like combat operations and intelligence activities, bypassing regular appropriation accounts. The Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) received $3.5 billion in funding allocated by Congress for specific categories like combat operations and intelligence activities. The Department of Defense (DOD) was required to report quarterly on the use of the funds, but details on specific purposes were lacking. Congress also mandated that DOD provide detailed spending reports within 45 days of enactment and quarterly thereafter to improve transparency. The Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) received $3.5 billion in funding allocated by Congress for specific categories like combat operations and intelligence activities. Congress required DOD to provide detailed spending reports within 45 days of enactment and quarterly thereafter, using guidelines for transparency. The DOD was required to submit an allocation plan for previous funding and a baseline for reprogramming. Quarterly reports were mandated for the $14.0 billion and $3.5 billion provided, detailing funds available, transfers, obligations, and expenditures. DOD was also to identify savings from various activities related to the war on terrorism. Despite periodic reporting, DOD failed to submit any reports. Congressional dissatisfaction with DOD reporting on the war on terrorism led to calls for more detailed and traditional appropriation accounts to ensure proper oversight by both the executive and legislative branches. DOD's decision to spend funds directly from the DERF and use new functional categories may have provided more visibility on war-related funds. Traditional appropriation accounts sometimes make it difficult to segregate peacetime from wartime costs, hindering trend analysis. Assessing DOD spending for war and occupation-related expenses is challenging due to inconsistent reporting categories and lack of information on planning factors. In the FY2002 Emergency Supplemental, DOD requested $11.3 billion for the Defense Emergency Response Fund due to the dynamic nature of operations in Afghanistan. Despite the fall of the Taliban regime, combat operations continued to eliminate Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters. Congress agreed to provide the funding but required more visibility on war-related expenses. Congress approved $11.3 billion for the Defense Emergency Response Fund (DERF) in the FY2002 Emergency Supplemental. The DERF was to operate as a transfer account, with funds transferred to regular appropriation accounts under the control of the services. DOD was required to report quarterly on transfers from the DERF, and Congress had to be notified in advance of any deviations from allocated funds. The Administration designated all funding as emergency to exempt it from discretionary spending caps. In the FY2003 Emergency Supplemental request, Congress re-allocated $5.1 billion from the Administration's $28 billion request to other programs, designating it as \"contingent emergency funding.\" The funds were intended for combat and post-war operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and enhanced security for defense installations. The president chose not to designate the funds as emergency, so they were never made available to agencies. The DOD submitted a request on March 25, 2003, two days after the war with Iraq began, to cover costs for pre-deployment buildup, combat operations, transitional costs, and reconstitution of forces. The request included a flexible transfer account for funding flexibility. Appropriators allocated $44.0 billion to individual accounts and kept $15.7 billion in the Iraqi Freedom Fund for DOD's war effort management. Congress provided the DOD with flexibility to manage the war effort and combat operations by allocating $2 billion in transfer authority. DOD had to follow reprogramming procedures and provide advance notification of transfers from the Iraqi Freedom Fund. The Secretary of Defense could transfer between $10 billion and $11 billion for combat operations. The FY2005 Budget Amendment requested even more flexible funds for DOD. The FY2005 Budget Amendment requested a larger amount of flexible funds for DOD, with reporting requirements for more refined projections of expected costs and comprehensive financial analysis. New restrictions were added to ensure funds were not used for previously denied programs or items unavailable within four years. In FY2003, DOD requested $10 billion for contingencies in its regular budget, including funds for the war on terrorism. Congress initially denied the request but later allocated the funds by appropriations title, although there were concerns about the timing of fielding certain investment items. In FY2004, DOD requested $65.6 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $2.0 billion allocated in the Iraq Freedom Fund. Congress approved this request in the FY2004 Emergency Supplemental. The supplemental funding was intended to sustain operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas, as well as support a force structure expected to decline. The Army expressed concerns about insufficient funds due to increased violence and troop levels in Iraq. However, funds could potentially be transferred from other areas to meet the Army's needs. The Department of Defense received $165 billion in supplemental funding for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as enhanced security for defense installations. The FY2004 Emergency Supplemental provided additional transfer authority, requiring reprogramming practices to be followed. DOD was required to give advance notification of transfers and report quarterly to congressional defense committees. The Defense Emergency Response Fund was formally closed in the FY2004 supplemental. The Administration requested $173 billion for war and occupation in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $104 billion in flexible funds and $69 billion in regular appropriation accounts. Congress provided $44 billion in flexible accounts, not meeting all Administration requests. Congress appropriated $44 billion in flexible accounts and $127 billion in regular accounts for DOD funding since the 9/11 attacks. Despite Administration requests for 80-100% flexibility, Congress has only provided about 20% flexibility in recent supplementals. The FY2003 and FY2004 Supplementals provided 20% and 3% flexibility in DOD funding respectively. Various acts have been passed for supplemental appropriations since the 9/11 attacks. Several acts were passed for supplemental appropriations following the 9/11 attacks, including P.L. 104-134, P.L. 107-38, P.L. 107-117, P.L. 107-206, P.L. 107-248, P.L. 108-7, P.L. 108-11, and P.L. 108-87. These acts provided funding for recovery and response to the terrorist attacks. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-106) was passed on November 6, 2003, following the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense and for the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, 2004."
