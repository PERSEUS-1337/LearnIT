    "content": "The \"Enumerated Powers Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. It includes a Constitutional Authority Clause. The \"Enumerated Powers Act\" requires all Acts of Congress to include a concise explanation of the specific constitutional authority relied upon. If limiting or abolishing federal activities, the 9th or 10th Amendment may be cited. The \"Enumerated Powers Act\" mandates that all Acts of Congress must include a clear explanation of the constitutional authority relied upon, specifically mentioning clauses like the common defense, general welfare, or necessary and proper clause. Failure to comply may result in a point of order in Congress. Invoking the commerce clause for purposes other than regulating trade across boundaries is not sufficient to meet the Act's requirements. The \"Enumerated Powers Act\" requires Acts of Congress to specify the constitutional authority used, such as the common defense or general welfare clause. Failure to comply may lead to a point of order in Congress. Any Senator can raise a point of order in the Senate under this Act, which can be waived by a two-thirds vote. In the Senate, a motion to table a point of order is not allowed under the \"Enumerated Powers Act.\" Waiving points of order can be debated for up to 3 hours, and the motion to waive a point of order cannot be amended. In the House of Representatives, if a Member raises a point of order under this Act, specific procedures apply. When a Representative raises a point of order, the Chair will decide on the adequacy of a statement of constitutionality. In the House of Representatives, the consideration of the point of order is debatable for 10 minutes and controlled by the Member raising the point of order and an opponent. No other motions can intervene except for adjournment or rising of the Committee of the Whole. In the House of Representatives, the Speaker should recognize an opponent from the opposing party when selecting an opponent. The disposition of the question of consideration for a measure also applies to determining consideration for an amendment. SEC. 3. EXPLANATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. This Act is enacted under the power granted to each House of Congress to determine its proceedings under the Constitution of the United States."
