    "content": "GRID-ENABLED WATER HEATERS. Part B of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to include additional standards for grid-enabled water heaters, defining an activation key as a necessary component for the product to operate continuously and at its designed specifications. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act now includes standards for grid-enabled water heaters, requiring an activation key for continuous operation at full capacity. Grid-enabled water heaters must have a storage tank volume over 75 gallons, be manufactured after April 16, 2015, and have an energy factor of at least 1.061 minus a certain value. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act mandates standards for grid-enabled water heaters, including a requirement for an activation key for continuous full capacity operation. Grid-enabled water heaters must have a storage tank volume over 75 gallons, be manufactured after April 16, 2015, and have an energy factor not less than 1.061 minus a specific value. The rated storage volume of the tank must be expressed in gallons and must be 0.00168. The water heater must have an efficiency level equivalent to the energy factor, expressed as a uniform energy descriptor, equipped with an activation key, and bear a permanent label made of water-resistant material. The water heater must have an efficiency level equivalent to the energy factor, equipped with an activation key, and bear a permanent label made of water-resistant material. It should be attached with non-water-soluble adhesive and come with a notice for intended use in electric thermal storage or demand response programs. The manufacturer or private labeler must provide the activation key to utilities or companies operating electric thermal storage or demand response programs for grid-enabled water heaters. Manufacturers are required to report the quantity of grid-enabled water heaters shipped annually to the Secretary. The Secretary mandates utilities and program operators to report annually on the activation of grid-enabled water heaters. Shipment data reported by manufacturers is treated as confidential. Information will be published in 2017 and 2019. The Secretary will analyze data on grid-enabled water heaters to assess their use in demand response and thermal storage programs. If sales exceed activations by 15% annually, procedures will be established to prevent product diversion. The Secretary will establish procedures to prevent product diversion for non-program purposes until grid-enabled water heaters no longer require a separate efficiency requirement. This action will take effect upon the Secretary's determination or amendment of the efficiency requirement, as specified in subsection (m)(4)(A)(ii). The Secretary will consider the impact on thermal storage and demand response programs for electric water heaters, including energy savings, electric bills, reliability, renewable resources, and the environment. Grid-enabled water heaters must have communication capability for ancillary services programs. The Secretary will consider the impact on thermal storage and demand response programs for electric water heaters, including energy savings, electric bills, reliability, renewable resources, and the environment. Grid-enabled water heaters must have communication capability for ancillary services programs if deemed available, practical, and cost-effective. The curr_chunk states that it is prohibited to distribute activation keys, enable operation, or remove labels of grid-enabled water heaters."
