Congress finds that the population of individuals age 65 or older in the United States is growing and is estimated to reach 1/5 of the total population by 2030. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office revealed that 1 out of every 7 older individuals experienced elder abuse. Additionally, a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that 54 percent of crimes involving victims age 65 or older go unreported. The Crime Victims Fund, funded by forfeited bonds and criminal penalties, supports victims of crime. The Crime Victims Fund, supported by forfeited bonds and criminal penalties, does not receive taxpayer funds and does not specifically allocate amounts to individuals aged 65 or older who experience abuse. Elder abuse investigations are projected to increase by 28 percent by 2020, with varying definitions of elder abuse used by the Federal and State governments. The primary definition aims to ensure consistent administration of elder abuse programs by the State. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT OF 1984.

If the Fund has more money than the limitation, the excess amount goes into an elder abuse reserve fund for grants under section 1404F. The Director can carry over amounts in the elder abuse reserve fund. The Director can carry over amounts in the elder abuse reserve fund from fiscal year to fiscal year, and these amounts are not subject to the obligation limitation.
