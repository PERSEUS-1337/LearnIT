Voter turnout was low at under 50%, with Colom receiving 52.8% of the vote. He plans to lead Guatemala towards social democracy with a focus on the Mayan population. Voting patterns showed an urban-rural divide, with P\u00e9rez Molina winning in Guatemala City and Colom dominating the countryside. Alvaro Colom of the National Union for Hope (UNE) won the 2007 presidential elections in Guatemala, dominating the countryside and gaining seats in the National Assembly. His success will depend on forming alliances with other parties as his party does not have a majority. The elections were monitored by the European Union and the Organization of American States, with observers noting relatively free and fair elections despite some violence. The 2007 elections in Guatemala were relatively free and fair with increased rural voting. However, there were irregularities like the burning of a polling station. The UNE won 48 seats, GANA came in second with 37 seats, and former President R\u00edos Montt was elected to congress. Concerns were raised about the lack of information in Mayan languages and low female representation in Congress. President-elect Colom will need to form alliances as UNE controls less than one-third of seats. President-elect Colom will have to negotiate with other parties in the 158-seat legislature to pass his agenda. Under President Berger's leadership, the Guatemalan economy expanded, but drug trafficking and organized crime remained significant challenges. The GDP grew by 4.6% in 2006, the highest rate since 1998, aided by various factors including increased remittances and investor confidence due to CAFTA-DR. Berger's administration also passed laws against organized crime and established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). The Guatemalan peace accords signed in 1996 have not been fully implemented, leading to a rise in murders, with 6,033 reported in 2006. The root problem lies in the lack of employment and educational opportunities, driving many youth towards gangs and organized crime, particularly in Guatemala City, eastern departments, and along the Mexican border. The majority of violence is attributed to drug trafficking. Central America faces high levels of violence, primarily due to drug trafficking and organized crime. The infiltration of security forces by organized crime was highlighted after the murder of Salvadoran deputies. The 2007 electoral campaigns in Guatemala were marred by political violence, making it the bloodiest election since 1985. There were 119 violent acts leading up to the election, resulting in 51 deaths, including the torture and killing of a candidate's 14-year-old daughter. The 2007 electoral campaigns in Guatemala were marked by political violence, with a total of 18 murders in the UNE party and 7 in the ruling party GANA. Violence decreased between the first and second round of voting, with a total of 5 political candidates and supporters killed. Prosecuting murders is rare in Guatemala, and the responsible parties for many of the killings remain unclear. 'lvaro Colom, a three-time presidential candidate, moderated his leftist platform in recent elections. Alvaro Colom shifted from a leftist to a center-left candidate for the UNE party, holding various positions in government before running for president in 1999 and 2003. He now identifies as a moderate social democrat and supports President Lula da Silva of Brazil. Alvaro Colom, a moderate social democrat, supports President Lula da Silva of Brazil and aims to focus on social development and education in Guatemala. He plans to tackle issues through social dialogue and prioritize security within 100 days of taking office, with a \"zero tolerance\" stance on corruption and organized crime. The Castillo case involving alleged drug trafficking links and murders of Salvadoran deputies has raised suspicions about Colom's integrity and possible connections to organized crime. Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, a retired general, campaigned as the \"General of Peace\" and founded the Patriot Party in 2001, later forming the Grand National Alliance (GANA) in 2003. P\u00e9rez Molina founded the Patriot Party and later formed the Grand National Alliance (GANA). He campaigned on a hardline security policy, advocating for more soldiers on the streets to combat violence. Despite concerns about human rights violations, his rhetoric appealed to many due to the country's increasing violence. P\u00e9rez Molina, implicated in human rights abuses, planned to decentralize education, improve health coverage, and industrialize agriculture to fight rural poverty. He supported legal reforms through a national constituent assembly. Impunity and violence are major issues in Guatemala due to high murder rates and weak institutions. The establishment of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) has been a success under President Berger, despite opposition from the Guatemalan Revolutionary Front. Impunity and violence are major issues in Guatemala, with very few murders being investigated or prosecuted. The establishment of CICIG under President Berger has been successful, despite opposition. CICIG has been praised by human rights groups and the international community. Concerns remain about the Guatemalan executive branch's control over investigations and limitations on retroactive crime investigations. The approval of CICIG led to U.S. approval of Foreign Military Financing for Guatemala in FY2008. Both presidential candidates are likely to support continued cooperation with the international community to combat impunity and violence in Guatemala. The U.S. is interested in consolidating democracy, securing human rights, and establishing security in Guatemala. The United States' immigration policy has caused tension with Guatemala due to increased deportations of Guatemalan nationals. President Bush visited Guatemala in 2007 to express support for counternarcotics efforts. Guatemala has 1.2 million nationals living in the U.S., with nearly 60% being illegal immigrants. They sent back $3.61 billion in remittances in 2006, equal to 10% of the country's GDP. Guatemala received $3.61 billion in remittances in 2006, equivalent to 10% of the country's GDP. Both Colom and P\u00e9rez Molina are expected to appeal to the U.S. Government to revise its immigration policies."
