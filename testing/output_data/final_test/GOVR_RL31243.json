    "content": "The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is a federal law that protects public water supplies from contaminants. It was first enacted in 1974 and has been amended several times. The act establishes standards for water supplies, finances infrastructure projects, promotes compliance, and controls underground injection of fluids. States can be delegated authority for implementation and enforcement. The PWSS Program regulates public water systems, with 49 states assuming this authority. Congress reauthorized appropriations for SDWA programs in 1996. The SDWA amendments of 1996 reauthorized appropriations for most programs through FY2003. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WINN) Act made significant amendments to address lead in water systems and assist small communities. Tables provide details on major provisions and authorizations of appropriations. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) has been amended multiple times since its enactment in 1974. The first major amendments in 1986 aimed to increase EPA regulation of contaminants and protect groundwater. The EPA was given discretionary authority to regulate drinking water contaminants, with states playing a lead role in enforcement. The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act required the EPA to issue regulations for specified contaminants, establish wellhead protection programs, and increase enforcement authority. Congress further amended the Act in 1988 with the Lead Contamination Control Act. The Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-572) aimed to reduce lead exposure in drinking water by recalling lead-lined water coolers and providing guidance for schools and day care centers to address lead contamination. The 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) made significant changes to the Act, focusing on health risks, regulatory flexibility, and funding for federal mandates. Congress shifted to a risk-based approach for selecting contaminants for regulation and eliminated the requirement for the EPA to regulate 25 new contaminants every three years. The 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) introduced a risk-based approach for selecting contaminants for regulation, added flexibility to the standard-setting process, required health risk reduction and cost analyses for new rules, authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund program, and included provisions for small system compliance and pollution prevention. Additionally, in 2002, drinking water security provisions were added through the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188). The Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188) required vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans for community water systems serving over 3,300 individuals. The Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, P.L. 111-380, tightened lead regulations in drinking water. The Drinking Water Protection Act, P.L. 114-45, directed the EPA to develop a strategic plan for water assessment and management. The Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act (P.L. 114-98) revised the small system technical assistance program and extended authorization of appropriations through FY2020. The WIIN Act (P.L. 114-322) made revisions to the SDWA, authorizing new grant programs for small or disadvantaged communities, lead reduction projects, and a voluntary lead testing program in schools and child care programs. Federal regulations apply to over 152,700 water systems providing drinking water to at least 25 people. These systems range from large municipal systems to smaller ones like schools and campgrounds. Community water systems serve over 299 million people, with 82% serving 3,300 or fewer individuals. 92% of these systems serve populations of 10,000 or fewer, and 55% serve populations of 500 or fewer. Among community water systems, 71% rely on ground water, and 29% rely on surface water. There are also 18,178 non-transient non-community water systems, serving populations of 3,300 or fewer and providing water to 83% of the population served. Additionally, there are 83,200 transient non-community water systems serving transitory customers. Approximately 95,800 out of nearly 101,400 non-community water systems serve 500 or fewer people, facing financial, managerial, and technological challenges in meeting federal drinking water regulations. The SDWA requires EPA to establish national primary drinking water regulations for contaminants that may pose health risks. (Figure 1 provides statistics on different types of water systems.) The EPA is directed by the SDWA to regulate contaminants in public water systems serving at least 15 connections or 25 people. Regulations cover over 90 contaminants, including disinfectants, microorganisms, radionuclides, organic and inorganic chemicals. EPA must establish regulations for contaminants meeting health risk criteria. The EPA is required to regulate contaminants in public water systems based on health risk criteria. Every five years, the EPA must publish a list of unregulated contaminants that may require regulation (CCL) and administer a monitoring program (UCMR) for suspected contaminants in public water supplies. The EPA must regulate unregulated contaminants in public water systems every five years based on health risk criteria. They must determine whether to regulate at least five contaminants from the CCL list, setting nonenforceable MCLGs and enforceable MCLs for regulated contaminants. Regulations must be proposed within 24 months and promulgated within 18 months after determination. The EPA must set a \"national primary drinking water regulation\" within 18 months after proposing regulations for unregulated contaminants in public water systems every five years. The standard may be set at a level other than feasible if it reduces health risks overall. EPA must assess whether the benefits of the standard justify the costs before promulgating it. The agency generally considers affordable technologies for large communities when setting standards. The EPA must set a \"national primary drinking water regulation\" within 18 months after proposing regulations for unregulated contaminants in public water systems every five years. The standard may be set at a level other than feasible if it reduces health risks overall. EPA must assess whether the benefits of the standard justify the costs before promulgating it. The agency generally considers affordable technologies for large communities when setting standards. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to list technologies or means that comply with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) and are affordable for small public water systems serving populations of 10,000 or fewer. If compliance technologies are not affordable for small systems, then variance technologies or other means may be identified. New regulations become effective three years after promulgation, with a possible extension of up to two years for capital improvements. EPA must review and strengthen drinking water regulations every six years. In the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), Congress added risk assessment and risk communication provisions. EPA is required to use the best available science and make risk assessment documents publicly available when developing regulations. EPA must also publish a \"health risk reduction and cost analysis\" for each drinking water standard being considered, including quantifiable and nonquantifiable health risk reduction benefits and costs. EPA may promulgate an interim standard without a health risk reduction and cost analysis. In the Safe Drinking Water Act, Congress included provisions for variances and exemptions to help smaller water systems comply with regulations. Variances can be granted if raw water quality prevents meeting a standard despite using the best technology, as long as it does not pose an unreasonable health risk. Small systems can also receive variances based on affordable technology. EPA must identify affordable technologies for small systems if they cannot meet a standard with existing technology. The EPA can grant variances to small water systems serving 3,300 or fewer people if they cannot afford to comply with a standard. Variances are not available for microbial contaminants, and affordable compliance technologies are available for all existing standards. States can also grant variances to systems serving between 3,301 and 10,000 persons. Small system variances are not available for systems serving more than 10,000 people. EPA approval is required for states to grant variances, and variances are not available for microbial contaminants. The EPA authorizes states to grant temporary exemptions to public water systems for compelling reasons, such as cost constraints, to allow for compliance with regulations without posing unreasonable health risks. Exemptions can be granted for up to three years beyond the compliance deadline, with small systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons eligible for extensions up to a total of nine years. States and tribes can assume primary oversight for water systems if they meet statutory criteria, with 55 out of 57 states and territories currently having this authority. The EPA authorizes states to grant temporary exemptions to public water systems for compelling reasons, such as cost constraints, to allow for compliance with regulations without posing unreasonable health risks. Exemptions can be granted for up to three years beyond the compliance deadline, with small systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons eligible for extensions up to a total of nine years. States and tribes can assume primary oversight for water systems if they meet statutory criteria, with 55 out of 57 states and territories currently having this authority. To assume primacy, a state must adopt regulations at least as stringent as national requirements, develop enforcement procedures, adopt authority for penalties, conduct monitoring and inspections, maintain records, and make reports as required by the EPA. States may use a portion of their annual DWSRF grant to cover the costs of administering the PWSS program. EPA is required to allot funds among states based on various factors. The SDWA requires public water systems to monitor their water supplies for compliance with drinking water standards and report results to states. EPA monitors compliance by reviewing violation data submitted by states and can issue orders or civil actions for non-compliance. In nonprimacy states, EPA notifies local officials if a system is not in compliance. The 1996 amendments to the SDWA strengthened enforcement authorities, streamlined the process for issuing federal orders, increased penalty amounts, required states to have penalty authority, and mandated public water systems to notify customers of violations within 24 hours. The WIIN Act, Section 2106, added public notification requirements for water system exceedances of the lead action level under EPA's Lead and Copper Rule. Water systems must notify the public, state, and EPA of system lead action level exceedances within 24 hours to address serious health effects. EPA must notify the public within 24 hours if the state or water system fails to provide the required notice. The SDWA requires EPA to develop a strategic plan for outreach and assistance to populations affected by lead in water systems. If a household exceeds the lead action level, EPA must provide data to the water system and state, who then inform affected households. Community water systems must send an annual report on detected contaminants to customers. The SDWA requires annual reports on detected contaminants in drinking water systems. Citizen suits can be brought against violators, and the EPA has emergency powers to address threats to public health, including those from terrorism. The SDWA grants authority to act in response to terrorist threats or intentional acts that may disrupt safe drinking water. Provisions address lead in drinking water, including limits on lead in pipes, public notice requirements, and grant programs. Section 1417 prohibits the use of non-lead-free materials in water systems and plumbing. The SDWA prohibits the use of non-lead-free materials in water systems and plumbing. Section 1417 sets limits on lead content in solders, fluxes, pipes, and pipe fittings. States are responsible for enforcement, and regulations were added in 1996 to limit lead leaching from plumbing fittings and fixtures. The Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act amended Section 1417 in 2011. The Lead in Drinking Water Act (P.L. 111-380) amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to reduce the allowable level of lead in products in contact with drinking water and added exemptions for certain nonpotable services. The act also removed the reference to Section 1417(e) which required specific standards for plumbing fittings and fixtures. Section 1417(e) was removed by the Lead in Drinking Water Act, making plumbing fittings and fixtures subject to the \"lead free\" definition. Products must comply with a 0.25% lead limit effective since January 4, 2014. EPA proposed a rule to revise regulations on January 17, 2017. Section 1417(a)(2) requires public water systems to notify affected individuals of lead contamination. Subsection 1417(f) from the WIIN Act mandates EPA to provide educational information. The WIIN Act, Section 1459B, establishes a grant program to reduce lead in drinking water, including replacing lead service lines. Grants prioritize disadvantaged communities and may waive the nonfederal cost share requirement. $60 million per year is authorized for FY2017 through FY2021. EPA must provide educational information on lead in drinking water to the public. The WIIN Act, Section 2107, requires EPA to establish a voluntary program for testing lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs. States or LEAs can apply for grants, with Congress authorizing $20 million per year for FY2017 through FY2021. The 1996 amendments added state-administered programs for operator certification and capacity development to improve public water system compliance with drinking water regulations. EPA must withhold 20% of a state's annual DWSRF grant unless the state adopts and implements an operator certification program. The WIIN Act requires EPA to establish a program for testing lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs. States can apply for grants, with Congress authorizing $20 million per year. The 1996 amendments added programs for operator certification and capacity development to improve public water system compliance. EPA must withhold funds from states that do not have capacity development strategies. Compliance assistance is also provided to small water systems. Small public water systems, comprising 92% of community water systems, often lack the resources to meet SDWA requirements. Subsection 1442(e) allows EPA to provide $15 million annually for technical assistance to small water systems through nonprofit organizations. The Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act extended this program through FY2020 to help small systems comply with regulations through various assistance programs. The WIIN Act amended Section 1442 to allow technical assistance grants for tribes to be used for operator training and certification. SDWA Section 1452 authorized funding for this assistance, with a set-aside of up to 2% of DWSRF funds for small systems. The WIIN Act extended this set-aside authority through FY2021 and added a grant program for disadvantaged communities and small systems. The WIIN Act amended Section 1442 to allow technical assistance grants for tribes to be used for operator training and certification. SDWA Section 1459A directs EPA to establish a grant program to assist disadvantaged communities and small communities unable to finance projects needed for SDWA compliance. Eligible projects include investments for SDWA compliance, household water quality testing, and assistance benefiting underserved communities. EPA may waive some project costs and authorize $60 million per year for FY2017 through FY2021. Section 1421 and 1422 of the WIIN Act focus on protecting underground sources of drinking water through state underground injection control programs. States are required to have approved plans for UIC programs to prevent endangerment of drinking water sources, with EPA stepping in if necessary. The regulations do not interfere with brine injection from oil and gas production unless it affects drinking water sources. EPA delegates primacy for UIC programs to states with effective prevention measures for underground injection that endangers drinking water sources. EPA has established six classes of UIC wells with specific regulations, including recent ones for Class VI wells for carbon dioxide injection. Class VI wells are used for underground injection of carbon dioxide to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The Safe Drinking Water Act includes the Sole Source Aquifer Protection Program, which designates aquifers as the sole drinking water source for an area to prevent contamination. EPA has designated 77 sole source aquifers nationwide. The Safe Drinking Water Act includes programs for aquifer protection, such as the Sole Source Aquifer Demonstration Program and State Wellhead Protection Programs. These programs aim to protect designated sole source aquifers and wellhead areas around public water system wells. Additionally, State Groundwater Protection Grants provide funding for states to develop comprehensive groundwater protection programs. The Safe Drinking Water Act includes programs for aquifer protection, with appropriations authorized through FY2003. The 1996 amendments expanded the act's pollution prevention focus to include protection of surface water and groundwater. Section 1453 required EPA to publish guidance for states to implement source water assessment programs to determine systems' susceptibility to contamination. States with approved assessment programs may adopt alternative monitoring requirements for water systems. States are authorized to use up to 10% of their DWSRF grant for delineating and assessing source water protection areas. A source water petition program allows for voluntary partnerships between state and local governments to reduce contaminants in drinking water and develop protection strategies. $5 million each year is authorized for grants to support petition programs. Additionally, states can use up to 10% of their DWSRF grant for source water protection activities. In 1996, Congress authorized the DWSRF program to help systems finance improvements needed to comply with SDWA regulations. EPA makes grants to states to capitalize DWSRFs, which states can then use to make loans to public water systems. States must match 20% of the federal grant, and grants are allotted based on needs surveys. Each state and the District of Columbia must receive at least 1% of the appropriated funds. Drinking water SRFs can provide loans for expenditures that facilitate compliance or further health protection objectives. States must allocate 15% of their annual allotment for loan assistance to systems serving 10,000 or fewer persons. States can use up to 30% of their DWSRF grant for eligible projects. The DWSRF program allows states to use up to 30% of their grant for loan subsidies to economically disadvantaged communities. Funds can also be used for technical assistance, source water protection, and operator certification. The law authorized appropriations for DWSRF capitalization grants, with specific allocations for health effects research, monitoring for contaminants, and grants to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. The WIIN Act further amended the program. The WIIN Act (P.L. 114-322; Section 2113) made amendments to the DWSRF provisions, increasing the portion of the annual capitalization grant for program administration costs. It also required that funds from a state DWSRF in FY2017 must use U.S.-produced iron and steel products for water system projects. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-188) amended the SDWA to address drinking water security threats, including new requirements for community water systems serving over 3,300 people. Section 1433 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 required community water systems serving more than 3,300 people to conduct vulnerability assessments for terrorist attacks. The provision also mandated the preparation of emergency response plans based on the assessment results, with exemptions for disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and penalties for inappropriate disclosure. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 mandated vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans for community water systems to address threats, with funding allocated for security enhancements. EPA was directed to review methods to prevent and respond to water supply disruptions by terrorists. Section 1435(e) authorized $15 million for FY2002 and additional funding for FY2003 through FY2005 to address water system disruptions. Civil and criminal penalties were increased for tampering with public water systems under the Bioterrorism Act, with maximum prison sentences and fines raised significantly. The maximum fine for tampering or threatening to tamper with public water systems increased to $100,000. EPA is authorized to provide technical assistance and grants for emergency situations under SDWA Subsection 1442(b). The Bioterrorism Act amended Subsection 1442(d) to allow appropriations of up to $35 million for emergency assistance in FY2002. EPA can conduct research on water contaminants and provide technical assistance to states and municipalities for water system regulation. The WIIN Act amended the SDWA to authorize EPA to conduct research on innovative water technologies and provide technical assistance to public water systems. It also authorized $10 million annually for developing new technologies for safe drinking water and investigating health implications of waste water reclamation/reuse. Section 1445 requires persons subject to SDWA requirements to establish and maintain records. Section 1445 of the SDWA mandates that individuals under its requirements must maintain records, conduct water monitoring, and provide necessary information to the Administrator. The Administrator or a representative can inspect properties to ensure compliance, with penalties for non-compliance. EPA is directed to establish monitoring criteria for unregulated contaminants, with a list of up to 30 contaminants to be monitored every five years. States can create monitoring plans for unregulated contaminants. The Safe Drinking Water Act mandates monitoring for unregulated contaminants in small systems, with $10 million authorized for grants for monitoring costs. A National Drinking Water Advisory Council advises the Administrator on activities and policies. Federal agencies must comply with drinking water requirements, with waivers for national security. EPA and other agencies are authorized for enforcement. Section 1456 of the Safe Drinking Water Act authorized grants to assist colonias in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas with health risks related to inadequate drinking water systems. Congress allocated $25 million annually from 1997 to 1999 for this purpose. Section 1457 allowed EPA to test estrogenic substances in drinking water, while Section 1458 directed EPA to study subpopulations at greater risk and biological mechanisms related to drinking water. The Drinking Water Protection Act (P.L. 114-45) added Section 1459 to the Safe Drinking Water Act, directing EPA to develop a strategic plan to assess and manage risks associated with algal toxins in public drinking water supplies. This includes assessing health risks, publishing a list of toxins, issuing health advisories, providing guidance on toxin identification, recommending treatment options, and offering technical assistance to states and water systems. The 1996 SDWA amendments included provisions for states to transfer funds between drinking water and clean water programs. Congress also authorized technical assistance for addressing toxin-producing cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms. The 1996 SDWA amendments authorized EPA to make grants to Alaska for rural sanitation improvements and required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue bottled drinking water standards. Grants were provided for water and wastewater systems, training, and technical assistance programs. Congress reauthorized appropriations for rural sanitation grants at $40 million for FY2001 through FY2005. EPA was also authorized to make grants to colonias. Section 307 of the 1996 SDWA authorized EPA grants to colonias for wastewater treatment works, with appropriations of $25 million for FY1997 through FY1999. Section 401 provided additional assistance, up to $50 million for FY1997 through FY2003, for infrastructure and watershed protection projects."
