    "content": "During a Senate hearing, Senator Jeff Sessions questioned Chuck Hagel about the Obama Administration's plans for nuclear arms control and the requirement to provide briefings to Congress. Hagel committed to pursuing the required consultations and agreements for further reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons. Senator Sessions sought assurances that the Administration would not bypass the Senate in treaty-making decisions. Senator Hagel did not respond to Senator Sessions' request for assurances that the Obama Administration would not bypass the Senate in reducing U.S. nuclear weapons through informal means. Concerns were raised about potential reductions without a formal treaty, despite the Administration's interest in further nuclear arms control. The United States and Russia have not yet started formal negotiations on further reductions in nuclear weapons due to disagreements on various issues. This includes the U.S. interest in limiting nonstrategic nuclear weapons and Russia's interest in limiting U.S. ballistic missile defense programs. Congressional concerns about the Administration's plans to reduce U.S. nuclear warheads and funding requests for the modernization of the U.S. nuclear enterprise have also contributed to the delay. The Administration's funding requests for modernizing the U.S. nuclear enterprise have raised questions about Senate ratification of a new treaty. Analysts suggest pursuing \"parallel reductions\" with Russia based on mutual understanding rather than a formal treaty. The U.S. may seek an informal understanding within the New START Treaty framework to reduce limits on nuclear forces. Different mechanisms like formal treaties, informal understandings, and unilateral adjustments have been used by the U.S. to reduce nuclear weapons. Each mechanism serves different purposes in the arms control process. The United States has signed formal arms control treaties with the Soviet Union and Russia to limit nuclear weapons. The Senate reviews and ratifies these treaties, as per Article II of the Constitution. Presidents have also unilaterally reduced forces, with President George H.W. Bush withdrawing U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons without congressional approval. President George W. Bush also withdrew some U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons without seeking approval. The report reviews the unilateral reductions of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons by Presidents without seeking approval from Congress. These reductions are part of the normal force planning process managed by the Department of Defense and approved by the President. The report also examines the role of nuclear arms control in the U.S.-Soviet relationship, including formal treaties and unilateral steps taken by the United States to alter its nuclear posture. The report discusses bilateral treaties and unilateral steps taken by the United States to change its nuclear posture, as well as the role of arms control in the U.S.-Russian relationship. It also outlines the involvement of Congress in the arms control process and provides an analytical framework for evaluating different mechanisms. The report does not address whether the U.S. should pursue further reductions in nuclear weapons. The report evaluates mechanisms for implementing the Administration's policy of further reductions in U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, without considering involvement of other nations like China, the United Kingdom, and France. The United States and Russia have more nuclear weapons than other nations, so they may reduce their arsenal before involving others. Arms control was crucial during the Cold War in the U.S.-Soviet relationship. During the Cold War, arms control played a crucial role in the U.S.-Soviet relationship. From 1972 to 1991, several treaties and agreements were signed to limit nuclear weapons and missile defenses, providing a platform for communication and transparency between the two nations. This helped build confidence and understanding of each other's capabilities. The arms control agreements between the U.S. and Soviet Union during the Cold War helped build confidence and understanding of each other's nuclear forces. Some questioned the value of these talks, arguing that they restricted the U.S.'s ability to respond to emerging threats. During the Cold War, arms control agreements between the U.S. and Soviet Union aimed to limit specific weapons systems. The Soviet Union deployed intermediate range missiles in the late 1970s and early 1980s, prompting the U.S. to respond by deploying its own weapons. Concerns arose over compliance with treaty obligations, but most issues were resolved through discussions in compliance review commissions. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union deployed intermediate-range missiles, leading to concerns about a potential \"decapitation\" strategy. This prompted negotiations for the 1987 INF Treaty, eliminating these missiles. Additionally, U.S. analysts were worried about the Soviet's large \"heavy\" ICBMs. During the Cold War, analysts were concerned about the Soviet Union's large \"heavy\" ICBMs with multiple warheads. The U.S. deployed warheads at sea on submarine-launched ballistic missiles to reduce vulnerability. Arms control agreements aimed to limit the number of Soviet ICBMs. During the Cold War, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) aimed to cap permitted missile numbers. The 1991 START treaty saw the Soviet Union reduce weapons by 50%, and the 1993 START II Treaty had Russia eliminate all missiles. These bilateral agreements did not restrict shorter-range nuclear weapons, allowing nations to adjust numbers and deployment as needed for national security. No limits were set on extra warheads in storage or spare warheads for deployment. During the Cold War, the United States deployed nonstrategic nuclear weapons at bases in Asia and NATO allies in Europe, adjusting forces in response to changing threats. Reductions began in the late 1970s, with deployed warheads declining from over 7,000 to below 6,000 by the mid-1980s. NATO allies agreed to remove older weapons in favor of modern ones, maintaining deterrence with fewer but more advanced weapons. In 1983, NATO defense ministers approved weapons modernization plans and called for a reduction of 1,400 nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The Pentagon implemented these reductions without Congress approval, leading to a sharp decrease in U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons by the mid-1990s. President George H.W. Bush's Presidential Nuclear Initiative withdrew over 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons, indicating a unilateral decision by the United States. The Pentagon viewed these steps as sound military policy. The Pentagon implemented reductions in nonstrategic nuclear weapons without Congress approval, following President Bush's unilateral decision. Congress did not object and even suggested further cuts in nuclear programs. The United States maintains a stockpile of warheads, some of which are active and could be deployed based on changes in the international security environment. The United States has significantly reduced its stockpile of warheads over the decades, reaching a peak of 31,255 warheads in 1967 and declining to 13,708 warheads in 1992. These reductions were made unilaterally as the US and Soviet Union never counted these warheads under arms control treaties. The United States reduced its stockpile of warheads unilaterally by retiring older warheads, replacing them with new types, and adjusting the number needed for the deployed force. These reductions were influenced by changes in nuclear strategy and international security environment. Cooperation between the US and Russia expanded in the 1990s, leading to arms control agreements and collaboration on various issues. The United States and Russia negotiated three arms control treaties since 1992, with two entering into force. The second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) aimed to reduce deployed strategic warheads and enhance stability. However, the Treaty did not enter into force due to disagreements. During the Clinton Administration, the United States and Russia worked together on implementing START I but did not sign any new bilateral strategic arms control treaties. They aimed to negotiate further reductions in a START III Treaty, which could have reduced their strategic forces to 2,500 deployed warheads, but negotiations were not concluded before the end of the administration. Analysts believed the U.S. no longer needed arms control to limit the Russian threat, expecting Russian forces to decline due to economic pressure. President George W. Bush pledged to unilaterally reduce U.S. strategic nuclear forces to the \"lowest possible number consistent with our national security\" without the need for a formal treaty, reflecting the belief that nuclear weapons could deter emerging threats from nations seeking their own nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The Bush Administration no longer saw Russia's nuclear arsenal as a factor in U.S. nuclear plans, believing that arms control agreements were no longer necessary as Russia was no longer considered an enemy. They advocated for collaboration with Russia to reduce security threats instead of engaging in adversarial arms control negotiations. The Bush Administration believed arms control agreements with Russia were unnecessary as they no longer saw Russia as a threat. They preferred unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons to quickly adjust forces based on security needs. President Bush announced plans for reductions in 2001. President Bush announced plans to reduce U.S. nuclear weapons in November 2001 without a formal agreement with Russia, emphasizing a new relationship based on trust and cooperation. While Russia appreciated the decision, they preferred using formal arms control processes for reducing forces. Russia valued arms control negotiations as a forum to discuss sensitive security issues with the United States. During the 1990s, Russia viewed nuclear weapons as crucial for maintaining its superpower status after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Arms control negotiations with the Bush Administration provided Russia with status in international politics. The Administration initially preferred a less formal agreement for reducing nuclear weapons, but the U.S. Senate objected, insisting on a legally binding treaty for any reductions. The United States agreed to reduce its weapons through a treaty, not an executive agreement, as urged by Senators Biden and Helms. The George W. Bush Administration eventually codified the limits in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, known as the Moscow Treaty, which lacked detailed definitions, monitoring, or verification provisions. Administration officials mentioned using START monitoring provisions during Senate hearings on the Moscow Treaty. The United States and Russia discussed extending monitoring provisions in START through the end of the Moscow Treaty in 2006. Russia wanted a formal treaty with detailed limits and monitoring, but the Bush Administration preferred not to sign a treaty mandating further nuclear weapon reductions. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice argued against costly limitations and verification procedures. The United States and Russia discussed extending monitoring provisions in START through the end of the Moscow Treaty in 2006. The United States initially resisted Russia's push for a formal treaty with detailed limits and monitoring, preferring a less formal arrangement with voluntary notifications and site visits. Eventually, the United States agreed to attach monitoring provisions to a legally-binding document, but these provisions would not require the intrusive inspections permitted under START. During the Obama Administration, efforts were made to negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons. This was part of the administration's goal to reset U.S.-Russian relations and rebuild confidence through dialogue and cooperation. The negotiations aimed to create a legally binding agreement that would significantly impact Russia's nuclear force. The Obama Administration aimed to negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons. The Administration stated that Russia's nuclear force would play a significant role in determining the reduction of U.S. forces. The need for strict numerical parity between the two countries was no longer as crucial as during the Cold War, but large disparities in nuclear capabilities could raise concerns. Negotiations on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) began in May 2009 to preserve stability at reduced force levels. Negotiations for the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) between the U.S. and Russia began in May 2009 to reset their relationship and reduce deployed strategic warheads. The treaty was signed on April 10, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011. The Obama Administration sees New START as a first step towards further reductions in nuclear weapons. In March 2012, President Obama stated that the U.S. has more nuclear weapons than needed, even after the New START treaty. He expressed confidence in maintaining security while pursuing further reductions in the nuclear arsenal, with plans to cooperate with Russia on this matter. President Obama expressed his commitment to further reducing U.S. nuclear weapons during a speech in Berlin in June 2013. He believes that up to one-third of deployed strategic nuclear warheads can be reduced while maintaining security for the U.S. and its allies. This goal of negotiating reductions with Russia remains part of U.S. arms control policy, with plans to pursue further reductions on a bilateral basis. President Obama expressed his commitment to reducing U.S. nuclear weapons by up to one-third during a speech in Berlin in June 2013. He aims to negotiate reductions with Russia beyond Cold War nuclear postures, potentially without a formal treaty. The Obama Administration supports negotiated agreements over unilateral measures to address changes in NATO's nuclear posture. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested linking the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe to a reduction in numbers. In 2010, NATO endorsed linking the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe to a reduction in Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia have not started negotiations on further reductions, but President Obama plans to engage with allies to develop proposals for reducing nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The United States reduced its nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the 1990s, leaving approximately 1,100 weapons, with 500 air-delivered bombs in Europe and the rest stored in the US. The Clinton Administration adjusted weapon readiness but did not recommend further reductions. The George W. Bush Administration later reduced the number of weapons in Europe, leaving fewer than 200 air-delivered B61 bombs. The United States reduced its nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the 1990s, leaving approximately 1,100 weapons, with 500 air-delivered bombs in Europe and the rest stored in the US. The George W. Bush Administration further reduced the number of weapons in Europe, leaving fewer than 200 air-delivered B61 bombs at 5 locations, with withdrawals from Greece, Ramstein Air Base, and RAF Lakenheath between 2001 and 2006. These reductions were made without public announcements, negotiations with Russia, or approval from Congress. The Obama Administration later announced adjustments to the U.S. nuclear force as a result of the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. The Obama Administration decided to unilaterally adjust the U.S. nuclear force by retiring its stockpile of nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles, which were previously retained to assure allies in Asia. The decision was made due to the aging of the missiles and the lack of plans for replacement. This move was part of the Administration's effort to rely on other U.S. nuclear capabilities to assure allies in Asia. In 1992, the U.S. nuclear stockpile decreased during the Clinton Administration, reaching around 11,000 warheads by 1994. The stockpile remained at about 10,600 nondeployed warheads in 2000. The George W. Bush Administration aimed to reduce the stockpile by 50-60%, but specific numbers were not disclosed. The Obama Administration revealed the size of the stockpile in 2010. The U.S. stockpile size was disclosed in 2010, showing 5,113 warheads in 2009, a 60% decrease from 2000. Reductions were made post-2001 Nuclear Posture Review without seeking reciprocity from Russia. Congress approved the reductions but sought to limit funding for new warhead development. Obama Administration continued reducing the stockpile in its first term. The U.S. nuclear stockpile has decreased by around 500 warheads since 2009, reaching approximately 4,650 warheads in early 2014. The Obama Administration's slower pace of reduction may be due to the retirement of nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles. If further reductions are pursued, Congress could influence implementation through formal agreements or Executive Agreements with Russia. The President could incorporate legally-binding limits in an Executive Agreement for U.S. nuclear weapons reductions. If a formal treaty is not agreed upon with Russia, the President could unilaterally reduce the U.S. arsenal with Congress's approval. Any new arms control treaty would require Senate approval for ratification. The Senate committees would hold hearings, craft a resolution of ratification, and vote on it with a two-thirds majority required to pass. Any changes to the New START treaty that impose legally-binding obligations on the U.S. would need to be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. Declaration 9 of the Resolution of Ratification emphasized the need for Senate approval for any modifications to the treaty. The U.S. has historically entered into major arms control agreements through treaties, but agreements could also be made through Executive Agreements with Congress's approval. The United States has historically entered into major arms control agreements through treaties, but agreements could also be made through congressional-executive agreements, which do not require Senate approval. This mechanism was used to codify limits on offensive forces in 1972 as part of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). The Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961, amended in 1994, requires the President to seek congressional approval if he reduces U.S. nuclear forces through an agreement with another nation. The Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961, amended in 1994, requires any arms reduction agreement obligating the United States to be made as a treaty presented to the Senate for its advice and consent. The Senate indicated in a declaration to the New START Resolution of Ratification that further arms reduction agreements must be made only through the treaty-making power of the President or by further affirmative legislation by Congress. The Senate expects future arms control agreements to be treated as treaties, not congressional-executive agreements, as stated in the Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961. This Act requires any arms reduction agreement to be presented to the Senate for approval. The Executive is barred from obligating the US to reduce armaments without treaty approval or congressional authorization. The United States has made nonlegal political commitments or \"gentlemen's agreements\" with other countries, which carry political or moral weight but have no legal effect. According to the executive branch interpretation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, a document with a non-legally binding commitment would not require Senate approval if it clearly states it is only politically binding. The United States and Russia have made politically binding statements within arms control agreements, which do not have the force of law but carry political weight. These commitments have sparked controversy and occasional opposition, but the President's ability to implement them is limited by legal constraints and funding restrictions imposed by Congress. For example, in the 1991 START Treaty, they exchanged declarations on nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles. The Soviet Union wanted to count nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) under the Treaty limits, but the United States rejected this due to verification challenges. Both countries issued statements agreeing to exchange annual declarations on the maximum number of deployed nuclear SLCMs, with a cap of 880 per year. This number was not a legally-binding limit on deployed SLCMs. The U.S. and Russia agreed to exchange annual declarations on the maximum number of deployed nuclear SLCMs, with a cap of 880 per year. While not legally binding, these declarations were politically binding. If the Obama Administration pursued unilateral nuclear reductions, Congress could oversee the process through legislation like the National Defense Authorization Act for 2014. The United States aims for further strategic nuclear arms reductions with Russia below the New START Treaty levels, to be pursued through a negotiated agreement. Congress can influence arms control through funding decisions, as seen in past attempts to limit ABM system funding. Despite initial failures, these efforts eventually led to the ABM Treaty in 1972, restricting each side to two ABM sites. After Congress showed support for restraint in ABM system deployment through funding votes, the Nixon Administration agreed to exercise restraint. Congress also influenced arms control by imposing funding restrictions in the late 1990s. In 1994, the Defense Department decided to retire Peacekeeper ICBMs and Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines to meet START II limits, which Congress later prevented in the 1997 Defense Authorization Act. The 1997 Defense Authorization Act imposed funding limitations on retiring or dismantling bombers, missiles, or submarines limited by the START II Treaty. The President could waive the limitation if START II entered into force, but a report to Congress was required before implementing any agreement for substantial early deactivation of these systems. Congress passed this limitation to incentivize the Russian parliament to approve the START II Treaty. The Clinton Administration faced opposition from Congress regarding nuclear weapons policies, leading to funding limitations on reducing U.S. nuclear forces in Defense Authorization Bills. The Bush Administration saw a repeal of these limitations in the FY2002 Defense Bill after the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. Recent versions of the National Defense Authorization Act have also included similar limitations on nuclear force reductions. The 2012 Authorization Act (H.R. 1540) prohibited funding for retiring systems covered by New START unless a positive report on maintaining and modernizing the U.S. nuclear enterprise was issued. This legislation aimed to prevent the President from complying with New START Treaty limits, potentially creating a legal quandary. The final version of the act (P.L. 112-81, Section 1045) requires the United States to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent. If resources fall short, the President must submit a report detailing the effects and a plan to address them. Congress has also sought to prevent the President from reducing U.S. nuclear forces below New START limits. The Act prohibits the use of funds to reduce U.S. nuclear forces below New START limits without Senate approval of a new treaty. Congress emphasizes the importance of further reductions through the treaty process. The decision to alter the size or structure of the U.S. nuclear arsenal can be influenced by various factors, such as the international security environment and domestic political conditions. This can lead to the use of formal treaties, informal reductions, or unilateral adjustments. During the Cold War, the U.S. and Soviet Union aimed for balanced provisions in formal treaties. During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union sought balanced and equal provisions in formal treaties, despite differences in their weapon systems. This balance aimed to enhance understanding and stability, although determining trades between weapon systems often prolonged negotiations. Analysts debate whether equality and balance reduce the risk of nuclear war by minimizing arms race incentives. An arms race could lead to instabilities if nations seek new weapons to offset disadvantages or gain advantages. Some argue that arms control agreements may lock nations into destabilizing force structures over time. The existence of formal treaties could increase instability and the risk of war, as seen in U.S. arms control policy. The United States signed an Interim Agreement on Offensive Arms with unequal limits on missiles in forces. Congress mandated future treaties with the Soviet Union to have equal limits. Subsequent treaties with Russia have included equal limits, sometimes with sublimits on weapon categories. Treaties have specified single agreed limits or ranges for aggregate limits. The range applied equally to both sides. During the 1990s, the United States and Russia negotiated arms control treaties for equal limits on nuclear forces, symbolizing political balance. The START Treaty and START II Treaty provided Russia with a sense of equal status post-Soviet Union collapse. President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush supported unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear forces. In 2001, the United States made significant changes to its nuclear posture by unilaterally reducing its nuclear forces without seeking reciprocal reductions from Russia. This decision was based on the belief that the US could maintain its security without the need for balance or equality in nuclear forces. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 led to the US deciding it no longer needed ground-based nuclear weapons in Europe, as the threat they were meant to deter had diminished. This shift allowed for sweeping changes in the US nuclear posture in a short period of time. In 2001, the United States unilaterally reduced its nuclear forces without seeking reciprocal reductions from Russia, believing it could maintain security without balance in nuclear forces. This decision allowed for sweeping changes in the US nuclear posture in a short time, reflecting improved US-Russia relations post-Cold War. President Bush proposed each nation declare its preferred force size and reduce to that level, no longer prioritizing force equality for stability or war risk reduction. The US could adjust its forces as needed without formal treaty limits to address emerging threats. The Obama Administration emphasized the importance of balance and equality in nuclear capabilities for stability in the U.S.-Russian relationship. While exact parity was not deemed necessary, large disparities could undermine a stable strategic relationship. Negotiations on reductions in strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons were supported to avoid significant differences in forces. However, achieving balanced or equal reductions in a treaty may not always be possible. The Administration aimed for the next U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control treaty to cover deployed strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The Obama Administration emphasized balance and equality in nuclear capabilities for stability in the U.S.-Russian relationship. Negotiations aimed for the next nuclear arms control treaty to cover deployed strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons, possibly limiting them within an aggregate limit on all categories of warheads. Russia has different priorities, seeking limits on U.S. ballistic missile defense programs and counting long-range conventional weapons in any further limits on strategic offensive forces. Formal arms control negotiations and resulting treaties can enhance each nation's understanding of the other's forces and capabilities, allowing for predictions of future changes. Sharing details during negotiations helps in understanding emerging threats and limits in agreements provide confidence about the other nation's forces. This knowledge, combined with treaty limits, reduces pressures to acquire more weapons and specific types to counter potential threats. Monitoring in a treaty is crucial for ensuring compliance. Arms control treaties provide nations with confidence in predicting and understanding each other's forces and capabilities. The level of detail in these treaties increased over the years, leading to the 1991 START Treaty which includes 290 pages of documents with detailed restrictions and monitoring provisions. This ensures that parties are not surprised by each other's actions and have sufficient warning if treaty-imposed limits are being evaded. The United States and Russia did not formalize the reductions outlined in the 1991 PNIs in a treaty. This lack of detail has led to disputes over Russia's compliance with its obligations and makes it hard to predict each other's nonstrategic nuclear forces. Predictability between the United States and Russia regarding the size and structure of their nonstrategic nuclear forces may be less important today than during the Cold War. Experts argue that initiating a nuclear attack is not in either country's national security interest. If both countries maintain a second-strike retaliatory capability, they may not fear changes in the other's nuclear force. The United States and Russia cooperate in various policy areas and share information about their nuclear force structure plans. The United States and Russia communicate about their nuclear force structure plans and concerns about future developments. Arms control treaties with equal limits limit flexibility, while unilateral U.S. nuclear reductions allow for setting the size and structure of its nuclear force. The United States reduced its nonstrategic forces unilaterally in 1991, retaining some weapons in storage for potential deployment. Similar considerations led to unilateral reductions in U.S. strategic nuclear forces in 2001, with the flexibility to adjust forces based on international security changes. The United States implemented quick reductions in its nuclear forces in 1991, allowing for flexibility in timing and the capacity to dismantle excess weapons. Unilateral reductions can be adjusted based on security needs, unlike treaties with set timelines for eliminations. This approach could potentially undermine nations reducing forces in parallel. The 2002 Moscow Treaty and the 2010 New START Treaty aimed to provide predictability and flexibility in reducing nuclear forces. The Moscow Treaty had equal limits on U.S. and Russian warheads but no specific system limits or timetable for reductions, allowing each side to reduce forces at its own pace. This lack of clarity on force definitions and counting rules could lead to instability and an arms race. The New START Treaty maintains flexible provisions for reducing nuclear forces, with an aggregate limit on deployed warheads and delivery vehicles but no sublimits on specific systems. This allows the United States to structure its remaining forces according to its security needs. The treaty does not impose strict counting rules, similar to the previous Moscow Treaty, which could lead to instability and an arms race. The New START Treaty allows for flexible reductions in nuclear forces without specific sublimits on systems. Each side declares its total number of warheads, exchanges data on deployed delivery vehicles, and conducts regular inspections for transparency and predictability in force structure. The United States and Russia could establish an informal transparency regime for nuclear reductions, exchanging data and possibly allowing visits or inspections to confirm each other's forces. This approach, similar to a proposal by the George W. Bush Administration in 2008, could provide predictability even without a formal treaty. The arms control process has been crucial in providing nations with access to military information for compliance verification. Starting in the 1980s, additional measures like data exchanges and on-site inspections were added to monitor forces and ensure treaty compliance, seen as a way to build trust. The arms control process includes sharing data, allowing inspections, and cooperating to confirm information collected by National Technical Means (NTM). These measures have built confidence in compliance with treaties since the late 1980s, fostering cooperation between the United States and Russia. Inspections provided ground truth and increased trust in compliance. The 2002 Moscow Treaty and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention lacked monitoring and verification provisions, relying on transparency measures. Treaties like the 1992 Open Skies Treaty focus on transparency and cooperation without imposing limits on forces and activities. Nations can determine their own level of transparency by publishing information. In the absence of a formal treaty, parties could determine their level of transparency by publishing data periodically on force reductions. However, the lack of agreement on transparency measures could undermine predictability and raise concerns about the accuracy of information on the other party's forces. Transparency may not always have a positive impact in improving predictability. The government may choose to adjust its forces unilaterally to maintain ambiguity about its nuclear arsenal for deterrent value and to avoid providing critical national security information for compliance verification with treaty-mandated reductions. This explains why limits on stored, nondeployed warheads have not been included in formal treaties between the United States and Russia. The United States and Russia have not included limits on stored, nondeployed warheads in formal treaties. When President George H.W. Bush and President Gorbachev announced the PNIs in 1991, they did not include cooperative monitoring measures. The two nations could monitor each other to a certain degree with their own satellites and sensors, but did not provide data on numbers and locations of weapons covered by the PNIs, notify each other of weapon movements, or allow inspections at storage or deployment areas. Cooperation on PNIs lacked the rigor required by arms control treaties. The United States has occasionally questioned Russia's commitment to implementing the PNIs due to the lack of mechanisms to confirm the accuracy of Russia's declarations. Despite the incomplete knowledge about each other's forces, President George H.W. Bush announced in 1991 the withdrawal of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear forces regardless of the Soviet Union's actions. This lack of precise information about Soviet weapons did not hinder unilateral reductions in forces. The United States was willing to accept less cooperation and shared information on nuclear weapons in 2001 than in previous years, as it no longer saw Russia as a threat. President George W. Bush did not push for new transparency measures in the 2002 Moscow Treaty, indicating that discussions on transparency could be added later, which never happened. The Obama Administration had a different perspective on the value of cooperation. The Obama Administration emphasized the importance of transparency in arms control negotiations with Russia, highlighting the value of monitoring and verification capabilities. NATO also expressed a desire for increased transparency in future reductions of nonstrategic nuclear weapons. NATO aims to seek Russian agreement for increased transparency on nuclear weapons. The process of reducing nuclear forces through a bilateral arms control treaty may take longer than adopting unilateral adjustments. It can take time to negotiate and ratify a treaty, delaying the implementation of reductions. The negotiation process for bilateral arms control treaties can be lengthy due to the need for legislatures to review and vote on the Treaty, as well as other intervening events. For example, the original START Treaty between the United States and Soviet Union took over nine years to negotiate, with talks opening in 1982 and concluding in July 1991. In contrast, unilateral adjustments can be implemented more quickly, as seen with the development of measures for the 1991 PNIs by the George H.W. Bush Administration in under a month. The negotiation process for bilateral arms control treaties can be lengthy due to various factors such as political difficulties, disputes over treaty details, and unforeseen events. Negotiations may not keep up with weapons-planning processes or changes in the international environment, leading to delays in finalizing treaties. For example, the United States and Russia completed the 1993 START II Treaty and the 2010 New START Treaty in around one year, while the 2002 Moscow Treaty was completed in four months but lacked detailed provisions. When the START negotiations began, the United States and Soviet Union were adversaries in a tense relationship. President George H.W. Bush cancelled several weapons systems covered by the agreement two months after signing the Treaty in 1991. The Soviet Union ceased to exist six months after signing the Treaty, leading to negotiations to name successors before seeking ratification. Unilateral measures, like those announced in the 1991 PNIs, could allow the United States to respond to sudden changes in the international security environment. President George H.W. Bush sought analyses and alternatives from the Department of Defense and other agencies for altering U.S. nuclear forces. President George W. Bush planned reductions without negotiating with Russia, aiming for quick implementation. Delays between treaty signing and entry into force are not inevitable, as seen with the 1972 ABM Treaty between the United States and Soviet Union. The 1972 arms control treaty was ratified on August 3, 1972, and entered into force on October 2, 1972. Factors like legislative review, international events, and debates can delay the implementation of arms control treaties. This was evident in the lengthy debates surrounding treaties like the 1979 SALT II and 1991 START Treaty. The Senate held numerous hearings over several months on arms control treaties such as SALT II, START, and New START. International events like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the break-up of the Soviet Union have also impacted the ratification process of these treaties. The Protocol to START was signed in May 1992 for Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to join Russia as successors to the Soviet Union. The Treaty entered into force on December 4, 2004, after the return of nuclear warheads and joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The U.S. Senate and Russian Duma delayed their votes on START II due to concerns about missile defense and NATO enlargement. The legislative debate on arms control treaties can be delayed by disputes between the executive and legislative branches over treaty terms. This was seen in the delays of START II in 1995 and New START Treaty in 2010. The Senate eventually ratified START II in January 1996 despite disagreements. The New START Treaty allowed for weapons modernization, leading to extensive Senate negotiations in 2010. The U.S. Senate negotiated with the Obama Administration on nuclear modernization funding. Legislative review is required for unilateral adjustments in nuclear forces. Congress can review nuclear weapons plans during authorization and appropriations processes. Arms control treaties have lengthy implementation periods. The 1993 START II Treaty required the U.S. and Russia to reduce their forces by 2003, but due to delays, the deadline was extended to 2007. The 2002 Moscow Treaty allowed 10 years for force reductions, while the 2010 New START Treaty has a seven-year reduction period. The implementation process can be lengthy to ensure compliance with detailed elimination procedures. The lengthy time frame for nuclear weapons reduction may increase costs as nations maintain forces for years before elimination. Some in the US suggest reducing weapons to New START levels in less than seven years, but an accelerated schedule could also incur additional costs. Unilateral reductions can be tailored to a nation's needs, such as the gradual reduction planned by the George W. Bush Administration in 2001. The Obama Administration aimed to reduce U.S. nuclear weapons in cooperation with Russia, achieving this with the New START Treaty. Despite the desire for further reductions, the Administration continues to support this goal. The United States aims to work with Russia to reduce nuclear weapons further, but may not insist on a formal, legally-binding treaty. The 2010 NPR emphasized maintaining balance and equality between U.S. and Russian nuclear forces, supporting a cooperative approach to arms reductions without strictly equal limits. The New START Treaty allowed for different strategic force structures and warhead numbers between the two countries. The United States and Russia have different priorities for arms control treaties, making it challenging to agree on balanced limits. Previous treaties during the Cold War focused on predictability with specific limits, while the 2002 Moscow Treaty prioritized flexibility without detailed restrictions. The New START Treaty restored predictability with agreed definitions on systems and data exchange, allowing flexibility in force mix. If the US and Russia further reduce forces under New START, they can rely on its provisions for transparency until at least 2021 or 2026. Without a new agreement with legally-binding limits, they would increase flexibility. The Obama Administration values the monitoring and verification provisions in New START for nuclear weapons in Russia, providing transparency and confidence in compliance. Data exchanges and inspections apply to deployed strategic forces, aiding in further reductions and maintaining mutual trust. The Obama Administration values the monitoring and verification provisions in New START for nuclear weapons in Russia, providing transparency and confidence in compliance. The next round of arms control may include limits on nonstrategic nuclear weapons and nondeployed weapons, which are not covered by New START. Reducing strategic nuclear weapons further could rely on New START provisions for transparency, but nonstrategic and nondeployed weapons may require a separate agreement with less transparency. The approach for arms control may not be as comprehensive as a formal treaty, and there is a stall in the formal arms control process. Russia is hesitant to move forward on further reductions in strategic offensive forces without limitations on US missile defense plans. Negotiations for nonstrategic nuclear weapons are also on hold until the US agrees to certain terms. The United States may consider reducing its nuclear weapons below New START levels to achieve budget savings and delay modernization programs. This decision could also help garner support from other nations for nuclear disarmament efforts. The United States and Russia could potentially reduce their strategic nuclear weapons in parallel without negotiating a new Treaty to avoid delays in implementation. This approach could help in garnering support from other nations for nuclear disarmament efforts. Without signing a new treaty, the United States and Russia could potentially reduce their strategic nuclear weapons in parallel. The legality of this agreement would depend on the form and substance of the agreement, with a unilateral announcement likely not being legally binding, while a signed agreement would require Senate approval. The United States and Russia could issue a joint statement or sign a shared memorandum of understanding to incorporate newly agreed levels for nuclear reductions. The need for Congressional approval would depend on the nature of the agreement, with potential implications for legally-binding obligations. If the United States and Russia agree to reduce their nuclear weapons below New START levels without a formal Treaty, Congress may not need to approve the agreement but could limit funding for force reductions. The Obama Administration's priorities in this scenario may be questioned by Congress regarding predictability, transparency, balance, and equality. The United States and Russia may decide to reduce their nuclear forces without a formal Treaty, prioritizing flexibility and timeliness over balance and equality. This approach could allow for quicker implementation of reductions without the need for approval from legislative bodies. Some in Congress may support this if it reduces costs without compromising security. If a formal agreement proves difficult, an informal understanding could allow each nation to proceed independently. Some in Congress may oppose reducing U.S. nuclear forces due to concerns about risks and benefits, especially with countries like China, India, and Pakistan not bound by arms control agreements. They argue against further reductions while North Korea and Iran are increasing their nuclear capabilities. Some in Congress question the Administration's high priority on timeliness in arms control, as it may exclude Congress from the process. Debates in Congress over further nuclear reductions may reflect differing views on whether the U.S. should pursue reductions. Members may support or oppose Administration's chosen mechanism based on their stance on further reductions, regardless of whether they are codified in a treaty, pursued in parallel with Russia, or done unilaterally. Some in Congress may oppose further reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons, regardless of the method used. Congress may debate how these reductions could impact national security."
