    "content": "The Act titled \"Early Learning and Opportunity Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that the first 3 years of life are crucial for brain development, emotional growth, and overall well-being of a child. Research indicates that experiences during this period significantly impact individuals throughout their lives. Additionally, one in 3 victims of physical abuse is under 1 year old, and nearly half of infants in the US lack necessary resources for growth. High-quality care from adults is essential for child development. More than 50 percent of working women lack paid maternity leave, unlike 30 developing countries. Five million children under 3 are in care while parents work, with limited affordable child care options available. Less than 20% of child care services for very young children are of good quality, with nearly 50% being substandard and affecting children's development and safety. Families with children under 3 years old are the largest group living in poverty, with 25% of them below the poverty line and at risk for malnutrition, poor health, and maltreatment. These children are less likely to receive the necessary care for normal growth and development. The Act aims to enhance child care services for children under 3 years old, improve affordability, assist families in nurturing their children, and enhance existing programs for these services. Early Learning and Opportunity Grants are provided for these services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to eligible States to improve child care services for very young children and support services for their families. Priority is given to states that minimize administrative costs and coordinate activities with child care providers for children aged 3-6. The State, through legislative or executive action, aims to reduce duplication and barriers in providing child care services. Providers will be reimbursed at rates reflecting higher costs for accredited providers and for caring for very young children. SEC. 102. ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS.
