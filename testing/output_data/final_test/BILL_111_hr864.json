    "content": "The \"Renewable Fuel Pipelines Act of 2009\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Renewable Fuel Pipelines Act of 2009\" states that creating infrastructure for renewable fuels is crucial for the US. Currently, most gasoline is transported through pipelines, which are cost-effective and safe. The Act highlights that renewable fuels are currently transported by truck, barge, and rail, but using pipelines would alleviate infrastructure challenges. The Federal policy supports the production and use of renewable fuels, necessitating infrastructure for their transportation. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines. Loan guarantees are provided for projects constructing renewable fuel pipelines, with definitions and terms outlined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 amendments. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amendments allow for loan guarantees for projects involving renewable fuel pipelines, with specific provisions regarding guarantee applications and amounts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amendments allow for loan guarantees for renewable fuel pipelines, with guarantees not exceeding 90% of the project cost and the option for multiple guarantees as long as the total does not exceed 90% of the project cost. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amendments allow for loan guarantees for renewable fuel pipelines, with guarantees not exceeding 90% of the project cost. The Secretary may make guarantees for projects to construct renewable fuel pipelines without certain limitations, considering factors like volume of fuel, market size, storage availability, and proximity. The factors considered for loan guarantees for renewable fuel pipelines include proximity to production facilities, investment in terminal infrastructure, experience with renewable fuel, quality maintenance, timely project completion, and overall project feasibility. The entity carrying out the proposed project must have the ability to secure property rights-of-way. Eminent domain authority is granted when necessary right-of-way cannot be acquired by contract or agreement with the property owner for the construction of renewable fuel pipelines. The entity carrying out the proposed project can acquire necessary equipment for pipeline operation through eminent domain in federal or state courts if deemed necessary in the public interest. United States district courts have jurisdiction over cases where the property owner claims more than $3,000 for condemnation. The Secretary of Energy must publish a final rule within 90 days for a guarantee program to construct renewable fuel pipelines under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Additionally, a grant program is established for project preparation for these pipelines. The Secretary may provide grants for projects to assist in permit acquisition and planning for projects under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Grants provided under this section will not impact eligibility for a loan guarantee under the same Act. Grants and loan guarantee amounts for a project will be considered separately. The Secretary of Energy may provide grants for projects under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with grant amounts not exceeding 90 percent of the project cost. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. $50,000,000 is authorized for appropriation for this section."
