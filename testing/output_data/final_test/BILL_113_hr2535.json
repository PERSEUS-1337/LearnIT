    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Liberty Coinage and Deficit Reduction Act of 2013\". The Congress finds that the 50 State Quarters Program increased seigniorage, which helped reduce the budget deficit without raising taxes or cutting spending. The cumulative production of quarter dollars exceeded 34,000,000,000, resulting in a 136 percent increase compared to the previous 10-year period. This led to increased seigniorage revenues of approximately $3,000,000,000 and a reduction in the budget deficit. The Mint estimated that 147,000,000 Americans became collectors of 50 State quarters, showing a significant increase in demand for circulating coins beyond commerce when frequent design changes are made. The Westward Journey Nickel Program increased annual nickel production by 593,200,000 units with new designs commemorating the Lewis and Clark Expedition and President Thomas Jefferson. Liberty-themed coin designs were prevalent in US currency from the 1790s to the mid-20th century, symbolizing American values. A new series of \"Liberty\" themed coins could significantly increase seigniorage, reduce budget deficits, and allow for the continued production of coins honoring past presidents. A new series of \"Liberty\" themed coins is proposed to revitalize US coinage design, increase seigniorage, and reduce deficits. The series would include circulating commemorative coins alternating between the dime and quarter annually, along with a noncirculating numismatic half dollar. Starting in 2015, the Act provides for this initiative. The Act proposes a new series of \"Liberty\" themed coins starting in 2015, with a 1-year circulating commemorative dime and quarter annually. The dime will feature \"Liberty\" alongside President Roosevelt, while the quarter will feature \"Liberty\" alongside President Washington. This series aims to revitalize US coinage design and reduce deficits. The new \"Liberty\" themed coin program includes a 1-year dime, quarter, and half dollar with new designs issued annually to renew collector interest and promote demand. The program aims to maximize seigniorage for the United States Mint. The new \"Liberty\" themed coin program includes a series of circulating commemorative coins with new designs issued every 10 years. This initiative aims to increase the Mint's numismatic profits, reduce budget deficits, and promote American medallic art through public art on pocket change. The American Liberty Coin Program aims to issue circulating commemorative coins with new designs every 10 years to increase Mint's profits, reduce budget deficits, and promote American medallic art. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on the impact of a specific amendment on the Federal budget deficit over a 10-year period. A report with the estimate and explanation will be issued to Congress within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The effective date of the amendment will be determined based on the report's findings. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on the impact of a specific amendment on the Federal budget deficit over a 10-year period. If the report shows a reduction of $100,000,000 or more, it must be submitted to Congress within 90 days. Amendments to Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, will allow for the issuance of circulating dime and quarter dollar coins, as well as numismatic half dollar coins commemorating American values and attributes. The Secretary will mint dime coins every two years from 2015 onwards with designs symbolizing American Liberty, the American bald eagle, civil governance, the torch of knowledge, and The Union.

In 2016, quarter dollar coins will also be minted and issued. The Secretary must ensure that 40-50% of dime coins issued in a calendar year are made up of specific designs. The Secretary will issue quarter dollar coins in 2016 and every second year thereafter with obverse designs representing 'American Liberty' and reverse designs depicting an American bald eagle, a fasces emblem, the torch of knowledge, 'The Union', or American values. The Secretary will mint and issue half dollar coins annually from 2015 onwards with specific designs representing American values and attributes like freedom, independence, peace, strength, equality, democracy, and justice. The coins must meet certain quantity requirements set by the Secretary. The Secretary will mint half dollar coins annually from 2015 onwards with designs changed every 10 years, representing American values like freedom, democracy, and justice. The coins will have obverse designs symbolizing 'American Liberty' and reverse designs depicting an American bald eagle, fasces emblem, torch of knowledge, and 'The Union'. The 1977 Liberty mini dollar design by Frank Gasparro will be considered for half dollar coins issuance, ensuring 40-50% of coins are issued annually. The design requirements for dollar coins include the obverse design chosen by the Secretary with inscriptions of 'Liberty', 'In God We Trust', and the year of minting, and the reverse design chosen by the Secretary. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant committees, selects designs for coins with inscriptions of 'United States of America', 'E Pluribus Unum', and the coin's value. Artists and engravers from states may participate in the design selection process at the Secretary's discretion. The Secretary may mint and issue coins in uncirculated and proof qualities as deemed appropriate. Dimes, quarter dollars, and half dollar coins can be minted and issued in various designs, with a portion offered in rolls and bags at face value plus issuance costs. The Secretary will mint coins with a .999 fine silver content, obtaining silver from available resources including stockpiles established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act."
