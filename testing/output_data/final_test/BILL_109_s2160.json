    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Higher Education Enhancement Act\". It includes findings related to this Act. Congress finds that the population of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) is exceptionally diverse, varying in characteristics based on ethnicity, immigration patterns, historical experiences, and social group issues. This diversity includes indigenous Pacific Islanders, well-established populations in the US for generations, recent immigrants or refugees, and those forced to leave their home countries. The Federal government recognizes 17 ethnic groups as Asian Americans and 4 ethnic groups as Pacific Islanders. The educational attainment of different AAPI sub-populations is often overlooked due to aggregated data and the \"model minority myth\". This myth affects AAPI youth who are perceived as academically successful and may hinder outreach efforts by student services offices. Intentional outreach efforts are needed for AAPI students, as some subgroups like Vietnamese Americans, Hmong Americans, Cambodian Americans, Laotian Americans, and Pacific Islanders face high poverty rates. Despite AAPI overall having high college graduation rates, certain subgroups like Vietnamese Americans have much lower rates of degree attainment. Certain segments of the AAPI population, including Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Hmong, and Pacific Islanders, have low college degree attainment rates. Designating AAPI-serving institutions could help address barriers to higher education access for underserved AAPI students. SEC. 318. ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER-SERVING INSTITUTIONS. This section provides assistance to institutions serving Asian American and Pacific Islander students to address barriers to higher education access for underserved AAPI students. The Secretary will provide grants and assistance to Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions to enhance their capacity to serve these communities. Definitions for 'Asian American' and 'Pacific Islander' are based on federal standards. An Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institution is defined as a higher education institution. An Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institution is defined as a higher education institution with at least 10% Asian American and Pacific Islander students. A low-income individual is someone from a family with taxable income not exceeding 150% of the poverty level. Grants awarded to these institutions are meant to assist them in various activities. Islander-serving institutions can receive grants to improve their capacity to serve Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Authorized activities include purchasing educational equipment, renovating facilities, supporting faculty development, and curriculum enhancement. The curr_chunk outlines authorized activities for grants received by Islander-serving institutions, including curriculum development, purchase of educational materials, funds management, joint facility use, academic tutoring, community outreach programs, endowment fund establishment. The curr_chunk outlines activities for grants received by Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions, including endowment fund establishment, academic instruction in underrepresented disciplines, research for populations, and partnerships with community organizations. The institution, defined as an Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institution, can apply for assistance by submitting a 5-year plan to improve support for Asian American and Pacific Islander students. Additional information and assurances may be required by the Secretary. The Asian American and Pacific Islander-serving institutions eligible for funds under this section cannot receive funds from other parts. Section 313(d) exemption applies to eligible institutions. The Secretary will ensure equitable distribution and give priority consideration in awarding grants. The amendment gives priority consideration to institutions serving a significant percentage of low-income Asian American and Pacific Islander students. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2006 for section 318, with additional funding for the following 4 years."
