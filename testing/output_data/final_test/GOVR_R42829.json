    "content": "The \"farm bill\" reauthorizes agriculture-related statutes and programs every five years, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The 2008 farm bill expired in 2012 but was extended through 2013. This report focuses on the Nutrition title of the 2012 farm bill proposals. The 112th Congress's farm bill actions in 2012, including Senate-passed bill S. 3240 and House Committee-reported bill H.R. 6083, will influence the current Congress's farm bill formulation. The report discusses proposed changes to SNAP and other nutrition assistance programs in the bills. For background on USDA-FNS programs, refer to CRS Report R42353, Domestic Food Assistance. The 112th Congress's farm bill actions in 2012, including Senate-passed bill S. 3240 and House Committee-reported bill H.R. 6083, will influence the current Congress's farm bill formulation. The report discusses proposed changes to SNAP and other nutrition assistance programs in the bills. On April 26, 2012, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry marked up the Chair's mark of the 2012 farm bill, Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, S. 3240. The bill passed by a 16-5 voice vote and was later passed by the Senate on June 21, 2012 by a vote of 65-34. The Senate Committee reported the bill on August 28, 2012 in S.Rept. 112-203. House Committee on Agriculture introduced a Chair's mark of their 2012 farm bill, H.R. 6083. The House Committee considered 23 amendments to the Nutrition title and adopted 9 amendments. H.R. 6083 passed the committee on July 12, 2012. The House Committee reported the bill on September 13, 2012. The House-reported bill was not brought to the floor for a vote. The largest difference between the Senate-passed and House Committee bills was forecasted SNAP spending. The House Committee-reported bill's Nutrition title forecasted SNAP spending, mainly due to restrictions on SNAP \"Categorical Eligibility.\" CBO cost estimates compared farm bill nutrition spending under current law to proposed policies in S. 3240 and H.R. 6083, showing a net reduction in spending of $4.0 billion over 10 years for S. 3240. The Nutrition title in H.R. 6083, which includes SNAP and non-SNAP proposals, would result in a net reduction in spending of approximately $16.1 billion over 10 years. SNAP provisions alone are estimated to reduce spending by $16.5 billion. The Title's total CBO cost estimate includes non-SNAP proposals that may increase spending. The SNAP program, formerly known as food stamps, receives the largest federal funding and serves the most households. Approximately 78% of the current farm bill's spending is allocated to SNAP. The program is an open-ended entitlement with 100% federal funding, and its participation fluctuates with the economy. Funding for SNAP is authorized through appropriations, and it is subject to the appropriations process despite being a mandatory entitlement program. Funding for SNAP is subject to the appropriations process, allowing it to be extended even without reauthorization of the farm bill. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 proposed extending appropriations for SNAP until September 30, 2017. Changes to SNAP eligibility were included in the bills, with the House-reported bill containing more extensive changes affecting state administration of the program. Federal law sets basic eligibility rules for SNAP, including income and resource limits. There are two pathways to financial eligibility: meeting federal SNAP law criteria or being categorically eligible based on participation in other low-income assistance programs. States must administer traditional categorical eligibility, with the option to also adopt broad-based categorical eligibility. Under broad-based categorical eligibility, households receiving TANF-funded benefits may qualify for SNAP if income conditions are met. 43 states have chosen to implement this option, which often means assets are not checked for non-cash TANF benefits. For more details on SNAP eligibility and states' choices, refer to CRS Report R42054. H.R. 6083 (Section 4004) would have repealed \"broad-based categorical eligibility\" for SNAP, limiting eligibility to those receiving TANF cash assistance, SSI, or state-funded general assistance cash benefits. CBO estimated $11.5 billion in savings, including reduced SNAP participation and 280,000 children losing eligibility for free school meals. The CBO assumed that households ineligible for SNAP would qualify for reduced-price meals instead of free lunch and breakfast through the National School Lunch Program. College students aged 18-50 are generally ineligible for SNAP unless they meet specific criteria such as being disabled, employed at least 20 hours per week, or enrolled in certain programs like the SNAP Employment and Training program. The SNAP Employment and Training program does not have specific provisions for lottery or gambling winners. Proposed bills aim to add requirements for post-secondary students enrolled in the program to participate in employment-oriented training to qualify for SNAP benefits. The proposed bills aim to make households with substantial lottery or gambling winnings ineligible for SNAP benefits until they meet the eligibility limits. State SNAP agencies would need to work with state gaming agencies to determine winnings. The goal is to prevent cases like a lottery winner receiving SNAP benefits in the future without increasing administrative burden on states for overseeing private or charitable gaming activities. The Committee aims to prevent households with substantial lottery or gambling winnings from receiving SNAP benefits without increasing administrative burden on states. Eligibility for SNAP involves a thorough application process, including calculations based on household size, income, and deductible expenses. Deductions are applied to determine a household's net income, such as the excess shelter deduction. The Committee encourages the Secretary to evaluate criteria for substantial winnings to avoid increasing poverty. The excess shelter deduction and excess medical expenses deduction are examples of SNAP deductions. These deductions account for variations in the cost of living and health costs for households that include the elderly and disabled. The Senate-passed and House Committee-reported bills mostly maintained current federal law on SNAP benefit calculation but changed the role of LIHEAP in benefit calculation. The House Committee-reported bill also specified the excess medical expenses deduction. Current law allows SNAP households to use LIHEAP payments to document heating and cooling costs, triggering a standard utility allowance in the SNAP benefit calculation. States vary in how they consider LIHEAP in benefit calculations, with approximately 16 states implementing this practice according to a 2012 survey by USDA-FNS. According to a June 2012 survey by USDA-FNS, about 16 states have implemented the \"Heat and Eat\" policy, which leverages LIHEAP payments to increase SNAP benefits. Proposed legislation would have changed the treatment of LIHEAP benefits, requiring payments above $10 to confer this advantage. Payments of $10 or less would no longer qualify for a standard utility allowance in the benefit calculation process. CBO estimated that nearly 500,000 households each year would have had their SNAP benefits reduced by an average of $90 per month due to changes in utility cost documentation. Certain states were including medical marijuana expenses in excess shelter deductions, which was reaffirmed as not permissible by FNS. FNS reaffirmed its policy that SNAP benefits cannot be used for medical marijuana expenses. States allowing this deduction must stop immediately or face penalties. H.R. 6083 aimed to prevent medical marijuana from being considered a medical expense for SNAP benefits. Unlike other programs, SNAP does not provide cash benefits. The Senate-passed and House Committee-reported bills aimed to change the process of authorizing retailers, using technology for EBT transactions, and specific types of retailers that may accept SNAP benefits. The bills also included resources and policies to prevent the illegal use of benefits. SNAP benefits can only be redeemed for SNAP-eligible foods at authorized retailers. Retailer authorization is based on inventory and sales, as defined by the Food and Nutrition Act. The Food and Nutrition Act defines a retail food store as an establishment that offers a variety of foods in staple food categories or has over 50% of its sales in staple foods. Retailers can choose to purchase credit card machines that also accept EBT at their own cost. The Food and Nutrition Act defines a retail food store as an establishment offering staple foods. SNAP has transitioned to EBT, but manual vouchers are still accepted by some small retailers. Proposed bills aimed to amend SNAP's retailer authorization and equipment requirements. The proposed bills aimed to amend SNAP's retailer authorization by allowing stores with at least 45% of sales in SNAP-ineligible items to participate. They would also shift the costs of EBT machinery to retailers and prohibit states from issuing manual SNAP vouchers. The bills aimed to amend SNAP's retailer authorization by allowing stores with a certain percentage of sales in SNAP-ineligible items to participate. They would require EBT service providers to maintain unique terminal identification number information to prevent fraudulent transactions. The House-reported bill included further details on this provision, prohibiting USDA from issuing a regulation earlier than two years from enactment. Currently, there are no explicit provisions for redemption of SNAP benefits via wireless EBT machinery. Advocates have requested technological accommodations for farmers' markets and other direct-to-consumer venues to allow redemption of SNAP benefits. Currently, using a SNAP EBT card for online purchases is not allowed or technologically feasible. S. 3240 (Section 4007) and H.R. 6083 (Section 4010) proposed demonstration projects for mobile and online redemption, with the Senate bill requiring USDA to authorize retailers for EBT transactions using mobile technologies based on project results. The bill proposed demonstration projects for mobile and online redemption of SNAP benefits, with USDA authorization for retailers to accept benefits over the Internet and through mobile technologies. The House Committee-reported bill limited the authority to a USDA pilot on mobile technologies without allowing continued redemptions after the pilot. The H.R. 6083 provision did not specify a date for the mobile technologies report to Congress. SNAP benefits are not redeemable for CSA shares or at restaurants for hot, prepared foods. States may choose to operate restaurant meals programs for specific groups. Currently, non-profit grocery delivery services for the elderly and disabled must negotiate waivers with USDA to accept SNAP benefits. Legislation proposed making SNAP benefits redeemable for Community-Supported Agriculture shares and allowing restaurant meal programs for specific groups. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 would have imposed new responsibilities on state agencies, private establishments, and USDA for restaurants to participate in a meal program. Restaurants already accepting SNAP benefits would have a 180-day grace period. H.R. 6083 would also expand the definition of retail food stores to include governmental and non-profit food services for the elderly and disabled, with regulations to prevent misuse of SNAP benefits. USDA-FNS enforces penalties for SNAP trafficking, including fines and imprisonment. Trafficking rate estimated at one cent per SNAP dollar. $8 million annually allocated for retailer integrity and trafficking enforcement. Proposal to increase monitoring and penalties for lost EBT card replacement to prevent trafficking. The USDA-FNS enforces penalties for SNAP trafficking, including fines and imprisonment. The proposed rule aims to increase monitoring and penalties for lost EBT card replacement to prevent trafficking. S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 differ in the amount of funding provided for efforts to fight trafficking, with S. 3240 allocating $18.5 million annually and H.R. 6083 allocating $5 million annually. The proposed bills aim to prevent SNAP trafficking by adding statutory measures for lost EBT card replacement. USDA could require an explanation for lost cards and must protect vulnerable individuals. Federal law imposes work-related requirements for SNAP participation. State SNAP agencies may require work registrants to participate in Employment and Training programs, which can include job search, workfare, education programs, and other approved activities. States have flexibility in administering these programs. Since the 2002 farm bill, SNAP E&T programs have been funded by the federal government in various ways, including mandatory funds allocated to states based on a formula, funding for ABAWDs, matching funds for administrative costs, and matching funds for dependent care and transportation costs. State requirements and program activities vary, with some funding reductions occurring through changes in mandatory program spending. The FY2006-FY2012 appropriations laws annually rescinded $10.5 to $15 million from the $90 million SNAP E&T funding. P.L. 112-240 reduced the funding to $79 million. H.R. 6083 and S. 3240 proposed changes to SNAP E&T, with the House Committee bill reducing funding to $79 million for FY2013-FY2017 and adding monitoring and reporting requirements. The bill mandates additional monitoring, performance measures, and reporting requirements for SNAP E&T. It also requires cooperation from states, agencies, and contractors participating in Food and Nutrition Act programs. State agencies can receive $48 million per year in performance awards for achievements in payment accuracy, program access, application timeliness, and error rates. The 2002 farm bill established this performance award system. The SNAP quality control system includes performance awards for state agencies based on various measures. States can receive bonus awards for achievements in payment accuracy, program access, application timeliness, and error rates. Connecticut is the only state that has never received a high performance bonus. There is no requirement for states to reinvest these performance awards back into the SNAP program. Sanctions are imposed on states with high error rates for two consecutive years. Proposed bills aimed to either require reinvestment of bonus payments or repeal the authority to issue performance awards. The SNAP quality control system measures accuracy in eligibility and benefits calculation. The threshold for an acceptable error was temporarily raised to $50 in 2009 and extended in 2011. Proposed bills aimed to reduce the error tolerance level to $25 and adjust it for inflation. The Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grants program, formerly known as SNAP-Ed, provides funding for states to offer programs promoting healthy food choices and physical activity for low-income households. Recent farm bill amendments allow funds to be used for physical activity programs as well. Funding for this program was reduced in the P.L. 112-240 farm bill extension. The Food and Nutrition Act authorizes USDA to spend $5 million on grants to states for improving SNAP application process and eligibility. H.R. 6083 would have repealed this grant program, while S. 3240 makes no changes. SNAP allows certain legal immigrants to participate, with eligibility extended to specific groups. USCIS operates a verification system called Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements. The SAVE Program verifies noncitizens' immigration status for SNAP benefits. H.R. 6083 would have required all SNAP agencies to use the SAVE system for verification. States must also match SNAP data with Social Security Administration to prevent deceased individuals from receiving benefits. Administrative costs for SNAP are funded equally by state and federal funds. H.R. 6083 (Section 4029) would have mandated states to submit annual reports to prevent benefits going to deceased individuals or households receiving benefits in multiple states, with a penalty for noncompliance. The Senate bill did not include this requirement. Recent laws have aimed to standardize data exchange and reporting mechanisms across welfare programs to prevent fraud and save federal funds. H.R. 6083 (Section 4015) sought to standardize data exchange for SNAP, but this was not included in the Senate bill. \"Programs in Lieu of SNAP\" are alternative programs to SNAP. Entities in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands do not participate in SNAP but receive a nutrition assistance block grant. Indian tribal organizations can opt for the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) instead of SNAP, with federal funding covering most expenses. FDPIR provides a household food package as an alternative to SNAP's electronic benefit transfer. Funding for FDPIR is within the SNAP account. The Food and Nutrition Act includes authority to fund a local foods pilot program in the FDPIR program, which was extended by P.L. 112-240. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 would have reauthorized FDPIR and the local foods pilot program until FY2017. Funding for FDPIR is included within the SNAP account. In FY2017, Guam and the Virgin Islands participate in SNAP, while American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and CNMI do not. American Samoa and Puerto Rico receive mandatory funds for nutrition assistance block grants, while CNMI negotiates its block grant with USDA. The block grants offer flexibility but have limited funding amounts, growing at inflation rates. A study in 2008 explored including Puerto Rico in SNAP, and Puerto Rico currently has flexibility to provide some food assistance benefits through SNAP. H.R. 6083 (Section 4021) would have amended Puerto Rico's block grant to potentially impact how food assistance benefits are distributed, including the possibility of a non-cash allotment. This change could affect how participants use their benefits, especially the cash portion, which is currently used for non-food essentials like medicine and hygiene products. The full impact of a non-cash allotment on Puerto Rico retailers and participants remains uncertain. H.R. 6083 (Section 4021) proposed changes to Puerto Rico's block grant, requiring benefits to be provided only in EBT form, not cash. For the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the bill authorized funds for a feasibility study on administering a SNAP pilot program. S. 3240 made no changes to these territories' programs. USDA commodity foods are a variety of foods purchased for distribution to nutrition programs. The catalog of commodity foods includes a wide variety of fruit, vegetable, livestock, dairy\u2014fresh, frozen, and processed foods. The 2012 farm bill provisions relate to programs distributing USDA commodity foods such as TEFAP, CSFP, NSLP, SFSP, and CACFP. These programs distribute \"entitlement commodities\" and \"bonus commodities\" based on requests from the agricultural producer community. TEFAP, the main program supporting emergency feeding organizations, receives federal government resources in various ways. TEFAP receives federal government resources through mandatory funding for \"entitlement commodity\" foods distributed to emergency feeding organizations and discretionary funding for administrative costs. Bonus commodity donations are also received from USDA. Mandatory funding for \"entitlement commodities\" includes an immediate infusion of $50 million in FY2008, $250 million for FY2009, and $250 million adjusted for food-price inflation for FY2010-2012. This funding must be spent within one year. The TEFAP program receives federal funding for entitlement commodity foods and administrative costs. P.L. 112-240 extended TEFAP law through September 30, 2013. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 proposed increasing mandatory funding for TEFAP, with the Senate bill suggesting a $174 million increase over 10 years. Funding would have been front-loaded, with significant increases in the first four years. S. 3240 also proposed funding availability for two-year periods. The Senate's Committee Report encourages additional commodity purchases for TEFAP in times of high need. The House Committee bill proposed a $129 million increase over five years and $270 million over 10 years. CSFP provides food packages to eligible individuals, including pregnant women, infants, children, and the elderly. The CSFP program provides food packages to eligible individuals, including pregnant women, infants, children, and the elderly. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 would have extended authorities for USDA to purchase commodity foods for and operate CSFP, with eligibility limited to income-eligible elderly. Enrolled women, infants, and children would have been allowed to participate until their certification period expires. In addition to receiving cash reimbursements, schools participating in NSLP, SFSP, and CACFP also receive USDA commodity foods. The policies related to USDA commodity food procurement fall under the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Agriculture. The Senate and House bills in FY2011 included policies affecting the USDA foods served in school meal programs. Approximately 10% of federal assistance for school meal programs was allocated in FY2011. In FY2011, 10% of federal assistance for school meal programs was in the form of USDA commodity donations. Schools redeem entitlement commodity assistance from USDA based on meals served. Some stakeholders want entitlement commodities to be used for local purchases. Proposed changes in S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 relate to USDA food purchases for schools. The 2002 farm bill requires USDA to purchase additional fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts for domestic nutrition programs using Section 32 funds. The purchases required are $190 million (FY2008) to $206 million (FY2012 and beyond), with at least $50 million annually for fresh fruit and vegetable acquisitions for schools. The farm bill extension continued the $206 million level for FY2013. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 aimed to extend additional fruit and vegetable purchases, including the $50 million carve-out for schools. \"Farm to school programs focus on serving locally produced food in school cafeterias to enhance child nutrition. Goals include increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, supporting local farmers, and providing education. The National Farm to School Network aims to connect schools with local farms to improve student nutrition and support farmers.\" The federal government's role in promoting \"farm to school\" efforts is limited, with funding mainly provided through per-meal cash reimbursements to schools. S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 proposed different approaches to support these programs. For more information on \"farm to school\" resources, issues, and funding, refer to CRS Report R42155. S. 3240 aimed to facilitate the purchase of locally grown agricultural products for schools participating in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. The House-reported bill allowed schools with low commodity entitlement values to substitute local foods. Additionally, it proposed establishing cost-neutral farm to school demonstration projects and a pilot project for 5 states to use commodity funding to buy fresh produce. The 2008 farm bill authorized a pilot project to purchase whole grain products for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. The Senate-passed bill would renew funding for the Whole Grain Pilot and evaluation, providing $10 million over two years. It also included a new authority for purchasing pulse crop products for school meals programs. The House-reported bill did not include funding for the whole grain or pulse crop programs. USDA's authority to enter reprocessing agreements with private companies for processing commodity foods for donation expired in FY2012 but was renewed through P.L. 112-240. Both S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 aimed to extend USDA's authority to contract with private processors for bonus commodity foods through FY2017. The House-reported bill included a provision authorizing USDA to contract with a processor and retain title to bonus commodity foods. The 2008 farm bill funded the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, providing grant funding to states for elementary schools to purchase fresh fruit and vegetable snacks. The program restricts snacks to fresh produce, excluding frozen, canned, and dried options. Companies producing non-fresh options have been advocating for a change. H.R. 6083 (Section 4203) proposed changing the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to include frozen, canned, and dried options. The program provides grants to states for benefits redeemable at farmers' markets for those 60 and older. Funding for the program expired in 2012 but was extended by P.L. 112-240. The Hunger-Free Communities Grant Program funding was extended by P.L. 112-240 after expiring in 2012. S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 proposed mandatory funding of $20.6 million annually from CCC funds for FY2013-FY2017. H.R. 6083 included changes like expanding the program purpose to include low-income families at nutritional risk and adding discretionary authorization for additional funds. The Hunger-Free Communities Grant Program funding was extended by P.L. 112-240 after expiring in 2012. The grant initiatives aim to assess community hunger problems and support emergency feeding organizations. Funding is divided equally between these initiatives with a federal matching percentage limit of 80%. The 2008 farm bill authorized pilot projects to improve participant health, including a mandatory provision for \"point of purchase incentive\" projects. SNAP bonus incentive programs operate in many jurisdictions but do not receive federal funds for the incentives provided. The bonus incentive programs for SNAP participants allow them to redeem benefits for more than the dollar value. Markets can now conduct bonus incentive programs without needing a waiver from USDA-FNS, as long as the bonus funds are non-federal dollars. Legislation like S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 have addressed funding for Hunger-Free Communities Grants for Bonus Incentive Projects. The Senate-passed bill reauthorized Hunger-Free Communities Grants, amending the program to include incentive grants for SNAP participants to buy fruits and vegetables. The federal cost share would be limited to 50%, with $100 million in mandatory funding over five years for incentive grants. The House-reported bill did not extend Hunger-Free Communities grants but provided additional funding for bonus incentive-like projects. The Food and Nutrition Act authorizes grants for nonprofit organizations to improve community access to food, with infrastructure projects eligible for funding. Grants require a 50% match, with $5 million annually in mandatory funding provided by the 2008 farm bill. The funding is included in USDA's SNAP appropriation but transferred to NIFA for administration. S. 3240 and H.R. 6083 aimed to increase funding for Community Food Projects and amend project types. The Senate bill also included bonus incentives. The Senate-passed bill aimed to eliminate grant funding for infrastructure improvement projects but double mandatory funding for Community Food Projects to $10 million annually. The House-reported bill, on the other hand, would increase funding to $15 million annually, with $5 million allocated for projects promoting fruit and vegetable purchases by low-income households. Incentives were targeted towards low-income individuals without specifying SNAP participation. The Administration manages a \"Healthy Food Financing Initiative\" to provide grants and tax credits for food development. The Senate-passed bill included authorization for a Healthy Food Financing Initiative, with up to $125 million in funding for supporting food retail projects in underserved communities. USDA would select a national fund manager to administer the funds, aimed at expanding access to staple foods and accepting SNAP benefits. S. 3240 would establish a Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) with USDA selecting a national fund manager. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, jointly published by USDA and HHS, provide dietary advice for promoting health. S. 3240 would require guidelines to include specifications for pregnant women and children under two years by 2020. The Senate-passed and House-reported bills did not include changes to repeal the authority for a Nutrition Information and Awareness Pilot Program, which had not been funded or utilized in recent years."
