The Secretary of Defense will modify the Military Rules of Evidence to protect confidential communications between members of the Armed Forces alleging sexual assault and Victim Advocates. The privilege of confidential communication between members of the Armed Forces alleging sexual assault and Victim Advocates is protected under the Military Rules of Evidence, similar to the psychotherapist-patient privilege.

The term \"sexual assault\" is defined according to Department of Defense Directive 6495.01."
