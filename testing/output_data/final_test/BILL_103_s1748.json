    "content": "TITLE II--EXPEDITED PROCEDURES\n\nThis Act does not override the War Powers Resolution, except for the deployment of designated Armed Forces units under section 101. Congressional priority procedures are outlined in Section 201. Definitions for resolutions and session days are provided in this section. Resolutions introduced in the House of Representatives are referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, while those introduced in the Senate are referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. If a committee has not reported on a resolution within 7 days of its introduction, the committee is discharged from further consideration and the resolution is placed on the appropriate calendar. After a resolution is reported or discharged from a committee, no other resolution on the same use of force can be considered by that committee or the respective House of Congress. Any member can move to proceed with the resolution's consideration at any time. After a resolution is reported or discharged from a committee, no other resolution on the same use of force can be considered by that committee or the respective House of Congress. The motion to proceed with the resolution's consideration is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and the Senate, not debatable, and not subject to a motion to postpone. If agreed to, the resolution becomes the unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of. Whenever a point of order is raised in the Senate against the privileged status of a resolution initially identified as privileged for consideration, it shall be decided by the yeas and nays after four hours of debate. The point of order shall not set a precedent for future cases. Consideration of the resolution in a House of Congress follows this process. Consideration in a House of Congress of a resolution is limited to 12 hours, divided equally between the Majority Leader and Minority Leader. Additional time can be allotted by them. Only germane amendments are allowed, with debate limited to 2 hours per amendment. The amendment process in the House of Congress involves equal time division between the mover of the amendment and the resolution manager. The Minority Leader can offer one amendment under a one-hour time limit if they haven't had a previous opportunity. Debate on the amendment is limited to half an hour, with time divided between the mover and the resolution manager. In the House of Congress, the Minority Leader or designee controls the time for debate on a resolution. A motion to postpone or recommit the resolution is not allowed. Once debate time is used up, no further amendments can be proposed, and the resolution is voted on without any intervening motions or amendments. Appeals can be made regarding the application of the Rules of the Senate or House of Representatives. In the House of Congress, the Minority Leader or designee controls the time for debate on a resolution. Appeals can be made regarding the application of the Rules of the Senate or House of Representatives. If one House receives a resolution from the other House, certain procedures apply, including not referring the resolution to a committee in the receiving House. When resolutions from both Houses are not identical, the final vote will be on the resolution of the sending House with the text of the receiving House's resolution inserted. This vote will occur without debate or any intervening action before the resolution is returned. Upon receipt of a resolution from the other House, it will be referred to the appropriate committee in each House for consideration. Once a resolution is disposed of in one House, it is no longer in order to consider a similar resolution from the other House. If resolutions are not identical, the final vote will be on the resolution of the sending House with the text of the receiving House's resolution inserted. Upon receipt of a resolution from the other House, it will be referred to the appropriate committee for consideration. If the resolution is identical to one already disposed of, it can be considered without debate or amendment. Procedures for amendments between the Houses involve a nondebatable motion for consideration of the received resolution. Conferees have been appointed to handle the time for debate in Congress on motions related to amendments between the two Houses. Debate time is limited to 2 hours, equally divided and controlled by the mover and manager of the resolution. Amendments must be germane and relevant. Either House of Congress may disagree to an amendment in a resolution. Either House of Congress may disagree to an amendment or amendments made by the other House to a resolution, request a conference, and appoint conferees if needed. If conferees are unable to agree within 72 hours, the resolution process may be delayed. After agreeing to conference, the Houses must report back in disagreement. The report must be acted on within 2 session days, with debate limited to 3 hours. In cases of disagreement on a conference report, amendments must be germane and relevant. Debate time is limited to half an hour, divided between the mover of the amendment and the resolution manager. If the manager supports an amendment, the Minority Leader controls opposition time. If a resolution is vetoed, debate time is limited to 20 hours, divided between the Majority Leader, Minority Leader, and their designees. The section enacted by Congress outlines rules for the Senate and House regarding procedures for resolutions, recognizing the constitutional right of each House to change rules related to its procedures. Section 1013 of the Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985, does not apply to joint resolutions introduced under this Act."
