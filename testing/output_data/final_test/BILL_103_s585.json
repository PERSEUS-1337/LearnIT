The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1993 allows for diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and awards attorneys' fees to the prevailing party. Section 1332 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for attorneys' fees in actions under this section. The prevailing party is entitled to attorneys' fees only if they prevail on any position or claim advanced during the action. Attorneys' fees are to be paid by the nonprevailing party but cannot exceed the amount of the nonprevailing party's attorneys' fees for that position or claim. Counsel of record must maintain accurate records of hours worked on the matter to receive attorneys' fees. The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1993 allows for diversity of citizenship jurisdiction and awards attorneys' fees to the prevailing party under certain conditions. The court may limit fees recovered based on special circumstances. The term 'prevailing party' is defined as a party who obtains a favorable final judgment in the action. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts is required to conduct a study on the impact of these fee requirements. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts is mandated to study the impact of fee requirements on actions brought under section 1332 of title 28, United States Code. The study includes data on actions where the nonprevailing party paid attorneys' fees and assesses the deterrent effect on frivolous actions. A report with study results and recommendations on continuing or expanding the requirements must be submitted to Congress within 4 years of the Act's enactment. The section and amendment made by this Act should be repealed no later than 5 years after enactment. SEC. 3. OFFER OF JUDGMENT. Amends Part V of title 28, United States Code by adding a new chapter titled \"CHAPTER 114--PRETRIAL PROVISIONS.\" Sec. 1721 allows parties in a civil action to make written offers for judgment. If the offer is accepted within 14 days, the clerk will enter judgment. If not accepted, the offer is deemed withdrawn. If the final judgment is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the offeror's attorney fees incurred after the offer's expiration. The offeror may recover attorney fees incurred after the offer's expiration to make them whole. The award of attorney fees cannot exceed the judgment amount. An offer made under this section does not prevent a subsequent offer. When liability is determined but the amount remains uncertain, a party can make an offer of judgment with the same effect as before trial. The court may shorten the acceptance period, but it must be at least 7 days. The offeror can recover attorney fees incurred after the offer's expiration to be made whole, not exceeding the judgment amount. A subsequent offer does not deprive the offeror of the benefits of their initial offer unless it is more favorable. If the judgment includes nonmonetary relief, it must be determined to be more favorable than the offer only if all nonmonetary relief terms were included. This section does not apply to class or derivative actions under specific rules. The provisions do not limit awards or reduce amounts received under statutes providing for attorney's fees payment by another party. The section allows for recovery of attorney fees incurred after an offer's expiration, not exceeding the judgment amount. The amount received can be set off against an award made under a specific statute. A technical amendment is made to the table of chapters in the United States Code. SEC. 4. Prior notice required before filing a civil action in the United States District Court. Prior notice of civil action is required before filing a civil action in a US court. The claimant must send a written notice to the intended defendant at least 30 days before filing, detailing the claims and damages. The notice must be sent via first-class mail or a commercial delivery service. The claimant must file a certificate of service when initiating a civil action. The statute of limitations for the action expires 30 days after written notice is sent to the defendant. The parties can extend this period by up to 90 days by agreement. These requirements do not apply in certain legal proceedings or if the assets are at risk of flight or dissipation. The district court may waive the requirements for filing a civil action if assets are at risk of flight, dissipation, or destruction, or if the defendant is likely to flee. This waiver may also apply in specific legal proceedings, such as enforcing a civil investigative demand or foreclosing a lien, or in cases involving urgent circumstances necessitating immediate court action. If the claimant fails to meet the requirements, the district court can find a defect in the filing. If the requirements for filing a civil action are not met by the claimant and the defendant asserts a defect within 60 days, the claim will be dismissed without prejudice. The claimant can refile within 60 days after dismissal if notice is transmitted and the original action was timely filed. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in title 28, United States Code. SEC. 5. CIVIL RIGHTS OF INSTITUTIONALIZED PERSONS ACT. 483. Prior notice of civil action. Section 7 of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act is amended to require exhaustion of administrative remedies within 180 days for adult inmates filing lawsuits. The Attorney General must provide assistance to state or local corrections agencies upon request. The Attorney General of the United States will provide technical advice and assistance to establish administrative remedies for inmate grievances. Section 1915(d) of title 28, United States Code, is amended to allow courts to request an attorney for indigent individuals and dismiss cases that are frivolous or malicious. These amendments will take effect upon the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. EXPERT WITNESSES. Amends Chapter 119 of title 28, United States Code to limit opinion evidence to one expert witness per party in civil actions, with exceptions for good cause. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its amendments is held invalid, the rest of the Act and amendments, as well as their application to other persons or circumstances, will not be affected. SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act and its amendments will become effective 90 days after enactment, except for actions or proceedings started before that date."
