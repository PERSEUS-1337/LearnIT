After the 9/11 attacks, foreign aid became crucial in U.S. national security strategy, with a focus on \"front line\" states in the war on terrorism. The Bush Administration restructured foreign aid programs in 2007 to better support transformational development efforts. The U.S. restructured foreign aid programs to focus on transformational development, emphasizing security and democracy. The new Strategic Framework divides aid into five objectives: peace and security, governing justly, investing in people, economic growth, and humanitarian assistance. The Millennium Challenge Account rewards countries with good governance, health, education, and economic policies. Some analysts believe recent U.S. foreign policy trends have weakened basic development programs. Some analysts argue that foreign aid resources have been diverted from traditional programs in countries with lower security threats or inadequate governance. Insufficient funding for foreign assistance objectives has led to a shift of aid functions to the Department of Defense. Foreign operations appropriations fluctuated over the past 25 years due to U.S. foreign policy responses to events like natural disasters and wars. U.S. assistance to front line states in the global war on terrorism and Iraq war-related funding have increased since 2001. Foreign aid funding has reached new highs due to contributions from the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Several Asia-Pacific countries are eligible for MCA assistance, with Mongolia signing a significant agreement in 2007. Vietnam has received substantial funding under PEPFAR. The war on terrorism has shifted foreign assistance priorities in Asia, leading to increased aid to the region since 2000. Since the war on terrorism began in 2001, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, and Indonesia have been the focus of the Bush Administration's counterterrorism efforts in South and Southeast Asia, due to their strategic importance, large Muslim populations, and insurgency movements with links to terrorist groups. This shift towards increased aid to the region began in 2000, following a period of declining U.S. assistance to Asia in the 1990s due to various factors such as Cold War security concerns, nuclear proliferation sanctions, and economic trends. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 prompted USAID to fund a regional economic recovery program for Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Since 2004, Indonesia and the Philippines received increased U.S. foreign aid for education programs promoting diversity, non-violent conflict resolution, and livelihood skills among Muslims in conflict areas. Funding for the Human Rights and Democracy Fund also saw a significant increase during the Bush Administration, reaching $71 million in FY2006 and FY2007. The U.S. government provided $65 million for National Endowment for Democracy (NED)-administered HRDF programs between 2003 and 2007. Approximately one-third of the Democracy Fund has been allocated to Asia, with a focus on rule of law and civil society programs in China. Sanctions on aid to Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Pakistan have mostly been lifted, but restrictions on non-humanitarian development aid, ESF, and military assistance have been imposed on these countries in the past decade to pressure them to improve performance related to democracy, human rights, and other areas. The United States continues to fund NGOs that run development and democracy programs in some of these countries. Sanctions on aid to Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Pakistan have been lifted. The Administration's FY2008 budget request for East Asian countries saw a slight increase compared to FY2007. Assistance to most East Asian countries is expected to decrease or remain the same in 2008. Indonesia and Vietnam received increases in Development Assistance and Foreign Military Financing. Global HIV/AIDS Initiative funding for Vietnam is set to grow by 36% in FY2008. Assistance to South Asian countries increased by 8% in FY2008. In FY2008, funding for South Asian countries increased by 8%, with greater funding for Bangladesh and Pakistan. The Administration also requested new funding for law enforcement activities in Nepal and Sri Lanka. Regional Development Mission Asia programs supported various initiatives in East and South Asia, including public health, water and sanitation services, trade, environmental preservation, and investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 made revisions to the Administration's request, including additional funding for democracy and humanitarian activities in Burma, democracy and rule of law programs in China, and increased military financing for the Philippines. The spending measure in FY2007 included increased FMF for the Philippines and new restrictions on FMF for Sri Lanka. Africa was the largest recipient of Child Survival and Health (CSH) and Development Assistance (DA) funding. East Asia saw significant growth in foreign aid spending since 2001, mainly due to counterterrorism efforts in the Philippines and Indonesia. Near East Asia and South and Central Asia were the largest recipients of Economic Support Funds and military assistance. In FY2007, Indonesia and the Philippines were major recipients of U.S. foreign aid, with a focus on counterterrorism efforts in the region.

Indonesia received the largest aid, followed by the Philippines, with a focus on ESF, health, and development assistance. The Philippines also received the most Foreign Military Financing in the region. In FY2007, the region's largest beneficiaries of U.S. foreign aid were Indonesia and the Philippines, with a focus on counterterrorism efforts. Indonesia, the Philippines, Laos, and Thailand received assistance for counter-narcotics and law enforcement. Indonesia, Cambodia, and the Philippines were major recipients of Non-proliferation, Anti-terrorism, De-mining, and Related Programs. Vietnam received funding from the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative. U.S. assistance also supported EAP regional programs, with a focus on economic growth efforts. The United States provides aid to East Asian countries for various purposes such as peace and security, democracy-building, and specific assistance to Taiwan and Singapore. Aid activities include counterterrorism, counternarcotics, non-proliferation, and maritime cooperation. Taiwan receives funding for export control and combating trafficking, while Singapore receives support to deter illegal arms flow across its maritime borders. Some countries in East Asia may have restricted or withheld assistance from the United States. The United States has imposed human rights-related sanctions on foreign assistance to countries like Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand, as well as the Indonesian military. Sanctions have been lifted on aid to Cambodia and Thailand since 2006. Indonesia faced sanctions on military assistance between 1993 and 2005 due to concerns about human rights violations by the Indonesian military forces. In 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice certified the resumption of full IMET for Indonesia, lifting restrictions on FMF assistance if the Indonesian government prosecutes cases of human rights violations by the military. The Secretary of State can waive restrictions on FMF for Indonesia if it serves U.S. national security interests, which was done in November 2005. The Bush Administration suspended military and peacekeeping assistance to Thailand after a military coup in 2006. The U.S. government also halted counter-terrorism assistance under the National Defense Authorization Act. However, aid programs not affected by these restrictions continued to receive funding. In 2008, security and military assistance to Thailand resumed after democratic elections. Compared to other donors in the region, China provides relatively little official development assistance. China provides limited official development assistance (ODA) and lacks a centralized foreign aid system. However, it offers various forms of economic assistance to Southeast Asia, including infrastructure projects, trade agreements, foreign direct investment, and loans.

However, others believe that China's assistance has benefited countries like Cambodia and Laos. The United States is urged to increase aid programs and diplomatic presence in the region to counter China's growing influence. Burma has suffered from deteriorating political, economic, educational, and public health systems under military rule for 40 years. The United States does not provide direct aid to Burma. The United States imposes sanctions on the Burmese government due to repression of democracy, failure to honor election results, and harassment of opposition leaders. Sanctions include travel and financial restrictions on government leaders, bans on imports from Burma, and opposition to international bank loans and debt restructuring assistance. Since 2001, Burma has consistently received a \"Tier 3\" assessment from the U.S. State Department for failing to combat trafficking in persons, potentially leading to aid withholding. The U.S. provides assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention, English language training, and aid to Burmese refugees in Thailand. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 allocated $13 million for Burmese student groups and democratic organizations outside Burma, and $3 million for displaced Burmese along Burma's borders. The U.S. provides $3 million for community-based organizations in Thailand to assist internally displaced persons in eastern Burma. Cambodia ranks 131st on the UNDP's Human Development Index due to fragile institutions, weak rule of law, and corruption.

The U.S. assistance mission in Cambodia aims to promote transparency, combat corruption, and strengthen civil society. Other areas include economic reform, improving military capability, and lifting a decade-long ban on direct bilateral aid in 2007 due to previous restrictions imposed on foreign assistance following Prime Minister Hun Sen's unlawful seizure of power in 1997. In Cambodia, U.S. assistance is focused on basic human needs through NGOs and local governments. Statutory exceptions allow for assistance to the central government in areas such as healthcare, education, combating human trafficking, and HIV/AIDS prevention.
