    "content": "Despite measles being declared eliminated in the United States 15 years ago, occasional outbreaks have raised questions about the virus, available treatments, and the federal government's role in preventing vaccine-preventable diseases like measles. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that measles is highly contagious and transmitted through coughing and sneezing. Measles is highly contagious and can live for up to two hours on surfaces. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, red/watery eyes, and a rash. Complications can include inflammation of the middle ear, pneumonia, and diarrhea. Serious cases may lead to hospitalization and even permanent brain damage. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and complications, including permanent brain damage. Infants, young children, adults over 20, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems are at highest risk. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, millions of people in the US were infected each year, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of hospitalizations. In 1954, John F. Enders and Dr. Thomas C. Peebles collected blood samples from ill students during a measles outbreak in Boston to create a vaccine. By 1963, they successfully developed a measles vaccine. Today, the measles vaccine is combined with mumps and rubella or with mumps, rubella, and varicella. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends two doses of MMR vaccine for children and at least one dose for adults without immunity evidence. The CDC recommends receiving the measles vaccine, as it is much safer than getting the diseases. However, some individuals should not get the vaccine, including those with certain allergies, pregnant women, and individuals with certain medical conditions. The vaccine can cause mild, moderate, or severe side effects, but serious harm or death is extremely rare. The MMR vaccine can cause mild to severe side effects, with severe problems being very rare. Concerns over vaccine safety, including a perceived link to autism, have led to lower vaccination rates in some areas. However, scientific studies have overwhelmingly found no link between autism and the MMR vaccine. Data from the CDC shows high national coverage for the MMR vaccine among children aged 19-35 months. MMR vaccine coverage among children aged 19-35 months was 91.9%, varying by state. CDC reports high vaccination rates in some states but pockets of unvaccinated individuals exist, increasing measles susceptibility. Despite overall high immunization rates, measles importations into the U.S. have increased due to low vaccination rates in certain areas. The President's FY2016 budget request for the CDC highlights a high rate of immunization, but pockets of unvaccinated individuals increase measles susceptibility. In 2014, CDC reported 610 measles cases in the U.S., the highest since 1994. In 2015, there have been 102 measles cases, with a large outbreak linked to an amusement park in California. Only one company, Merck & Co., Inc., is licensed to sell measles vaccine in the U.S. Merck & Co., Inc. is the only company licensed to sell measles vaccines in the United States, offering MMR II and ProQuad vaccines. Financial data from 2013 and 2014 show significant revenue from the sales of these vaccines. The federal government plays a significant role in vaccine policy, including developing guidelines for vaccine administration and distribution. The CDC's ACIP provides evidence-based recommendations on vaccine usage, and the government monitors vaccine usage for adverse events. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used to report adverse events related to vaccine usage. The President's FY2016 budget included funding for the Vaccines for Children Program (VCP) to provide vaccines to children in need. Additionally, the CDC's Section 317 immunization program receives funding for vaccine purchase and programs. The President's FY2016 budget includes $560.5 million for the Section 317 program, which spent $38.3 million on MMR vaccine in 2014. The National Institutes of Health plans to spend $1.65 billion on vaccine research in FY2015. State and local governments have the authority to enact laws for public health, including mandatory vaccination laws. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of states to enforce mandatory vaccination programs under their police powers. In Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Court upheld a state law allowing vaccination requirements for individuals over 21 against smallpox, citing the protection of public health and safety. The Court also affirmed state and local authority to mandate vaccinations for students in cases like Zucht v. King. The Supreme Court has upheld states' power to enforce mandatory vaccination programs under their police powers, citing public health protection. Lower courts have given deference to states' use of police power for immunization requirements, with examples from West Virginia and New York. The courts have rejected challenges to laws regarding religious exemptions and school vaccination requirements. The Second Circuit has upheld laws for mandatory vaccinations during public health emergencies, giving power to governors or state health officers to order vaccinations. Exemptions are allowed for medical or religious reasons, but refusal may result in quarantine. During public health emergencies, mandatory vaccinations can be ordered by governors or state health officers, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Refusal may lead to quarantine. States primarily hold authority in this area, but the federal government can intervene under the Commerce Clause to regulate public health matters. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services can enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has the authority to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, including quarantine and isolation measures. Vaccination requirements can be issued for immigrants entering the United States, but there are no federal regulations for mandatory vaccination programs during public health emergencies. The CDC has determined that HPV and zoster vaccines are not required for immigration or adjustment of status in the US. Vaccination requirements may be waived for medical reasons or religious beliefs. The military mandates immunization against diseases like tetanus for its personnel. U.S. military regulations mandate troops to be immunized against various diseases including tetanus, diphtheria, influenza, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and yellow fever. Vaccinations start upon entry into service and continue based on troop specialties or assignments. Courts have upheld the legality of mandatory military vaccination orders.
