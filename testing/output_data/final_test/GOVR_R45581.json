    "content": "Many disputes in public education and school choice revolve around whether education is a public or private good. Education has characteristics of both, with benefits accruing to individuals and society. The distinction between education as a private or public good can be blurred, as individuals benefit from a stable society. Researchers argue that schooling involves balancing family and societal rights, with parents having the right to make decisions about their children's education in a democratic society. In a democratic society, education is used to reproduce essential political, economic, and social institutions through a common schooling experience. Various forms of school choice exist, including public charter schools, vouchers, tax credits, and homeschooling. Controversies arise over publicly funded school choice, particularly regarding support for students attending private, especially religiously affiliated, schools. Federal programs like those under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act support school choice efforts. The District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) provides federally funded vouchers for students in DC to attend private schools, including religiously affiliated ones. Established in 2003 under the DC School Choice Incentive Act, it is the only federally funded voucher program in the US. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 authorized and funded the DC OSP. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) was established in 2003 under the DC School Choice Incentive Act and is administered by the U.S. Department of Education. Funding was provided for the DC OSP, District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), and District of Columbia State Education Office (SEO) through a \"three-pronged approach\" suggested by Mayor Anthony Williams. This approach was supported by the George W. Bush Administration and many Members of Congress. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (DC OSP) was established in 2003 under the DC School Choice Incentive Act. It has been reauthorized twice, first by the SOAR Act in 2011 and then by the SOAR Reauthorization Act in 2017. Funding has been provided for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools. The SOAR Act authorized appropriations for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools through FY2019. $52.5 million was appropriated for the SOAR Act in FY2019, with $17.5 million each provided to the DC OSP, DCPS, and the DC State Education Office. The report discusses provisions of the SOAR Act, appropriations for the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools, student and private school participation in the DC OSP, local program management, and impact evaluations conducted. The report discusses the potential costs of discontinuing the DC OSP and includes appendices on scholarship use, private school participation, impact evaluation reports, and legislative history. The SOAR Act provides funding for scholarships for students to attend private schools and funding for DC public schools and charter schools. The report focuses on the DC OSP, providing an overview of the SOAR Act and legislative provisions related to funding for DC public schools and charter schools. Congressional findings discuss parental school choice and the inadequacy of public school options. The SOAR Act aims to provide low-income parents in DC with expanded school choice options, particularly for children attending low-performing schools. Congressional commitment includes funding for DC public schools, charter schools, and the DC OSP program. The DC OSP program aims to improve education until public schools in DC address health, safety, and security issues. Eligible students are DC residents from low-income households. The Secretary of Education oversees the program. The DC OSP program, overseen by the Secretary of Education, awards competitive grants to nonprofit organizations to provide expanded school choice options for eligible students from low-income households in DC. Grants are awarded based on application quality and program priorities for up to five years. The Secretary may award one or multiple grants, but historically has awarded to one entity at a time. The entity, also known as the local program administrator, is not limited in the number of eligible students receiving scholarships. The DC OSP program awards grants to nonprofit organizations to provide school choice options for eligible students from low-income households in DC. Eligible students cannot be excluded based on previous school attended, scholarship history, or participation in previous evaluations. Entities must submit detailed applications addressing program priorities and use a random selection process. The DC OSP program uses a random selection process to award scholarships to eligible students from low-income households, ensuring expanded choice opportunities at participating private schools. Parents are notified about the program and provided with information on tuition, fees, and transportation expenses. Participating private schools must meet reporting and program requirements. The eligible entity must ensure participating private schools meet program requirements, submit to site visits, use funds effectively, address scholarship renewals, have majority DC resident board members, utilize fiscal controls, and comply with reporting requirements. The eligible entity must prioritize scholarships for students from low-performing schools or with siblings already in the program. Compliance with evaluation requirements is also necessary for grant awards. The eligible entity must target resources to students lacking financial resources, provide a wide range of educational options, and use grant funds for scholarships to attend private schools. The scholarships must not exceed the school's regular tuition fees. The eligible entity must provide scholarships to eligible students in the DC OSP program, ensuring funds are used for tuition, fees, and transportation expenses. Larger scholarships can be given to students with the greatest need, with amounts adjusted annually for inflation. Scholarship amounts for the 2018-2019 school year are up to $8,857 for elementary and middle school and up to $13,287 for high school. $2 million of the DC OSP funds must be made available each fiscal year. The eligible entity can use $2 million of the DC OSP funds each fiscal year to cover administrative expenses, conduct studies on barriers for eligible students, educate parents about the program, and assist with the application process. The eligible entity can use up to 1% of the funds for tutoring services for eligible students needing academic assistance, with priority given to students from low-performing schools. Remaining funds can be carried over to subsequent fiscal years by the Secretary. The Secretary must make remaining funds available to the eligible entity within specific timeframes based on when the funds were appropriated. If the entity decides to use additional funds during a fiscal year, they must allocate at least 95% for scholarships and up to 5% for administrative expenses, parental assistance, or tutoring. Administrative expenses, parental assistance, or tutoring funds must be in addition to the annual allocation for these purposes. The participating private schools must meet requirements such as having a valid certificate of occupancy, providing accreditation information, demonstrating financial resources, allowing site visits, maintaining financial controls, and ensuring core subjects are taught by qualified teachers. The participating private schools must meet requirements such as having a valid certificate of occupancy, conducting criminal background checks on employees, complying with data requests, and meeting accreditation requirements. Private schools participating in the DC OSP must be pursuing full accreditation by specified accrediting bodies and be fully accredited within five years. Schools not previously in the program must be fully accredited before participating. All participating schools must certify accreditation within five years of the SOAR Reauthorization Act. The SOAR Reauthorization Act requires participating private schools in the DC OSP to meet accreditation requirements. Schools failing to meet these requirements must assist eligible students in finding another participating private school. Participating private schools are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, or gender, except for single-sex schools affiliated with a religious organization. Parents can choose single-sex options offered by participating private schools. The SOAR Act allows participating private schools to offer single-sex options without altering their religious beliefs or practices. Schools must comply with accreditation requirements and cannot discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, or gender. Eligible students must follow school rules, and schools must provide data upon request. Participating private schools must comply with data requests for program evaluations under the SOAR Act. They are also required to meet testing requirements for evaluations. IES will administer assessments to students unless the school is already doing so. Results must be shared with the Secretary for evaluation. Assistance provided to eligible students through the DC OSP is considered assistance to the student, not the school. Participating private schools in the DC OSP must comply with evaluation requirements under the SOAR Act. The Secretary and the Mayor are required to enter into joint agreements for evaluation and monitoring. Data on participating private schools and a list of schools for the 2018-2019 school year are provided in the report. The Secretary and the Mayor must jointly enter into agreements to evaluate the DC OSP annually and monitor funds for DC public schools and charter schools. The evaluation must use an acceptable research design to assess the program's effectiveness, comparing academic achievement of eligible students with those attending public schools. Control groups cannot include students who applied but did not receive scholarships. The evaluation of the DC OSP includes comparing academic achievement of eligible students with those in public schools, analyzing choice options for parents, reasons for participation, and comparing retention, graduation, and college outcomes with a comparison group. The evaluation of the DC OSP includes comparing academic achievement of eligible students with those in public schools, analyzing choice options for parents, reasons for participation, and comparing retention, graduation, and college outcomes with a comparison group. This involves assessing college enrollment, persistence, and graduation rates of students who won the lottery to participate in the program compared to those who did not win, as well as evaluating school safety and academic achievement at participating private schools. The Secretary must collect data on the impact of the Opportunity Scholarship Program on academic achievement and educational attainment of participating students in DC. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) is responsible for assessing students in grades 3-8 and one high school grade, using the same assessments as DC public schools. IES also measures academic achievement and collaborates with eligible schools. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) assesses students in grades 3-8 and one high school grade for the Opportunity Scholarship Program in DC. IES collaborates with eligible schools and ensures parental consent for evaluations. Personally identifiable information is protected, and data is only shared with authorized individuals for evaluation purposes. Annual interim reports are submitted to congressional committees. The Secretary must provide annual interim reports to congressional committees on the progress of the DC OSP evaluation, with a final report due one year after the last grant. All reports and data collected must be made public upon request, with no personally identifiable information disclosed. Up to 5% of funds can be used for evaluation purposes. The DC OSP requires eligible entities to submit reports on activities and academic outcomes of scholarship participants, with no personally identifiable information included. Reports must be submitted by specific deadlines and made public upon request. The eligible entity must ensure that participating private schools report on academic achievement, school safety, and accreditation status to parents of scholarship recipients. Reports must compare student performance with peers but cannot include personally identifiable information. The Secretary is required to report findings to congressional committees on the DC OSP funding arrangement, which includes DC public schools and DC public charter schools. Funding is provided to improve public education in DC and expand quality public charter schools. Requirements for funding under the SOAR Act must be met for public education in the District of Columbia. The Mayor of DC must ensure that public schools provide necessary information for assessments, monitor fund usage, and report on fund utilization for student achievement. Failure to comply may result in intervention by the Secretary. The Secretary can withhold funds for DC public schools or charter schools if the Mayor fails to comply with requirements. Section 3011 outlines specific funding provisions for DC public charter schools, allowing funds to be directed to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education. This transfer cannot impact funding for the DC OSP, and the OSSE can allocate funds to specific charter schools or nonprofit organizations supporting DC public education. Section 3014 authorizes $60 million to be appropriated annually from FY2012 through FY2019 for DC public charter schools. The funds must be divided equally among the DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools. The availability of funds cannot be restricted based on location, governing body, or school facilities. The SOAR Act authorizes $60 million annually from FY2012 through FY2019 for DC public charter schools, divided equally among DC OSP, DC public schools, and DC public charter schools. Transition provisions include the repeal of the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003, special funding rules, multiyear awards, MOU requirements, and orderly transition provisions. Changes to prior appropriations bills allow funds for the DC OSP to be used for opportunity scholarships for the 2011-2012 school year. The SOAR Act repealed certain provisions related to academic quality reports and site inspections for participating schools. Unobligated funds were to be used for administrative expenses or scholarships, including those for students who had not previously received scholarships. Recipients of grants under the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 were to continue receiving funds as per the terms of their grants. The SOAR Act repealed academic quality reports and site inspections for participating schools. Unobligated funds were to be used for administrative expenses or scholarships, including for new recipients. Recipients of grants under the DC School Choice Incentive Act of 2003 will continue to receive funds with certain exceptions, such as changes made by the MOU. Transition provisions require revising the MOU to address the implementation of the DC OSP under the SOAR Act and ensure compliance with evaluation requirements. The Secretary may take necessary steps for an orderly transition. The SOAR Act repealed academic quality reports and site inspections for participating schools. Unobligated funds were to be used for administrative expenses or scholarships, including for new recipients. Transition provisions require revising the MOU to address the implementation of the DC OSP under the SOAR Act and ensure compliance with evaluation requirements. The Secretary may take necessary steps for an orderly transition, including funding allocation among three entities for school improvement in the District of Columbia. Over $800 million has been appropriated for these entities from FY2004 to FY2019. Over $800 million has been appropriated for three entities from FY2004 to FY2019. Data on student and private school participation in the DC OSP is provided, with 24,351 applications and 10,701 scholarships awarded from 2004-2019. Student participation ranged from 1,000 to 1,900 students annually. From 2009-2019, student participation in the scholarship program fluctuated, with most students enrolling in grades prekindergarten through 8th. The number of high school enrollees using the scholarship remained more stable. Data on applications show a peak of 2,700 students applying in the first year of the program, decreasing to 726 applications four years later. The scholarship program received 3,294 applications for the 2018-2019 school year, with 1,961 from returning students and 1,333 from new students. 1,645 students used a scholarship in 44 of the 46 participating private schools, with an average family income of $23,285. 43% of the students were eligible for SNAP or TANF benefits, and the majority were African-American/Black (73.7%). The DC OSP program saw a decrease in the number of participating private schools over the years, with 78.8% to 98.0% of schools enrolling scholarship recipients. Not all participating schools enrolled students, and Appendix B provides more details on participating private schools for the 2018-2019 school year. For the 2018-2019 school year, 46 private schools are participating in the DC OSP. 39 schools serve elementary or middle school students, while 20 schools serve high school students. 11 schools could fully cover tuition with the scholarship. 33 schools are accredited, 1 is a candidate for accreditation, and 8 did not provide accreditation information. ED awards grants to administer the program, with only one eligible entity receiving a grant each competition. The Washington Scholarship Fund (WSF) was the first organization to administer the DC OSP program, expanding its operations significantly without proper accountability mechanisms according to a Government Accountability Office evaluation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the Washington Scholarship Fund (WSF) lacked the capacity to oversee participating private schools and administer the scholarship program funded with federal dollars. GAO made recommendations to improve internal controls, financial systems integration, monitoring, and information accuracy for parents. WSF was selected as the local program administrator in FY2009 but was unable to continue beyond the 2009-2010 school year due to funding constraints. The Washington Scholarship Fund transferred administration of the DC OSP to the DC Children and Youth Investment Trust Cooperation in 2010. The Trust had to submit a grant transfer agreement to ED addressing the use of appropriations for scholarships. ED granted a waiver and extension of the project period to the Trust. The DC OSP was transferred to the DC Children and Youth Investment Trust Cooperation in 2010. The Trust struggled to provide accurate information to parents and lacked internal controls. GAO made 10 recommendations for improvement to ED. The Trust decided to no longer serve as the program administrator for the DC OSP. ED awarded a grant to Serving Our Children to take over the program administration for a three-year period. In January 2018, ED proposed granting a waiver to extend Serving Our Children's project period for up to two years to ensure continuity as the program enters its final years. Extending Serving Our Children's grant period would allow for full implementation of new recruitment and marketing strategies to increase scholarship usage rates. The project period extension aligns with the next anticipated reauthorization of the SOAR Act. GAO has not evaluated DC OSP program management since Serving Our Children took over administration. The GAO has evaluated the accountability mechanisms and operations of the DC OSP, including fund usage and adherence to statutory requirements. They assessed how ED and the District of Columbia fulfilled their roles for the program. Two evaluations were conducted in 2007 and 2013, focusing on program goals and performance audits. The GAO found weaknesses in the Washington Scholarship Fund's accountability mechanisms for fund usage, including using funds for tuition at schools that typically do not charge tuition, and paying before- and after-care fees without clarity on statutory requirements. Rapid expansion and limited time hindered the implementation of internal controls. The Washington Scholarship Fund's mechanisms were weakened by rapid expansion and limited time to design internal controls. WSF faced challenges in recruiting students from schools in need of improvement and finding placements at secondary level due to fewer openings at private schools. Providing accurate information to parents about private schools was also a difficulty. The GAO found that the Washington Scholarship Fund provided inaccurate information on teacher qualifications and tuition for some schools. The assessment measure used for evaluating the DC OSP became mismatched with the one used by DC public schools, limiting the ability to make comparisons and generalize findings. The evaluation of the DC OSP included assessing three program goals: informing families for school choices, ensuring internal controls for accountability, and evaluating the performance of ED and DC agencies. The Trust's efforts to inform families were hindered by inaccurate and untimely information about participating schools, lacking key details like tuition and accreditation. The Trust also lacked internal controls for effective implementation and oversight of the program. Trust lacked internal controls for effective implementation and oversight of the DC OSP, such as verifying self-reported information from private schools and submitting financial reports on time. Despite a cooperative agreement with ED and the District of Columbia, limited assistance was provided to the Trust in improving financial reporting procedures and site visit policies. The GAO found that the Trust lacked clarity on responsibilities for inspections in participating schools, leading to inspections not being conducted as outlined in the MOU. Additionally, ED conducted impact evaluations on the DC OSP's effectiveness in increasing student achievement and other outcome measures. The impact evaluations of the DC OSP aimed to determine its effectiveness in improving student achievement, parent and student satisfaction, school safety, and parental involvement. Six evaluations were conducted, with the first two focusing on participation data and the following four on measuring the program's impact using student achievement data. Detailed results can be found in Appendix D. The DC OSP underwent six evaluations over 12 years to measure its effectiveness with student achievement data and other outcomes. A seventh evaluation is starting with data from the 2018-2019 school year. The evaluations followed different legislative requirements, with four impact evaluations published so far under different laws. The design and presentation of results in these evaluations were similar, focusing on using strong research designs to determine effectiveness. Links to the evaluation reports are provided in Appendix C. Both evaluations of the DC OSP used strong research designs to assess effectiveness, focusing on student achievement, parent and student satisfaction, school safety perceptions, and parental involvement. Results are reported by outcome measure, with the use of lotteries allowing for randomization in the evaluation process. The evaluation of the DC OSP used strong research designs to assess effectiveness, focusing on student achievement, parent and student satisfaction, school safety perceptions, and parental involvement. The evaluations compared students who received a scholarship (treatment group) with those who did not (control group), and further divided the treatment group into students who used the scholarship and those who did not. The effectiveness of the program was determined by comparing outcome measures such as reading and mathematics achievement on standardized tests. The evaluation of the DC OSP focused on student achievement, parent and student satisfaction, school safety perceptions, and parental involvement. Outcome measures were disaggregated by subgroups including students who previously attended a school in need of improvement, students in elementary and secondary school, students with different levels of achievement upon entering the scholarship program, male and female students, and students in different cohorts. The evaluation of the DC OSP focused on student achievement, parent and student satisfaction, school safety perceptions, and parental involvement. Results of impact evaluations comparing treatment groups to control group on outcome measures are summarized in tables in Appendix D. Tables include reading and mathematics achievement, parent and student satisfaction, school safety perceptions, and parental involvement disaggregated by subgroups. The evaluations conducted under P.L. 108-199 showed that students with scholarships scored higher in reading achievement initially, but not in the second evaluation. There were positive effects for subgroups in the second evaluation. However, there was no significant difference in mathematics achievement. Under P.L. 112-10, students with scholarships did not show significant differences in reading achievement overall. Overall, students who were offered or used a scholarship did not score significantly differently than the control group in reading achievement. However, there were statistically significant negative effects in some subgroups. In mathematics achievement, students with scholarships scored lower than the control group. Parent satisfaction was significantly higher for parents of scholarship recipients compared to the control group. Overall, student and parent satisfaction for those offered or using scholarships did not differ significantly from the control group in both impact evaluations. Subgroup effects were observed for higher-achieving students' parents in the second evaluation, but not in the overall group. The impact evaluations showed that parent perceptions of school safety were significantly higher for parents of students who used scholarships compared to the control group. However, student perceptions of school safety did not show a significant difference between the two groups. The impact evaluations found that parent perceptions of school safety were significantly higher for parents of students who used scholarships compared to the control group. Student perceptions of school safety did not show a significant difference in the first evaluation but were significantly higher in the second evaluation for students who used scholarships. The impact evaluations showed that parental involvement of parents in the treatment group was lower than the control group in certain subgroups. Evaluations under different requirements did not find significant differences in parental involvement between scholarship users and the control group. The federal government has provided over $245 million since FY2004 to support the DC OSP, with mixed findings from program evaluations raising questions about its success and replicability. Some expect immediate positive results when evaluating new programs like the DC OSP. In the evaluation studies of the DC OSP, students who used a scholarship showed gains in reading but sometimes lower math achievement compared to the control group. Results may not be overwhelmingly positive, and it is challenging to predict achievement gains. Other states with similar scholarship programs, like the Louisiana Scholarship Program (LSP), have shown significant negative effects in the first two years of evaluation. The evaluation of the DC OSP program found no significant differences in reading or math after several years. Scholarship recipients scored similarly in reading but lower in math compared to non-recipients. Evaluations question the focus on academic performance and suggest considering other outcome measures. The DC OSP evaluations consider factors like school safety, parent involvement, and graduation rates. While academic performance is important, other outcome measures are also considered for program continuation or expansion. Random assignment is crucial for experimental evaluations to determine effectiveness. The DC OSP evaluation used random assignment to compare students offered a scholarship with those who were not. Researchers used a mathematical adjustment to estimate the effect on students who used the scholarship. The impact of offering scholarships in the DC OSP was estimated using a quasi-experimental research design, as random assignment was not feasible. This approach allowed for comparisons between scholarship recipients and similar students in public schools and charter schools. Parents had to agree for their child to participate in the evaluations. The DC OSP impact evaluations require parental consent for student participation. Response rates below 70% or a difference over 5% between treatment and control groups may indicate attrition issues. Natural attrition occurs as students graduate or leave secondary education. The DC OSP impact evaluations track students over time, with some students leaving due to natural attrition. As the sample size decreases, it becomes harder to detect the treatment effect. The sensitivity of outcome measures affects the likelihood of finding an effect in the evaluation. The DC OSP evaluation used the Stanford Achievement Test and TerraNova to assess reading and math achievement, but these tests may not align with DC school standards. This could impact the sensitivity of outcome measures in evaluating academic gains. The assessment requirements under P.L. 115-31 have changed to align with DC public schools' reading and math assessments, which are currently PARCC assessments. These assessments may create a positive bias towards DC public school students compared to private school students, as they are more aligned with public school standards. The impact on evaluating academic gains for private school students is unknown. The evaluation of academic gains for DC private school students is unknown, potentially creating a positive bias towards public school students. Positive impact results are often used to scale up education policies, but it is challenging to interpret the results within the context of other school choice programs due to DC's unique governance structure. The DC school choice program includes a large number of charter schools and has shown evidence of increasing achievement and choice options for students. The impact of these effects on other cities remains unknown. Appendices provide details on scholarship use, participating private schools, impact evaluation reports, and legislative history of the program. Funding for the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) is provided under the Federal Payment for School Improvement account in the Financial Services appropriations act. The OSP was established in FY2004, with subsequent amendments included in appropriations bills. Enactment of the program was part of the Bush Administration's FY2004 budget submission, requesting $75 million for school choice. The focus is on the OSP, with some information on provisions affecting DC public schools and charter schools. The Administration's FY2004 budget requested $75 million for a Choice Incentive Fund to provide grants for parents of children in low-performing schools to attend higher-performing schools, including charter and private schools. The Mayor and President of the DC Board of Education supported private school vouchers to improve education options. The establishment of a federally supported voucher program in the District of Columbia faced criticism from opponents who argued it would reduce funding for public education and benefit only a few students. Despite resistance, the House Committee on Government Reform passed the DC Parental Choice Incentive Act of 2003, creating a federally funded scholarship program for low-income students. A federally funded scholarship program was established for low-income students in the District of Columbia, offering scholarships of up to $7,500 per academic year to attend private schools. The program was authorized at $15 million for FY2004 and continued through FY2008. Additionally, H.R. 2765 proposed $10 million for a similar school choice program in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia had a voucher program proposed under H.R. 2556 and H.R. 2765. Delegate Norton's amendment to eliminate the voucher program failed, while Representative Tom Davis's amendment to establish eligibility criteria and funding cap passed. The Senate's bill, S. 1583, included the DC Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 2003, similar to H.R. 2556, laying the groundwork for the DC School Choice Incentive Act. The DC School Choice Incentive Act, authorized and funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, included funding for school improvement in public schools and public charter schools in the District of Columbia. Funding for the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program was provided under the \"Federal Payment for School Improvement\" header. The three-pronged approach to funding education in DC, supported by Mayor Williams and Congress, includes funding for public charter schools. The DC School Choice Incentive Act authorized the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program for low-income students. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program provides low-income families with opportunities to enroll their children in schools of choice in the District of Columbia. Authorized for FY2004 through FY2008, the program had an initial appropriation of $14 million for FY2004 and allowed the Secretary to award grants to eligible entities to make scholarships to eligible students. Eligible entities included educational entities of the DC government, nonprofit organizations, or consortiums of nonprofit organizations. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program prioritizes eligible entities that effectively target students from underperforming schools and low-income families. The program allows up to 3% of funds for administrative expenses and is open to children from families with low incomes. The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program offers scholarships valued at up to $7,500 for eligible students from low-income families to cover tuition, fees, and transportation expenses for private schools in the District of Columbia. Recipients must reapply annually and can continue to participate as long as their family income does not exceed 200% of the poverty line. Students from low-income families could participate in the scholarship program if their family income did not exceed 200% of the poverty level. Priority was given to students in public schools under Title I-A, but all eligible students could receive scholarships regardless of school type. Private schools in the program were not allowed to discriminate based on race, color, national origin, religion, or gender, except for single-sex schools with religious affiliations. The DC School Choice Incentive Act allowed low-income students to participate in the scholarship program without exceeding 200% of the poverty level. Private schools in the program were prohibited from discriminating based on certain factors, and were required to comply with program evaluations. The Act mandated annual evaluations conducted by an independent entity selected by the Secretary and Mayor. The DC School Choice Incentive Act mandated annual evaluations by an independent entity to compare academic achievement of scholarship recipients with students in DC public schools. The evaluations also examined parental choice, retention rates, and dropout rates. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) authorized the DC School Choice Incentive Act and allocated funds for the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), DC Public Schools (DCPS), and DC public charter schools. Up to $1 million of the OSP funds could be used for assessments. The DC OSP funds could be used for assessments. FY2005 Appropriations Act provided funding for DC OSP, DCPS, and SEO for DC public charter schools. FY2006 Appropriations Act included provision for DC OSP funds to be used for administering assessments. The FY2007 Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 110-5) authorized funding for DC OSP, DCPS, and SEO for DC public charter schools. The FY2008 Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) provided funding for the same programs, with $1.8 million allocated for assessments. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act continued funding for these programs. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8) provided funding for the DC OSP, DCPS, and SEO for DC public charter schools. It added requirements for schools to be eligible for the DC OSP, including the need for participating private schools to have a valid certificate of occupancy and for core subject teachers to hold a four-year bachelor's degree. The Act also limited the appropriation of funds for the program beyond FY2010. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8) funded the DC OSP, requiring core subject teachers to have a four-year bachelor's degree. Senator Ensign proposed an amendment to remove the requirement for program reauthorization, citing other federal education programs receiving funding without reauthorization. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act funded the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) but an amendment to expand program participation failed to pass. The appropriations specified that funds could only be used for current participants and directed steps to minimize disruption for scholarship recipients transitioning to public schools. The FY2010 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided funding for the DC OSP, DC Public Schools, and DC public charter schools. The FY2010 Omnibus Appropriations Act allocated funds for the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) without requiring reauthorization. Up to $1 million was designated for administering assessments and student testing in participating private schools. The funds were limited to students who received scholarships in the 2009-2010 school year, with added requirements for participating private schools. The Participating private schools in the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program had to comply with accreditation and attendance laws. The Secretary had to submit a report to Congress on school quality by June 15, 2010. Eligible scholarship recipients had to take the same assessments as DCPS students. Site inspections were required annually. The Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act was authorized under the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. The Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act, authorized under the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10), replaced the DC School Choice Incentive Act and reauthorized the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. It also provided appropriations for DC public schools and charter schools for FY2012 through FY2016. Subsequent acts amended the SOAR Act, with details on changes made. The FY2011 Appropriations specified funding for the DC OSP, public schools, and charter schools, including provisions for assessments and student testing. The Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act, authorized under the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10), made changes to the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. It removed restrictions on scholarship recipients and altered requirements for school visits and reporting. The SOAR Technical Corrections Act (SOAR TCA; P.L. 112-92) amended the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act by defining \"core academic subjects\" and adding requirements for standardized tests administration. The SOAR TCA amended the DC OSP evaluation requirements to align the use of standardized tests with new provisions, ensuring assessment results are available for evaluation. The FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015 Appropriations Acts provided funding for the three parts of the SOAR Act, without specific provisions for the DC OSP beyond allocating funds for the program. The SOAR Act provided funding for the DC OSP in FY2015, with $3 million allocated for administrative expenses, student academic assistance, and evaluation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 amended the SOAR Act to include new accreditation requirements for private schools participating in the DC OSP. Private schools participating in the DC OSP must meet accreditation requirements within a specified timeframe to remain eligible. Extensions may be granted in certain circumstances.
