    "content": "Social Security reform is an issue discussed by policy makers in various contexts, such as improving retirement security and reducing federal budget deficits. In 2011, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction considered Social Security program changes as part of deficit reduction measures, but no agreement was reached. The debate on Social Security reform reflects different approaches, with some supporting restructuring through individual accounts. Some policy makers support restructuring the Social Security program through individual accounts, citing the projected funding shortfall and the need for workers to have a sense of ownership over their retirement savings. Others advocate for maintaining the current defined benefit system, arguing that only modest changes are needed to ensure solvency and potentially increase benefits. Proponents of reform have differing views on the extent of changes needed. The debate over Social Security reform ranges from minor changes to a complete overhaul, with varying policy objectives focusing on improving benefits and reflecting different views on the role of the program. The system's financial outlook is a key factor in evaluating reform proposals, particularly their impact on the trust funds. The report discusses Social Security program financing, long-range projections for the trust funds, objectives for reform, and beneficiary statistics. Social Security is a federal social insurance system covering retired, disabled, and deceased workers' family members. It has 57.9 million beneficiaries, with 65% being retired workers and 15% disabled workers. The program is funded by payroll taxes and federal income taxes. Social Security tax revenues are invested in federal government securities held by the OASDI trust funds. The funds needed to pay benefits come from the redemption or sale of these securities. In 2012, the trust funds had receipts of $840 billion, expenditures of $786 billion, and a total surplus. In 2012, the Social Security trust funds had expenditures totaling $786 billion, a total surplus of $54 billion, and a cash flow deficit of $55 billion. The trust funds held assets of $2.7 trillion, representing money owed to them by the U.S. Treasury. Surplus tax revenues and interest income contributed to the growing trust fund balance from 1984 to 2009, totaling $1.21 trillion. The Social Security trust funds had a surplus of $1.21 trillion from 1984 to 2009, with assets totaling $2.7 trillion at the end of 2012. The trust fund balance is projected to peak at $2.9 trillion in 2020 before expenditures exceed income in 2021. Trust fund assets are projected to be drawn down to pay benefits and expenses, with funds expected to last until 2033. After the Social Security trust funds are exhausted in 2033, the program will rely on current tax revenues to pay 77% of benefits in 2033 and 72% in 2087. Social Security has been operating with an annual cash flow deficit since 2010, projected to continue until 2087. When there is a deficit, federal government securities are cashed in to supplement tax revenues, with general revenues used to redeem the securities. The Social Security program will rely on increased spending from the general fund, which can only be paid for by the federal government raising taxes, reducing spending, or borrowing from the public. The program will have a total surplus each year from 2013 to 2020, but will start relying on interest credited to the trust funds to meet annual costs after that. Interest is credited in the form of new special issue securities, not from outside sources. The Social Security program will increasingly rely on general revenues to cover the difference between tax revenues and program costs. By 2020, it is projected to need $95.4 billion in general revenues, and by 2030, this reliance is expected to increase to $291.6 billion. This reliance on general revenues will continue to grow as the trust fund balance is drawn down, starting in 2021. The Social Security program relies on tax revenues collected in previous years for funding. The trust funds are projected to be exhausted by 2033, with incoming receipts covering 77% of benefits. Demographic changes, including the retirement of the baby boom generation, contribute to the funding shortfall. The retirement of the post-World War II baby boom generation in 2008, coupled with lower fertility rates and increased life expectancy, is leading to an older society. By 2035, the number of people aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 65%, while the number of workers aged 20-64 is only expected to increase by 6%. This will result in a decline in the number of workers supporting each Social Security beneficiary from 2.7 in 2015 to 2.1 in 2035. Program design features, such as indexing benefits to wage growth, will also contribute to the growth in program spending. The Social Security program allows monthly benefits to replace a proportion of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, keeping pace with rising living standards. The program's cost is estimated to be $826.8 billion in 2013, projected to increase to 16.98% of taxable payroll by 2035 and gradually rise to 18.01% by 2087. Income rates are expected to increase from 12.69% in 2013 to 13.25% in 2087, remaining stable due to the unchanged Social Security payroll tax rate of 12.4%. The Social Security program's tax rate (12.4% for employers and employees combined) is projected to remain unchanged. Income from the taxation of benefits is expected to gradually increase relative to taxable payroll as more beneficiaries are required to pay federal income taxes. By 2087, program costs are projected to exceed income by 36%. Over the 75-year period (2013-2087), the program's cost is projected to exceed income by almost 20%. Program costs are also evaluated as a share of U.S. economic output, increasing from 5.06% of GDP in 2013 to 6.23% by 2035, and declining to 6.05% by 2087. The projected long-range financial outlook for the Social Security program shows costs increasing from 5.06% of GDP in 2013 to 6.23% by 2035, then declining to 6.05% by 2050. Program income is expected to increase from 4.60% of GDP in 2013 to 4.87% in 2022, then gradually decline to 4.56% by 2087. The projected funding shortfall in 2087 is estimated to be 1.64% of GDP, with an average shortfall of 0.98% of GDP over the 75-year period. The Social Security system's projected long-range financial outlook shows a funding shortfall of 0.98% of GDP. Public opinion polls indicate less than 50% confidence in Social Security's ability to meet long-term commitments. Concerns about the system's sustainability have led to reform efforts and calls for increased national savings to support an aging society. Supporters of the current program structure believe the system's issues are not as serious as portrayed. The Social Security system's financial issues are not as severe as portrayed, with trust funds projected to remain balanced until 2033. Modest changes could restore long-term solvency, as seen in past measures like benefit constraints, retirement age increase, tax hikes, and coverage extensions. The Social Security system faces long-term deficits due to changes in actuarial methods and assumptions. While program changes aim to restore trust fund solvency over 75 years, there is disagreement on whether this constitutes a crisis. Policy makers, trustees, and interest groups advocate for action to address the issue. The Social Security system's long-term deficits have led to debates on reform proposals, ranging from minor adjustments to complete replacement with models like IRAs or 401(k)s. Various complex proposals have emerged, reflecting divergent views on how to address the system's solvency issues. The lack of a perceived crisis has diffused the pressure for compromise among stakeholders. Advocates of Social Security reform see the current system as outdated and unsustainable in aging societies. They believe in modernizing retirement savings through market-based individual accounts to strengthen incomes and spur savings and investments. They argue for a system that allows workers to acquire wealth and provide for their retirement by investing in individual accounts. Some proponents advocate for private investments in individual accounts to increase retirement savings and give workers a sense of ownership. They argue that stocks and bonds historically yield higher returns than the current system projects. However, recent stock market declines and Social Security deficits have made investment-based proposals less popular among policymakers. Proponents advocate for long-range Social Security constraints to curb federal entitlement spending due to the increasing costs of programs for the elderly linked to an aging population. They believe delaying changes would burden future generations with higher taxes and unfair transfer payments for current workers. Some argue that changes to the Social Security program are unfair to current workers, who face potential benefit cuts and overgenerous transfer payments. They suggest gradual adjustments like raising the retirement age and reducing cost-of-living adjustments to allow workers time to adjust their retirement plans. Others believe modest tax and spending changes can resolve the system's issues without drastic measures. Critics of the Social Security program argue that individual savings accounts could undermine its social insurance nature, posing transition problems for younger workers. They doubt that it would increase national savings and raise concerns about the difficulty of regulating capital markets with the influx of account funds. Some critics argue that individual accounts in Social Security could disrupt its social insurance aspect, posing transition issues for younger workers. They are concerned that the influx of account funds could make regulating capital markets challenging and distort equity valuations. Additionally, they believe that the administrative costs of maintaining individual accounts could be substantial and diminish their value. The costs of maintaining individual accounts in Social Security could be significant and reduce their value. There are differing opinions on the severity of the projected funding shortfall, with some believing it to be more acute than traditional projections suggest. On an \"infinite horizon\" basis, the projected funding shortfall is estimated to be 4.0% of taxable payroll. In 2030, the system is projected to have costs exceeding income by 3.36% of taxable payroll. By 2087, the Social Security system is projected to have costs exceeding income by 4.77% of taxable payroll. This would require a significant change in taxes or expenditures over the next 75 years to cover the projected program costs. The current 75-year actuarial deficit is 2.72% of taxable payroll, the largest reported since before the 1983 Social Security Amendments. Viewing the problem as 20 years away does not consider the pressure Social Security will exert on the federal budget as cash flow deficits require reliance on trust fund assets. The Social Security system faces annual cash flow deficits, relying on trust fund assets redeemed with general revenues to meet expenditures. Some argue there is no immediate problem as trust funds are projected to remain positive until 2033, allowing time for policy changes. However, there is uncertainty in projections over a 75-year period. Trust fund projections over a 75-year period show potential imbalance, suggesting an increase in payroll tax rate. Despite rising costs relative to GDP, inducements for older workers to stay longer and phased retirements are becoming more common. Social Security program sustainability is a topic of discussion. Public opinion polls have shown that a majority of Americans lack confidence in the Social Security system's ability to meet future commitments, especially younger workers. Some caution against drawing conclusions from polling data due to limited public understanding of Social Security. Confidence in the system is highest among older age groups. Some believe older persons have higher confidence in Social Security due to their increased knowledge of the program. Annual Social Security Statements may raise awareness of future benefits, but skepticism remains due to financial difficulties and reduced benefits for younger workers. Social Security taxes have increased, and the retirement age is gradually rising, leading to concerns about the system's sustainability. As Social Security taxes increase and the retirement age rises, concerns about the system's sustainability grow. Some argue that the program needs restructuring as future retirees may receive less value, while others see it as a social insurance program with anti-poverty features benefiting lower-wage workers and families. The debate over incorporating individual accounts into the Social Security system has been ongoing since the program's creation in 1935. Proposals have been made to involve the program in financial markets, with plans to authorize investment of trust funds in equities and require extra worker contributions to individual accounts. This is driven by concerns about Social Security's financial outlook, sustainability, and the potential for economic growth through increased savings. The debate over incorporating individual accounts into the Social Security system has been ongoing since its creation in 1935. Proposals include redirecting 1.6% of pay to individual accounts to offset benefit reductions, redesigning the system to gradually replace retirement benefits with flat-rate benefits and individual accounts, and allowing workers to invest some or all of their Social Security payroll taxes in individual accounts. These measures aim to address concerns about the system's long-term solvency and sustainability. The Social Security reform commission under President George W. Bush proposed options for individual accounts, reducing future benefits based on assumed rates of return. President Clinton's plan involved using budget surpluses for individual accounts, worker contributions, and government matches. Funds would also be redirected to the Social Security trust funds for stock acquisitions. Some proposals suggest using Social Security funds to invest in stocks or corporate bonds through an independent board. Individual accounts could reduce future financial burdens on the government and increase retirement income by offering higher returns. Proponents argue that individual accounts would boost national savings and economic growth while preventing the government from using any surplus Social Security funds. Opponents of individual accounts argue that Social Security's funding shortfall could be addressed without changing the program's fundamental nature. They are concerned that replacing Social Security with individual accounts would harm lower-wage workers, survivors, and the disabled. Transitioning to individual accounts would also create challenges for younger workers saving for retirement while supporting current beneficiaries. Some argue that individual accounts for Social Security could worsen budget deficits and not increase national savings. They believe the investment pool created by the accounts could be hard to regulate and expose participants to excessive market risk. Others prefer collective investment of the trust funds in the markets for better returns and risk spreading. Social Security payroll taxes are levied on earnings up to a maximum amount set each year. In 2014, the maximum taxable earnings base for Social Security is $117,000, limiting contributions and benefits. A small percentage of workers earn above this base, with 5.7% in 2010. There are debates about raising or eliminating this limit to address Social Security's financial challenges. Raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base for Social Security could help reduce the funding shortfall. This change would increase payroll tax revenues and benefit payments to some beneficiaries. Concerns exist about the potential impact on monthly benefits if all covered earnings were taxable. Raising or eliminating the taxable earnings base for Social Security could improve the system's financial outlook. However, concerns about equity and weakening support among higher-wage workers exist. The percentage of covered earnings subject to the payroll tax has declined over the years. The percentage of covered earnings subject to the payroll tax has declined from 90% in 1982 to an estimated 83% in 2011. Policy makers have proposed raising the taxable earnings base to make 90% of aggregate covered earnings subject to the payroll tax, as recommended by deficit reduction commissions. The 2010 National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested a gradual increase in the taxable wage base so that 90% of aggregate wages in covered employment would be taxable by 2050. The Social Security Administration estimates that increasing the taxable earnings base to cover 90% of earnings by 2050 would significantly improve the system's long-term financial balance. Critics argue that this approach may disproportionately impact those with earnings just above the current taxable base. Various proposals aim to increase the amount of wages subject to the Social Security payroll tax in different ways. Some proposals to improve Social Security's financial balance include raising the retirement age and increasing taxes on earnings above certain thresholds. Life expectancy increases have contributed to the system's projected cost growth. By 2030, life expectancy at age 65 is projected to reach 20.3 years for men and 22.5 years for women. In 1983, Congress raised the full retirement age (FRA) from 65 to 67 as part of the Social Security Amendments. The increase is being phased-in, with the full two-year increase affecting persons born in 1960 or later. The early retirement age of 62 was not raised, but the benefit reduction for those who retire at 62 will increase from 20% to 30%. Proponents argue that increasing the retirement age is reasonable due to projected increases in life expectancy. Opponents of raising the full retirement age argue that it would penalize workers in physically demanding occupations and racial minorities with shorter life expectancies. Social Security benefits are adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index, which has been criticized for overstating inflation effects. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated in 1994 that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) overstatement ranged from 0.2 to 1.1 percentage points. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has made revisions to the CPI to address criticisms. In 2002, BLS introduced the chained CPI-U (C-CPI-U) to more accurately reflect consumer buying habits. Some policymakers support using the C-CPI-U for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Some policymakers support using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) to calculate Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, arguing that the market basket of goods and services purchased by the elderly is different from the general population. This is due to higher healthcare expenditures, which rise faster than the overall CPI, leading to a higher cost of living for the elderly. Chief Actuary suggests that reducing the Social Security COLA by 1 percentage point annually starting in December 2014 could improve the system's long-range actuarial balance by about 63%. A reduction of 0.5 percentage point annually would improve it by about 33%. Using a chained version of the CPI-W to calculate the COLA could reduce it by 0.3 percentage point on average and improve the actuarial balance by about 20%. Social Security's financial condition impacts the federal government's overall budget, despite being considered \"off budget\" for some purposes. When former President William Clinton proposed using unified budget surpluses to address Social Security's funding issues, it sparked diverse views in Congress on how to allocate the surpluses. Some suggested reducing federal debt, cutting taxes, or increasing spending, while others supported setting aside funds equal to Social Security trust fund surpluses. However, federal budget deficits have since emerged, leading to cash flow deficits in the Social Security trust funds. Today, some policymakers advocate for Social Security program changes to reduce federal entitlement spending and budget deficits. Policy makers are concerned about unsustainable federal budget deficits due to spending on major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. They differ on how to restrain spending growth and apportion benefit reductions and tax increases. President Obama established the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to address these issues. The President's Fiscal Commission released recommendations on Social Security program changes to address long-term trust fund solvency through benefit reductions and revenue increases. Proposed changes include a new special minimum benefit for low-wage earners and a benefit increase for older beneficiaries. The proposed recommendations for Social Security program changes include gradual increases in the retirement age, with the full retirement age reaching 68 by about 2050 and 69 by about 2075. Additionally, the benefit formula would become more progressive over time, and the early eligibility age would increase to 63 and 64 in line with the retirement age. A hardship exemption is proposed for those unable to work beyond the current early eligibility age. The proposed changes for Social Security include a hardship exemption for retirees unable to work beyond the current early eligibility age, allowing them to claim benefits at age 62 without reduction. The retirement age would gradually increase, linked to life expectancy projections. The commission also suggests using a different measure for calculating Social Security COLA and making coverage mandatory for newly hired state and local government workers after 2020. The commission proposes increasing the taxable wage base to 90% of aggregate wages by 2050, with an estimated base of $190,000 in 2020. They recommend allowing individuals to claim half of their benefits at age 62 and the other half later, promoting personal savings for retirement. Projections indicate lower future benefits compared to current law. The proposed changes aim to increase benefits for low-wage earners and restore long-term solvency to the Social Security system. Despite majority support from commission members, the recommendations fell short of the super-majority needed for congressional action. Previous attempts to address solvency issues have not garnered majority support. The proposed Social Security reform plans included increasing revenues, minor benefit reductions, investing trust funds in stocks, requiring extra pay contributions to individual accounts, redesigning the system with flat-rate benefits and individual accounts funded by payroll tax redirection. These approaches have been reflected in recent reform bills. Former President William Clinton proposed using Social Security's share of budget surpluses to reduce federal debt and credit the trust funds. He suggested investing $2.8 trillion in stocks and federal securities to keep the system solvent until 2059. Concerns were raised about double-crediting the trust funds and government ownership of private companies. Clinton also proposed creating Universal Savings Accounts with $0.5 trillion of the budget surpluses. Former President William Clinton proposed using Social Security's share of budget surpluses to reduce federal debt and credit the trust funds. He suggested investing in federal bonds instead of stocks, with the goal of keeping the system solvent. Former President George W. Bush appointed a commission to recommend Social Security reform, emphasizing the need to preserve current benefits. The commission's final report, issued on December 21, 2001, included three reform options. Each option would allow workers to participate in individual accounts on a voluntary basis and reduce their future Social Security benefit. The first option would redirect 2% of taxable earnings to individual accounts, the second option would redirect 4% up to $1,000 annually, and adjust benefits for future retirees. During his second term, former President George W. Bush continued efforts to build support for Social Security reform by proposing guidelines for Congress to consider in creating individual accounts within the program. This included options to reduce initial benefits for future retirees, increase benefits for lower-wage workers and widow(er)s, and allow workers to contribute an additional 1% of taxable earnings to individual accounts with a government match of 2.5% up to $1,000 annually. Former President George W. Bush proposed guidelines for Social Security reform during his 2005 State of the Union address, including voluntary individual accounts for eligible workers aged 55 and younger, with up to 4% of earnings redirected to the accounts. Accounts would be administered by the government, and workers would need to annuitize a portion for lifelong income. Former President George W. Bush proposed changes to address Social Security's funding shortfall, including raising the retirement age, reducing benefits for wealthy beneficiaries, and modifying the benefit formula. He ruled out increasing the payroll tax rate and suggested benefits for low-income workers should grow faster. This proposal was similar to one by Robert Pozen. Robert Pozen, a member of the 2001 President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security appointed by former President George W. Bush, proposed \"progressive indexing\" to restrain the growth of initial benefits for future retirees. This method would use a combination of wage and price indexing mechanisms in the benefit formula to adjust benefits based on the worker's earnings level. Lower-wage workers would receive benefits closer to wage growth, while higher-wage workers would receive benefits closer to price growth. This shift from wage indexing to price indexing would result in lower initial benefits for many future retirees compared to current law. During the end of 2005, the reform debate in the 109th Congress focused on legislation introduced by Senator DeMint (S. 1302) proposing voluntary individual accounts funded with surplus Social Security tax revenues and reduced benefits. Senator Santorum also introduced S. 1750, which aimed to issue \"benefit guarantee certificates\" to ensure full Social Security benefits with accurate cost-of-living adjustments for individuals born before 1950. Senator Santorum made unanimous consent requests to bring both measures to the Senate floor for consideration. During the 2006 State of the Union address, former President George W. Bush expressed concern about federal spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He proposed creating a commission to study the impact of baby boomer retirements on these programs. Additionally, he suggested voluntary individual accounts funded with a portion of current payroll taxes. Former President George W. Bush supported voluntary individual accounts funded with a portion of current payroll taxes as a cost-saving measure for Social Security reform. After the 2006 congressional elections, there was interest in resuming discussions on this issue. In the Fiscal Year 2009 Budget, Bush reiterated his support for individual accounts funded with 4% of taxable earnings, up to a limit of $1,400. Former President George W. Bush supported voluntary individual accounts funded with a portion of current payroll taxes for Social Security reform. In the 2010 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama expressed concern about the federal budget outlook, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security spending. A bipartisan fiscal commission was called for, leading to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform's final report in December 2010, proposing changes to the Social Security program. In the Fiscal Year 2012 President's Budget, President Barack Obama expressed support for bipartisan efforts to strengthen Social Security for the future and outlined six principles for reform, including opposition to privatization or benefit cuts for current beneficiaries. The Administration emphasized the need to maintain disability and survivors' benefits and ensure retirement security for low-income seniors. President Barack Obama supports bipartisan efforts to strengthen Social Security for the long term, emphasizing the need to maintain robust disability and survivors' benefits for low-income seniors. President Barack Obama opposes privatizing or weakening Social Security, aiming to preserve it for future generations. In the Fiscal Year 2013 and 2014 budgets, he proposed measures to strengthen the system and ensure long-term solvency, including using the chained Consumer Price Index for COLA calculations. The President proposed measures to strengthen Social Security in the Fiscal Year 2013 and 2014 budgets, including using the chained Consumer Price Index for COLA calculations. Senator Bernard Sanders introduced S. 500 (Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act) in the 113th Congress, which would increase Social Security payroll tax on earnings over $250,000 starting in 2014. Senator Tom Harkin introduced S. 567 (Strengthening Social Security Act of 2013) on March 14, 2013. The measure aims to extend trust fund solvency by making all earnings in covered employment subject to the Social Security payroll tax, increasing benefits, and using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E) for COLA calculations. H.R. 1374, introduced by Representative Gwen Moore, aims to enhance Social Security benefits by increasing the special minimum benefit, extending benefit eligibility for children of disabled or deceased workers, and making all covered earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax. It also proposes to increase the Social Security payroll tax rate to 13.0% by 2020. SSA estimates that these measures would extend trust fund solvency for an additional 16 years. The Social Security payroll tax rate is proposed to increase to 13.0% by 2020, with the aim of extending trust fund solvency for an additional 35 years. Various Social Security reform bills have been introduced in recent Congresses, reflecting different approaches to reform. In the 109th Congress, 10 reform measures were introduced, with most aiming to establish individual accounts within the Social Security system. In the 109th Congress, several Social Security reform bills were introduced, with most proposing individual accounts to supplement or replace traditional benefits. Despite intense debate, no legislative action was taken. One bill, H.R. 440, aimed to redirect a percentage of earnings for workers under 55. The proposed Social Security reform bill in the 109th Congress aimed to redirect a percentage of earnings to mandatory individual accounts, with additional contributions allowed. Changes to benefit computation included adjustments to replacement factors and indexing initial benefits to life expectancy. Average indexed monthly earnings calculation would also be modified. The proposed Social Security reform bill in the 109th Congress aimed to make significant changes to benefit computation, retirement age, widow(er)s' benefits, early retirement factors, and tax adjustments. It would have shifted the calculation of average career earnings, accelerated the increase in full retirement age to 67, and set widow(er)s' benefits at 75% of the couple's pre-death benefit. Additionally, it included provisions for a minimum benefit tied to the poverty level and reduced cost-of-living adjustments. The proposed Social Security reform bill in the 109th Congress aimed to make significant changes to benefit computation, retirement age, widow(er)s' benefits, early retirement factors, and tax adjustments. It would have increased the taxable wage base gradually, credited all revenues from the taxation of Social Security benefits to the Social Security trust funds, and established a central authority to administer accounts with investment options similar to the Thrift Savings Plan. Workers could choose from a broader range of investment options once the account balance reached $7,500, and the account would become available at retirement or earlier if the balance was sufficient to provide a payment at least equal to 185% of the poverty level. H.R. 3304, introduced by Representative Jim McCrery in 2005, proposed establishing voluntary individual accounts for workers born after 1949 funded with surplus Social Security tax revenues. Workers would have been enrolled automatically with the option to disenroll, and funds would have been invested in long-term Treasury bonds initially. The accounts aimed to provide a combined monthly payment equal to 185% of the poverty level, with any remaining balance available as a lump sum. The proposed voluntary individual accounts for workers born after 1949 would have been funded with surplus Social Security tax revenues. Initially, funds would be invested in long-term Treasury bonds, with additional investment options available starting in 2009. At retirement, participants would be required to annuitize a portion of the account balance to provide a combined monthly payment at least equal to the poverty level. Any remaining balance could be taken as a lump sum. Traditional Social Security benefits would be offset by the annuity value of a hypothetical account with a 2.7% real rate of return. The proposed legislation introduced by Senator John Sununu and Representative Paul Ryan in 2005 would have allowed workers under 55 to redirect a portion of payroll taxes to voluntary individual accounts. Workers could redirect 5% of covered earnings up to a base amount from 2006 to 2015, and 10% from 2016 onwards. Workers could redirect 10% of covered earnings up to the base amount and 5% of remaining covered earnings to individual accounts. Participants would receive a \"benefit credit certificate\" reflecting accrued benefits, redeemable at retirement. Account holders would receive a combined monthly payment equal to current law benefits. Non-participants would receive traditional Social Security benefits. Six indexed investment accounts would be offered, including a default \"lifecycle investment account\" with a 65% equities/35% fixed mix. The proposed plan included a \"lifecycle investment account\" with a 65% equities/35% fixed income mix. Additional investment options would have become available once the account balance reached $25,000. At retirement, the worker would have needed to annuitize a portion of the balance to provide a combined monthly payment. Pre-retirement distribution would have been allowed if the account balance could provide a minimum annuity payment. Financing provisions would have constrained future federal spending growth rates and dedicated savings to Social Security. Senator Jim DeMint introduced S. 1302 (Stop the Raid on Social Security Act of 2005) to establish voluntary individual accounts funded by surplus Social Security tax revenues. The measure included general revenue transfers to maintain trust fund solvency and a central authority to administer the accounts. A central authority would administer individual accounts funded by surplus Social Security tax revenues. Initially, funds would be invested in long-term Treasury bonds, with additional investment options available from 2008. At retirement or in case of death, the account would be accessible. Workers would need to annuitize a portion of the balance for a monthly payment equal to the poverty level, with any remaining balance available as a lump sum. Traditional Social Security benefits would be offset by the annuity value of a hypothetical account earning a 2.7% real rate of return. The Social Security trust funds' real rate of return (3% on average) would be reduced by 0.3 percentage points for administrative expenses. S. 2427, introduced by Senator Robert Bennett in 2006, proposed \"progressive indexing\" of initial Social Security benefits for future retirees, resulting in lower benefits for higher earners. Initial benefits would also be indexed to increases in life expectancy. The 110th Congress introduced six Social Security reform bills, including measures to accelerate the full retirement age to 67 and establish voluntary individual accounts funded with general revenues. In the 110th Congress, several Social Security reform bills were introduced, including proposals to establish individual accounts funded by payroll tax redirection and increase contributions from workers and employers. These bills were not acted upon during that Congress. In the 111th Congress, Representative Ron Lewis introduced H.R. 1090 (Social Security Guarantee Plus Act of 2007) on February 15, 2007. The bill proposed voluntary individual accounts funded with general revenues for workers aged 18 and older, with contributions equal to 4% of taxable earnings up to $1,000. It also included provisions for caregivers and widow(er)'s benefits. H.R. 1090 proposed increasing the widow(er)'s benefit to 75% of the couple's pre-death benefit, allowing disability-based benefits regardless of age, and reducing the spousal benefit offset. Private financial institutions would administer accounts with three investment options. Workers would receive a lump sum of 5% upon benefit entitlement. H.R. 2002, introduced by Representative Sam Johnson, proposed establishing individual accounts funded with 6.2 percentage points of the Social Security payroll tax. Participation would have been voluntary for workers aged 22 to 54 and mandatory for younger individuals. Workers in the individual account system would no longer accrue benefits under the current system. The proposed H.R. 2002 would have replaced the current Social Security system with individual accounts funded by a portion of the payroll tax. Workers in the new system would receive a \"recognition bond\" for benefits accrued, with a minimum benefit based on a percentage of the poverty level. Those not participating would remain in the current system with lower initial monthly benefits. Future retirees' benefits would be indexed to price growth, and a central authority would administer the accounts with multiple investment options. The proposed H.R. 2002 would have replaced the current Social Security system with individual accounts funded by a portion of the payroll tax. Workers would have had at least three initial investment options with specified allocations in equities and fixed income instruments. The account balance would have been transferable to a private financial institution once reaching $10,000. At retirement or earlier if the balance was sufficient, the worker could access the account. An annuity equal to 100% of the poverty level would have been required, with an annual rebate of future payroll tax contributions for pre-retirement distributions. Senator Chuck Hagel introduced S. 2765 (Saving Social Security Act of 2008) on March 13, 2008, allowing workers born in 1963 or later to redirect 4 percentage points of the Social Security payroll tax to an individual account (SAFE account). The measure constrained the growth of initial benefits for future retirees by indexing them to increases in life expectancy. If the account balance at retirement was insufficient to provide the minimum payment, a supplemental payment would be made from general revenues. The Saving Social Security Act of 2008 proposed \"longevity indexing\" of benefits for future retirees, raising the full retirement age to 68 for those born in 1963 or later. It also included offsetting traditional Social Security benefits with a hypothetical account and providing a minimum benefit amount up to 135% of the poverty level for workers with 35 years of covered employment. A central authority would administer individual accounts with initial investments. The Saving Social Security Act of 2008 proposed raising the retirement age to 68 for future retirees and creating individual accounts with initial investments. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress included bills such as H.R. 107 (Flake) and S. 426 (Bennett) for Social Security reform, but no action was taken. Jeff Flake introduced H.R. 107 (Securing Medicare and Retirement for Tomorrow Act of 2009) on January 6, 2009, proposing individual accounts funded with 6.2 percentage points of the Social Security payroll tax. Participation would be mandatory for workers below full retirement age, with the choice between Social Security benefits or a retirement distribution from the individual account. Part A benefits would phase out over time, and after 42 years, new retirees would not have the option for Part A benefits. H.R. 107 proposed individual accounts funded with 6.2% of the Social Security payroll tax. Workers would choose between Social Security benefits or a retirement distribution from the account. A Social Security Escrow Fund would be established to hold various funding sources for Social Security benefits. The Social Security Solvency Act of 2009, introduced by Senator Robert Bennett, aimed to modify the benefit formula for future retirees by implementing \"progressive indexing\" of initial Social Security benefits. It also proposed the establishment of the Personal Accounts Management and Review Board to oversee the Social Security Escrow Fund and regulate qualified Social Security mutual funds. Transfers to the Medicare HI trust fund were also included in the measure. The Social Security Solvency Act of 2009, introduced by Senator Robert Bennett, proposed \"progressive indexing\" of initial benefits for future retirees, which would result in lower benefits for higher earners. It also included \"longevity indexing\" of benefits and an accelerated increase in the full retirement age to 67. H.R. 1863, introduced by Representative Robert Wexler, aimed to provide general revenue transfers to maintain trust fund balances. H.R. 1863, introduced by Representative Robert Wexler, aimed to increase Social Security revenues by requiring workers and employers to contribute 3% of earnings above the taxable wage base in addition to the current 6.2% contribution. H.R. 4529, introduced by Representative Paul Ryan, aimed to reform various aspects including Social Security. It proposed allowing workers aged 55 or younger in 2012 to redirect a portion of their payroll tax contributions to voluntary individual accounts, with 2% of taxable earnings up to a base amount and 1% of remaining taxable earnings. The proposed reform under H.R. 4529 by Representative Paul Ryan would have allowed workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security contributions to individual accounts. The percentage of taxable earnings that could be redirected would have increased over time, with different rates set for different time periods. Workers participating in the individual account system would have received a \"benefit credit certificate\" reflecting the value of benefits accrued under the traditional system, which could be redeemed at retirement. The proposed reform under H.R. 4529 by Representative Paul Ryan would have allowed workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security contributions to individual accounts. The measure would have guaranteed that the value of a participant's individual account would be at least equal to their contributions, adjusted for inflation. Workers not participating in the individual account system would receive traditional benefits. Six indexed investment accounts would be provided, with additional options available once the account balance reached a specified threshold. The account would be accessible at retirement or earlier if the balance could provide an annuity at least equal to 150% of the poverty line. The proposed reform under H.R. 4529 by Representative Paul Ryan would have allowed workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security contributions to individual accounts. At retirement, the worker would have been required to annuitize the portion of the account balance needed to provide a monthly payment at least equal to 150% of the poverty line. Any excess balance could have been withdrawn as chosen by the worker, with remaining funds payable to designated beneficiaries or the individual's estate. The measure would have also modified the Social Security benefit formula for future retirees, resulting in lower initial monthly benefits for workers with higher earnings. The proposed Social Security reform measures in the 112th Congress included H.R. 539, H.R. 797, S. 804, S. 1213, H.R. 2889, S. 1558, and S. 3533. These measures aimed to adjust benefits for higher earners and accelerate the increase in the full retirement age. No congressional action was taken on these measures during the 112th Congress. H.R. 539, introduced on February 8, 2011, aimed to gradually eliminate the taxable wage base for Social Security payroll tax, base COLA on CPI-E, and create a point of order against privatizing Social Security. H.R. 797, introduced on February 18, 2011, proposed the No Loopholes in Social Security Taxes Act, focusing on the 12.4% payroll tax on covered earnings. The Social Security Solvency and Sustainability Act, introduced by Senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee, aimed to increase the full retirement age gradually until it reached age 70. This would have involved applying a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax to earnings above $250,000 starting in 2012, with additional taxable earnings not counted for benefit computation. The Defend and Save Social Security Act proposed increasing the earliest eligibility age from 62 to 64, with a gradual increase each year. It also aimed to modify the benefit formula for future retirees through progressive price indexing, resulting in lower initial monthly benefits for higher earners. Introduced by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in 2011. The Save Social Security Act proposed increasing the full retirement age by three months each year until reaching age 69 for those attaining age 62 in 2027 or later. It also aimed to raise the earliest eligibility age to 64 and reduce the annual Social Security COLA by 1 percentage point. Representative Thaddeus McCotter introduced a bill to establish a Personal Social Security Savings Program. The Save Social Security Act proposed establishing voluntary personal accounts for workers under 50, funded by general revenues and earnings subject to Social Security tax. Administered similarly to the Thrift Savings Plan, withdrawals would be allowed at retirement age or disability. Traditional Social Security benefits would be reduced for participants. The proposal under the Save Social Security Act would have reduced traditional Social Security benefits for participants in the personal account system by up to 50%. Participants would have been guaranteed a combined monthly payment equal to their Social Security benefit, funded by general revenues. Excess trust fund income would have been redirected to the Treasury to help fund the program. S. 1558, introduced by Senator Bernard Sanders, proposed applying a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax to earnings over $250,000 starting in 2012. Earnings above the current taxable wage base would not be counted for benefit computation. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's S. 3533 aimed to increase the full retirement age by three months annually, starting in 2016. The proposed measure aimed to increase the full retirement age by three months each year, starting with those turning 62 in 2016, until reaching age 70 for those turning 62 in 2031 or later. Additionally, the earliest eligibility age would have been raised from 62 to 64, and the annual Social Security COLA would have been reduced by 1 percentage point."
