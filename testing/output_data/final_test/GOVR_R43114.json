    "content": "Science and technology (S&T) are crucial for economic growth, human health, and national priorities. Federal policies impact S&T through funding research, setting legal frameworks, and regulating private sector activities. The federal government regulates science and technology activities, including research with dangerous pathogens and commercial use of radio frequency spectrum. This report provides an introduction to various S&T policy issues for the 113th Congress, with background information and policy considerations. Contact information and relevant CRS reports are included for further details. Several issues of congressional interest in federal S&T policy are highlighted. The federal government's science and technology policymaking involves various stakeholders in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. It focuses on advancing scientific knowledge, STEM education, applying technology for economic and national security benefits, and improving federal decision-making. Congressional laws play a key role in establishing and refining S&T policies. Congress enacts laws to establish, refine, and eliminate S&T-related programs and policies, as well as regulations and regulatory agencies. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation are primary committees for S&T policy, with other committees also having jurisdiction. The President formulates budgets, policies, and programs for Congress' consideration and directs executive branch departments responsible for implementing S&T policies. The Office of Science and Technology Policy advises the President and executive agencies on S&T issues. Different agencies have varying S&T responsibilities, including regulatory agencies in areas like nuclear energy and environmental protection. Federal court decisions can impact science and technology policy, industries, and evidence admissibility. The federal government supports scientific and technological advancement through R&D funding for national interests like defense, health, and energy security. This support has led to breakthroughs and new technologies. Federal R&D funding has declined from $147.3 billion to $140.9 billion between FY2009 and FY2012, raising concerns about the potential long-term effects on U.S. technological leadership, innovation, competitiveness, economic growth, and job creation. This decline comes after sustained growth in federal R&D funding for over half a century and is compounded by increases in R&D investments by other nations, globalization of R&D and manufacturing activities, and trade deficits in advanced technology products. Members of Congress have expressed concerns about these reductions in federal R&D funding. Some Members of Congress are concerned about federal funding levels due to the fiscal condition, deficit, and debt. R&D funding decisions may be influenced by differing views on the government's role in advancing science and technology. Congress faces challenges in determining the direction of federal R&D investment amidst pressure on discretionary spending and how to prioritize funding. Low or negative growth in R&D investment may require reallocating resources across disciplines, programs, or agencies. Congress will define the nation's R&D priorities by deciding on the size and distribution of funding. The America COMPETES Act, enacted in 2007, authorized federal research and education activities to enhance U.S. competitiveness. Congress faces challenges in determining the direction of R&D investment amidst fiscal constraints and differing views on the government's role in advancing science and technology. Funding decisions will define the nation's R&D priorities. In 2010, Congress passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (P.L. 111-358) to extend and modify provisions of the 2007 law. Certain appropriations authorizations expired in FY2013. House and Senate committees held hearings in 2013 to develop bills related to scientific and technological advancement. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. losing its leadership in S&T fields to other countries. The COMPETES acts aimed to address weakening strengths in federal funding for physical sciences and engineering research, as well as the production of scientists and engineers. These acts increased funding authorizations for targeted research activities and STEM education, including the creation of ARPA-E and prize competitions. However, implementation of these provisions has varied, and congressional appropriations have generally been below authorized levels. Critics of the COMPETES Acts express opposition from various perspectives, questioning the existence of a STEM labor shortage, the federal government's role in addressing it, and preferring alternative approaches like research tax credits. Some also oppose increased funding for research and development and STEM education due to concerns about the federal budget deficit and the use of competitiveness as a rationale for economic and education policy. Experts widely accept that technological progress is responsible for up to one-half the growth of the U.S. economy and is a driving force for increases in our standard of living. Technology contributes to the creation of new goods, services, industries, jobs, and capital, as well as resolving national problems. Technological progress through innovation and research and development (R&D) contributes to economic growth by improving productivity. Government funding supports R&D for mission requirements and areas where private sector research is lacking. Federal funding reflects a consensus on the importance of technological advancements. Federal funding for research and development (R&D) is crucial as the social rate of return on R&D spending is significantly higher than the benefits captured by individual firms. Collaboration with publicly funded research organizations boosts private sector productivity, highlighting the importance of federally funded R&D in driving innovation. Federal R&D funding is essential for driving innovation and technological advancement across industries. It stimulates private investment, influences business decisions, and impacts the nation's technological progress. Choices made by Congress regarding research financing can have immediate and long-term effects on federal programs and technological development.

Most experts agree that patent ownership is an incentive to innovation, providing the recipient with a limited-time monopoly in exchange for public dissemination of information. Congressional decisions on research financing can have significant impacts on technological development. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) made significant changes to the patent statute, introducing a first-inventor-to-file priority rule, infringement defense based on prior commercial use, and assignee filing. It also restricted patents on human organisms and tax strategies, and reformed administrative patent challenge proceedings at the USPTO. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA) introduced various reforms to the patent system, aiming to improve patent quality, make dispute resolution fairer and more efficient, enhance innovation, and boost economic growth in the United States. Some observers believe that the legislation may not address all issues discussed in Congress, such as damages assessment in infringement litigation and fee diversion. Experience will ultimately determine if the legislation achieves its intended goals. For further information, contact [author name scrubbed], Specialist in Science and Technology Policy. Congressional interest in the value of intellectual property has increased as technology plays a larger role in the United States. Patents are evolving with the expansion of cooperative research and development (R&D) to drive technological advancement and create new products, processes, and services for the market. Various laws, such as the Stevenson-Wydler National Technology Innovation Act, are shaping this landscape. The Stevenson-Wydler National Technology Innovation Act and the \"Bayh-Dole\" Act have patent-related incentives to promote joint ventures between government, industry, and universities. Patents protect inventors, encourage innovation, and provide exclusive rights for 20 years to develop and commercialize inventions. Universities are motivated to license technology for commercialization and royalty payments. The patent system encourages innovation by protecting inventors and providing exclusive rights for commercialization. However, concerns have arisen regarding the cost of drugs developed with federal funding and conflicts over patent ownership in collaborative research agreements. Policymakers are also questioning the effects of patenting early-stage inventions. The 113th Congress may need to address concerns about patenting early-stage discoveries and the impact on innovation and public investment in R&D. Policymakers are questioning the effectiveness of patenting research tools and the difficulties in obtaining experimental compounds developed by drug companies for government-sponsored research. Maintaining a balance between bringing new products to market and protecting public investment in R&D is a key issue. The 113th Congress is exploring ways to boost technological innovation to address the slow growth of high-paying jobs. This includes promoting entrepreneurial business formation, increasing domestic research and development (R&D) investment, and enhancing domestic production of R&D-derived products and services. Congress can influence job creation by focusing on these areas. Tax incentives provided by Congress, such as expensing allowance and tax credits for research expenditures, aim to encourage new business formation and investment in R&D. These incentives lower the after-tax cost for companies, promoting innovation and job creation. However, some argue that the current credit's effectiveness is limited due to design flaws. The Section 1202 gains exclusion aims to boost equity investment in small startup firms by reducing the tax burden on returns. Research indicates that access to capital is a significant barrier for small startup companies. Congress may need to consider new tax incentives to increase job growth. \"Open access publishing grants free online access to articles, with authors typically paying fees for publication. Some traditional publishers offer a hybrid model where authors can provide free access in exchange for higher fees. Congress authorized NIH to require grant recipients to submit electronic versions of their final work since 2008.\" The NIH requires recipients of grants to submit final articles for public access within 12 months. Supporters of open-access publishing cite benefits like avoiding high subscription fees and promoting scientific collaboration. Traditional publishers and some associations oppose these policies, fearing industry weakening and profit loss. The America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010 required the OSTP Director to establish a working group to coordinate agency policies on public access to federally funded R&D results. Respondents generally support increasing public access to research results. In February 2013, the OSTP Director directed federal agencies funding over $100 million of research to develop plans for making research results publicly available within one year of publication. The OSTP has identified 20 agencies for draft public access plans, with ongoing review by OSTP and OMB. Maintaining a sufficient workforce of scientists and engineers is crucial for scientific and technological advancement, with workforce-related issues expected to be discussed by the 113th Congress. The U.S. science and engineering (S&E) workforce is a concern for Congress, with efforts to support education and development in STEM fields. There is no definitive definition of the S&E workforce, and policymakers are looking to increase the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the U.S. through visa and immigration policies. The policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce focuses on professional-level computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. Some analyses also include life scientists, S&E managers, technicians, social scientists, and related occupations. Various stakeholders have diverse views on the shortage of scientists and engineers in the U.S. and related policy issues. The policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce focuses on professional-level computer, mathematical, engineering, and physical science occupations. Stakeholders have diverse views on the shortage of scientists and engineers in the U.S. and related policy issues. Labor economists use indicators like employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates to assess occupational labor shortages in STEM fields. Policymakers have a lasting interest in STEM education, with concerns about U.S. students' performance compared to other countries. The national conversation about STEM education in the U.S. is complex, with varying opinions on the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce. Estimates show federal STEM education efforts amount to around $3.0 billion annually. While some argue for a shortage of STEM workers, others disagree. Most agree that improving STEM skills in the workforce would benefit the economy, defense, and health sectors. Analysts have differing opinions on federal STEM education policy, with some advocating for comprehensive policies to improve STEM achievement for all students, while others prefer targeted policies to meet specific needs. Some scholars oppose using education policy to increase the supply of STEM workers, citing concerns about corporatization of education or the market being a more efficient lever for signaling demand for STEM skills. Federal STEM education activities are closely monitored due to perceived importance. The Obama Administration proposed a reorganization of federal STEM education efforts in response to concerns about duplication and fragmentation. The proposal aimed to target resources towards specific priorities but faced mixed reactions in Congress, with some supporting the idea to reduce duplication while others raised concerns about stakeholder input and alignment with existing STEM education strategies. The reorganization of federal STEM education aligned with a congressionally mandated strategy. Some committees have opposed parts of the Administration's plan, while others have endorsed changes or remained silent. For more information, refer to CRS reports on STEM education. The federal government invests billions in agricultural research annually, with the 113th Congress likely facing budget issues and challenges related to advances in agricultural biotechnology. Public investment in research has led to productivity gains, boosting agricultural and economic growth. The USDA conducts research at the federal level and supports programs in states, with a research program funded at about $2.5 billion per year. The USDA's research program is funded with about $2.5 billion per year of discretionary funding. Congress reauthorizes agricultural research in omnibus farm bills. The 2008 farm bill authorized research through September 30, 2013. The 113th Congress has been working on a 2013 farm bill to reauthorize. The 113th Congress has been working on a 2013 farm bill to reauthorize agricultural research and other provisions. The Senate and House approved their versions of the bill, with increased funding for certain research initiatives. S. 954 would provide $200 million in mandatory funding to establish the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, which would award grants for collaborative public/private partnerships in agricultural research. The FDA is considering approving the first bioengineered animal for human consumption, specifically a salmon that grows to market size in half the time. Bills addressing bioengineered fish and mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods have been introduced in Congress. The FDA is nearing completion of its Environmental Assessment on the potential ecological impacts of commercially producing bioengineered salmon for human consumption. The agency is addressing public comments and plans to issue a final decision. Approval of the bioengineered salmon has been widely covered in the press and strongly opposed by environmental groups and food safety advocates. Senator Begich introduced a bill to prevent the escape of bioengineered salmon into the wild. Senator Begich and Representative Young introduced bills (S. 248 and H.R. 584) to require labeling of bioengineered fish. Representative DeFazio also introduced a labeling bill (H.R. 1699) for bioengineered food. An amendment allowing states to require labeling of bioengineered foods was defeated in the Senate farm bill (S. 954). Further legislative action on FDA regulatory processes and food labeling for bioengineered animals may occur in the second session of the 113th Congress. The 113th Congress may face biomedical research and development issues related to the budget and oversight of the National Institutes of Health and the impact of federal R&D on prescription drug costs and availability. NIH plays a key role in conducting and supporting biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the lead federal agency for biomedical research with a budget of $29.3 billion in FY2013. Funding supports basic, clinical, and translational research in NIH's laboratories and universities nationwide. The extramural research program provides grants, contracts, and training awards to over 300,000 scientists affiliated with various institutions. Despite budget constraints, NIH funding has decreased by 22% since its peak in FY2003. NIH's budget decreased from $30.9 billion to $29.3 billion in FY2013. Efforts are being made to improve research training, promote diversity in the biomedical research workforce, and enhance career advancement for minorities. Budget constraints have led to a reevaluation of programs like the Institutional Development Awards (IDeA). Congress approved an NIH reorganization in FY2012 focused on translational medicine, leading to the establishment of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS). The NIH focuses on testing therapeutic products and forming partnerships to speed up commercialization. Congress has concerns about government involvement in private sector product development and NIH expanding its mission. Oversight topics include financial conflict of interest, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and human research subject protection. The pharmaceutical industry benefits from federal policies that support innovation and reduce drug costs for consumers. Patent ownership incentivizes companies to invest in research and development, leading to the introduction of new products to the market. Patents are crucial in the pharmaceutical sector due to the ease of replicating inventions. The pharmaceutical industry relies on patents to drive innovation and bring new products to market. However, challenges such as generic competition and patent expirations are impacting revenue available for research and development. The expiration of patents on blockbuster drugs can have a significant effect on companies, leading to a need for new products in the development pipeline. Some experts believe that declining productivity in the pharmaceutical industry is due to a lack of new products in the development pipeline. Concerns have been raised by Members of Congress about the current legislative approach to encouraging innovation. Critics argue that industry incentives are unnecessary due to government support and patent protection, while others believe government intervention in drug pricing is necessary. Government intervention in drug pricing is debated as contrary to promoting innovation in the private sector. Supporters argue that existing incentives have led to a strong pharmaceutical industry. The key issue is finding an initiative to reduce prescription drug costs without hindering innovation. For more information, refer to CRS reports on drug patent expirations, authorized generic pharmaceuticals, and pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. The curr_chunk discusses policy issues related to federal support for research and development in physical and material sciences, including funding for the National Science Foundation and nanotechnology initiatives. It also addresses issues concerning the Department of Energy Office of Science and ARPA-E in the \"Energy\" section. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering, with a focus on funding levels and the \"doubling path\" policy. It is a key source of federal support for U.S. university research and STEM education programs. The National Science Foundation (NSF) is debating whether to continue the \"doubling path\" policy of large budget increases over a short period. Advocates argue for steep funding increases for U.S. competitiveness, while others suggest steady, reliable increases over longer periods. Some propose directing funding towards mission-oriented research or increasing research tax credits for private industry. Policymakers are considering reducing NSF funding in light of federal fiscal constraints. Some policymakers are considering reducing NSF funding due to federal fiscal constraints. Other federal policy issues for the NSF include scientific independence, accountability to taxpayers, funding for behavioral and social sciences, geographic distribution of grants, and investments in STEM education research and programs. Nanotechnology R&D focuses on controlling matter at nanoscale dimensions, offering potential economic and societal benefits. Current applications are incremental, such as improving products like automobile bumpers and cargo beds. Nanotechnology has various applications in different industries, such as in automobile bumpers, clothes, and sporting goods to enhance performance and durability. In the long term, nanotechnology could lead to significant advancements in areas like cancer detection and treatment, renewable energy, water filtration, self-healing materials, and memory devices, driven by substantial public investments in research and development. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) focuses on R&D to achieve scientific breakthroughs and develop new materials, tools, and products. Over 60 nations have established similar programs. Congress has appropriated $16.1 billion for nanotechnology R&D through FY2012, with an estimated $1.7 billion for FY2013. The 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act was enacted in 2003 to provide a legislative foundation for NNI activities. Congress has addressed R&D funding, U.S. competitiveness, and environmental, health, and safety concerns related to nanotechnology. The Department of Defense relies on science and technology for national defense, with key issues for the 113th Congress including budgetary concerns and program effectiveness in transitioning S&T findings into fielded systems. The Department of Defense's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation program is the largest in the federal government, with a majority of funding dedicated to military systems. The Science and Technology (S&T) program receives $11-12 billion annually for basic and applied research. Maintaining funding for S&T is a concern as overall Department spending is expected to decrease. Overall, there is concern about the declining overall spending in the Department of Defense's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation program. The FY2014 budget request for Science and Technology (S&T) was $11.983 billion, a slight increase from previous years. Some experts argue that investing in a robust S&T program now is crucial for future military advantage, despite the long-term nature of the benefits. There are also concerns about the level of funding for basic research activities within the Department. The Department of Defense's Science and Technology (S&T) program is a major supporter in fields like mathematics and materials, providing support to universities for the development of students. Concerns exist about the efficient transition of technology from the lab to the field, with some technologies not being utilized and others being incorporated into systems before fully developed. The 113th Congress may consider reauthorizing NASA and issues related to earth observing satellites. Congress has established programs like the Rapid Reaction Fund and the Defense Acquisition Challenge to address concerns about system development. The 113th Congress is expected to consider legislation to reauthorize NASA, focusing on the direction of NASA's human spaceflight program and the impact of constrained budgets on other missions. NASA lost the capability to launch astronauts into space after the last space shuttle flight in July 2011, relying on Russian spacecraft for ISS crew transport. NASA is pursuing a two-track strategy for human spaceflight as directed by the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. NASA is supporting commercial development of crew capability for the ISS, with services expected by 2017. They are also developing a new crew capsule (Orion) and heavy-lift rocket for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, with the first crewed test flight planned for 2021. Funding increases projected in the 2010 authorization act have not materialized, leading to concerns about potential budget cuts for other NASA missions. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impact of budget cuts on other NASA missions, such as science, aeronautics research, and technology development. It also mentions issues with the James Webb Space Telescope, future Mars exploration plans, and the establishment of a new NASA directorate for space technology. Satellite observations of Earth's oceans and land surface aid in short-term seasonal forecasts, wildfire detection, and long-term climate data used in predictive models for assessing climate change. Congress monitors NASA, NOAA, and U.S. Geological Survey's performance in building and operating earth-observing satellites. Congress is interested in agencies meeting budgets and time schedules to ensure critical space-based observations are not missed. Recent scrutiny has focused on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), which has experienced delays and higher costs. Originally scheduled for launch by now, JPSS is now set for 2017. A potential issue with a 2017 launch is a coverage gap in the polar-orbiting weather satellite system. The Suomi NPP satellite is currently filling the operational gap until the JPSS spacecraft is launched in 2017. If the Suomi-NPP instruments fail before 2016, there is a risk of a gap in polar-orbiting weather satellite coverage. Science and technology will play a significant role in environmental issues before the 113th Congress, including climate change science and national ocean policy. Science and technology considerations will be crucial in congressional deliberations during the 113th Congress, particularly regarding new greenhouse gas regulations and the availability of Carbon Capture and Sequestration technology. The President requested significant funding for clean energy programs and the U.S. Global Change Research Program in FY2014. The federal government also provides incentives for technologies that either increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, Congress introduced several bills related to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions, establishing new federal programs, taxing carbon in fossil fuels, and supporting adaptation to climate change. Sector-specific issues like controlling emissions from international aviation and incentivizing biofuel production are also likely to be debated. Different levels of confidence in federal policies fuel the ongoing debate. The ongoing debate on federal policies related to climate change is fueled by differing levels of confidence in climate change science among Members and the public. Most experts agree that human activities, particularly the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, have been the main drivers of global warming since the 1970s. Failure to address these human contributions could lead to costly and catastrophic risks and challenges in the future. The main contributors to climate change are carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, and black carbon aerosols emitted from various sources. To stabilize climate change, radical technological changes are needed in the US and other growing economies. Legislation has proposed technologies for adaptation to future climate change. Congress may address the federal role in facilitating private decision-making to anticipate and adapt to climate changes. In 2013, two major scientific assessments on climate change were released: the fifth scientific assessment of climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the National Climate Assessment (NCA) required under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. These assessments provide a comprehensive picture of the changes in response to climate variability and change, including effects on public health and human infrastructure. In 2014, the IPCC will release two additional reports on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and GHG control. Reliable water quantity and quality are crucial for the U.S. population, ecosystems, and economy. The curr_chunk discusses the lack of coordination and prioritization in federal water research funding, with only $700 million allocated in FY2004, less than 0.5% of federal R&D. The National Research Council found this funding distribution inconsistent with the nation's water research needs, favoring short-term research. This highlights the need for improved water science to address climate change impacts and adaptation concerns. The report highlighted the lack of coordination and prioritization in federal water research funding, with funding directed towards short-term research and federal regulatory activities. It called for renewed funding for research on water use, conservation, and augmentation. The 2012 GAO report emphasized the need for more comprehensive data and research for effective energy and water policies. Recent attention in Congress has been driven by concerns that current research is insufficient to address domestic and international water challenges. The 113th Congress is addressing various water challenges, including funding for federal water research, energy-water research, and reauthorizing appropriations for existing efforts. Key reports on desalination, drought causes, and selected water issues are available for further information. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is of interest to Congress for mitigating climate change by capturing and storing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use. The EPA has proposed standards to limit CO2 emissions from new coal-fired power plants. The EPA has proposed standards to limit CO2 emissions from new coal-fired power plants to 1,100 pounds per megawatt-hour, while new natural gas-fired plants should emit between 1,000 and 1,100 pounds. Existing coal-fired plants emit over 2,000 pounds per megawatt-hour. New natural gas plants can meet the standards without new control technologies, but new coal plants would need CCS technology. The future of coal as a domestic energy source is linked to CCS development, as current U.S. power plants do not capture large volumes of CO2 for CCS. The United States has the potential to store billions of tons of CO2 underground indefinitely through CCS technology, which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the high cost of implementing CCS on CO2-emitting facilities and unresolved issues regarding liability and ownership pose challenges to its widespread adoption. In 2009, Congress allocated $3.4 billion for CCS through the Recovery Act. The United States has allocated $3.4 billion for CCS RD&D through the Recovery Act. Currently, there are no commercial ventures in the U.S. solely focused on carbon sequestration, but there are commercial-scale demonstration projects for CO2 capture, injection, and storage. The success of these projects will impact the future deployment of CCS technologies to prevent CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning. Geoengineering refers to technologies aimed at deliberate modification of Earth's energy balance to reduce global temperatures. Little research has been done on most methods, and deployment is limited. Research on geoengineering methods and deployment has been minimal, with some involvement from foreign governments and scientists. Concerns exist regarding the effectiveness, appropriateness, and potential consequences of geoengineering as a climate change solution. Despite the need for continued research due to slow progress in emissions reductions and uncertainties in climate sensitivity, some warn against hasty deployment due to possible unforeseen impacts. Despite limited federal involvement and oversight, Congress may need to consider the potential need for funding and research on geoengineering as a strategy for addressing climate change. With the possibility of climate change remaining a global concern, policymakers may need to evaluate whether existing laws and international agreements are sufficient or if new ones need to be developed. In August 2000, legislation created a U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which published An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century in September 2004 with 212 recommendations for a national ocean policy. The Pew Oceans Commission, established in 2000, published America's Living Oceans: Charting a Course for Sea Change in June 2003 to develop policies for marine resource restoration and protection. In response to recommendations from the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission, the Obama Administration established the National Ocean Council through Executive Order 13547 in July 2010. This initiative focused on improving coordination of federal activities, stewardship of marine resources, and coastal and marine spatial planning. The national ocean policy framework operates within existing authorities, with some in Congress questioning its implementation. Some in Congress have questioned the administration's national ocean policy, particularly marine spatial planning, as a potential new regulatory program. Legislation in the 113th Congress included provisions to restrict actions based on the policy. Previous legislative efforts have focused on specific marine issues, but comprehensive approaches to federal organization and marine spatial planning have not been fully addressed. The 113th Congress has not introduced legislation on marine spatial planning and ocean-related technology investments have been reduced due to budget constraints. Key energy issues for Congress include funding for ARPA-E, reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, biofuels, and ocean energy technology. ARPA-E, modeled after DARPA, has supported over 285 energy technology research projects since FY2009. Its appropriations authorization expired in FY2013, leading to a funding gap of $329 million for FY2014. Critical questions for the 113th Congress include whether to continue funding ARPA-E. The House Appropriations Committee initially passed $50 million funding for ARPA-E, but two minority members argued it would \"effectively end\" the agency. Policymakers struggle to determine the optimal funding level for agencies like ARPA-E, as there is no consensus on federal R&D funding. ARPA-E focuses on transformative research with a higher failure rate, leading some to advocate for increased funding due to private sector reluctance to fund high-risk research. Some question private sector reluctance to fund high-risk research for ARPA-E projects, citing previous private sector funding for some grantees. A 2012 Government Accountability Office report stated that most ARPA-E projects couldn't have been funded solely by private investors. Assessing ARPA-E's impact may take many more years due to the long-term nature of the research funded. The Department of Energy's Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a major federal funder of research in the physical sciences. It oversees 10 of DOE's national laboratories and allocates budget to support national laboratories, university researchers, and other recipients. Funding levels are a perennial policy concern for the Office of Science. Funding levels for the Department of Energy's Office of Science are a policy concern. Increases in appropriations have not met authorized rates, and reauthorization for funding is a key question for Congress. Another issue is the ITER project, an international effort to build a fusion reactor. The ITER project, an international effort to design and build a fusion reactor, has faced budget pressure on domestic fusion activities. Some analysts claim that U.S. fusion researchers have had grants cut to fund ITER. Concerns have been raised about the reliability of ITER's cost and schedule, which have changed significantly since 2006. The U.S. ITER program emphasizes that a majority of funding is spent in the U.S., providing access to technology and data for American institutions. The ITER project, an international effort to design and build a fusion reactor, has faced budget pressure on domestic fusion activities. Some analysts claim that U.S. fusion researchers have had grants cut to fund ITER. Concerns have been raised about the reliability of ITER's cost and schedule. Other Office of Science topics that the 113th Congress may consider relate to technology transfer, laboratory management, and exascale computing. Biofuels, touted as an alternative to conventional fuels, have both supporters and critics due to concerns about environmental impact and cost. The debate over the feasibility of biofuels is complex, with policymakers considering factors like feedstock costs and impact on other industries. Different biomass feedstocks and conversion technologies add to the complexity, requiring a thorough assessment of costs and benefits for each specific biofuel. U.S. energy policy, including infrastructure and the use of natural gas, also influences investment in biofuel research and production. Congress has long been interested in biofuels, particularly first-generation biofuels like cornstarch. The farm bills since 2002 have focused on biofuel production, with attention on first-generation biofuels like cornstarch ethanol. Commercial-scale production of advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, is still in its early stages. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was expanded in 2007 to increase advanced biofuel production, but it has faced scrutiny for not meeting targets. The advanced biofuel targets are not being met, and there are concerns about the transparency of the compliance system. Congress may debate the necessity of a domestic biofuel industry for national defense and the military's role in biofuel production. There is a possibility of producing more biofuel than can be used. Congress may need to consider modifying biofuel efforts or maintaining the status quo. The debate over reprocessing spent nuclear fuel revolves around extracting plutonium and uranium for new reactor fuel or direct disposal. Proponents argue that reprocessing can recover substantial energy, but critics fear it could undermine nonproliferation policies by creating material for nuclear weapons. In the past, the government planned to reprocess all commercial spent fuel, but concerns about weapons proliferation led to a halt in the 1970s. President Carter halted commercial reprocessing efforts in 1977 due to slow nuclear power growth. President Reagan restarted a breeder demonstration project, but funding was stopped in 1983. Clinton largely halted nuclear energy reprocessing research, with some work continuing for waste management. Bush renewed support for reprocessing with a new technology, UREX+. Obama redirected the Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program towards various nuclear fuel cycle approaches. The FY2014 DOE budget justification outlines research on nuclear fuel cycle approaches, with a funding request of $165.1 million.

New technology is needed for growth in domestic ocean energy production. Congress aims to diversify U.S. ocean energy portfolio by deploying renewable resources like offshore wind projects. The Energy Information Administration anticipates 200 MW of offshore wind capacity to come online by 2015, producing 750 million kWh per year. 750 million kilowatt hours (kWh) per year of electricity is anticipated to come online by 2015 with the Cape Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts. The project has faced controversy due to environmental concerns and financing challenges, leading to delays in operations. Congressional consideration of statutory changes to facilitate financing options for renewable energy projects like Cape Wind is ongoing. Options for addressing financing hurdles may include extending federal tax credits for renewable energy projects. The Marine Well Containment Company, a consortium of major oil companies, developed a subsea containment system to prevent subsea blowouts, which was recently tested by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement has tested a new system designed to shut off flow from underwater wells and activate subsea dispersant injection equipment for blowout prevention at ocean depths of up to 10,000 feet. Congress will monitor this development for ocean drilling safety. The Department of Homeland Security conducts research and development on detecting nuclear material and biological terrorism, as well as developing medical countermeasures against various agents. DHS has five core missions including preventing terrorism and enhancing security, securing borders, enforcing immigration laws, safeguarding cyberspace, and ensuring disaster resilience. Coordination of DHS R&D is a congressional concern, with the Directorate of Science and Technology having primary responsibility. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) are key DHS components responsible for coordinating R&D activities related to nuclear and radiological threats. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that multiple DHS components fund R&D efforts, making it challenging for DHS to oversee these activities effectively. The S&T Directorate manages federal laboratories, R&D centers, and university centers of excellence, but budget constraints have limited funding for R&D projects in recent years. The S&T Directorate's role has expanded to include technology acquisition and operational support. Its R&D focus is now more short-term and incremental, with less emphasis on basic research. DHS has reorganized its R&D activities multiple times, creating DNDO and OHA from elements of the S&T Directorate. Congress has directed DHS to evaluate merging DNDO and OHA. In 2013, Congress directed DHS to evaluate merging DNDO and OHA, potentially realigning functions like R&D. Congress emphasizes the need for nuclear detection domestically and abroad, with a layered strategy including international engagement, supply-chain security, border security, and developing detection capabilities within the U.S. Experts have criticized the combined fixed and mobile detection capabilities in the United States as insufficient to detect all smuggled special nuclear material. Research and development activities for nuclear smuggling detection involve multiple agencies, including DHS and NNSA. Next-generation detection equipment development has not met performance expectations, leading to a potential need for new neutron-detection materials. Congressional policymakers may oversee interagency coordination, equipment procurement, and testing for nuclear detection activities. The federal government responded to the nation's vulnerability to biological terrorism after the anthrax attacks of 2001 by increasing efforts to protect against CBRN terrorism. Policymakers identified a lack of effective medical countermeasures as a challenge and created programs to encourage private sector development. Despite these efforts, gaps in CBRN medical countermeasures remain. The federal government lacks medical countermeasures for many CBRN threats. BARDA and Project BioShield support the development and procurement of new countermeasures. BARDA funds development through contracts with private sector developers, while Project BioShield provides a procurement mechanism to guarantee purchases. The 113th Congress enacted the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 to reauthorize and modify BARDA and Project BioShield, but some key issues remain unresolved. In FY2004, Congress advance appropriated $5.6 billion to Project BioShield for a ten year period. HHS had obligated all of this advance appropriation by FY2014. Congressional policymakers may consider providing appropriations to BARDA and Project BioShield individually on an annual basis for improved efficiency. Deviating from previous funding amounts may be necessary to address countermeasure needs or the current fiscal environment. The National Select Agent Registry Program (NSAR) oversees the possession of select agents\u2014biological agents and toxins with the potential to pose a severe threat to public health. NSAR requires registration and specified security practices by U.S. laboratory facilities that possess, use, or transfer these agents. The select agent list is developed and updated by the HHS CDC and USDA APHIS. Congress mandated the program in 1996 and has strengthened it through subsequent reauthorizations. The National Select Agent Registry Program (NSAR) oversees the possession of select agents, requiring registration and security practices for U.S. laboratory facilities. Access to select agents is restricted based on background investigations and federal laws. CDC regulates human pathogens and toxins, while APHIS regulates animal and plant pathogens. Both agencies oversee \"overlap agents\" that affect both human and non-human animals. Concerns include intentional and accidental release of agents from registered facilities due to environmental control failures or improper practices. NSAR regulations require registered facilities to have biosafety plans addressing good laboratory practices and worker safety to prevent accidental releases. CDC designates Tier 1 select agents with the highest risk of deliberate misuse, imposing new security requirements. The BioWatch program, managed by the DHS Office of Health Affairs, deploys pathogen sensors in U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. Local jurisdictions handle public health responses, and timely treatment reduces casualties during incidents. Federal officials aim to improve BioWatch system responsiveness. The BioWatch program aims to improve responsiveness by replacing daily sensor collection with autonomous sensors transmitting pathogen findings in real-time. Despite technical challenges and high costs, DHS is pursuing Gen-3 sensors since 2007. GAO recommends reevaluating the mission need before continuing procurement. BioWatch has not detected bioterrorism incidents but has found pathogens of interest. The BioWatch program has faced criticism for false alarms and lack of sensitivity, but some officials defend it for promoting collaboration among different levels of government. Congressional members have been monitoring the program's performance and have at times limited funding or called for reviews. The BioWatch program has faced criticism for false alarms and lack of sensitivity, with Congressional members monitoring its performance and sometimes limiting funding or calling for reviews. Hearings have been held on the program by authorizing committees in each Congress since the 108th, and an investigation by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce began in the 112th Congress. The debate over research publishing policies for making influenza more transmissible raises concerns about national security. Balancing benefits and harms across various policy areas like security, science, health, export, and international policy is complex. Trade-offs must be considered to establish regulatory frameworks that maximize research benefits while minimizing risks. The Administration is developing policy frameworks for life science experiments to maximize benefits and mitigate risks. Stakeholders have not reached consensus on the effectiveness of these policies. Congressional policymakers could allow full implementation or require new processes for identifying concerning research. The Administration is developing policy frameworks for life science experiments to maximize benefits and mitigate risks. Stakeholders have not reached consensus on the effectiveness of these policies. Congressional policymakers could allow full implementation or require new processes for identifying concerning research. Results; federal licensing of researchers for experiments; limit research to safe laboratories. Issues for Congress include cybersecurity, Internet governance, broadband access, and spectrum allocation. Experts have concerns about cybersecurity in the US and abroad. The federal role in cybersecurity is complex, involving securing federal systems and protecting nonfederal systems. Various statutes address cybersecurity, with consensus on the need for a policy framework that considers technology evolution and threats. Congress faces issues like cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, cybercrime prevention, the link between cyberspace and national security, and federal involvement in cybersecurity. Proposed legislation in the 112th Congress focused on national cybersecurity issues, including national strategy, reform of FISMA, protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing, cybercrime penalties, privacy in electronic commerce, international efforts, R&D, and the cybersecurity workforce. Despite several bills being considered, none were enacted, leading to the White House issuing an executive order in February 2013. The White House issued Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 to enhance cybersecurity of U.S. critical infrastructure through voluntary collaborative efforts involving federal agencies and private sector operators. Several bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress with more proposals expected. The Internet is governed by a private sector organization called ICANN, which manages domain names and Internet addressing using a multistakeholder model of governance. Some national governments are pushing for more influence over ICANN policy decisions, especially regarding issues like intellectual property, privacy, and cybersecurity. The debate over intergovernmental control of the Internet emerged during the 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications, with the United States and the European Union opposing such jurisdiction. The United States and 54 other nations chose not to sign the final treaty due to concerns about an unacceptable expansion of ITR jurisdiction over the Internet. The 112th Congress passed resolutions promoting a global Internet free from intergovernmental control and supporting the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The 113th Congress faces the issue of maximizing U.S. influence over ICANN's governance process while resisting proposals for increased international governmental involvement. The ongoing concern is the extent to which future international telecommunications and Internet conferences could lead to increased intergovernmental control over the Internet. The Administration is working to counteract this threat. Broadband technology is increasingly important for telecommunications services. The lack of adequate broadband availability is most pressing in rural America, where costs and low population densities reduce economic incentives for providers to invest in infrastructure. Broadband adoption is also a problem, with certain populations lagging behind. The 113th Congress is addressing broadband-related issues such as transitioning the Universal Service Fund to the Connect America Fund, reauthorizing broadband loan programs, and developing new wireless spectrum policies. There is a potential examination of the regulatory structure and revision of the Telecommunications Act to incentivize investment in broadband. The 113th Congress is addressing broadband-related issues such as transitioning the Universal Service Fund to the Connect America Fund, reauthorizing broadband loan programs, and developing new wireless spectrum policies. Creating additional incentives for investment in broadband infrastructure is a key issue under consideration, along with developing federal policies to increase broadband availability and adoption while minimizing negative effects on competition and private sector investment. The High-Performance Computing and Communications Program (HPCC) Act of 1991 was passed by Congress to enhance federally-funded IT research and development programs. Proponents argue that federal support for IT R&D has been beneficial for the country and has supported long-term research into fundamental aspects of computing. Government-funded IT research plays a crucial role in supporting long-term research into fundamental aspects of computing, leading to unanticipated results that are often as important as anticipated ones. It also promotes open standards, benefiting various sectors. Critics argue that government funding may favor certain entities, while supporters believe it creates a synergistic environment for research across different sectors. The NITRD Program, funded by the government, may influence industry research directions, potentially favoring certain entities. Its size and funding will be debated in Congress. The growth in mobile technologies has increased the need for advanced communications infrastructure and spectrum capacity. The 113th Congress may debate new policies for managing radio frequency spectrum to support high-speed, content-rich uses. Spectrum is considered a natural resource but also a form of property through license assignments. The debate centers on maximizing societal and economic value of airwaves for wireless services. The \"Spectrum Act,\" part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, addresses the need for new spectrum capacity to support wireless services. It authorizes the FCC to establish an \"incentive auction\" process to release airwaves for commercial wireless companies. This aims to ensure American leadership in a wireless, mobile economy for the future. The Spectrum Act of 2012 aims to license and auction spectrum for commercial wireless companies, expand spectrum for unlicensed use, and allow federal agencies to share spectrum. Next-generation networks use licensed spectrum, while technologies like Dynamic Spectrum Access are being developed for future spectrum policy."
