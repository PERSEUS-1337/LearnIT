Boys Town provides care to children and families in 11 regions across the country, including California, Nevada, Texas, Nebraska, Iowa, Louisiana, Florida, Washington, DC, New York, and New England. The Boys Town National Hotline offers counseling to over 150,000 callers annually. The Boys Town National Research Hospital is a leader in hearing care and research on Usher Syndrome. Boys Town programs impact over 2,000,000 children and families in America each year. The 100th Anniversary of Boys Town, Nebraska will be celebrated on December 12th, 2017. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue up to 350,000 $1 silver coins commemorating the centennial of Father Flanagan's Boys Town. The coins will weigh 26.73 grams, have a diameter of 1.500 inches, and contain 90% silver and 10% copper. They will be legal tender and considered numismatic items.\n\nSEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The design of the coins minted under this Act will symbolize Boys Town's 100 years. Each coin will feature the coin's value, the year \"2017\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with Boys Town's Executive Director and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens of Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a single designated facility of the United States Mint from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS. The coins will be sold by the Secretary at a price including face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. All sales of coins issued under this Act will include a $10 surcharge per coin, with the surcharges going to Boys Town to support children and families in underserved communities. The Comptroller General of the United States has the right to audit Boys Town's expenditures related to these funds. No surcharge may be included for any coin issuance in a calendar year if the issuance has already occurred. The Secretary may issue guidance if issuing a commemorative coin would exceed the annual limit set by section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code."
