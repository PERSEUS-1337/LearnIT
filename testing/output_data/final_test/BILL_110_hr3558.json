    "content": "The Act titled \"Military Eye Trauma Treatment Act of 2007\" establishes a Center of Excellence for the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of military eye injuries. The Act establishes a Center of Excellence in Prevention, Diagnosis, Mitigation, Treatment, and Rehabilitation of Military Eye Injuries within the Department of Defense. It collaborates with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and institutions of higher education. The Center of Excellence in Prevention, Diagnosis, Mitigation, Treatment, and Rehabilitation of Military Eye Injuries collaborates with Veterans Affairs and other entities to track and exchange information on significant eye injuries incurred by armed forces members. The Military Eye Injury Registry, developed in consultation with ophthalmological and optometric specialists from the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs, tracks treatments and outcomes for veterans with eye injuries. The registry ensures proper tracking at military medical facilities. The Military Eye Injury Registry requires military medical facilities to submit information on eye injuries, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The Center notifies the Blind Rehabilitation Service and Veterans Health Administration about armed forces members with significant eye injuries. The Military Eye Injury Registry collects data on armed forces members with significant eye injuries, including those with visual dysfunction related to traumatic brain injury, visual acuity of 20/200 or less, or loss of peripheral vision. This information is used to coordinate ongoing eye care and visual rehabilitation benefits by the Department of Veterans Affairs post-separation from the armed forces. The Military Eye Injury Registry collects data on armed forces members with significant eye injuries, including visual field loss of twenty degrees or less in the injured eye. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will ensure registry information is available for research and clinical education on combat-related eye injuries. The Secretary of Defense will include records of OIF/OEF veterans in the Military Eye Injury Registry. A report on the status of the Center of Excellence in Prevention, Diagnosis, Mitigation, Treatment, and Rehabilitation of military eye injuries will be submitted to Congress within 180 days. The Secretary of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs will jointly conduct a program for members of the Armed Forces and veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Post Traumatic Visual Syndrome at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. This program includes vision screening, diagnosis, rehabilitative management, and vision research. Authorization of $5,000,000 for the Center of Excellence in Prevention, Diagnosis, Mitigation, Treatment, and Rehabilitation of Military Eye Injuries under the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008."
