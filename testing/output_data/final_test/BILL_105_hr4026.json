    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Megan's Law Implementation Act\" and provides grants to states for costs related to the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to include a grant program known as the Sex Offender Management Assistance Program (SOMA) to help states comply with the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to include the Sex Offender Management Assistance Program (SOMA) grant program for states to comply with the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. States must submit an annual application to the Bureau of Justice Assistance to receive grants for training, salaries, equipment, and other costs related to compliance. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance may require states to comply with the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, including having penalties comparable to or greater than federal penalties. Waivers may be granted for states demonstrating an overriding need. Regulations must be established within 90 days of the enactment of this subsection. The Director will promulgate regulations to implement this subsection, including information requirements for state applications. Funds allocation may consider the number of sex offenders registered in each state. The Bureau of Justice Assistance will study certain training programs before implementation. The Bureau of Justice Assistance will study the feasibility of incorporating activities from a training program established under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 into the SOMA program to avoid duplication of efforts or costs. Recommendations may be made to Congress for integration prior to program implementation. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will conduct a study on the effectiveness of the SOMA program and provide recommendations to Congress by March 1, 2000. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 for this purpose."
