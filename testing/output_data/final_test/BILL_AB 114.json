    "title": "AB 114",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 13332.19 of the Government Code is amended to define \"design-build\" as a construction procurement process where both design and construction are procured from a single entity. This section also outlines terms like \"design-build project\" and \"design-build entity\" for capital outlay projects. The design-build solicitation package includes performance criteria, concept drawings, contract forms, and other necessary documents for bidding. The \"design-build phase\" is the period after awarding a contract to a design-build entity where they complete design and construction activities to finish the project. \"Performance criteria\" describe the project scope, including building size, design, materials, and operational requirements. Concept drawings may also be included to detail the state's needs. Funds for a design-build project must be approved by the Department of Finance and State Public Works Board before being spent by state agencies. Exceptions include real property acquisition, equipment, minor capital projects, and funds for performance criteria or preliminary plans before January 1, 2005. Any funds appropriated for the design-build phase of a project must be approved by the State Public Works Board. If not approved, the funds will be returned to the original fund. The bid package for a design-build project cannot be released until approved by the Department of Finance. Changes to performance criteria require written approval from the Department of Finance. Bid alternates in the solicitation package must also be approved by the Department of Finance. The State Public Works Board can increase a design-build project budget by up to 20% of the capital outlay appropriations, regardless of whether any funds have reverted. The Department of Finance has the authority to decide which fund sources will cover the augmentation for projects funded by multiple sources. Augmentations exceeding 20% will be deferred until additional funds are allocated by the Legislature. The State Public Works Board can increase the construction reserve within the construction fund for a capital outlay project by up to 20% without augmenting the project. Any augmentation exceeding 10% of the design-build project budget must be reported to the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. The Department of Finance has the authority to modify approved scopes for major design-build projects and must report any changes and cost implications to relevant legislative committees. Additionally, the Department must report to the appropriate committees when the estimated cost of a design-build project exceeds 20% of the amount recognized by the Legislature. Section 15770.5 of the Government Code is repealed. Section 15816 is amended to specify the jurisdiction and maintenance of public buildings once their revenues are no longer needed for bond payments. Section 15817.1 is also amended. Section 15817.1 of the Government Code is amended to specify the jurisdiction and maintenance of public buildings once their revenues are no longer needed for bond payments. The board can lease public buildings from state agencies to finance public buildings through revenue bonds. The board can then lease the buildings back to the state agency and use the revenues to repay the bonds. The lease terms include rental provisions, payment, security, default, and other specified terms. The lease terms may include provisions for security, default, remedy, and other specified terms between the board and the state agency. The public buildings leased can be substituted with other buildings and may be existing public buildings determined by the board and state agency. The board and state agency determine fair rental value and economic useful life for financing public buildings. The lease does not need approval from the Director of General Services. This can be used for previously authorized but unissued revenue bonds. The Department of Finance will report to the Legislature on the asset transfer authority, including the number of times it has been used, the financing secured, and estimated savings. Section 15820.903 of the Government Code is amended. Section 15820.903 of the Government Code is amended to allow the SPWB to issue up to $340,866,000 in revenue bonds for approved local jail facilities. The funds can be used to reimburse counties for acquisition and construction costs, with appropriations continuously available for this purpose. The SPWB may issue up to $870,074,000 in revenue bonds to finance approved local jail facilities. This section will be inoperative after June 30, 2017, with projects already commenced by that date allowed to be completed with bond financing. The board may issue up to $509,060,000 in revenue bonds to finance approved adult local criminal justice facilities, including acquisition, design, construction, renovation, and construction reserve. Funds derived from this section are continuously appropriated for this purpose. Proceeds from revenue bonds can reimburse counties for costs related to approved adult local criminal justice facilities. Funds from this section are continuously appropriated for this purpose. Section 15831 of the Government Code is amended. Section 15831 of the Government Code is amended to specify that all bonds issued under this part must bear the facsimile signature of the Governor, Controller, and Treasurer, along with the Great Seal of the State of California. The bonds remain valid even if the signing officers have left office. Bonds subject to early redemption must include a statement to that effect. The board can determine a variable interest rate for bonds of the same issue, series, or maturity, with a maximum rate set by resolution. The Treasurer is authorized to sell bonds above, below, or at their face value. The Treasurer is responsible for preparing and selling bonds authorized by the board, either through public or private sale. In a public sale, bids are submitted to the Treasurer for the lowest interest cost, and if no satisfactory bids are received, the Treasurer may reject them and opt for a private sale. The Treasurer determines the lowest interest cost bid using either the net interest cost method or the true interest cost method. The bid with the least total interest cost, taking into account premiums or discounts, is awarded the bonds. The rate bid is determined by the nominal interest rate that, when compounded semiannually, discounts the debt service payments on the bonds to the bond date, equaling the price bid for the bonds. Temporary bonds, certificates, or receipts can be issued and signed by the Treasurer until definitive bonds are available. Treasurer's signature may be done using a signature stamp. The text chunk discusses the appropriation of funds to pay rent for state agencies occupying facilities authorized under specific acts. The funds are to be taken from the agency's support appropriation and are available when the state is operating without funds appropriated by the Budget Act or if rental payments are not included in the Budget Act. The appropriation of funds ensures support for state agencies occupying authorized facilities, with funds available when the facility is ready for use. This appropriation becomes inactive if jurisdiction over the facility is transferred. This act is a bill providing appropriations related to the Budget Bill in California, identified as budget-related and effective immediately."
