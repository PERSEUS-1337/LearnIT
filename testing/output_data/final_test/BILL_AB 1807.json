    "title": "AB 1807",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds it appropriate for the Bureau of Real Estate to report disciplinary actions on its website and to consider petitions from licensees to stop reporting past actions if no longer necessary to protect the public. Petitioners may be required to pay a fee for consideration of their petition. The act does not authorize the destruction of public records under the California Public Records Act or to deny a request for such records. It aims to allow licensees to petition the Bureau of Real Estate to remove past disciplinary notices from the bureau's license verification webpage. The commissioner must provide online information about license status, including suspensions and revocations, without personal details, in accordance with relevant acts. The commissioner must disclose a licensee's address of record, allowing for a post office box or alternate address. A licensee may be required to provide a physical business or residence address for internal administrative use only, not for public disclosure. Upon petition and payment of a fee, the commissioner may remove discipline postings from the bureau's website after 10 years if evidence of rehabilitation is provided, considering any ongoing violations that pose a risk to the public. The bureau may establish fees and requirements for licensees to petition for disciplinary record removal, with the process starting on January 1, 2018. A list of licensees with altered records will be maintained and shared with other licensing bodies. The commissioner will provide online information on license status, including suspensions and revocations, as well as accusations filed against licensees. The commissioner will disclose a licensee's address of record, allowing for a post office box or alternate address. A licensee may also provide a physical business or residence address for internal use only, not for public disclosure. The public information disclosed by the commissioner includes whether a licensee is an associate licensee and identifies responsible brokers associated with the licensee. The definition of \"Internet\" is as stated in the relevant section. Upon petition and payment of a fee, the commissioner may remove discipline postings from the bureau's website after 10 years if evidence of rehabilitation is provided, and there is no longer a risk to the public. Other violations that pose a risk will be considered in the evaluation. The bureau may establish fees and requirements for licensees to petition for disciplinary record removal, with evidence of rehabilitation needed. The process will start on January 1, 2018, and a list of altered records will be shared with other licensing bodies. This section will be effective on January 1, 2018. Section 2.5 of the bill will only be effective if certain conditions are met, including the enactment of Assembly Bill 2330. It specifies that changes to Section 10083.2 of the Business and Professions Code will become operative on January 1, 2018."
