    "content": "The \"Corporate Fair Share Tax Act\" limits interest deduction for excessive interest of financial reporting groups. The \"Corporate Fair Share Tax Act\" limits interest deduction for excessive interest of financial reporting groups by amending Section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Corporate Fair Share Tax Act\" amends Section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code to limit interest deduction for excessive interest of financial reporting groups. It calculates a corporation's proportionate share of the group's net interest expense based on earnings percentages. The \"Corporate Fair Share Tax Act\" limits interest deduction for excessive interest of financial reporting groups based on earnings percentages. Earnings include net earnings, net interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as per financial statements. The \"Corporate Fair Share Tax Act\" restricts interest deduction for financial reporting group members if they fail to substantiate their share of net interest expense or elect to do so. The deduction for interest expense exceeding 10% of adjusted taxable income is disallowed. This applies to corporations within a financial reporting group. The subsection does not apply to certain corporations predominantly engaged in banking, financing, or with less than $5,000,000 of net interest expense. A financial reporting group refers to a group that prepares consolidated financial statements according to accounting standards authorized by the Treasury Secretary. The subsection excludes certain corporations engaged in banking or financing with less than $5,000,000 of net interest expense. All members of an expanded affiliated group are treated as one corporation. Net interest expense is defined in subsection (j)(6)(B). Disallowed interest can be carried forward to the next taxable year. The excess of interest expense deducted in a taxable year over the sum determined under paragraph (1)(A)(i) and (ii) shall be added to the limitation for the next taxable year. An election must be made as prescribed by the Secretary, and regulations will be provided to carry out the purposes of this subsection. The subsection aims to coordinate interest deductibility rules, define financial services entities, allow non-US net interest expense computation for financial reporting groups, address pass-through entities treatment, and permit the use of foreign financial statements when US statements are not prepared. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014 for corporations that are members of financial reporting groups."
