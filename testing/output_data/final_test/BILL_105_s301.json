    "content": "The Act titled \"National Parks Capital Improvements Act of 1997\" includes definitions for clarity. The Act defines key terms such as fundraising organization, National Park Foundation, park, and Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary may enter into a memorandum of agreement with a fundraising organization to issue taxable bonds for park surcharge collection. The organization must adhere to professional standards, undergo audits, and the US is not liable for the bonds. The fundraising organization must enter into a memorandum of agreement detailing the bond issue amount, maturity not exceeding 20 years, per capita amount for bond repayment and administration costs, reserve requirements, funded projects, and responsibilities of the Secretary and organization. The Secretary of the Interior may authorize the Superintendent of the park to charge a surcharge of up to $2 in addition to the entrance fee, with a limit of $2 per individual. The funds collected are used to amortize bond issues, cover administration costs, and maintain reserves. Excess funds collected beyond bond amortization, administrative expenses, and reserves will be sent to the National Park Foundation for the benefit of all National Park System units. The use of bond proceeds is outlined in Section 6. Bond proceeds under this Act can be used for projects in the park, subject to certain limitations. Interest earned on bond proceeds must be used for reserve requirements and administrative expenses, with excess funds remitted to the National Park Service. The excess funds from interest earned on bond proceeds must be remitted to the National Park Foundation for the benefit of all units of the National Park System. The Secretary, with consultation from the Secretary of Treasury, will issue regulations to implement this Act."
