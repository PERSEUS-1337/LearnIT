The \"Better Buildings Act of 2013\" introduces measures for high-performance energy efficiency in separate spaces, defining key terms and mandating a study on improving energy efficiency. The \"Better Buildings Act of 2013\" aims to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings by implementing high-performance measures in separate spaces through design and construction. The study will include descriptions of energy efficiency measures and processes for owners, tenants, architects, and engineers to replicate. The \"Better Buildings Act of 2013\" focuses on implementing high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces through design and construction. This includes standards for energy intensities in various systems to meet the needs of commercial building tenants, return on investment analysis for the incremental cost of these measures, and consideration of available incentives. The \"Better Buildings Act of 2013\" focuses on implementing high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces through models, simulation methods, and measurement platforms to predict and verify energy savings. The \"Better Buildings Act of 2013\" emphasizes high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces, including best practices for integrated design and construction to optimize energy efficiency alongside central building systems. Case studies are used to showcase economic and energy saving returns in the design and construction of these spaces. The \"Better Buildings Act of 2013\" focuses on high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces, emphasizing public participation in effective design and construction methods. The Secretary will publish a study on the Department of Energy's website. The Tenant Star Program is added to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, focusing on high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces. The Tenant Star Program, part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, aims to promote energy efficiency in separate spaces within commercial buildings through a voluntary program developed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary. The Tenant Star Program, part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, promotes energy efficiency in commercial buildings through a voluntary program developed by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary. The program includes collecting data on categories of building occupancy known to consume significant energy quantities. The Tenant Star Program, established under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, aims to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings. Data on relevant building occupancy is collected and made available to the public in aggregated form. Owners and tenants are recognized based on occupancy data, with input from the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Tenant Star Program aims to recognize tenants achieving high energy efficiency levels in separate spaces through voluntary policies and procedures. Building occupancy categories eligible for recognition are established based on collected data. Other forms of recognition for occupants lowering energy consumption are also considered. Design- and construction-based recognition will follow a study and public comment period. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection and the Secretary may develop a voluntary program to recognize commercial building owners and tenants using high-performance energy efficiency measures in separate spaces, without considering the impact on climate change."
