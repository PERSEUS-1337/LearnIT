    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Currency Harmonization Initiative through Neutralizing Action Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to currency harmonization. The Congress finds that misalignments in currency caused by government policies can nullify trade concessions, as outlined in the GATT 1994. Currency manipulation can result in unfair trade advantages and contravene the intentions of international agreements. The International Monetary Fund also prohibits such practices. The International Monetary Fund prohibits currency manipulation for unfair trade advantage. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the US to retaliate against unjustifiable trade practices. In 2002, the US had a $103 billion trade deficit with China, the largest in the world. The United States trade deficit with China is estimated to exceed $120 billion in 2003, with imports from China growing faster than exports. China is accumulating foreign currency reserves, mainly in US dollars, at a rate of over $6 billion per month, keeping the Chinese renminbi pegged at 8.3 RMB to the dollar since 1994. The Chinese renminbi (RMB) has been pegged at approximately 8.3 RMB to the dollar since 1994. Economists estimate the RMB is undervalued against the dollar by as much as 40 percent, leading to a large trade surplus with the United States. Revaluing the RMB would have a significant impact, potentially more than eliminating all import tariffs imposed by China on US goods. The President should take action against China for currency manipulation to address the trade deficit, citing GATT 1994, IMF rules, and Trade Act of 1974. SEC. 3. ANALYSIS OF AND REPORT ON EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES OF CHINA. The Secretary of the Treasury will analyze China's exchange rate policies to determine if they manipulate the currency for unfair trade advantages. If manipulation is found, a percentage will be computed. Reports on the analysis will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury will submit reports to Congress based on the analysis of China's exchange rate policies, including any computed rates, within 60 days of the enactment of the Act and annually thereafter. SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL TARIFFS. The Secretary of the Treasury will impose a tariff on all products of China entering the US if manipulation is reported, equal to the manipulation rate. This tariff will be adjusted annually based on the latest report."
