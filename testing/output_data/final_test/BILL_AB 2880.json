    "title": "AB 2880",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6253.11 of the Government Code states that a public agency must comply with requests to inspect or copy public records protected by the Copyright Revision Act of 1976, unless the record is exempt from disclosure under other laws. Section 14615.1 is amended accordingly. Section 14615.1 of the Government Code is amended to exempt the department from the Administrative Procedure Act when directed to maintain processes or policies related to its duties under specific chapters and codes. This exemption applies to actions concerning the State Administrative Manual and the State Contracting Manual. The Public Contract Code is amended to extend provisions to actions taken by the department before January 1, 1999, regarding competitive procurement in the State Administrative Manual and the State Contracting Manual. This article applies to all state agency contracts for services rendered to the state, requiring department approval for effectiveness. It excludes contracts for construction, alteration, or maintenance of real property. Contracts subject to this article include those for construction, alteration, improvement, repair, or maintenance of real or personal property, services under Chapter 10 of Division 5 of Title 1 of the Government Code, exceptions listed in Section 10295, contracts under $5,000, contracts for per diem or travel expenses only, contracts between state agencies, or contracts between state and local or federal agencies. The department must ensure that state agencies subject to specific Government Code sections have obtained the Attorney General's consent for contracts with legal counsel, excluding the Attorney General. This consent does not allow the Attorney General to establish a separate contract approval program. The department must maintain a list of approved contracts with legal counsel exceeding $20,000, including provider information, contract length, hourly rates, and service need. The list must be filed quarterly with specified committees and made available to the public upon request for a fee. State agencies must consider department processes and policies when exercising authority under this article. Contracts entered into after January 1, 2017, require consideration of intellectual property rights unless the department consents. Department approval is needed for contract modifications, with some exceptions. An amendment to a contract that extends the original time for completion for one year or less is exempt. If the amendment increases the monetary amount or includes an indemnification agreement, department approval is required. Amendments to contracts based on competitive bidding laws must be authorized by the law or contract."
