The \"Idaho Land Enhancement Act\" defines key terms such as Agreement, Bureau of Land Management land, Board, and City. The \"Idaho Land Enhancement Act\" defines key terms such as City (referring to Boise, Idaho), Federal land (including Bureau of Land Management land and National Forest System land), National Forest System land (7,220 acres in Idaho Panhandle National Forests and Clearwater National Forest), Secretary (referring to the Secretary of the Interior), and State (referring to the State of Idaho, Department of Lands). The term \"State\" in the Idaho Land Enhancement Act refers to the State of Idaho, Department of Lands. The term \"State land\" refers to approximately 11,085 acres of land administered by the State proposed to be acquired by the United States. SEC. 3. LAND EXCHANGE. The Agreement and this Act require the State to offer State land to the United States, with the Secretary and Secretary of Agriculture accepting the offer and exchanging Federal land simultaneously. Additional agreements may be made to supplement the exchange, including legal descriptions, reserved interests, and cash payments. The land exchange agreement must include cash equalization payments, specify necessary terms, and be subject to valid existing rights and agreed-upon conditions. The value of Federal and State land exchanged must be equal or adjusted accordingly, determined through appraisals. Appraisals for land acquisitions must adhere to specific standards and be approved by the Secretary and Secretary of Agriculture or an interdepartmental appraisal review team. Cash equalization may be used if the value of Federal and State land is not equal. Cash equalization payments can be made to the United States or the State to equalize the value of land. Proceeds from these payments are deposited into a fund for the acquisition of land for the National Forest System. The Secretary of Agriculture will convey easements or rights-of-way to National Forest System land to provide access to Federal land acquired by the State. The State will convey easements or rights-of-way to land owned by the State to the United States. The City will pay administrative costs associated with the conveyance. The City will pay administrative costs for the conveyance of Federal and State land, including field inspections, environmental analyses, appraisals, title examinations, and deed preparations. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT OF FEDERAL LAND. Transfer of Administrative Jurisdiction: The Secretary of Agriculture will now have administrative jurisdiction over approximately 2,111 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in Shoshone County, Idaho. This land will be managed in accordance with laws applicable to the National Forest System. The Secretary of Agriculture will manage Wilderness Study Areas transferred to them to preserve their suitability for wilderness designation until Congress decides otherwise. State land conveyed to the United States will be administered in accordance with the Weeks Act and laws applicable to the National Forest System. The State land conveyed to the United States under this Act will be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other applicable laws. Acquisition of State land will not require a revision to existing land and resource management plans of the Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. When plans are renewed, they will consider the State land acquired under this Act. The acquired State land will be managed according to existing land and resource management plans for adjacent land. The boundaries of Idaho Panhandle National Forest and Clearwater National Forest will be considered as of January 1, 1965. The acquired State land will be managed according to existing land and resource management plans for adjacent land, considering the boundaries of Idaho Panhandle National Forest and Clearwater National Forest as of January 1, 1965. SEC. 5. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS. The Secretary, Secretary of Agriculture, and the Board can modify land descriptions in the Agreement for corrections, adjustments, or reconfigurations. Written legal descriptions prevail over maps or acreage estimates. Public land orders withdrawing Federal land are revoked to allow disposal. Federal land can be withdrawn pending completion of the land exchange. Pending completion of the land exchange, Federal and State lands are withdrawn from mining, public land laws, mineral leasing laws, and the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. This withdrawal does not affect valid existing rights. Congress finds that the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have conducted adequate analyses and reviews of the environmental impacts of the exchange authorized under section 3(a). No further administrative or environmental analyses or examination shall be required to carry out any activities authorized under this Act."
