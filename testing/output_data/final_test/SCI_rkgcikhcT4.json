    "content": "In a recent study, the alignment of labels to eigenvectors in a single layer network was found to impact optimization and generalization. This concept was extended to kernel and neural representations, improving both aspects. The work of BID8 raised questions about optimization and generalization in deep net training, prompting a reevaluation of statistical learning theory. The alignment of labels to eigenvectors in a single layer network impacts optimization and generalization. Extending this concept to deeper networks raises questions about training and statistical learning theory. Incorporating embeddings in a two-layer model and performing spectral analysis to understand deep learning phenomena. Using unbiased kernels like Gaussian kernel or mimicking deep networks for embeddings. Using kernel methods like random Fourier features (RFF) and neural embeddings improves convergence in training and lowers test error, confirming the effectiveness of data-driven embeddings in deep learning models. Using kernel methods like random Fourier features (RFF) and neural embeddings improves convergence in training and lowers test error. This work empirically shows that kernel and neural embeddings enhance the alignment of target labels to the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix, improving training and generalization. It suggests a way to extend insights to deeper networks and possible theoretical results in this direction. The study demonstrates that aligning label vectors with eigenvectors of the Gram matrix improves training and generalization in kernelized networks. This alignment is crucial for optimization and generalization performance, as shown in previous research. The study focuses on the generalization performance of a two-layer network, using a kernelized approach on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. The experiments involve setting image labels, normalizing images and kernel embeddings, initializing weights, and using a specific loss function for training. Optimization is done through gradient descent with a specified learning rate. In experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, a Gaussian kernel with random Fourier features is used for optimization. Different dimensions of the kernel lead to faster convergence of the optimization process. The Gaussian kernel with random Fourier features in optimization on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets shows faster convergence with different kernel dimensions. Analysis focuses on CIFAR-10 dataset, showing lower theoretical upper bound on generalization error with various kernels. The generalization error bound improves with higher dimensions of representations but is sensitive to values of \u03b3. Kernel methods show significant improvements in test error and accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset, with larger kernels leading to larger improvements. Early-stopping can be more efficient in deep learning with such transitions. Choosing a proper kernel and its parameters can be challenging, as seen in the comparison of plots in FIG0, 1(c) and 2(a). By improving alignment of eigenvectors and target labels, training and generalization can be enhanced with kernels. Investigating a data-dependent neural kernel and embedding, a second hidden layer with m = 10000 hidden units and ReLU activation is added to the neural network. The embedding is pre-trained using two different approaches, with the first layer kept fixed while the rest of the network is reinitialized and trained. In the context of investigating a data-dependent neural kernel and embedding, the training loss for the CIFAR-10 dataset is shown in FIG4. The neural embeddings demonstrate faster convergence compared to previous methods, especially when pre-trained using different domain data. The results are compared with using a RFF kernel with an embedding size of 10000. The neural embeddings show improved alignment of labels to eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues compared to the best RFF kernel. Test error on CIFAR-10 is comparable between neural embeddings and RFF kernel, with a clear improvement when pre-training on the same labels. The representations corresponding to kernel and neural embeddings were analyzed using spectral analysis. The representations from kernel and neural embeddings in BID0 benefit optimization and generalization. Connecting kernel embeddings to neural networks like BID6 and BID4 can extend theoretical results for deeper networks."
