    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Fracture Prevention and Osteoporosis Testing Act of 2007\". Congress recognizes the importance of osteoporosis prevention and the lack of early diagnosis leading to debilitating fractures and mobility loss. Caucasians are at higher risk for osteoporosis fractures. Osteoporosis fractures are a significant health concern, especially among the nonwhite population, with costs projected to increase by 180 percent in the next 20 years. Black women have a higher risk of mortality following hip fractures. Women make up the majority of fractures and associated costs. The most accepted method for measuring bone mass and predicting fracture risk is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), with vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) also used to identify high-risk patients. The underutilization of bone mass measurement testing is a concern as it can strain the Medicare budget due to the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis and low bone mass. By 2020, over 61 million people in the United States are projected to have osteoporosis or low bone mass, leading to a 50 percent increase in osteoporosis fractures by 2025. Less than 20 percent of eligible Medicare beneficiaries are taking advantage of bone mass measurement testing, despite the high risk for future fractures. The economic burden of osteoporosis fractures is projected to increase by 50 percent over the next 2 decades, reaching $25.3 billion in 2025. Reimbursement for bone mass measurement under Medicare will be significantly reduced by 2010, straining the Medicaid budget for osteoporosis treatment in low-income Americans. Reimbursement for bone mass measurement will be reduced by 50 percent by 2010, discouraging physicians from providing access to DXA or VFA in their offices. This reduction will compromise patient access to these tests, exacerbating the current underutilization of the benefit. SEC. 3. MINIMUM PAYMENT FOR BONE MASS MEASUREMENT.\n\nAmends the Social Security Act to establish a national minimum payment amount for bone mass scans, ensuring reimbursement rates are not less than 100 percent of the rates in effect on December 31, 2006. Effective from January 1, 2008.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY AND REPORT BY THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will arrange for a study by the Institute of Medicine on the impact of Medicare reimbursement reductions for bone mass measurements on beneficiary access, especially in rural and minority communities. The study will also explore ways to increase the use of bone mass measurements by Medicare beneficiaries. The Institute of Medicine will submit a report with its findings and recommendations to the Secretary and Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act. The Institute of Medicine will provide a report on issues related to Medicare reimbursement reductions for bone mass measurements."
