    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"GPCI Justice Act of 2009\". Congress finds that the Medicare physician fee schedule was established in 1992 to replace the charge-based payment system. The fee schedule includes over 7,000 services with corresponding payment rates and three relative value units (RVUs) for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense. Geographically adjusted RVUs measure the costliness of services in specific localities. Physician payment localities were established in 1966 and redesigned in 1997, with varying geographic bases like zip codes or political boundaries. Medicare has not revised these boundaries since 1997, and geographic adjustments are determined using three GPCIs. The physician payment locality is determined using three GPCIs corresponding to Medicare physician payment components. Data for GPCIs is primarily sourced from the decennial census, resulting in significant payment differences among counties. Underpaid counties are concentrated in California, Georgia, Minnesota, Ohio, and Virginia. Hospitals are reimbursed for geographic costs based on MSAs under the Medicare program. Studies by MedPAC, GAO, Urban Institute, and Acumen LLC in 2007-2008 have all highlighted the payment discrepancies in physician GPCI payments based on geographic costs. Recommendations have been made to correct these payment differences within the locality system. The discrepancy studies aim to replace county-based locality with Metropolitan Statistical Area for physician GPCI payments. Redesignating the Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) localities in California. The Social Security Act is amended to transition to using MSAs as fee schedule areas in California starting January 1, 2010. The Secretary will revise the fee schedule areas using the MSA Geographic Adjustment Factor methodology. The Secretary will configure physician fee schedule areas using Core-Based Statistical Areas-Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) as the basis. An iterative process will transition fee schedule areas by listing MSAs within the State by Geographic Adjustment Factor. The Secretary will compare the Geographic Adjustment Factor (GAF) of the highest cost MSA in the State to the weighted-average GAF of the remaining MSAs. If the ratio is 1.05 or greater, the highest cost MSA becomes a separate fee schedule area. This process will be iterated for other MSAs in the State. The Secretary compares the GAF of the second-highest MSA to the weighted-average GAF of the remaining MSAs. If the ratio is 1.05 or greater, the second-highest MSA becomes a separate fee schedule area. This iterative process continues until the ratio of the highest-cost remaining MSA to the weighted-average of the lower-cost MSAs is less than 1.05. The remaining lower cost MSAs are combined into a single fee schedule area based on identical GAFs. For services in California after January 1, 2010, the Secretary will adjust indices to county-based fee schedule values from December 31, 2009. The Secretary will review and update the California Rest-of-State fee schedule area every three years using MSAs and geographic index data revision. The revision described in clause (i) will be effective concurrently with the periodic review of adjustment factors for California in 2012 and subsequent periods. The Secretary will provide county-level or MSA data used for calculating the geographic practice cost index. Effective January 1, 2010, any reference to a fee schedule area in California will be considered a reference to an MSA in the State. Effective January 1, 2010, any reference to a fee schedule area in California will be considered a reference to an MSA in the State. Amendment made to the definition of Fee Schedule Area in the Social Security Act."
