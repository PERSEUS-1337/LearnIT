    "content": "The Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights (SCCR) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has been discussing a new broadcasting treaty since 1998. Despite efforts for final negotiations, no consensus has been reached after 17 sessions. Webcasting and simulcasting were removed from the treaty scope in 2006, with the United States advocating for their inclusion. The WIPO General Assembly tentatively agreed to convene a diplomatic conference in November/December 2007 to conclude a treaty for the protection of traditional broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. The SCCR aimed to finalize the proposed text with a signal-based approach to focus on signal theft and piracy. The WIPO General Assembly tentatively agreed to convene a diplomatic conference in November/December 2007 to conclude a treaty for the protection of traditional broadcasting and cablecasting organizations. The focus was on signal theft and piracy concerns, but significant differences among parties delayed the treaty's conclusion. Despite discussions in SCCR meetings in 2008, no further steps have been taken to organize a diplomatic conference. The Revised Draft Basic Proposal from April 2007, which serves as the current working text, includes various alternatives for key articles. One contentious issue is the proposed 50-year term of protection, compared to the 20-year term under the Rome Convention. The text lacks a clear definition of \"signal,\" despite discussions on the topic in previous sessions. The April 2007 Non-Paper discusses the uncertainty surrounding a \"signal-based\" approach for a new treaty, with disagreement on exclusive rights. Lack of consensus is evident in the Revised Draft Basic Proposal, as shown in an Informal Paper from the November 2008 SCCR meeting. The WIPO member countries are divided on the new treaty, with some wanting exclusive rights extended to new areas like webcasting and protection of pre-broadcast signals. This is based on traditional concepts of intellectual property rights. Some WIPO member countries support extending exclusive rights to new areas like webcasting and protection of pre-broadcast signals, while others view the treaty as a standalone effort not requiring exclusive rights. Concerns exist that an exclusive rights-type treaty could limit public access to content by keeping it out of the public domain. The Chairman's informal paper also addresses issues such as post-fixation rights, retransmission over the Internet, term of protection, and limitations on protections granted under the treaty. The curr_chunk discusses points of contention regarding the treaty on signal-based protection and proposes two options for negotiations. One option is to base the treaty on the Revised Draft Basic Proposal, while the other suggests using the Geneva Phonograms Convention of 1971 and the Brussels Satellite Convention. These options aim to achieve international protection for broadcast signals and prevent signal piracy through national copyright, unfair competition, or administrative laws. The curr_chunk recommends that if no decision can be reached on a new treaty for signal-based protection, the SCCR should consider ending current efforts, removing it from the agenda, and revisiting the matter later. Despite discussions in November 2008, no decisions were made, and the treaty remains on the agenda. Stakeholders have expressed objections to the treaty, reflecting concerns from various WIPO country-parties. At the first special session of the SCCR, various stakeholders advocated guidelines for a treaty text, while maintaining their stance that a treaty is unnecessary. These stakeholders represent a range of international and national organizations from different sectors. The stakeholders argue against the need for a treaty to create new rights in the broadcasting and cablecasting sector, stating that the US industry is already flourishing. They emphasize the importance of demonstrating a clear need for such rights and understanding their impact on the public, educators, copyright holders, online communications, and technology innovation. Additionally, they oppose the idea of granting exclusive rights in broadcasts. The stakeholders argue that a treaty on broadcasting and cablecasting should focus on signal-based protection against theft or piracy, rather than granting exclusive rights similar to copyright. They believe that any rights beyond signal protection should have limitations and exceptions like copyright laws to ensure lawful uses of broadcast content. The stakeholders argue that the treaty on broadcasting and cablecasting should focus on signal-based protection against theft or piracy, rather than granting exclusive rights similar to copyright. They believe that any rights beyond signal protection should have limitations and exceptions like copyright laws to ensure lawful uses of broadcast content. Additionally, they contend that the treaty should permit additional limitations and exceptions appropriate in a digital network environment and exclude coverage of fixations, transmissions, or retransmissions over a home or personal network. Stakeholders are concerned that protections for technological protection measures and digital rights management schemes could inhibit networking services and related technology innovations. The stakeholders advocate for signal-based protection in the treaty on broadcasting and cablecasting, with limitations and exceptions similar to copyright laws. They also recommend that intermediate network service providers should not be held liable for infringement due to normal business activities or customer actions. The South Centre expressed similar concerns in a research paper on the treaty's impact on developing countries. The South Centre recommends negotiators limit the new instrument to signal protection, avoid exclusive rights beyond Rome Convention, include safeguards for public policy objectives, and exclude webcasting references. They also suggest special treatment for public service broadcasting. The United States advocates for extending protections to webcasting in new broadcasting treaties or agreements, with a focus on signal protection and limitations on exclusive rights. They emphasize the need to ensure that technological protection measures do not impede access to content. The United States proposed replacing \"webcasting\" with \"netcasting\" to clarify that it only covers transmissions over computer networks carrying audio, visual, or audio-visual content similar to traditional broadcasting. This was to avoid implying that ordinary internet activities would be covered. The United States reaffirmed its position on extending protections to \"netcasting\" similar to traditional broadcasting, limited to preventing signal theft/piracy. Any treaty would require ratification by the Senate and implementing legislation by Congress. Becoming a party to the new broadcast treaty would also require becoming a party to the Rome Convention first. The United States may need to ratify the Rome Convention to consider a new broadcasting treaty. Implementing legislation would be necessary to establish new protections or amend existing ones in broadcasting and copyright laws. Certain U.S. stakeholders have called for Congress to hold hearings on the treaty to determine its necessity. Stakeholders urge oversight on U.S. delegation's positions for a new treaty. Concerns raised about changes in telecommunications and copyright laws without public input. Senate Judiciary Committee expresses concerns about the Treaty to U.S. Copyright Office and USPTO. Stakeholders urge oversight on U.S. delegation's positions for a new treaty, expressing concerns about changes in telecommunications and copyright laws without public input. Senate Judiciary Committee opposes a new layer of exclusive rights, advocating for a narrow, signal-theft based approach to the U.S. Copyright Office and USPTO."
