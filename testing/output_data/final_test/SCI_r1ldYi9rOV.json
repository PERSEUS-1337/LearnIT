    "content": "Few-shot learning algorithms have gained popularity for enabling models to adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal training samples. Previous works in this area have primarily focused on classification and reinforcement learning. In this paper, a few-shot meta-learning system for regression tasks is proposed. The model reduces the degree of freedom of the unknown function by representing it as a linear combination of basis functions. A Feature Extractor network encodes basis functions, and a Weights Generator generates weight vectors for tasks. The model outperforms current meta-learning methods in regression tasks by learning a model that relates inputs to outputs. In this work, a few-shot learning model for regression tasks is proposed. The model aims to quickly adapt to new tasks with only a few examples. It is evaluated on sinusoidal regression tasks and compared to other meta-learning algorithms. Additionally, two more regression tasks are introduced: the 1D heat equation task and the 2D Gaussian distribution task. The model proposed in this work aims to perform regression tasks using few-shot learning, allowing it to quickly adapt to new tasks with only a few examples. It is evaluated on sinusoidal regression tasks and compared to other meta-learning algorithms. Additionally, new regression tasks introduced include the 1D heat equation task and the 2D Gaussian distribution task. The model proposed in this work focuses on few-shot learning for regression tasks, aiming to rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal examples. It was first introduced in 2011 for few-shot classification using the Omniglot dataset. The model aims to regress a novel function based on only a few samples, with a focus on regression tasks like the sinusoidal regression, 1D heat equation, and 2D Gaussian distribution tasks. The model aims to learn a sparse representation of the unknown function F(x) using a linear combination of basis functions. Various basis functions, such as the Maclaurin series expansion, can be used to expand F(x) in a compressible manner. The model aims to learn a sparse representation of the unknown function F(x) using a linear combination of basis functions. Using the Fourier basis can provide a compressible representation with only a few non-zero linear weights, making it possible to estimate the function accurately with a small number of samples. Our approach aims to learn a sparse representation of the unknown function F(x) using a set of training tasks drawn from p(T). The Feature Extractor encodes the set of {\u03c6 i (x)} for any task from p(T), while the Weights Generator maps K training samples of a novel task to a constant vector. The model is designed for few-shot regression tasks, predicting the entire regression function across a value range by passing training samples through the Feature Extractor with trainable parameters. The Feature Extractor encodes high dimensional feature representations for each training point of the task, while the Weights Generator outputs weights vectors for regression tasks using self-attention blocks. The model uses self-attention modules to generate optimal weights for regression tasks. It predicts on a set of points for a task by taking a dot product between task-specific weights and feature representations. The model can handle regression tasks with higher dimensional outputs by outputting multiple weight vectors. Few-shot regression tasks have additional label information at the task level, known as task labels, which describe regression function parameters. These task labels are used as input to the Weights Generator to improve model performance. To address the lack of task labels during testing, a Task Label Generator component is introduced to the model. The Task Label Generator in few-shot regression tasks uses self-attention blocks to generate task labels for regression tasks. The model is evaluated on three regression tasks: sinusoidal regression, 1D heat equation, and 2D Gaussian distribution. Comparison is made with Meta-SGD and Yoon et al. (2018) on the sinusoidal task. Our model, trained with a limited number of tasks for added complexity, outperforms Meta-SGD and BMAML on sinusoidal, 1D Heat Equation, and 2D Gaussian regression tasks. Results show that our model performs well even without using task labels. An ablation study compares different model variants on the sinusoidal task. The study compares three model variants on an advanced sinusoidal task, showing results in TAB1. A few-shot meta learning system focusing on regression tasks is proposed, with a feature extractor and weight generator network. The model demonstrates competitive performance on various few-shot regression tasks. The model consists of a 40-dimensional fully connected network for feature extraction, followed by a ReLU activation function. The Weights Generator takes a 41 + tn dimensional input and produces embeddings for each task's training samples. These embeddings go through 3 attention blocks with self-attention operations and fully connected layers, ending with layer normalization. Each block includes a residual connection from the embedding to the output. The model includes attention blocks with self-attention operations and fully connected layers. The Task Label Generator has a similar architecture to the Weights Generator, with a 64-dimensional fully connected layer and 3 attention blocks. The final weight vector is obtained by taking the mean of the output. The model includes attention blocks with self-attention operations and fully connected layers.

At each point of the rod, a certain time t after applying the heat source until the temperature achieves equilibrium throughout the rod. The temperature at each point x after time t is given by the heat equation. In experiments, L is set to 5 and 10 points are randomly sampled on the heat equation curve for a 10-shot regression task. The model is trained to predict the probability distribution function of a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution with mean ranging from (-2, -2) to (2, 2) and standard deviation in both directions. In experiments, the model is trained on regression tasks with batch sizes and steps specified. The Adam Optimizer is used for optimization, and Tensorflow library is utilized for implementation on a Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU. In an ablation study on a Ti GPU, the model's learned features correspond to basis functions that affect the final prediction. Removing certain dimensions from the feature vector results in noticeable differences in the regression function characteristics. In an ablation study, removing dimensions from the feature vector affects the regression function characteristics. Results show changes in the magnitude, position, and shape of the regression curve. Visual examples of model results are shown for sinusoidal, 1D heat equation, and 2D Gaussian tasks.
