    "content": "The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) governs arms sales to Taiwan since 1979 when the US recognized the People's Republic of China. It allows the US to provide defense articles and services to Taiwan for self-defense. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) manages relations with Taiwan under the direction of the Departments of Defense and State, as well as the National Security Council. The process for determining arms sales to Taiwan has become routine, with annual talks and consideration of Taiwan's defense needs by the US. Taiwan's armed forces have acquired defensive weapons from the US over the past 20 years. The military in Taiwan believes the Pentagon is supportive of their needs, making the situation favorable for predictable defense budget planning. Taiwan could send senior military delegations to Washington for arms talks, reducing U.S.-PRC friction. China objects to arms sales to Taiwan, citing the TRA and the 1982 U.S.-PRC communique. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell testified on the success of the TRA before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1999. The TRA has been successful in U.S.-Taiwan relations, with significant arms sales totaling $20 billion from 1991 to 1998. The Pentagon expanded military cooperation with Taiwan after tensions in 1996, focusing on strategy and defense planning. In 1999, a Pentagon team visited Taiwan to enhance cooperation further. In September 1999, a Pentagon team visited Taiwan to assess its air defense capability and make recommendations on upgrading it. Criticisms within the United States of arms sales arrangements include observations on the lack of a strategic, longer-range approach and disappointments for Taiwan in obtaining requested defensive items. In 1999, some in Congress introduced the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act to address delays and denials in arms sales to Taiwan. Critics have long pushed for a reevaluation of arms sales to Taiwan, advocating for more diplomatic solutions and a focus on statesmanship rather than military hardware. Some argue for greater support for Taiwan's military, emphasizing the need for attention to \"software\" such as absorption of new equipment. Some critics are concerned about potential secret negotiations between the White House and Beijing regarding arms sales to Taiwan. During a summit in Beijing in June 1998, the PRC requested a U.S. promise to deny theater missile defense technology to Taipei in exchange for a pledge not to provide missiles to Iran, but no agreement was reached. Additionally, some on Capitol Hill feel that successive Administrations have overlooked Congress's role in determining arms sales as outlined in the TRA, with some Members seeking to increase their influence. Representative Gilman, Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, wrote to the President about this issue. The Clinton Administration decided to sell early warning radars to Taiwan after pressure from Representative Gilman. The arms sales process between Washington and Taipei typically includes four stages, with Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense deciding on a list of items to request from the United States. Taiwan typically presents a list of requested items to the U.S. at the end of each year, including P-3 anti-submarine aircraft and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. In 1999, Taiwan requested $1.7 billion worth of items such as Aegis-equipped destroyers, diesel-electric submarines, Patriot missile defense systems, early-warning radars, and satellite reconnaissance. Working-level talks are then held in Taiwan to discuss the requests in detail with Taiwan's military. After Taiwan presents its list of requested items to the U.S., working-level talks are held with Taiwan's military to discuss the requests in detail. Pentagon teams visit Taiwan to gather information on its defense needs, and various U.S. agencies formulate their positions on the requests based on factors like regional stability, military balance in the Taiwan Strait, and U.S.-PRC relations. The decisions may involve considerations of offensive vs. defensive capabilities and the value of arms known as the \"bucket.\" Annual talks between Washington and Taipei on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan occur every year, with disagreements resolved within the U.S. government at high levels if necessary. During the annual talks between Washington and Taipei on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the U.S. side presents final decisions on requested items, with a military delegation from Taiwan visiting for scheduled meetings. The State Department confirmed the presence of a Taiwan delegation in Washington in April 1999, emphasizing the importance of periodic consultations that include Taiwan military representatives. During the annual talks between Washington and Taipei on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, consultations took place with Taiwan military representatives. There was a frank exchange of views on Taiwan's self-defense needs, but details were not discussed. The U.S. agreed in principle to sell long-range early-warning radars to Taiwan, with the President and Congress determining the defense articles and services needed. The Pentagon will work with Taiwan to evaluate radar needs over the next year, but no specific agreement on type or terms of sale has been reached. Taiwan's military was represented by its Vice Chief of General Staff in the 1999 talks. During talks between Washington and Taipei on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Taiwan's military, led by Vice Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Teng Tzu-lin, discussed self-defense needs. The U.S. side, represented by AIT, included officials from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency and the State Department's Office of Taiwan Coordination."
