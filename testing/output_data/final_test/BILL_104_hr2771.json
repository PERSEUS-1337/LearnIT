    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Congressional Pay for Performance Act\" and includes definitions. The Act is titled the \"Congressional Pay for Performance Act\" and defines terms related to the Federal deficit, deficit target, concurrent resolution on the budget, and Member of Congress. The Congressional Pay for Performance Act defines terms related to the Federal deficit and outlines pay as a function of efforts to eliminate the deficit. The Congressional Pay for Performance Act outlines consequences if deficit targets are not met, including reducing the rate of basic pay for Members of Congress if the deficit exceeds the target by more than $1 billion. The Congressional Pay for Performance Act states that if the Federal deficit for fiscal year 2002 is $1 billion or more, the rate of basic pay for Members of Congress will be reduced to zero starting in 2003. If deficit targets are met for fiscal years 1996-2001, no changes will be made to the pay based on the deficit size. If the deficit is eliminated for any year from 1996-2002, no changes will be made to pay. The Federal deficit for fiscal years 1996-2002, if less than $1 billion, will result in restoring the rate of basic pay for Members of Congress to the 1995 level. The size of the deficit is determined by the Congressional Budget Office based on the Final Monthly Treasury Statement, excluding any tax revenue increases. The rate of basic pay for Members of Congress may be restored to previous levels in the event of a war declared by Congress, with adjustments made as if the relevant legislation had never been enacted. In the event of a war declared by Congress, the rate of basic pay for Members of Congress may be restored to previous levels, with adjustments made as if the relevant legislation had never been enacted. Any references to fiscal year 1996 in relation to deficit targets shall be adjusted to the first fiscal year after the war ends, and subsequent fiscal years shall be determined accordingly. SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF AUTOMATIC ANNUAL PAY ADJUSTMENTS FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. Repeals paragraph (2) of section 601(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Conforming amendments are made to section 601(a)(1) of the Act."
