    "content": "No information provided. Congress acknowledges that water supply issues in the western United States, including on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation, are worsened by drought, population growth, and environmental needs. The Pine River Indian Irrigation Project faces significant challenges, with key facilities in poor condition and maintenance fees insufficient to address the project's deterioration. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has attempted to double the fees in recent years, but the project remains in a critical state. The 2006 General Accounting Office report found that water users couldn't afford lower maintenance fees of $8.50 for the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project. Rehabilitating the project's infrastructure offers benefits like water conservation, increased agricultural production, and economic benefits. The project is currently managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Southern Ute Indian Tribe, managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, receives water from Bureau of Reclamation facilities. Rehabilitating the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project's infrastructure would improve water management and help address potential water conflicts. The Act defines key terms such as \"project,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" \"Tribal Council,\" and \"Tribe.\" It also calls for a study on the infrastructure of the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project. The Secretary, in consultation with the Tribe, will conduct a study of the project's irrigation infrastructure and develop a list of improvements over a 10-year period based on the study results. Improvements will be prioritized based on recommendations of the Tribe, cost-benefit analyses, users' ability to irrigate agricultural land, and water conservation effects. The Secretary will conduct a study of the project's irrigation infrastructure, consulting with the Tribe and other officials. Within 18 months, a report will be submitted to relevant committees and the Tribe, including a list of improvements and relevant findings. Biennial Review: The Secretary, in consultation with the Tribe, will review and update the list of improvements every two years following the submission of the report on the project's irrigation infrastructure. SEC. 4. IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS. The Secretary may provide grants or cooperative agreements to the Tribe for repairing, rehabilitating, reconstructing, or replacing irrigation infrastructure. Grants cannot be used for major impoundment structures or on-farm improvements. The Secretary must consult with and obtain approval from the Tribe, consult with the Director of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and coordinate with the Bureau's irrigation operations and maintenance program. The Secretary may require Tribes to provide matching funds for grants or cooperative agreements under the Bureau of Indian Affairs program, amounting to at least 25% of the total grant. SEC. 5. FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. This Act does not affect the Tribe's water rights under Federal or State law, nor does it preempt State water law or interstate compacts. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $4,000,000 is authorized for section 3, and $10,000,000 for each fiscal year 2010 through 2015 for section 4 projects."
