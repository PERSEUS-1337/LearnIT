The Congress recognizes the need for fair and objective guidelines to distinguish between employees and independent contractors. SEC. 3511 introduces standards for determining whether individuals are not employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 3511 introduces standards for determining if individuals are not employees under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If specific requirements are met, the service provider, recipient, and payor are not considered as employees for the service provided. The requirements include significant investment in assets or training, incurring unreimbursed expenses, and agreeing to perform the service for a set amount. The service provider is liable for damages for early termination without cause, paid on a commissioned basis, or purchases products for resale. Additional requirements include having a principal place of business, not primarily providing the service at the recipient's place of business, or paying fair market rent for its use. The service provider is not required to perform exclusively for the recipient. The service provider is not required to perform exclusively for the recipient, but must not have performed a significant amount of service for other persons in the year involved. They should not have offered service through advertising, individual solicitations, or other similar activities for other service recipients. The service provider must operate under a registered business name and have a written contract stating they are not an employee for tax purposes. If a service recipient or payor fails to meet reporting requirements for a service provider, the provider may not be treated as an employee unless there is reasonable cause. If the service provider operates through an entity they own, the entity may be included in the references, and the written contract can be with either the provider or the entity. Definitions for terms related to service providers are provided in this section. A service provider is defined as an individual who performs services for another person. The service recipient is the person for whom the service provider performs the service, and the payor is the person who pays the service provider if the recipients do not. The term \"in connection with performing the service\" refers to activities related to the service provided. The section provides definitions for service providers, service recipients, and payors. It states that a service provider is an individual who performs services for another person, with the service recipient being the person for whom the service is performed, and the payor being the one who pays for the service. The terms do not include entities owned by the service provider. The amendments made by this Act regarding standards for determining employee status will apply to services performed after December 31, 1998."
