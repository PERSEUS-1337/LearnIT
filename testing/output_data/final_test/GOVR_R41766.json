Radioactive contamination near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant raised concerns about food safety and exports. Many countries increased surveillance of Japanese food products, and the US FDA and USDA took steps to address these concerns. There are also worries about potential radiation leaks affecting food production in the US and Pacific territories. Japan's agricultural and fisheries industries are closely monitored for food safety concerns. Despite contributing less than 2% to its GDP, Japan's agricultural output is valued at $70 billion annually, with fisheries at $14 billion. Japan produces fish, seafood, rice, vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy, and poultry products. It has about 2 million commercial farms spread across 11.4 million acres of farmland. Japan's marine fisheries industry in Japan has about 115,200 business enterprises and 6,500 aquaculture operations. Japan is a net food importer, with imports totaling $59.3 billion in 2010. The United States is the leading supplier, accounting for one-fourth of food imports. U.S. exports to Japan include cereal grains, seafood, meat, dairy products, fruits, and nuts. Japan's food exports totaled $4.7 billion in 2010, with fish being a leading export. Japan's food exports totaled $4.7 billion in 2010, with leading exports including fish, processed foods, bakery products, grains, and beverages. Nearly $700 million of these exports went to the United States, accounting for about 15% of Japan's total food exports. Japan heavily supports its agricultural sectors and protects domestic producers with high tariffs on imported foods. The OECD estimates Japan provided over $46 billion in government support to its farmers in 2009, ranking second only to the EU. Japan heavily supports its agricultural sectors with high tariffs on imported foods. The country provided over $46 billion in government support to its farmers in 2009, ranking second only to the EU. The current agricultural policy plan aims to increase Japan's food self-sufficiency to 50% by FY2020. Some prefectures already have high food self-sufficiency ratios, but the impact of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami on these areas is uncertain. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused widespread devastation in Japan, affecting agricultural and fishery areas. Reports suggest that Japan's food production and supply shortages, along with food safety concerns and radiation threats, may limit food exports and increase the need for imports. The estimated damages to fisheries, agriculture, and forestry sectors are $21.5 billion, with $11.0 billion in losses in the fisheries sector, $9.1 billion in damages to agricultural lands and crops, and $1.4 billion in damages to forested lands and facilities. The impact on world farm commodity markets and food prices remains uncertain. Damages to agricultural crops, land, and facilities have been reported in multiple prefectures in Japan, including Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akita, Yamagata, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Nagano, Niigata, and Mie. The agriculture sector has suffered nearly 4,700 farmland areas and about 16,400 food facilities. Catastrophic damages to fish vessels and harbor facilities have been reported in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures, with additional damages in other regions. Aquaculture facilities in Toyama, Ishikawa, Shizuoka, and Tottori prefectures have also been affected. The five coastal prefectures of Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, and Ibaraki in Japan play a significant role in the country's agricultural sector. They account for about one-fifth of Japan's total marine fisheries and aquaculture production, 17% of all agricultural output, and similar shares of rice, soybeans, vegetables, livestock, hog production, cattle and dairy herds, and poultry flocks. A report by Rabobank also estimates the potential impact on major food sectors such as meat, dairy, seafood, fruits and vegetables, and grains. The earthquake in Japan had varying impacts on major food sectors like meat, dairy, seafood, fruits and vegetables, and grains. While rice supply remained unaffected due to high stocks, concerns about soil contamination for future planting were noted. Most grain processing mills and soy-crushing plants were outside the damage zone, with potential operational disruptions due to power shortages. Damage to 15% of Japan's compound feed industry capacity was estimated. Power shortages may have affected supplies in cold storage for meat, poultry, and dairy production in northern coastal prefectures. Widespread damage was reported in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The earthquake in Japan caused widespread damage in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors, including fishing ports, vessels, and wild seedbeds for scallops and oysters. Seawater contamination is affecting consumer confidence in fresh seafood. Concerns about radioactive contamination in locally produced vegetables and fruits are growing. Despite the situation, food imports and in-country food facilities are still operating. The Japanese government is monitoring possible radioactive contamination in plant and animal products, tap water, and coastal prefectures near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant. Testing has been ongoing since March 19, 2011. Testing for radioactive contaminants in a wide range of plant and animal products, including fish, has been conducted daily since March 19, 2011. The Japanese government has restricted the distribution of potentially contaminated foods from certain prefectures. Testing includes spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, strawberries, tomatoes, milk, eggs, pork, and various seafood. The Japanese government has restricted the distribution of certain foods from specific prefectures due to concerns about radioactive contamination. Restrictions included leafy vegetables, milk, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. Despite some reports of livestock culling near the Fukushima nuclear plant, radiation levels in meat, eggs, and floriculture products were found to be within safety limits. Coastal fishing in Fukushima Prefecture was initially halted due to earthquake damage. Japan's Fisheries Agency announced that fishery activities in Fukushima prefecture will be suspended for a while due to damage caused by the earthquake. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare placed restrictions on the distribution and consumption of contaminated fish products, including juvenile sand lance harvested in Fukushima. Updates on the safety of Japan's agricultural and fishery products can be found on the ministry's website. Japan's tap water supplies in Fukushima and Chiba prefectures are under ongoing radiation concerns. Reports suggest potential radioactive contamination affecting Japanese food markets, including fish, seafood, milk, dairy, produce, and beverages. Fears of contamination near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant have raised safety concerns globally, leading to bans on Japanese food products in several countries, including the United States. In 2010, Japan was the fourth-largest agricultural export market for the United States, with $14.1 billion in food exports. However, Japanese food exports to the U.S. were only $0.7 billion, less than 1% of U.S. food imports. The majority of imports from Japan were fish and prepared foods, accounting for 75% of the total value. Other leading imports included grain-based foods and beverages like rice wine and sake. The U.S. imports a significant amount of Japanese food preparations, accounting for almost 20% of imports. Agencies in the United States claim that Japan's situation does not pose a risk to U.S. food supplies. International health organizations also state that there is no evidence of radiation contamination in food from Japan affecting other countries. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission does not expect harmful levels of radiation to reach the West Coast, Hawaii, Alaska, or U.S. territories in the Pacific, and residents are not at risk of exposure to harmful levels of radiation from Japan. Other U.S. agencies are monitoring radiation released from Japanese plants. The EPA and DOE are monitoring radiation from Japanese plants. EPA uses RadNet to monitor air, water, milk, and precipitation for environmental radiation. Results show low levels of radioactive material below public-health concern. A joint statement with FDA detected 0.8 pCi/L of iodine-131 in Spokane, WA, well below FDA's intervention level. The levels of iodine-131 detected in milk and milk products are 5,000 times lower than the FDA's intervention level. The radiation levels detected by RadNet monitors are very low and continue to decrease over time, with no public health concerns. The CDC and some West Coast states downplay potential risks and assure the public of ongoing radiologic monitoring. The California Department of Public Health and Washington State Department of Health report no harmful radiation threat to California and Washington. Industry representatives claim no danger to California's produce industry. FDA, EPA, and NOAA assure the safety of seafood products in the U.S., with only Japanese sand lance exceeding radiation standards. The joint statement confirmed no significantly elevated radiation levels in migratory species from Japan, except for Japanese sand lance. FDA continues to monitor fish from Japan's prefectures near the damaged nuclear plant. Some countries, including the US, EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and India, have increased surveillance of food imports from Japan. About 2% of seafood consumed in the US is imported from Japan. Several international organizations, including the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and various Asian nations, monitor food safety concerns in Japan. Import restrictions cover products from Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures. Organizations like the WHO, FAO, INFOSAN, and IAEA oversee rules for radioactivity in international food trade. The Codex oversees rules for radioactivity in foods for international trade, including guidance for nuclear emergencies. Recent reports suggest some foods from Japan are contaminated with radioactive iodine and cesium, unsuitable for consumption. Radioactive iodine has a short half-life and naturally decays within weeks if ingested. Radioactive iodine decays naturally within a few weeks but can cause cancer if accumulated in the body. Radioactive cesium, which can be transferred from feed to milk quickly, poses longer-term risks to food production and public health. In the United States, food imports are regulated by FDA, USDA's FSIS, APHIS, and DHS for food security activities and border inspections. The FDA issued \"Import Alert 99-33\" for milk, vegetables, and certain fish species from selected Japanese prefectures due to reports of radioactive contamination. This import alert allows for \"detention without physical examination\" of specified products, placing the burden on importers to prove their shipments are safe. More information can be found on FDA's website. As of May 17, 2011, FDA's Import Alert 99-33 restricts food products from Fukushima, Ibaraki, and Tochigi prefectures in Japan. Certain products like spinach, lettuce, milk, and others from these areas are prevented from entering the United States. Category 2 includes dairy products and fresh produce from Fukushima, Ibaraki, and Tochigi prefectures not currently banned for sale or export by Japan. These products may be detained upon arrival in the US under Import Alert 99-33, but can be released if compliant. Category 3 covers food and feed products from the same prefectures not covered by the import alert, subject to FDA examination and testing. Category 4 encompasses all other FDA-regulated food products from Japan not listed in Import Alert 99-33. Authorities will review products in Import Alert 99-33 using standard procedures, monitoring and sampling as resources permit. Recent cancellations by the government of Japan may impact Category 1 products. Some groups advocate for an import alert for all food and seafood from Japan. USDA notes Japan has not exported beef to the US since 2010 and is not eligible to export poultry or processed egg products. Concerns persist in Congress about contaminated foods entering the US. The United States is taking steps to address concerns about contaminated food imports from Japan. FDA and USDA are implementing enhanced import security measures, including radiation screening and tracking of FDA-regulated products. Prior notification of food imports is required under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. USDA and federal partners are preparing to sample food imports if necessary. The FDA and USDA, along with CBP border inspections, are implementing security measures to address concerns about contaminated food imports from Japan. CBP monitors for radiological materials in cargo shipments at all U.S. ports of entry, while FDA requires labeling and screening of food imports. Trade laws mandate marking imported articles with the country of origin. Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, food labels must contain specified information, including the country of origin statement. Laws administered by FSIS also require labeling requirements for meat and poultry products. Only plants in countries certified by USDA with equivalent inspection systems can export products to the United States. Regulations mandate that the country of origin must appear in English on immediate containers of all meat and poultry products entering the United States. The USDA-administered programs enforce country-of-origin requirements for food products entering the United States."
