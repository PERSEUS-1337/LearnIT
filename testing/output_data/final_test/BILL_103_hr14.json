    "content": "The \"Flight Attendant Duty Time Act\" is an amendment to the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, adding a new section regarding the duty time of flight attendants. The \"Flight Attendant Duty Time Act\" mandates the Secretary to establish duty time limitations for flight attendants within 60 days of enactment. Final regulations must be issued within 240 days, including a maximum of 14 hours duty time for domestic flights with 10 hours of rest, and 16 hours for international flights. Flight attendants have specific duty time regulations to follow, including a maximum of 16 hours of duty time for international flights with at least 12 hours of rest after each duty period. Long-range international nonstop flights have a maximum duty time of 20 hours, with rest periods twice the scheduled flight time. Additionally, flight attendants must have eight 24-hour rest periods at their domicile per month and a 24-hour rest period every 7 days. They are also entitled to a 1-hour rest break on flights scheduled for 8 hours or more. The Secretary must initiate rulemaking proceedings within a specific timeframe, or air carriers cannot operate aircraft with flight attendants exceeding duty time limits. The Secretary can modify these prohibitions for safety reasons. The Secretary must initiate rulemaking proceedings within a specific timeframe for air carriers to operate aircraft with flight attendants within duty time limits. The modifying regulations must be transmitted to the Senate and House committees before taking effect. Definitions include terms like air carrier, debriefing time, and designated rest area. The term 'duty time' refers to all time worked for an air carrier, starting at the required report time and ending at the conclusion of the debriefing time or when released by the carrier. Duty time includes deadheading, ferrying, and attending meetings. \"Duty time for flight attendants includes time spent ferrying, attending meetings, and in-flight rest periods. International flight is defined as any flight with take off or landing outside the 48 contiguous States and DC. Long-range international nonstop flight refers to a single nonstop international flight scheduled for 8 hours or more.\" The term 'report time' refers to the period before a flight attendant's duty period, 'rest' means uninterrupted time free from duty, 'scheduled flight time' is based on airline schedules, and 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is amended by adding to title VI. Sec. 614 outlines duty time regulations for flight attendants, including rulemaking proceedings, final regulations, mandated prohibitions, modification of prohibitions, and definitions."
