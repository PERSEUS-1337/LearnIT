    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Medical Device Innovation Act\" and includes recognition of standards. The \"Improving Medical Device Innovation Act\" amends Section 514(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow for the recognition of standards by submitting a request to the Secretary. The Secretary must respond within 60 days with a determination to recognize all, part, or none of the standard requested. The Secretary must provide a written response stating the rationale for determining the recognition of a standard, including scientific, technical, regulatory, or other basis. The Secretary is required to implement recognized standards and make the rationale for recognition publicly available. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, will review and update guidance on recognizing and withdrawing standards under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Employees of the FDA will receive training on using recognized standards for premarket submissions. The FDA will review standards under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to promote harmonization among regulatory authorities in the regulation of devices. SEC. 3. CERTAIN CLASS I AND CLASS II DEVICES. SEC. 3 amends Section 510(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt certain class I devices from reporting requirements for safety and effectiveness. Section 510(m) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to exempt certain class II devices from reporting requirements and to update classification regulations accordingly. The Secretary will publish a list of class II devices no longer requiring safety reports, allowing for a 60-day public comment period. Within 210 days of the Improving Medical Device Innovation Act, a final determination list will be published in the Federal Register. Upon publication of the final list under paragraph (1)(B), each class II device listed is exempt from reporting requirements under subsection (k) and the classification regulation for each device is deemed amended. Each class II device listed is exempt from reporting requirements under subsection (k) and the classification regulation for each device is deemed amended to incorporate such exemption. SEC. 4. CLASSIFICATION PANELS. The amendment to section 513(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act establishes requirements for classification panels reviewing specific medical devices.

Additionally, the panel review process includes providing a representative with the opportunity to address the panel individually to correct factual errors or provide clarifying information. The panel review process allows for corrections of factual errors or clarifying information by a designated representative during classification panel meetings. Adequate time is provided for initial presentations by the device owner and the Secretary, followed by open participation from all interested parties. During the panel review process, questions can be posed to the designated representative and their responses considered in the device review. SEC. 5. POSTMARKET PILOT TO IMPROVE MEDICAL DEVICE REPORTING. Within one year of enactment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish pilot projects with device manufacturers to explore alternative compliance methods for reporting medical devices. Participation in these projects will be voluntary for manufacturers. The pilot projects established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will test methods of reporting for different device types, prioritize devices with high report volumes, evaluate data monitoring and reporting to improve usability, and identify effective reporting methods. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish pilot projects to test reporting methods for various device types, prioritize high-volume devices, evaluate data monitoring for usability improvement, and identify effective reporting methods. The Secretary will notify Congress of manufacturer participation in the pilot projects within 18 months of the Act's enactment.
