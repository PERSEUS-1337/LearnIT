    "content": "Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 610, which establishes an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard for retail electricity and natural gas distributors. The new section SEC. 610 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 defines key terms such as 'base quantity' and 'CHP savings' related to energy efficiency standards for retail electricity and natural gas distributors. The new section SEC. 610 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 defines key terms related to energy efficiency standards for retail electricity and natural gas distributors, including the term 'new combined heat and power system' which uses the same energy source for generating power and thermal energy. The system must meet efficiency requirements set by the Secretary to qualify. The new section SEC. 610 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 defines key terms related to energy efficiency standards for retail electricity and natural gas distributors. It includes terms like 'new combined heat and power system' which must meet efficiency requirements to qualify. The term 'customer facility savings' refers to a reduction in end-use electricity or natural gas consumption at a facility compared to a base year. The facility's electricity generation should not exceed 50% of the total annual electric generation, and it must commence operation after June 30, 2007. The term 'electricity savings' refers to customer facility savings of electricity consumption, adjusted for any increase in fuel consumption, and reductions in distribution system losses achieved by a retail electricity distributor. The term 'natural gas savings' refers to customer facility savings of natural gas consumption, adjusted for any increase in electricity consumption, and reductions in leakage and operational losses in a gas distribution system achieved by a retail gas distributor. The term 'recycled energy savings' refers to reducing electricity or natural gas consumption by capturing wasted energy from industrial or commercial systems. Retail electricity or natural gas distributors deliver energy to consumers not affiliated with them. Retail electricity or natural gas distributors must submit data to the Secretary annually if they deliver more than 800,000 megawatt hours of electricity or 1,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Verified electricity or natural gas savings must meet specific requirements. Retail electricity or natural gas distributors must submit data annually to the Secretary if they exceed certain delivery thresholds. Credits issued under subsection (d) must be a percentage of the base quantity applicable to the calendar year. Electricity credits have increased annually from 0.5% in 2010 to 5% in 2015. Natural gas credits have also increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 2.5% in 2015. Retail electricity or natural gas distributors must submit data annually to the Secretary if they exceed certain delivery thresholds. Credits issued must be a percentage of the base quantity applicable to the calendar year. From 2015 to 2020, electricity credits increased from 5.0 to 10.0, while natural gas credits increased from 2.5 to 5.0. For calendar year 2021 and beyond, retail electricity or natural gas distributors must submit credits to the Secretary by March 31 of the following year. The Secretary will determine the percentage of credits based on regulations, not less than the 2020 percentage. Regulations for measuring and verifying electricity and natural gas savings must be established by June 30, 2009. The regulations for measuring and verifying electricity and natural gas savings must specify eligible energy efficiency measures, adjust consumption estimates for changes in weather and production levels, account for the useful life of electricity savings measures, include deemed savings values, and determine the extent of electricity savings. The regulations specify eligibility for credits based on electricity and natural gas savings from measures before July 1, 2007, exclude savings not properly attributable to the entity, and establish procedures for third-party verification. Credit regulations must be in place by June 30, 2009. The Secretary will promulgate regulations by June 30, 2009, regarding the issuance of credits, a national credit trading system, and independent monitoring of the market for credits. Limitations may be established on how retail electricity or natural gas distributors can achieve compliance with submitting credits for savings. The Secretary will issue credits for electricity or natural gas savings at facilities served by distributors, including new combined heat and power systems. Verified savings in a calendar year will be credited. The Secretary will issue credits for verified electricity and natural gas savings achieved by entities, with conditions on distributor payments and installation responsibility. The Secretary will issue credits for electricity and natural gas savings achieved by entities, with a fee charged for administrative costs. Entities receiving credits under this section can sell, transfer, or use the credits for compliance. The Secretary will charge a fee for administrative costs. Retail electricity or natural gas distributors have the option to pay a buyout fee instead of submitting credits to meet performance standards. The fee is $20 for each electricity savings credit or $2 for each natural gas savings credit. States can apply to administer and enforce energy efficiency programs. The Secretary may allow states to implement their own energy efficiency programs if they can achieve equivalent savings to the required standards. Retail distributors receiving credits must provide necessary information and access for enforcement. Enforcement of the energy efficiency program involves penalties for failure to submit required credits or buyout payments by retail electricity or natural gas distributors. Civil penalties of $100 per credit or payment not made may be assessed by the Secretary. The enforcement of the energy efficiency program includes penalties for non-compliance by retail electricity or natural gas distributors. Civil penalties of $100 per credit or payment not made may be assessed, with procedures outlined in the Federal Power Act. State laws regarding energy savings are not affected by this section."
