    "content": "The funding authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) expires on September 30, 2015, and the report discusses topics likely to arise during reauthorization debates in the 114th Congress. Most FAA programs are financed through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF). The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) was established in 1970 to expand the nation's airports and air traffic system. It provides 66.6% to 71.4% of FAA's annual funding through various revenue sources like passenger ticket taxes, air cargo fees, and fuel taxes. In 2013, the AATF had revenues of almost $12.9 billion with a cash balance of over $13 billion, but the uncommitted balance has decreased since 2001. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF) had a cash balance of over $13 billion in 2013, but the uncommitted balance dropped to $299 million in 2009 due to the global economic crisis. By the end of FY2014, the balance rebounded to $1.3 billion. The trust fund balance is projected to grow in the near term as revenue rises and airport capital needs decline. However, long-term concerns exist due to reductions in general fund appropriations to FAA and changes in airline business practices affecting AATF revenue. Airlines impose fees for various options and amenities, excluding them from the base ticket price to avoid federal excise taxes. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated potential revenue of $186 million in FY2009 from untaxed baggage fees. Airlines argue that general aviation operators, especially corporate jets, should contribute more to the trust fund, but general aviation interests disagree, stating that nonairline users already pay a fair share. Proposals to increase general aviation jet fuel tax in 2012 were not approved. The Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama Administrations proposed per-flight user charges, with President Obama suggesting a $100-per-flight charge on commercial and general aviation jets since 2011. The Senate considered a $25-per-flight fee in the 110th Congress, but none of these proposals became law. FAA funding, totaling between $15 billion and $16 billion annually, is divided among four main accounts, with Operations and Maintenance (O&M) receiving the largest portion for air traffic operations and aviation safety programs. The O&M account funds air traffic operations and aviation safety programs. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for airport projects. The Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account funds air traffic facilities and equipment. The Research, Engineering, and Development account finances research on aviation safety and efficiency. The federal government supports airport infrastructure development through the AIP. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for airport projects, including capital projects for aircraft operations. Airports can also assess a Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) on boarding passengers for various projects. Investors receive tax benefits on bonds issued for airport improvements. Airports can also use state and local funds, operating revenues, and different funding sources for specific projects. The funding sources for airport projects include state and local grants, airport revenues, tax-exempt bonds, and Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs). Different airports rely on various funding sources, with larger airports more likely to use bonds and PFCs. These funding sources come with legislative, regulatory, and contractual constraints. A 2007 study showed that bonds financed 50% of airport capital spending, AIP 29%, PFCs 17%, state and local contributions 4%, and airport revenue 4%. Assessing airport capital needs is crucial for determining federal support to maintain a safe and efficient national airport system. The U.S. passenger airline industry has undergone bankruptcies and mergers since 2000, leading to a reduction in commercial flights. Carriers have consolidated operations, resulting in a 15-18% decrease in flights since 2005. Airlines have shown capacity discipline by flying fuller planes, with an average load factor of over 83% in 2014. The reduced number of flights may alleviate pressure on airport and air traffic control facilities, but on-time performance has not significantly improved. The U.S. passenger airline industry has seen bankruptcies and mergers, leading to fewer flights. Despite consolidation, on-time performance has not improved, indicating ongoing capacity issues. FAA and ACI-NA have differing estimates for airports' long-term financial needs, with FAA projecting $42.5 billion and ACI-NA estimating $71.3 billion for FY2013-FY2017. The disparity in estimates is due to differing views on which airport projects to include. FAA's estimate is based on airport master plans and state system plans, screening out projects not justified by aviation forecasts or eligible for AIP grants. The FAA study includes only designated airports and projects justified by aviation forecasts or eligible for AIP grants. In contrast, the ACI-NA study includes a wider range of projects funded by PFCs, bonds, state or local funding, airport-funded air traffic control facilities, security projects, and AIP-ineligible projects. This leads to a higher estimate of capital needs by ACI-NA compared to FAA. The FAA focuses on evaluating capital needs at the largest airports, which handle the majority of commercial passenger boardings. The FAA has conducted studies to determine critical improvements at major airports to increase system capacity. The most recent study, FACT3, found that the air traffic system is more reliable with reduced congestion due to structural changes in the airline industry and runway expansions. While NextGen helps manage delays, new capacity solutions are still needed to address traffic growth and reduce delays at busy airports. The study projects interim and long-term airport capacity needs up to 2030. The FAA conducted studies to identify critical improvements at major airports for increased system capacity. The latest study, FACT3, showed that while capacity constraints have improved, several busy airports, including those in New York City, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, will remain constrained. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for airport development, focusing on aircraft operation improvements like runways and taxiways. Commercial revenue facilities and operating costs are not eligible for AIP funding, reflecting congressional priorities for airport safety. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) provides federal grants for airport development, focusing on safety, security, capacity, congestion reduction, noise mitigation, and financing for small airports. AIP grants do not require airports to take on debt financing, but a local match is needed. Limitations include project eligibility and adherence to regulations. The Secretary of Transportation publishes a biannual National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) to guide airport development. The AIP program requires airports to be listed in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) to receive funds. Grant funding for AIP has fluctuated over the years, with gaps between authorized spending levels and actual expenditures. The AIR-21 Act in 2000 increased AIP's authorization levels significantly. The AIP program, authorized by P.L. 106-181 in 2000, saw major funding increases starting in FY2001. Funding peaked at $3.47 billion in FY2008, with annual obligation limitations set at $3.515 billion from FY2008 to FY2011. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 authorized funding at $3.35 billion annually through FY2015. AIP grants are distributed through formula grants and discretionary funds, with entitlements apportioned first to specific airports before the remaining funds are allocated as discretionary funds for airport projects. The AIP program provides formula grants and discretionary funds for airport projects. Entitlements are apportioned by formula to airports and can be used for various improvement projects. Funds are divided into categories based on airport type, with different distribution formulas. Airports have up to three years to use their apportionments, with a higher limit for nonhub commercial service airports. Formula distributions depend on an annual AIP obligation limitation of $3.2 billion or more. The AIP program provides formula grants and discretionary funds for airport projects, with entitlements apportioned based on airport type and usage. For primary airports with over 10,000 passengers annually, funding is determined by passenger boardings in the prior year. The allocation ranges from $7.80 to $0.50 per boarding, with a minimum of $1 million and a maximum of $26 million. Additionally, 3.5% of AIP funds are allocated to cargo service airports. AIP funds are apportioned to airports based on various criteria, including passenger boardings and landed weight for cargo service airports. General aviation airports receive 20% of AIP funds, with the remaining funds distributed based on state population and area. FAA decides on project allocations in consultation with states. Alaska Supplemental Funds ensure Alaskan airports receive double the funding they did in 1980. Large and medium hub airports with low passenger facility charges have their AIP entitlements reduced until they give back a portion of their grants. Small airports receive discretionary grants from the forgone funds. The discretionary fund, comprising 12.5% of total AIP funding, includes money not distributed under apportioned entitlements and forgone PFC revenues. FAA approves discretionary grants based on project priority and selection criteria. Allocations are subject to set-asides for noise compatibility planning, military airport program, and other spending criteria. The discretionary fund, comprising 12.5% of total AIP funding, includes money not distributed under apportioned entitlements and forgone PFC revenues. FAA approves discretionary grants based on project priority and selection criteria. Allocations are subject to set-asides for noise compatibility planning, military airport program, and other spending criteria. Additionally, there is a set-aside for conversion and dual use of up to 15 current and former military airports, as well as grants for reliever airports in metropolitan areas suffering from flight delays. The Secretary of Transportation ensures that 75% of grants enhance capacity, safety, and security at primary and reliever airports, with $5 million set aside for testing innovative aviation security systems. The remaining 25% of grants are at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation through FAA. The FAA provides funds directly to participating states for projects at airports classified as other than primary airports through a block grant program. Participating states are responsible for selecting and funding AIP projects at small airports, complying with federal priorities. States in the state block grant program include Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. The federal government's share for AIP projects varies depending on the type of airport. The federal government's share for AIP projects at airports varies based on airport type. Large and medium hub airports receive 75% federal share (80% for noise projects), other airports receive 90%, states in the block grant program receive \"not more than\" 90%, airports with exemptions under 49 U.S.C. Section 47134 receive 70%, economically distressed communities may get up to 95% federal share. Smaller airports pay a lower share of project costs compared to larger airports. Smaller airports receive a higher percentage of AIP-funded project costs compared to larger airports, with the remaining share needing to be raised from other sources. Noncommercial airports are particularly reliant on AIP grants, receiving over 30% of grants in FY2012. Grant applications require assurances for future airport operations, such as public availability and fair economic practices. Assurances within the AIP context guarantee federal policy implementation for airports, extending obligations beyond project closure for up to 20 years. Airports can request release from AIP obligations by reimbursing grants or reinvesting in approved projects. Decisions on airport expansion projects, particularly runway projects at large and medium hub airports, have implications for the reauthorization of the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) in 2015. These projects can have long lead times and may require AIP funding in earlier years. If airports levy passenger facility charges, they may need to rely on AIP discretionary funds for runway projects. Constraints on the AIP budget in the future could impact funding for these projects. If the entitlement formulas remain unchanged during the appropriations process, the discretionary portion of the AIP budget may be limited, affecting large airports' capacity expansion projects. Congress could prioritize capacity enhancement at large and medium hub airports by adjusting AIP funds distribution, such as eliminating the requirement for airports imposing maximum PFCs to forgo part of their entitlement. This could deplete small airport funds but increase grants for larger airports. Alternatively, changes in discretionary fund set-asides could give FAA more flexibility for capacity enhancement, potentially reducing funding for noise mitigation and other purposes. Changes in FAA authorization acts have increased entitlements and expanded landside projects eligible for AIP grants, benefiting smaller airports. The increased apportioned funds have limited discretionary grants for major airports' operational evolution plan projects. Allowing large and medium hub airports to opt out of AIP and rely on PFCs for financing could reduce trust fund revenue needed for AIP. This could conflict with the goal of reducing congestion at major commercial airports. Some airports may choose to rely solely on Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) instead of Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding. This would require raising the federal cap on PFCs and could lead to airports being released from certain AIP grant assurances. The PFC was introduced in 1990 as a user charge to supplement AIP funding. Initially capped at $3 per passenger, the PFC allows airports to impose a fee on each boarding passenger. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) is a fee imposed by airports on boarding passengers, initially capped at $3 per passenger. The PFC funds must be used for eligible airport-related projects and can also be used to service debt. In 2000, the PFC ceiling was raised to $4.50 with an $18 limit per round trip. Airports must show that funded projects will improve air safety, increase competition, or reduce congestion or noise impacts to impose a PFC above $3. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) can be raised above $3 to fund projects improving air safety, competition, or reducing congestion. Large and medium hub airports forgo 75% of AIP formula funds when imposing PFCs above $3. Approval for PFCs at these airports requires a competition plan submission to the FAA. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 made changes to the PFC program, including allowing nonhub small airports to impose PFCs and requiring GAO to study alternative collection methods. The Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) revenues are used for landside projects like terminals and transit systems, as well as interest payments. PFC collections grew significantly from $85.4 million in 1992 to $2.9 billion in 2014. Air carriers are less involved in PFC project planning compared to AIP grants. The central legislative issue related to PFCs is whether to raise the $4.50 per enplaned passenger ceiling or eliminate it altogether. Airports advocate for increasing or eliminating the ceiling, while air carriers and some passenger advocates oppose higher limits on PFCs. A GAO study in January 2015 showed that raising the cap would significantly increase PFC collections available to airports, but could also marginally slow passenger growth. The GAO report suggests that higher PFCs could marginally slow passenger growth and revenue to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Airport operators want more freedom to use PFC funds for off-airport projects, while carriers complain about airports using funds for low-priority projects. Major carriers are also unhappy with their limited influence over project decisions. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) was established in 1996 to explore privatizing publicly owned airports in the United States. While privatization has been promoted as a way to improve efficiency and financial viability, participation in the program has been limited. Only two airports have completed privatization, with one later reverting to public ownership. The lack of interest in privatization among U.S. airports may be due to readily available financing for publicly owned airports and barriers to privatization. Airport privatization in the United States has been limited, with most cases falling under partial privatization. This involves outsourcing noncore operations to private firms, such as cleaning services and shuttle operations. Full privatization, either under or outside the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP), is rare. Outsourcing of cleaning, landscaping, shuttle operations, and concessions is common in U.S. airports. Management contracts involve private sector expertise for parking, terminal operations, and more. Developer financing and operation models, like DBFOM, are used for airport projects. Examples include Terminal 5 at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Passenger terminals, parking garages, and rental car facilities at airports can be privatized through long-term lease or sale to a private owner or operator. This involves transferring management and development control in exchange for capital improvements and other obligations. While several airports in Europe have been privatized this way, there have been no sales of commercial service airports in the United States. Airport privatization involves airport owners, private operators, and other stakeholders. Airport privatization involves four major stakeholders: airport owners (mostly local or regional governments), air carriers, private investors, and the federal government. These stakeholders have different objectives and interests. Passenger interests are not formally represented in discussions of privatization. Airport owners may see privatization as a revenue source, but federal regulations dictate that revenue must be used for airport purposes unless the majority of airlines agree otherwise. Privatization of airports involves surrendering control of a facility, potentially leading to loss of public-sector jobs. Public-sector owners may not benefit unless the airport is losing money. The APPP grants exemptions to encourage privatization, but airlines want to keep costs low and have control over revenue usage. Air carriers have an interest in well-maintained airports and may support privatization for lower charges and better services. Private investors seek financial returns through growth opportunities like additional flights, improved amenities, and increased freight traffic. The FAA is directed to engage private capital in aviation infrastructure development and reduce reliance on federal grants. They also have mandates to maintain safety and enforce compliance with grant assurances. Privatization proposals that may reduce aviation system capacity or favor certain users will be carefully examined. Stakeholders' divergent interests are a significant issue in privatization. The APPP aims to balance interests in privatization by exempting airports from certain requirements. Participation was initially limited to five airports but was increased to ten in 2012. Only one large hub commercial airport can participate by leasing, not selling, while general aviation airports can be sold under the program. The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) allows for the sale of general aviation airports. Since its inception, 10 airports have applied to enter the program, with two completing privatization. Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, NY, was the first commercial service airport privatized under the APPP in 2000 by National Express Group PLC. National Express Group privatized Stewart International Airport in 2000 under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program. Despite making a $10 million capital contribution, the company struggled to increase passenger traffic. Attempts to rename the airport and attract more passengers to New York City were met with local opposition. In 2006, National Express shifted its focus to school bus operations in the U.S. In 2006, National Express decided to focus on school bus operations in the U.S. and sold its lease on Stewart International Airport to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for $78.5 million. The Port Authority reported losses of $0.8 million in 2007 and $5.5 million in 2008 while operating the airport, indicating it may not have been profitable for the private owner. National Express, however, made a profit of \u00a316.2 million on the sale, suggesting a significant return on investment. Juan, Puerto Rico, is the only commercial service airport operating under private management after privatization under the APPP. Aerostar Airport Holdings paid $615 million upfront to the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and agreed to a $1.2 billion capital plan, including a $200 million terminal reconfiguration. The only airport currently seeking privatization approval under the APPP is Hendry County Airglades Airport in Clewiston, FL, which received preliminary approval from the FAA in October 2010. Airglades International Airport LLC, controlled by owners of adjacent sugar plantations, plans to build an additional runway and a perishable air cargo complex near the airport. The APPP slot reserved for a large hub commercial airport was once held by Chicago Midway Airport, which was leased to private investors in a $2.52 billion, 99-year deal with MIDCo consortium. The lease agreement for Chicago Midway Airport was terminated in 2009 due to financing issues during the global economic crisis. MIDCo had to pay a $126 million penalty to the city. A renewed effort to lease Midway was abandoned in 2013, leading to the city suspending plans for privatization. The City of Chicago withdrew its privatization application in 2013, opening up the APPP slot for a large hub airport. The APPP program has not been successful in generating widespread interest in airport privatization due to time-consuming processes. The FAA process for transferring airports from public to private ownership is time-consuming and risky, taking years to complete. The application process involves submitting a preliminary application with privatization objectives, financial statements, and a request for private operators to submit proposals. FAA has 30 days to review the application. The FAA process for transferring airports to private ownership involves submitting a preliminary application with privatization objectives and financial statements. Once an airport receives preliminary approval, it may select a private operator, negotiate an agreement, and submit a final application to FAA. After FAA gives notice of its proposed approval in the Federal Register, there is a 60-day public review period. Airport privatization under the APPP has regulatory requirements that may lessen interest in privatization. Airport privatization under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) has regulatory requirements that may reduce interest in privatization. These requirements include the need for approval from 65% of air carriers, restrictions on rate increases exceeding the CPI, and compliance with previous grant assurances. Additionally, privatized airports are eligible for only 70% of AIP grants for improvements, serving as a disincentive due to receiving less federal funding post-privatization. In surface transportation, privatization aims to attract private capital to supplement insufficient public spending for construction and maintenance. Publicly owned airports have access to five major sources of funding, including federal grants from the AIP for planning and development, passenger facility charges, tax-exempt bonds, tenant leases, landing fees, and state and local grants. These funding sources support capital projects related to aircraft operations and other improvements on airport property. The financing arrangements for airport privatization have implications on funding sources. Privatized airports outside the APPP may not receive AIP formula funds and would have to rely on their own resources for improvements. Private operators would not have access to federal tax-exempt bonds, leading to higher interest rates. However, they would have more flexibility in imposing fees and charges. Privatized airports under APPP would still have access to federal grants but with a higher matching requirement. The operator of a privatized airport in the United States would need to provide a 30% match for funding, pay higher interest rates on bonds, and face limitations on fees and charges due to federal laws. This contrasts with Europe and Canada where airport privatization has been more successful, partly because major airports there were previously owned by national governments. In Europe and Canada, airports privatized were previously owned by national governments, simplifying the decision-making process. Unlike the US, the tax benefits for debt issued by state and local governments are not common in other countries, reducing borrowing costs in privatization. Congress aims to save money and increase aviation capacity through airport privatization, but current federal laws hinder these goals. Privatization outside the APPP framework is unappealing due to higher financing costs and potential investor disinterest. Privatization under the APPP framework may not benefit public-sector owners or air carriers, except in cases of financial loss or capital project needs. Private investors face limitations on earning money from privatized airports due to restrictions on fees. Streamlining the APPP process could make privatization more attractive by reducing risks. Privatization may become more appealing by streamlining the process and reducing risks. Structural changes to airport financing, such as equal tax treatment for private and public airport bonds, could further increase interest in airport privatization. Privatization of airports could be made more attractive by changing AIP requirements, relaxing grant assurances, and liberalizing rules governing fees. These changes may increase private investor interest but could impact federal revenues and aviation system capacity and safety. Privatization of airports could be more appealing to investors by increasing facility charges and raising rents and landing fees. However, this may face opposition from airlines and lead to higher costs for passengers and air cargo shippers. Easing limits on the use of privatization revenue could stimulate government interest in privatization but may result in lower investment in aviation infrastructure. Noise from aircraft is a concern at many airports, with regulations in place to assess environmental impacts, including noise, associated with airport projects and airspace redesigns. Noise has been a contentious issue in airspace redesign in the New York City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia region. The redesign of airspace in the New York City, New Jersey, and Philadelphia region has raised noise concerns, as seen in airport expansion projects like the new runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in 2013. The number of residents in the US exposed to significant aircraft noise has decreased significantly over the years, with major reductions achieved through phasing out louder Stage 2 airliners and implementing quieter noise standards for jet airplanes. The FAA is also planning to introduce even more stringent Stage 5 noise standards. The FAA, in collaboration with NASA and industry, has invested in research for quieter aircraft technologies, resulting in significant noise reductions. Despite advancements, air traffic volume has increased around major airports. Congress historically allocates 35% of AIP funding for noise mitigation within DNL 65 dB areas. Proposals suggest granting FAA flexibility to fund projects in lower DNL areas. The FAA is considering granting flexibility to fund noise mitigation projects in areas with lower DNL levels, which could support additional abatement projects but may divert resources from capacity and safety projects. NextGen is a modernization initiative to improve air traffic technologies and procedures for increased capacity, with full-scale implementation targeted by 2025. NextGen aims to enhance air traffic management by reducing separation, improving spacing and sequencing of aircraft, utilizing airspace and airports more efficiently, providing tailored weather forecasts, and reducing environmental impacts. The Vision 100 Act established the JPDO to develop and implement NextGen to meet projected air traffic demands by 2025. The JPDO released the Integration National Plan for NextGen in 2004, aiming to transform the national airspace system by 2025 to meet safety, security, mobility, efficiency, and capacity needs. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 refined NextGen implementation, establishing the Chief NextGen Officer position and requiring strategic objectives for NextGen planning and development. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated the acceleration of NextGen technologies deployment at airports, with specific performance metrics to be tracked by the FAA. It also required reviews of ADS-B ground system installation and enterprise architecture for NextGen. Additionally, the act authorized the evaluation of airport surveillance technologies for NextGen airport surface operations management. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandated the acceleration of NextGen technologies deployment at airports, with specific performance metrics to be tracked by the FAA. It also required reviews of ADS-B ground system installation and enterprise architecture for NextGen. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 defunded the JPDO for FY2014 and directed FAA to absorb the JPDO's functions into its operations account under the NextGen and operations planning activity. In May 2014, FAA moved the JPDO functions into a newly created NextGen Interagency Planning Office. The NextGen concept integrates air traffic control infrastructure with aircraft navigation and communication devices, originating from cargo airlines' efforts to develop low-cost collision avoidance and tracking technologies using GPS. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, developed by UPS Aviation Technologies in the 1990s, played a key role in the development of ADS-B technology, now a core component of the NextGen system. UPS Aviation Technologies was later acquired by Garmin Ltd., a major supplier of GPS navigation devices and advanced avionics for small to midsized general aviation aircraft. Additionally, in 1999, FAA initiated the Capstone Program in Alaska to explore the safety benefits of GPS, ADS-B, and advanced avionics for general aviation operations. The FAA created an Operational Evolution Plan (OEP) in 2001 to address future capacity needs in aviation, focusing on busy airports and airspace. The plan included technology solutions like RNAV procedures, WAAS for GPS accuracy, controller-pilot data link, and reduced vertical separation. NextGen, a $1 billion annual initiative, is a comprehensive plan to modernize air traffic control by replacing radar with GPS for precision navigation and aircraft tracking. It builds on earlier FAA initiatives like WAAS and controller-pilot data link technologies to increase operating flexibility and efficiency in routing aircraft. The NextGen program, funded by over $1 billion annually through the FAA's Facilities and Equipment account, includes core components such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B). This system broadcasts and receives aircraft data like identification, position, altitude, heading, and speed using GPS receivers. ADS-B Out transmits position data, while ADS-B In allows aircraft to receive signals from other aircraft and ground stations for traffic, weather, and flight information. FAA funds support the installation and maintenance of the ground network for ADS-B transmissions. Most aircraft will be required to have ADS-B Out functionality. The NextGen program includes core components like ADS-B Out capability for aircraft by 2020, SWIM for data sharing, DataComm for digital voice and data network, and CATMT for enhancing aircraft flow management. NextGen includes automation tools and decision support systems to improve aircraft flow management, leveraging technologies like SWIM. NVS upgrades voice communications infrastructure, NextGen Weather provides a common weather picture. FAA modernization initiatives are crucial for NextGen, with ERAM program seen as a key milestone. The FAA has implemented performance-based navigation procedures to improve airport access and operational efficiency for NextGen. Most air carrier fleets are equipped with PBN navigation equipment, allowing the use of NextGen procedures like RNAV. However, a small percentage of the general aviation fleet is equipped for NextGen, with stakeholder reluctance being a major challenge for FAA in implementation. The FAA faces stakeholder reluctance in adopting NextGen technologies due to uncertainties about technical details and benefits. In May 2010, FAA mandated aircraft operators to equip with approved ADS-B Out equipment by 2020, rejecting the no-action alternative to accommodate increasing air traffic. A cost-benefit analysis of the final rule for a uniform equipment mandate in air traffic control identified benefits of $6.8 billion to $8.5 billion over 2009-2035, including time and fuel savings, CO2 emissions reductions, and increased system capacity. Costs ranged from $3.3 billion to $7.0 billion, with avionics equipage costs estimated at $2.5 billion to $6.2 billion. FAA noted potential disproportionate impacts on small U.S. business operators. The FAA estimated that small operators would struggle to recover compliance costs, with over 1,500 facing costs exceeding 1% of annual revenues. Additionally, more than 1,000 operators would incur costs exceeding 2% of annual revenues. The total costs to general aviation were estimated to be between $1.2 billion to $4.5 billion. The FAA proposed a \"best-equipped best-served\" concept to incentivize early investment in NextGen technologies, offering benefits such as preferential treatment in flight routing. ADS-B technology could also provide benefits, especially to small general aviation aircraft, by providing pilots with traffic and weather data. The FAA plans to promote potential benefits of NextGen technologies, including robust traffic and weather data for small general aviation aircraft. There is no formal policy on best-equipped best-served practices, with implementation varying by region and airport. NextGen technologies are expected to improve efficiency and safety for both commercial and general aviation operators, reducing time, fuel burn, and environmental impacts. Commercial airlines will benefit from more direct routing and reduced flight delays under NextGen. The FAA has implemented a best-equipped best-served model for commercial operators using NextGen technologies, providing priority access to certain airports and flight routes. This results in fuel savings, improved customer satisfaction, reduced operational costs, and environmental benefits. General aviation operators will also benefit from improved airspace and airport access with NextGen-equipped aircraft. The FAA developed the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in 1995 to improve navigational accuracy for civil aviation. WAAS consists of ground stations that correct GPS signals and transmit them to satellites for broadcast to WAAS-enabled GPS devices on aircraft. This system allows for instrument approaches to airports using WAAS and GPS for lateral and vertical guidance, providing access to thousands of airports under various weather conditions. WAAS and GPS provide lateral and vertical guidance for aircraft, allowing access to additional airports in poor weather conditions. FAA has published over 3,000 approach procedures using this technology, with plans for over 5,000 by 2016. These procedures enable pilots to descend to 200 feet above ground in 1.5-mile visibility before establishing visual contact with the runway, reducing diversions and fuel costs. WAAS maintenance costs are significantly lower than traditional ILS systems, with no ground equipment to maintain. WAAS eliminates the need for ground equipment maintenance at airports. Costs mainly involve upkeep of runway lighting and markings for approach certification, and addressing impacts of new structures near the approach path. While not a core NextGen technology, WAAS enables precision airport approach procedures. ADS-B In functionality, along with WAAS-enabled navigation equipment, offers benefits to operators. FAA ground stations transmit TIS-B and FIS-B data for free to equipped aircraft. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 established a general aviation equipage fund to enhance safety by improving pilot situation awareness. NEXA Capital Partners anticipates making $550 million available in capital for general aviation equipage financing over the next 10 years through low-cost loans to qualified aircraft owners. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 established a general aviation equipage fund to improve safety by enhancing pilot awareness. NEXA Capital Partners plans to provide $550 million in low-cost loans over the next decade for aircraft owners to equip their planes with NextGen avionics, addressing concerns about safety improvements and funding challenges for NextGen infrastructure development. Total costs for NextGen infrastructure are estimated to be between $14 billion to $22 billion. The cost to upgrade the civilian aircraft fleet with NextGen avionics could range from $14 billion to $20 billion. Estimates suggest that equipping aircraft may cost less than $12 billion initially, with potential cost reductions as equipment is mass-produced. However, there are concerns that costs could increase significantly if schedules are delayed and decisions on technical specifications are not made promptly. The DOT OIG warns that some NextGen capabilities may not be fully implemented until 2035 or later, potentially exceeding the projected total cost estimate of $40 billion. Global harmonization of equipment and procedural standards, especially with European air traffic management initiatives, is also a policy concern. Consolidation of FAA air traffic facilities aims to control costs, replace outdated facilities, and improve services. Efforts have focused on TRACON facilities in major metropolitan areas, with recent projects expanding consolidation across larger geographical areas. The FAA is consolidating air traffic control functions across larger areas, replacing outdated combined tower/TRACON facilities with separate tower-only designs. TRACON components are being relocated to consolidated facilities, potentially leading to outsourcing of operations at low-activity towers under the FCT program. This consolidation plan has faced controversy due to ongoing evolution and concerns raised by FAA labor unions. The FAA is in the early stages of planning for consolidating air traffic control functions into large integrated facilities. This effort includes realignment and consolidation of services and facilities, which could result in job changes and modernization under the NextGen system. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required the FAA to develop a report with recommendations for this consolidation. The FAA is planning to consolidate air traffic control functions into large integrated facilities, including realignment and consolidation of services and facilities. The report will justify proposed actions, projected cost savings, and timelines. Congress will have the opportunity to approve or disapprove recommendations, with 252 U.S. airports with control towers operated by private firms. The FAA maintains responsibility for regulating and overseeing operations and safety at all civil air traffic control towers in the United States, with some towers funded by local governments. The cost-share program allows communities to retain control towers when federal costs outweigh benefits. The program, established in 1982, has an annual budget of around $140 million, including funding for 16 cost-share towers. The FCT program was established in 1982 to provide air traffic services at low-activity towers after the air traffic controller strike. It grew to 160 towers by 1997, with Congress funding a cost-sharing program in FY1999 to maintain contract tower operations with nonfederal funds. The FCT program, established in 1982 after an air traffic controller strike, funds contract tower operations with nonfederal funds. Congress limits the local share to 20% of a tower's costs. Currently, 16 towers are funded at $10 million annually. This could expand program eligibility but may lead to tower closures in communities unable to contribute. A 2012 audit found contract towers cost $1.5 million less annually than FAA-staffed towers due to lower staffing levels and controller pay. The audit compared contract towers to FAA towers, noting lower controller pay at contract towers. Contract towers had fewer reported safety incidents. FAA proposed closing up to 238 control towers due to budget cuts, including 149 FCT program towers. On March 22, 2013, FAA announced the closure of 149 FCT program towers, but Congress passed the Reducing Flight Delays Act of 2013 to prevent it. A bipartisan group of Senators urged FAA to fully fund the contract tower program, leading to the cancellation of the closures. The FCT program has been fully funded since then. The FAA canceled planned tower closures after Congress fully funded the FCT program. Technologies like in-cockpit situation awareness and remote air traffic services could mitigate safety impacts of closures. ADS-B technology in NextGen may provide affordable situation awareness capability for general aviation aircraft. The FAA will require most aircraft to have ADS-B Out capability by 2020, but there is no mandate for ADS-B In. Remote towers could offer services currently provided by airport towers, potentially leading to air traffic facility consolidation. The potential next step in air traffic facility consolidation involves using data from systems like ADS-B and surface radar to reduce staffing costs. An act of arson at FAA's Chicago air traffic control center in 2014 highlighted security risks posed by employees with facility access, emphasizing the importance of redundancy in operations. The FAA's air traffic control facilities have faced criticism for their physical and cybersecurity measures. Congress has debated whether air traffic services should be provided by an independent entity instead of the FAA. Two main alternatives proposed are corporatization and privatization of the air traffic control system. Many countries have already moved their air traffic control operations to private entities. In the United States, privatization proposals for air traffic control have faced obstacles related to funding and borrowing costs. User fees have been opposed by general aviation interests, and Congress has refused to permit them. The ability to borrow in financial markets is seen as an advantage, but an independent entity would face higher borrowing costs without federal backing. The FAA has taken some steps towards privatizing certain functions. The FAA has taken steps towards privatizing certain functions, including air traffic control operations at airports without radar control and contracting out work at flight service station facilities. They have also increased the use of design-build-maintain contracts for installing and maintaining air traffic control equipment. Recent changes in the controller selection and hiring process have been controversial and may be debated during reauthorization. In February 2014, the FAA implemented a new nationwide vacancy announcement and evaluation process for air traffic control hiring, open to all qualified U.S. citizens aged 18-31. The process now evaluates all applicants using a single set of criteria, requiring prior applicants to reapply, including those who had passed the AT-SAT exam. Under the FAA's new hiring process implemented in February 2014, applicants for air traffic control positions are now evaluated using a biographical assessment as the first step. This assessment, developed by the FAA, is a valid predictor of job performance and is unbiased in terms of gender and ethnicity. Only applicants who score above a specified level on the assessment and meet other job requirements are invited to complete the AT-SAT exam. Conditional job offers are given to those who achieve high scores on the AT-SAT, pending medical evaluations and background checks. The FAA's new hiring process for air traffic control positions includes a biographical assessment to identify successful candidates. Approximately 8% of applicants passed the assessment, with 1,600 receiving job offers. The process aims to improve workforce diversity and reduce hiring costs. However, concerns have been raised by colleges participating in the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative. AT-CTI students had a higher chance of receiving conditional offers in February 2014, but not all were eligible under the new selection process. FAA data show AT-CTI graduates have a slightly higher success rate in completing training. FAA intends to continue the AT-CTI program but may make modifications. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 was enacted in response to concerns over regional airline safety. It required FAA to make regulatory changes addressing pilot fatigue, qualifications, training, oversight, and crew resource management. FAA issued new regulations in December 2011 to change flight and duty time limits for passenger airline flight crews. The FAA issued new regulations in December 2011 for passenger airline flight crews, setting duty limits based on various factors and requiring a minimum 10-hour rest period between duty periods. Air carriers must implement fatigue risk management programs. The regulations also include new qualification standards for first officers and revisions to airline training programs and safety management systems. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-216) mandated changes to airline pilot flight time and rest requirements, including limitations on flight and duty time, fatigue risk management plans, and airline transportation pilot certificate requirements for all flight crewmembers within three years. These changes were made to address concerns over regional air carrier operations. The FAA implemented new regulations on Flightcrew Member Duty and Rest Requirements in response to the Colgan Air crash in 2009. These regulations, effective since 2014, prescribe flight crew rest and duty time for passenger airlines based on various factors. Compliance is optional for all-cargo carriers under Part 121 regulations. Pilot organizations advocate for uniform fatigue regulations, while the FAA and airline industry argue that air cargo operations have different safety standards. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 required pilots to attain the airline transportation pilot rating before being hired as airline first officers. FAA issued a final rule on Pilot Certification and Qualification Requirements for Air Carrier Operations in 2013, mandating all pilots operating under Part 121 to hold an airline transportation pilot certificate. The Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated pilots to have an airline transportation pilot certificate for air carrier operations. This requirement has led to a decrease in the supply of qualified first officers at regional airlines. However, pilot labor organizations argue that low wages are the main reason for the shortage. FAA data shows a 5% increase in certificated airline transport pilots in the past decade, but it is uncertain if this growth can meet the industry's demand. The GAO found mixed evidence on the supply of qualified pilots to meet airline needs, estimating 1,900 to 4,500 new hires annually over the next decade. Pilot employment and earnings have decreased since 2000, indicating that demand does not exceed supply. However, fewer students are entering pilot training programs, and opportunities overseas or in corporate aviation may divert pilots from lower-paying regional carriers. Concerns about tracking technologies on passenger aircraft were raised after incidents involving Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in 2014. The crash site of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in the Java Sea took days to locate despite GPS tracking technologies. Air traffic control relies on ground-based radar, but FAA's NextGen initiative aims to use GPS for tracking. However, this system is limited to the US and cannot track aircraft over remote areas. Pilots provide position reports during transoceanic flights beyond radar coverage. ACARS is a satellite-based messaging system used for position reports during flights. Airlines can configure ACARS communications differently, with some transmissions not including aircraft position data. One option is to use more frequent position reports or continuous streaming of aircraft position information for flights over oceans and remote regions. Challenges include bandwidth limitations and costs. In 2014, Inmarsat developed a global solution. In May 2014, Inmarsat began offering global tracking of aircraft using ADS-C signals at no cost. However, ADS-C updates are received every 15 minutes, leaving uncertainty in aircraft location. Aireon, a joint venture by NAV CANADA and Iridium Communications Inc., aims to provide global air traffic surveillance using low-orbit satellites. Aireon, a joint venture by NAV CANADA and Iridium Communications Inc., plans to offer worldwide air traffic surveillance using low-orbit satellites by 2017. The system will track flights in remote Canadian airspace and can be used for real-time global flight tracking. Aircraft will need ADS-B equipment for this service, which transmits position data primarily based on GPS. Additionally, other aircraft communication links like ACARS could transmit critical aircraft status information to aid first responders and investigators in locating downed aircraft and reconstructing incidents, such as the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Some U.S. military aircraft have deployable flight recorders that eject before impact, aiding accident investigators. Legislation proposed deployable recorders on commercial aircraft for extended-range operations, combining cockpit voice and flight data recording capabilities. The U.S. Department of Transportation would reimburse carriers for the cost. The U.S. Department of Transportation proposed reimbursing carriers for purchasing and installing deployable flight recorders on commercial aircraft for extended-range operations, but the proposals were not enacted. U.S. air carriers are increasingly outsourcing aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) to contain costs. MRO activities include Airframe Heavy Maintenance and Engine Repair and Overhaul, which are labor-intensive processes. Aircraft maintenance involves repair and overhaul of components essential for flight, as well as regular line maintenance checks. U.S. airlines have increasingly outsourced MRO activities to reduce costs, with maintenance accounting for nearly 10% of operating expenses. In 2008 and 2009, major U.S. airlines collectively spent $10.2 billion and $10.1 billion on maintenance, respectively. Prior to 2001, most airlines conducted the majority of maintenance work in-house. The percentage of outsourced maintenance work has increased from 20% in 1990 to over 44% in 2011, with major airlines like Northwest, United, Delta, and U.S. Airways eliminating in-house capabilities through bankruptcy. Aircraft engine work is outsourced to North America or Western Europe, while labor-intensive heavy maintenance is often done in Asian and Pacific countries like China. All airlines outsource some maintenance, with newer carriers outsourcing a large part of their maintenance. The share of passenger carrier MRO outsourced work is likely to grow, with concerns about safety and quality control at foreign repair stations. Airlines are interested in ensuring the quality of outsourced maintenance. Airlines prioritize high-quality outsourced maintenance to prevent delays and cancellations. Data from Airlines for America shows a decrease in maintenance-related accidents despite increased outsourcing. Safety remains a top priority in the airline industry. The study from 1996 to 2008 found no link between airline maintenance outsourcing rates and aircraft accident rates. Regulatory standards may be needed to ensure sufficient FAA-certified mechanics at foreign repair facilities. Enhanced reporting requirements for air carriers could help the FAA assess maintenance practices. The FAA regulates maintenance of U.S. air carrier aircraft at foreign and domestic locations through Part 145 repair stations. Repair stations must have FAA-approved documentation and processes. Foreign repair stations can be approved based on a certification from a country with a bilateral aviation safety agreement with the U.S. Airframe and engine manufacturers are also becoming MRO providers globally. The MRO industry is evolving towards global standardization, leading to potential offshoring of maintenance practices. This shift may impact the role of regulators like the FAA, which currently reviews and recertifies foreign repair stations annually. The FAA reviews and recertifies foreign repair stations annually, while domestic repair stations can retain certification indefinitely unless prompted by specific safety concerns. Foreign repair stations have more stringent regulatory requirements compared to domestic ones, but do not have the same requirements for certification of supervisors and authorized individuals. Inspections of foreign repair stations are conducted by foreign regulatory entities under bilateral agreements and a multilateral agreement with the EU. The FAA has limited resources to inspect foreign repair stations, with only 100 inspectors overseeing almost 700 foreign repair stations. Realigning the inspector workforce may help increase oversight of foreign repair facilities used by U.S. air carriers. The FAA has limited resources to inspect foreign repair stations used by U.S. air carriers. Realigning the inspector workforce based on language proficiency and cultural familiarity may be necessary to better oversee maintenance practices. FAA inspectors ensure that work at foreign repair stations complies with regulations and carrier procedures, but improvements are needed in targeting inspections and relying less on incomplete reporting. The DOT OIG found that FAA's maintenance outsourcing and air carrier audits varied in quality. FAA relied heavily on air carriers' initial audits of repair stations, leading to inconsistencies in surveillance activities. Systematic problems like inadequate mechanic training and outdated tool calibration were identified at both foreign and domestic repair stations. Foreign regulatory agencies play a crucial role in overseeing maintenance on U.S. air carrier aircraft overseas through bilateral aviation safety agreements. The U.S. has agreements with about 28 countries, including a comprehensive one with the EU. Formal procedures for coordination of repair station oversight have been in place with Canada since 2000. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 addressed concerns over bilateral aviation safety agreements, requiring appropriate inspections of foreign repair stations and annual inspections consistent with international agreements. FAA also mandates English proficiency for certificated mechanics and repairmen. Repair stations must ensure that supervisors and inspection personnel understand, read, and write English, but there is no formal requirement for specific English-language skills. FAA certification is not mandatory for working at a repair station, and there are no formal regulations on the number of certificated personnel at foreign repair stations. Maintenance manuals and aircraft systems are increasingly in English only. Aircraft maintenance at foreign repair stations may not require English-language skills for less technical tasks like interior refurbishing and airframe painting. However, technical tasks such as diagnosing and repairing advanced avionics on computerized aircraft systems with English-only interfaces do require a working knowledge of technical English. Many foreign countries have their own drug and alcohol testing programs for safety-related positions at repair stations, in line with ICAO aviation safety standards. Despite international efforts for global harmonization in drug and alcohol testing programs in the aviation industry, differences exist due to privacy laws and other limiting factors. The FAA has yet to issue final rules for controlled substance testing of employees in foreign repair stations, citing the need for additional coordination. The FAA has not issued a final rule for on-airport collision risk, citing the need for additional coordination. Safety measures implemented include investments in airport lighting, signage improvements, surface radar, runway status lights, and Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS) at airports. The FAA implemented safety measures such as airport lighting, signage improvements, surface radar, runway status lights, and EMAS at airports to reduce collision risks. P.L. 112-95 mandated the development of a strategic runway safety plan by the FAA, which includes national goals, actions, and a review of runway safety at all commercial service airports in the US. The plan also involves tracking and investigating runway incidents and deploying systems to alert air traffic controllers and pilots of potential runway incursions as part of the NextGen implementation. The FAA's Strategic Runway Safety Plan, published in November 2012, utilizes data collection and analysis tools to identify and mitigate safety risks in airport surface movements and terminal area operations. Specific actions include installing runway status lights at 23 large airports by 2016 and EMAS at airports without standard runway safety areas. The FAA is working on implementing NextGen technology to improve runway safety, including alert systems for controllers and pilots. Congress may need to address surface movement safety in the development of NextGen. The integration of drones into national airspace has been slow due to safety concerns, such as avoiding other air traffic. The FAA mandated a test site program to study drone integration issues in airspace shared with manned flights. Six test sites were selected in December 2013, with test flights underway. The test sites must provide data to the FAA without receiving funding. Additionally, the FAA set up a demonstration project in the Arctic for commercial UAS systems certification. The agency is also in the process of selecting universities to form a Center of Excellence for UAS research, with grant support of at least $500,000 annually over 10 years. The 2012 act required the FAA to issue final rules for civilian drones under 55 pounds. The FAA is still pending publication of a proposed rule on small UASs, with a deadline of May 2015. In the absence of regulation, the FAA has approved exemptions for certain small UAS operators. Some staff members claim the agency is compromising safety oversight by pressuring inspectors to approve applications. The FAA is facing challenges in regulating small model aircraft and drones, with pressure to streamline approval processes and growing impatience from potential users. Incidents of drones flying close to airports have raised safety concerns, while enforcement of policies regarding unmanned aircraft remains difficult. Enforcing FAA policies on unmanned aircraft, including drones, has been challenging despite available enforcement tools like warnings and fines. In a 2012 case, FAA fined a drone operator for reckless flying, but a judge later ruled the craft was a \"model aircraft\" with no applicable regulations at the time. The NTSB eventually reversed the ruling, but FAA may struggle to regulate commercial drone operators until final regulations are in place. Commercial space launches in the United States account for 17% of global totals, with competition from Russia, France, and China. The FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation regulates and licenses providers, but its dual mandate as a safety regulator and industry promoter has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. The FAA's authority covers the launch and reentry of space vehicles. The FAA's authority covers launch and reentry of space vehicles, with nine active launch site licenses and proposed spaceports. Since 1989, over 230 space launches have been licensed, including suborbital human spaceflights. FAA is responsible for regulating launch activities and overseeing mishaps like the SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise test flight accident and the Orbital Sciences CRS Orb-3 Antares rocket launch accident. Issues during FAA reauthorization may involve liability of commercial space operations and regulation of experimental test flights. The FAA oversees commercial space operations and human spaceflight regulation, including liability insurance requirements. The federal government may cover valid claims beyond insured amounts up to $1.5 billion in 1989 dollars. Insurance amounts are set to cover maximum probable losses, averaging around $100 million per launch. The insurance market may provide additional coverage up to $500 million per launch, reducing federal government risk. The GAO recommended that FAA reassess its methods for determining commercial space launch insurance requirements. In 2006, FAA issued regulations for human spaceflight requirements, limited to high-risk design features. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 allows for more comprehensive regulations after FY2015. The FAA has broad authority to regulate human spaceflight. There is a need to streamline certification processes and address delays in approvals. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 aimed to improve certification processes and reduce regional inconsistencies. The FAA faces delays and backlogs in certifying NextGen equipment, with a lack of performance measures and inconsistent regulatory interpretation. Efforts to standardize processes include establishing a regulatory consistency committee to address root causes of inconsistencies: unclear requirements, inadequate training, and a culture resistant to change. The FAA committee recommended improvements in guidance, training, oversight, and communication for certification activities. However, there has been no independent assessment of progress or effectiveness of revised practices. Regulatory revisions to streamline certification processes are still pending. FAA Research and Development focuses on aviation system safety, efficiency, and environmental impacts, with funding split between modernization, safety, and energy/environmental projects. The FAA's Research, Engineering, and Development Advisory Committee (REDAC) advises on research needs in operations, airport technology, aviation safety, human factors, and environment and energy. FAA is required to develop an annual national aviation research plan, with recent annual research funding around $300 million and projected to rise to $350 million by FY2018. About 56% of FAA research funding is designated for specific research areas. FAA research funding is primarily designated through the Research, Engineering, and Development account, with authorized funding at $168 million annually through FY2015. This account supports research activities at various FAA facilities and academic research programs. Additionally, FAA research activities are also funded through the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account, with about 29% of research funding allocated to this account for advanced technology development. The Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account funds research for advanced technology development, including the Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) managed by the MITRE Corporation. Some research funding comes from the Airport Cooperative Research and Development program and the Airport Technology Research Program, derived from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). P.L. 112-95 called for specific research initiatives on unmanned aircraft systems and airfield pavements, as well as the creation of new centers of excellence for NextGen technologies. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-504) granted airlines freedom to choose which domestic markets to serve and directed research on various aviation technologies and environmental impacts, including unleaded aviation fuels, alternative jet fuel sources, clean coal jet fuel, wake vortices, volcanic ash avoidance, weather hazards, and cabin air technology. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-504) granted airlines freedom to determine domestic markets and airfares. Concerns arose about small communities losing service, leading to the establishment of the EAS program to ensure service with subsidies if needed. The program is administered by the DOT to specify service requirements for eligible communities. The EAS program, established to ensure service for small communities, has been limited over the years by Congress. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 introduced additional reform measures, including defining an \"EAS eligible place\" based on daily enplanements. To be EAS-eligible, a community must have participated in the program between September 2010 and September 2011. Since October 1, 2012, new communities cannot enter the EAS program if they lose unsubsidized service. Eligibility criteria include being more than 70 miles from a large or medium hub airport, requiring a subsidy of $200 or less per passenger, and having an average of 10 or more enplanements per service day. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program has limitations for communities in the contiguous 48 states and Puerto Rico, with exemptions for Alaska and Hawaii. Funding for the program comes from overflight fees and annual appropriations. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 authorized appropriations for EAS funding, with the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 providing $155 million for FY2015. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program receives funding from overflight fees and annual appropriations. The program subsidizes air service for 160 communities, with subsidies ranging from $7 to over $980 per passenger. The Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a tentative order in 2014 to enforce the 10-enplanement criterion, potentially affecting 13 communities. The Department of Transportation (DOT) issued waivers to 12 out of 13 communities affected by the 10-enplanement criterion, allowing them to remain EAS-eligible for FY2015. Additionally, DOT proposed an enforcement policy on the $200-per-passenger subsidy cap for communities near hub airports, impacting 62 out of 114 EAS communities. The Small Community Air Service Development Program, established under AIR-21, provides grants to improve air service at small hubs or airports. The Small Community Air Service Development Program, funded at a lower level in recent years, has awarded 365 grants since FY2002. Despite a drop in new grant applications, the program still faces more funding requests than available. GAO testimony indicates mixed results, with less than half of grants achieving their goals. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) manages Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport under a 50-year lease authorized by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986. MWAA is governed by a 17-member board of directors appointed by Virginia, Washington DC, Maryland, and the President. MWAA is responsible for airport operations, maintenance, the Dulles Toll Road, and funding the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project. The federal government has restricted air traffic at Reagan National Airport to reduce congestion and promote growth at Dulles Airport. FAA controls the number of slots available for takeoffs and landings at Reagan National. Laws like AIR-21 and Vision 100 increased slots and exemptions to the perimeter rule, allowing for more flights beyond 1,250 miles. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required the expansion of the Metrorail system to Dulles Airport and Loudoun County, VA. Dulles Airport has been struggling with declining domestic traffic, while Reagan National Airport has seen steady growth in recent years. Dulles' high cost per enplanement of $26 has been identified as a factor making it less competitive than Reagan National, which has a cost per enplanement of $14. Dulles Airport's high cost per enplanement of $26 has led to declining domestic traffic, while Reagan National Airport's lower cost of $14 has fueled steady growth. MWAA approved a new agreement to shift revenue from DCA to offset costs at IAD and implement a $1 billion capital construction program at DCA. MWAA's management and policies have faced criticism from state and federal authorities, with concerns raised about contracting practices, ethics, hiring, and transparency. Reports by the DOT OIG highlighted questionable transactions in federal grants for the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project. Congress plays a key role in defining and enforcing airline passenger rights. Congress has intervened in issues related to passengers' rights, such as incidents of passengers being held aboard planes. DOT issued rules on tarmac delays in 2010, with language on this subject incorporated into the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The DOT Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings monitors airline compliance and enforces rules and regulations. The DOT Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings enforces rules and regulations, negotiates consent orders, and fines violators. In 2012, record figures of 49 consent orders were issued, with $3,610,100 in civil penalties assessed. Factors considered for civil penalties include harm caused, compliance disposition, financial condition, violation duration, and case strength. Large air carriers face a maximum penalty of $27,500 per violation, while small businesses or individuals face a maximum of $1,100, with higher penalties for discrimination and unfair practices. Since the deregulation of the domestic airline industry in 1978, the federal government no longer controls airlines' prices or routes. Contracts of carriage, which are the rules airlines apply to passengers, are not federally reviewed or approved. The DOT Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings enforces rules, negotiates consent orders, and fines violators for violations such as discrimination and unfair practices. If necessary, a civil penalty and consent order may be sought, with the possibility of an enforcement hearing before a DOT administrative law judge. The deregulation of the domestic airline industry in 1978 removed federal control over airlines' prices and routes. Contracts of carriage, which are the rules airlines apply to passengers, are not subject to federal review or approval. Airlines have responded to intense price competition by \"unbundling\" their offerings and charging separately for services that were once included in the ticket price, leading to consumer complaints about fees for checked baggage, early boarding, seat changes, and treatment of passengers on delayed or canceled flights. Section 407 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required a study on delays in checked baggage delivery and recommendations for compensating passengers for unreasonable delays. The GAO report, released on June 14, 2012, found that DOT data do not distinguish between delayed baggage and other mishandled baggage types. Mishandled baggage reports have decreased since 2008 when airlines started charging for checked bags. FAA conducted a study on the impact of cell phone use during flights in scheduled passenger air transportation. The FAA conducted a study on cell phone use on aircraft in 2012 and is revising it based on public comments. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 established an advisory committee for aviation consumer protection. Major carriers have increasingly utilized code-share agreements with regional airlines for passenger service improvements. Regional airlines often use code-share agreements with mainline carriers, allowing them to use flight designator codes, logos, and participate in joint promotions. These agreements account for over half of all scheduled passenger flights, with major airlines like American, Delta, United, and US Airways operating 61% of their flights through code-share agreements in 2011. While the Department of Transportation requires transparency in disclosing the operating airline, confusion still exists among passengers due to varying disclosure methods by carriers, travel agencies, and advertisers. Oversale or overbooking is common practice in the airline industry. When a flight is oversold, airlines must ask for volunteers to give up their seats before involuntarily bumping anyone. The Department of Transportation has rules in place to ensure that passengers are properly informed and compensated for involuntary bumping. In April 2011, the DOT issued an amended final rule to address issues related to denied boarding compensation. The April 2011 amendment increased denied boarding compensation rates and dollar limits, with adjustments every two years for inflation. If a passenger is involuntarily bumped and the substitute transportation arrives more than one hour later than the original time, compensation rules apply. Domestic flights require 200% of the one-way fare with a $650 maximum for arrivals between one and two hours later. International flights have a threshold between one and four hours. Flights departing the United States have a threshold of one to four hours for compensation. If substitute transportation is delayed more than two hours on domestic flights (four hours on international flights) or not arranged, compensation doubles to 400% of the one-way fare, with a $1,300 maximum. Airlines must refund unused optional fees for denied boarding. Ticket prices include various components such as optional and mandatory fees, taxes, and charges. To ensure transparency and fairness in airline pricing, a 2011 DOT rule mandates that airlines must include all government taxes, mandatory fees, and optional surcharges in their advertised airfare. This rule applies to both domestic and international markets, requiring carriers to disclose the full price, including all fees and surcharges, in their advertising, on their websites, and on the passenger's e-ticket confirmation. Airlines must disclose all fees for optional services through a prominent link on their home pages and on e-ticket confirmations. Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Air, and Southwest Airlines challenged a DOT rule requiring airlines to display the total cost of a ticket, including taxes, in their advertising. The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the airlines' argument that the rule violated their rights to engage in commercial and political speech. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld a rule requiring airlines to display total ticket costs, including taxes. The House passed a bill allowing airlines to highlight base airfare, with separate disclosure of taxes and fees. The Senate did not act on the legislation. Coverage for terrorist attacks and war risks became challenging post-9/11. After the 9/11 attacks, coverage for war risks became difficult for airlines to obtain from private insurers. Congress passed expansions of the FAA Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, offering U.S. airlines coverage with premiums based on pre-9/11 costs. The federal program provided extensive coverage with broad definitions of war risk losses. The program was extended multiple times through appropriations legislation, with the last extension in 2014. Most U.S. airlines purchased FAA coverage until then. In 2014, U.S. airlines started moving away from government insurance for war risks due to increased private insurance capacity and lower prices. Three claims were filed under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, with minimal payouts. Premiums paid were deposited in a fund at the Treasury, with over $2 billion invested in U.S. Treasury securities. The statutory cap on premiums left past amounts insufficient to cover all risks, such as those from the September 11 attacks. The September 11 attacks caused $5.6 billion in aviation losses. Changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program were proposed but not accepted by Congress in 2014. The program aimed to provide coverage for war risk losses from nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological events. In 2015, Congress terminated the expanded preclearance program proposed by the Administration. These facilities, operated by CBP in foreign airports, allow for customs and immigration clearance before departure to the U.S. This makes airports more appealing to U.S.-bound travelers by avoiding delays upon arrival. The first preclearance facility was established in Toronto in 1952, with additional locations since then. The CBP established preclearance locations at Toronto Pearson International Airport in 1952, with additional locations in Canada, Ireland, the Caribbean, and the UAE. Currently, there are 15 airport preclearance locations in operation. The newest location in Abu Dhabi International Airport faced opposition from some U.S. air carriers, labor unions, and Members of Congress due to concerns about competitive disadvantages. The U.S.-EU Open Skies agreement allows airlines to offer international air services between signatory jurisdictions. Norwegian Air International's application for a foreign air carrier permit has sparked controversy. Norwegian Air Shuttle, a major European discount carrier, operates nonstop flights to the U.S. under this agreement. Norwegian Air Shuttle applied for NAI, an Irish-registered airline, to operate transatlantic flights to the U.S. The delay in approval by the DOT is unprecedented, as most EU carriers are approved within weeks. The controversy surrounds NAI's plan to use crew members from various countries, potentially violating labor standards in the U.S.-EU open skies agreement. Labor groups, airlines, and Members of Congress oppose NAI's use of low-wage crew members from third countries. Norwegian Air Shuttle's application for NAI, an Irish-registered airline, to operate transatlantic flights to the U.S. has faced controversy over the use of low-wage crew members from third countries.

Congress passed provisions prohibiting approval of a foreign air carrier permit that would violate labor standards in the U.S.-EU open skies agreement. The controversy may reappear with other low-fare airlines interested in offering transatlantic service.

Legislative proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to prevent the DOT from changing regulations on foreign ownership of U.S. carriers. Virgin America, now 49.9% owned by Delta Airlines, limits voting shares owned by non-U.S. citizens. Lufthansa holds 16% of JetBlue's shares. Calls for increased foreign ownership in the airline industry have decreased as financial stability has improved post-recession.
