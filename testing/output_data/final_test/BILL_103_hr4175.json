The term 'pass-thru entity' includes partnerships, S corporations, regulated investment companies, and common trust funds. The limitation on gain exclusion applies based on the taxpayer's interest in the entity when the qualified zone asset was acquired. In the case of the sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership or stock in an S corporation that was a small urban enterprise zone business, the qualified capital gain is determined without considering intangible assets, non-essential land, or gain before the area was designated as an urban tax enterprise zone. Transfers of qualified zone assets are treated as acquisitions by the transferee. Transfers of qualified zone assets, whether by gift, at death, or from a partnership to a partner, must meet certain requirements including acquiring the asset in the same manner as the transferor and holding it for a continuous period. Rules similar to section 1244(d)(2) apply for these transfers.

Part IV. Exclusion for capital gain from new investments in small businesses in urban empowerment zones and enterprise communities. Part V. Regulations. Effective Date: The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
