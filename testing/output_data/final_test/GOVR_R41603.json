    "content": "Biomass energy, or bioenergy, is gaining attention as an alternative to fossil fuels due to its potential to reduce environmental impacts, enhance energy security, and support economic development. Biomass, such as woody biomass, agricultural biomass, and animal wastes, can be converted into energy like heat, electricity, or liquid fuels. Biopower, a form of bioenergy, involves generating electricity from biomass sources like paper mill residues. Stakeholders, including government agencies, environmentalists, and biomass producers, are increasingly focusing on the carbon-neutrality of biopower to ensure minimal greenhouse gas emissions throughout its life cycle. Biopower's carbon neutrality is debated, with some arguing it is carbon neutral due to biomass carbon absorption, while others claim it is not due to higher GHG emissions compared to fossil fuels. This debate may impact legislative support for biopower among renewable energy sources. The debate over biopower's carbon neutrality intensifies due to differing perspectives on GHG emissions from biomass fuels compared to fossil fuels. Congressional decisions and executive actions may impact the designation of biopower as carbon neutral. Factors considered include assumptions, technologies, and time frames. The carbon cycle involves various pathways for exchanging carbon between the atmosphere and land/water. Human activities contribute CO2 to the cycle, with energy production being a significant source. If excess carbon is not stored in sinks, atmospheric CO2 levels rise, potentially affecting climate. The carbon cycle can be classified as carbon-positive, carbon-negative, or carbon-neutral. In the biopower arena, there is no universally accepted definition for carbon neutrality. Various assertions have been made regarding biomass energy being carbon neutral, including the idea that if biomass is carbon neutral, then any product resulting from its use is also carbon neutral. Biomass energy is considered carbon neutral if the net life-cycle emissions are zero. Biomass energy is considered carbon neutral if the net life-cycle emissions are zero. However, issues arise due to GHG emissions released during biomass cultivation and management. Differences in carbon cycles between bioenergy and fossil fuel systems include carbon source and atmospheric carbon concentration. Additional plantings may be required to offset CO2 emissions from biomass energy production. GHG emission accounting for biopower is crucial for comparing its environmental impact with fossil fuel operations. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) is used to calculate the environmental footprint by evaluating emissions and resource depletion. Factors affecting carbon emissions from biopower generation include feedstock production, transport, and technology type. Conducting GHG emission accounting has been a topic of discussion for years. An LCA is a crucial tool for assessing GHG emissions in the biopower pathway, focusing on emissions and fossil fuel consumption. It can help in evaluating preferred energy approaches but may not be the sole deciding factor due to financial objectives and policy goals. GHG accounting with an LCA can be done at each phase of the biopower pathway, including biomass cultivation, electricity generation, and end use. The bulk of GHG emissions in the biopower pathway occur during the first three phases: cultivation and harvest, transport, and electricity generation. Published LCAs for biopower are limited and tailored to specific feedstocks and technology types, leading to varying results based on assumptions like the time frame of the assessment. Combustion and gasification are the main biopower technology types studied in LCAs. The two main biopower technology types are combustion and gasification. Combustion technology is currently in commercial use for co-firing biomass with coal, while gasification technology is still in the development phase. Biopower has been shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based electricity generation in various assessments, with some studies ranking it as one of the top bioenergy pathways for emission reduction and fossil energy replacement. Some LCAs of electricity production from biomass have a cradle-to-gate time frame. There are debates about the accuracy of LCAs in assessing the carbon impact of bioenergy, with concerns about land use and biomass accounting. Discussions also involve the comparison of biofuel and fossil fuel systems using existing methodologies. The discussion on global food and feed requirements considers increased productivity and the carbon-neutrality issue of biomass for bioenergy. EPA's standards for greenhouse gas emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, are key factors. President Obama's Climate Action Plan directed EPA to propose standards for CO2 emissions from power plants, leading to the final rule in August 2015. The EPA released the final rule for CO2 emission reductions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), in August 2015. States must achieve state-specific CO2 emission-reduction goals by 2030, with the option to include renewable energy like biopower in their plans. There is uncertainty about which forms of biomass will be accepted by the EPA for inclusion in state plans, raising questions about the role of biopower in implementing the CPP. The EPA released draft frameworks in 2011 and 2014 to evaluate GHGs from biomass energy. The 2014 framework addresses SAB recommendations and focuses on carbon flux in bioenergy production stages. EPA seeks public comment and SAB review for the frameworks. The EPA released a 2014 framework to evaluate GHGs from biomass energy, considering the minimal atmospheric impact of waste-derived feedstocks and forest byproducts. Stakeholders view the framework as a precursor for EPA's treatment of biogenic emissions in power plant standards and permitting requirements. EPA has not determined the framework's application yet. The EPA released a 2014 framework for evaluating GHGs from biomass energy, but has not determined its application yet. The EPA requested a peer review of the framework by the SAB, which previously reviewed the agency's 2011 biogenic accounting framework. The SAB found that \"carbon neutrality cannot be assumed for all biomass energy a priori.\" The SAB acknowledged the challenges of assessing GHG implications of bioenergy within EPA's regulatory boundaries. They recommended revising the biogenic accounting framework based on factors like time scale, spatial scale, and leakage. The SAB highlighted uncertainties and technical difficulties in quantifying components of the framework and suggested an alternative approach based on feedstock category, region, land management, and prior land use. The CAA's PSD/New Source Review program requires preconstruction review and permitting for new major stationary sources or major modifications. The Clean Air Act requires new and existing facilities emitting GHG pollutants to obtain permits for preconstruction review. In 2011, EPA deferred PSD and Title V permitting for CO2 emissions from bioenergy sources for three years to study the science behind biogenic emissions. In 2013, a court decision vacated the deferral rule. In 2013, a court decision vacated the EPA's deferral rule on CO2 emissions from bioenergy sources. The EPA may consider certain types of biomass as a best available control technology (BACT) after considering environmental, energy, and economic factors. States, with EPA guidance, determine BACT on a case-by-case basis for facilities applying for PSD permits. EPA provided specific guidance on considering the unique GHG attributes of biomass as fuel in the BACT selection process. The EPA is assessing the GHG classification for biogenic CO2 sources, facing legal challenges without clear guidance. Congress's bioenergy policy lacks carbon accounting, creating uncertainty for biopower regulation. The EPA may need clearer direction from Congress to fulfill bioenergy legal requirements in a timely manner, including a predetermined timeframe for issue resolution. Carbon neutrality for biopower is accurately calculated based on various parameters over a specified time period, such as feedstock type, management, transportation, energy generation technology, and feedstock replenishment. The carbon flux of biomass feedstock varies based on type, management, and transportation. Different feedstocks like agricultural and woody biomass have varying GHG emissions. Harvesting methods also impact carbon emissions. Transporting feedstock emits GHGs based on distance and fossil fuel usage. Biopower generation technology's carbon flux depends on these factors. The carbon flux of biopower generation technology depends on the type of technology, emission capture, and biomass feedstock replenishment time frame. An LCA for each biopower operation is necessary to determine carbon neutrality, incorporating biomass replenishment and measuring carbon flux at each phase. Standardizing biopower LCAs could ensure consistent GHG accounting, although multiple LCAs can be costly and time-consuming. The carbon neutrality of biopower remains a contentious issue in the bioenergy sector. Biopower's carbon neutrality is a controversial aspect of the bioenergy debate due to concerns about unsustainable biomass harvests and air quality around plants. These concerns can be addressed through sustainability requirements and air-quality regulations at federal and state levels. Congressional oversight may be needed to further analyze biopower's carbon status. Congressional oversight is necessary for recent and upcoming developments related to biopower, including the EPA's decisions on \"qualified biomass\" for the CPP and accounting for biogenic CO2 emissions. Biopower production involves various feedstocks and technologies, each with its own environmental impact. Analyzing carbon neutrality requires considering feedstock replenishment, CO2 removal rates, and technological advancements. Federal regulations address air quality, public land use, and water discharges in biopower plants. Congress may use existing legislative powers to address carbon accounting for biopower. Congress may need to reevaluate the carbon-neutral assumption for biopower and consider additional carbon accounting to align with legislative goals. This could impact renewable energy, agricultural, and environmental objectives. The debate on carbon neutrality for biopower may extend to other energy ventures, potentially slowing the achievement of multiple goals. Biopower's carbon accounting uncertainty may hinder investment and expansion. Stakeholders suggest a national RES or CES to meet energy and environmental goals, potentially relying on biopower for baseload power. Carbon-neutrality designation for biopower may need clarification. Biopower's carbon-neutrality designation may need clarification in response to environmental and sustainability concerns within an RES or CES framework."
