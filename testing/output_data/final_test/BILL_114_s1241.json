    "content": "The \"Enhanced Grid Security Act of 2015\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. It includes definitions for key terms. The \"Enhanced Grid Security Act of 2015\" provides definitions for key terms such as Department (referring to the Department of Energy), Electric utility, ES-ISAC (Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center), National Laboratory, Secretary (referring to the Secretary of Energy), and Sector-specific agency. The Department of Energy is designated as the lead Sector-Specific Agency for cybersecurity in the energy sector, in accordance with a Presidential policy directive. Additionally, there is a cybersecurity research, development, and demonstration program for the energy sector. The Secretary, with input from various stakeholders, will implement a program to develop advanced cybersecurity applications and technologies for the energy sector. This includes identifying and addressing vulnerabilities related to critical infrastructure dependencies, weather impacts, and fuel supply. Additionally, the program aims to enhance the security of field devices and third-party control systems in various aspects of the electric grid. The program aims to develop advanced cybersecurity applications for the energy sector, including forensic analysis of infected systems and secure communications. It also focuses on leveraging electric grid architecture to assess risks, conducting pilot projects with new technologies, and creating workforce development curricula for energy sector cybersecurity. The Secretary will implement a program to identify vulnerabilities in energy sector supply chain products, oversee third-party cybertesting, and develop procurement guidelines. The Secretary will carry out a program to enhance emergency response capabilities, coordinate with other agencies and industry, expand cooperation with intelligence communities, improve monitoring tools for the energy sector, increase industry participation in ES-ISAC, and provide technical assistance to small electric utilities for cybermaturity assessment. Additionally, a program will be implemented to identify vulnerabilities in energy sector supply chain products, oversee third-party cybertesting, and develop procurement guidelines. The Secretary will develop an advanced energy security program to protect energy networks, including electric, natural gas, and oil operations, from threats like electromagnetic pulses and geomagnetic disturbances. This program may involve identifying vulnerabilities, predicting impacts of events, and enhancing national grid security. The Secretary will develop a program to protect energy networks from threats like electromagnetic pulses and geomagnetic disturbances. This includes developing a maturity model for physical security and cybersecurity, conducting exercises to identify vulnerabilities in the electric grid, researching hardening and recovery solutions for critical components, and providing technical assistance for standards and risk analysis. SEC. 8. LEVERAGING EXISTING PROGRAMS.\n\nThe programs established under this Act will align with the Department's 2011 report on energy delivery systems cybersecurity, existing Department programs, and a strategic framework connecting researchers, utilities, manufacturers, and private industry.\n\nSEC. 9. STUDY. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant entities, will conduct a study to explore expanding industry participation in ES-ISAC. A report on the study's results will be submitted to Congress. Additionally, $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2022 to carry out this Act."
