    "title": "AB 815",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Board of Equalization amends Section 8670.40 of the Government Code to collect a fee for regulatory costs related to oil spill prevention. The fee shall not exceed $0.065 per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is imposed on the owner of crude oil or petroleum products received at a marine terminal via any mode of delivery passing through state waters. The fee is collected by the marine terminal operator for each barrel received. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is imposed on the owner of crude oil or petroleum products received at a refinery within the state via any mode of delivery passing over, across, under, or through state waters. The fee is collected by the refinery for each barrel received. There is a rebuttable presumption that crude oil or petroleum products received at a marine terminal or refinery have passed over, across, under, or through state waters. This presumption can be challenged by showing evidence that the products did not pass through state waters, such as shipping documents or transportation receipts. The State Board of Equalization will not accept petitions for redetermination or claims for refund of fees based on whether crude oil or petroleum products passed through state waters, as per the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law. The State Board of Equalization forwards appeals of redetermination or refund claims for fees related to crude oil or petroleum products passing through state waters. Refinery or marine terminal operators remit fees on the 25th day of the month based on the barrels received. No fee is imposed if already collected by a registered operator or paid to the State Board of Equalization. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is not collected by a marine terminal operator or refinery operator if it has already been paid at another location. An owner of crude oil or petroleum products is responsible for the fee until it is paid to the State Board of Equalization, but payment to a registered operator relieves the owner from further liability. The administrator annually prepares a plan projecting revenues and expenses over three fiscal years, setting the fee to match expenses. A surplus may be allowed for contingencies. The adjusted fee rate is notified to the State Board of Equalization and deposited into the fund. The State Board of Equalization collects fees for oil spill prevention programs, research, environmental studies, emergency response equipment, and facilities. The fees are deposited into a fund for these specific purposes. The State Board of Equalization collects fees for oil spill prevention programs and wildlife care network funding. The fund cannot be used for spill response or loans to other funds. Definitions for \"barrel\" and amendments to the Revenue and Taxation Code are included. Section 46101 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require registration for those operating refineries, marine terminals, or pipelines for oil transportation in or out of the state. The Legislature intends for the State Board of Equalization to collect the oil spill prevention fee only upon the first delivery of crude oil or petroleum products to a refinery or marine terminal, not on subsequent movements of the same products."
