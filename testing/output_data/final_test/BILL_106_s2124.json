    "content": "Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to focus on public school repair and renovation. Congress finds that it would cost $112 billion to improve the condition of the nation's school facilities, with 60% of schools needing extensive repairs. The average age of school buildings is 42 years, and schools in high-poverty areas tend to have older buildings. Research shows a positive correlation between school condition and student achievement. The Federal Government should provide assistance to high-need communities for school repair and renovation, as some States and communities struggle to meet the burden of providing adequate school facilities for all students, especially in areas with large proportions of students living on Indian lands. The purpose of this title is to help high-need local educational agencies with urgent repairs and renovations to public school facilities to reduce health and safety issues for students and enhance their learning environment. Authorized activities include addressing violations of fire codes and improving student learning conditions. The grant or loan funds under this title must be used for repairing or replacing essential school infrastructure such as roofs, electrical wiring, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. Additionally, repairs and renovations must comply with accessibility requirements for individuals with disabilities. Other urgent school repairs and renovations deemed necessary by the Secretary to ensure the health and safety of students and staff are also eligible. The Secretary will not approve a grant or loan application unless the applicant proves they lack funds from other sources for necessary repairs or renovations, including those that violate fire codes. \"SEC. 12004. Grants to local educational agencies with high concentrations of students living on Indian lands.\" The Secretary will award grants to local educational agencies to support authorized activities.

Each eligible agency must submit an application. Local educational agencies seeking grants must submit an application detailing fund usage, facility maintenance plans, and other required information. Grant funds can be used to construct a new school if replacing an existing one in poor condition is more cost-effective. \"Grants are available to high-poverty local educational agencies for various purposes.\" The Secretary will provide grants to local educational agencies with poverty rates of 25 percent or higher for school repairs and renovations. Criteria for awarding grants include poverty rate, need for repairs, and fiscal capacity. Agencies must submit applications detailing their urgent repair needs and fund usage plans. The agency receiving grants must provide information on how funds will be used for school repair and renovation, demonstrate fiscal need, outline maintenance plans for repaired facilities, and provide any additional information required by the Secretary. \"SEC. 12006.

The Secretary's direct loans for fiscal year 2001 are capped at $7,000,000,000 or the amount specified in an appropriations Act. \"SEC. 12009.
