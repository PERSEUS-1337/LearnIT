    "content": "From April 1991 to December 1998, UNSCOM and IAEA worked to verify Iraq's compliance with ending WMD programs and establish monitoring. Iraq accepted a monitoring program in 1993, but confrontations over access to suspected WMD sites led to resolutions requiring disclosure and access. Iraq impeded inspectors from entering certain facilities during 1996-1997. Iraq impeded UNSCOM inspections, leading to resolutions demanding cooperation and threatening travel restrictions on Iraqi officials. In response to Iraq's actions, travel restrictions were imposed, and the possibility of unilateral U.S. military action was backed as a last resort. In response to Iraq's obstruction of UNSCOM inspections, the House adopted H.Res. 322 supporting U.S. military action as a last resort. Russia and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan brokered temporary compromises in 1997 and 1998, allowing inspections to resume. Resolution 1154 accepted an agreement for access to presidential sites, with threats of consequences if Iraq failed to comply. Iraq allowed inspections in March-April 1998 but later refused to complete UNSCOM's work, leading to restrictions and sanctions reviews. In August 1998, the Senate and House passed a resolution declaring Iraq in \"material breach\" of the ceasefire. The Security Council demanded full inspections access and suspended sanctions reviews. Iraq's refusal to cooperate led to a U.S. policy of regime change. After UNSCOM reported Iraq's obstruction of inspections in December 1998, a U.S. and British bombing campaign (Operation Desert Fox) targeted Iraqi WMD-capable facilities. Resolution 1284 was adopted in December 1999 to suspend sanctions if Iraq cooperated with UNMOVIC inspections. Hans Blix was appointed head of UNMOVIC in January 2000. In January 2000, Hans Blix was appointed head of UNMOVIC, a staff of about 60 reviewed WMD-related documents and imagery, interviewed informants, and scrutinized civilian imports in Iraq. Concerns over Iraq's WMD capabilities arose after the September 11 attacks, leading to debates on expanding the \"war on terrorism\" to Iraq. The House passed a resolution in December 2001, calling Iraq's refusal to readmit U.N. inspectors a threat to peace and security. In early-mid 2002, the Bush Administration built a case for preemptive action in Iraq based on claims of WMD possession and ties to terrorist groups. Despite not explicitly authorizing military action, the Administration argued that regime change would lead to democracy in Iraq and hinder terrorist recruitment. President Bush hinted at military action in a speech before the United Nations on September 12, 2002. In 2002, President Bush hinted at military action in a speech before the United Nations, leading to Iraq pledging to admit UNMOVIC inspectors. Congress passed a resolution authorizing the use of U.S. armed forces against Iraq, and the Security Council adopted Resolution 1441, declaring Iraq in breach of resolutions and initiating new inspections. In 2002, Resolution 1441 declared all sites in Iraq subject to inspections by UNMOVIC, granting them the right to interview Iraqis in private and freeze activities at suspect sites. Iraq accepted the resolution in a defiant letter on November 13, 2002, and inspections began on November 27, 2002. Inspectors had full access to about 450 sites, and Iraq submitted its declaration on December 7, 2002. After Iraq submitted its declaration on December 7, 2002, the Bush Administration claimed there were material omissions, leading to further breaches of Iraq's obligations. Blix criticized the declaration for lacking new information but did not deem it a material breach. Despite Iraq's incomplete compliance with Resolution 1441, there was some substantive disarmament, including the destruction of Al Samoud II missiles. The United States, Britain, and Spain called for a Security Council vote to set a short deadline for Iraq to comply. After unsuccessful diplomacy, the US, Britain, and Spain withdrew their resolution for Iraq to cooperate with disarmament. President Bush issued an ultimatum for Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq, leading to military action on March 19, 2003. US-led forces took control of Iraq by mid-April, with no confirmed finds of WMD after search operations. After unsuccessful diplomacy, the US, Britain, and Spain withdrew their resolution for Iraq to cooperate with disarmament. President Bush issued an ultimatum for Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq, leading to military action on March 19, 2003. US-led forces took control of Iraq by mid-April, with no confirmed finds of WMD after search operations. Following this, the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) took over the mission to uncover any WMD in Iraq. Led by Brig. General Joseph McMenamin, the ISG consisted of civilian technical experts, including former UNSCOM inspectors like David Kay and Charles Duelfer. Their task was to investigate the relationship between Saddam Hussein's regime and Al-Qaeda. The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) focused on uncovering information about Saddam Hussein's regime, Al Qaeda, and WMD programs in Iraq. David Kay presented an \"Interim Progress Report\" in October 2003, highlighting evidence of hidden programs but no confirmed findings of weapons. The Administration shifted resources from WMD search efforts in late October 2003. The Administration shifted resources from WMD search to counterinsurgency missions, leading David Kay to resign before completing the search. Kay testified that U.S. pre-war intelligence on Iraq's WMD was mostly wrong and that Iraq violated Resolution 1441. Duelfer later briefed committees, stating the ISG had not made new breakthroughs. The ISG released \"The Duelfer Report\" in September 2004, stating that Iraq lacked actual WMD stockpiles but retained the intention to resume production. Three U.S. personnel investigating a tip on a hidden chemical facility were killed in a bombing in April 2004. The Duelfer Report revealed that Iraq did not possess WMD stockpiles but had the intention to restart production. Saddam's regime exploited loopholes in trade agreements to procure items for WMD efforts. UNMOVIC continued research post-Saddam but had no access to Iraq. The U.S. did not involve UNMOVIC or the IAEA in the post-conflict WMD search in Iraq. The U.S. did not involve UNMOVIC or the IAEA in the post-conflict WMD search in Iraq, despite both bodies expressing interest in a formal role. Blix retired from UNMOVIC and criticized the U.S. for being impatient and disregarding contradictory intelligence on Iraq's WMD. UNMOVIC's work was terminated by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1762, but Resolution 687's ban on Iraq acquiring WMD remains. U.N. Resolution 1546 lifted restrictions on Iraq importing conventional weaponry. The ISG findings and discrepancies in pre-war assertions led to inquiries after Saddam Hussein's fall. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, inquiries were made into the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Iraq's pre-war WMD. The CIA compared pre-war intelligence to actual on-the-ground WMD findings. Six inquiries were conducted, including an internal CIA inquiry and a bipartisan commission led by Charles Robb and Laurence Silberman. The bipartisan commission led by Charles Robb and Laurence Silberman has started meeting to investigate the U.S. intelligence community's pre-war assessments of Iraq's WMD. The Senate Intelligence Committee released a critical report on the intelligence community's misinterpretation of evidence, citing \"group think.\" The report did not find evidence of officials pressuring CIA analysts but highlighted a lack of sources close to the regime. The intelligence community lacked sources close to the regime and relied heavily on information from Iraqi exiles with vested interests in US military action against Saddam Hussein. Some officials cited the ISG's interim report to suggest WMD programs in pre-war Iraq. General James Clapper suggested Iraq may have moved WMD materiel to Syria before the war, but no other officials have presented evidence to support this theory. The failure to find substantial WMD in Iraq has led to renewed debate over the justification for the 2003 invasion. Secretary of State Powell expressed uncertainty about recommending invasion if he had known the true state of Iraq's WMD programs. Most senior officials, including the President, believe that Saddam's intentions to restart WMD programs justify the war. The justification for the war in Iraq was based on the belief that Saddam Hussein intended to restart WMD programs. U.S. assessments highlighted Iraq's expertise and intention to rebuild its nuclear program, with concerns raised about aluminum tubes that could be used in a nuclear weapons program. The issue of aluminum tube procurement remained open as the tubes found did not match precise Iraqi specifications. The justification for the war in Iraq was based on the belief that Saddam Hussein intended to restart WMD programs, including a nuclear program. Concerns were raised about Iraq's attempt to procure uranium from Africa, but the IAEA found the documents to be \"not authentic.\" The White House admitted in July 2003 that the allegation should not have been included in the State of the Union speech. The IAEA found no evidence of Iraq restarting a nuclear program in 2003. UNSCOM/IAEA uncovered and dismantled a network of nuclear research facilities in Iraq, including uranium enrichment programs and a plutonium separation program. Iraq had a nuclear weapons development program, attempted to develop a radiological weapon, and launched a crash program in 1990 to produce a nuclear weapon quickly. Iraq's nuclear program aimed to assemble a nuclear explosive device by December 1992. By 1997, the IAEA confirmed the program had been terminated and had a clear understanding of Iraq's nuclear suppliers. Despite efforts to close the nuclear file in 1998, unresolved issues remained. In 2000, the IAEA destroyed a nuclear centrifuge stored in Jordan, and in 2002, verified sealed uranium stockpiles. The Duelfer report in 2004 provided further insights. The Duelfer report in 2004 expanded on early findings by the ISG regarding Iraq's nuclear program, stating that while evidence of the program's maturity was found pre-1991, Iraq's ability to reconstitute it decayed after that date. The report also mentioned limited post-1995 activities that could aid in reconstituting the program once sanctions were lifted, including efforts to retain nuclear scientific talent. There were unconfirmed reports of looting at Iraq's nuclear sites after the fall of the regime, raising concerns about the security of equipment. During its 1991-1998 tenure, UNSCOM destroyed all chemical weapons materiel uncovered, including 38,500 munitions, 480,000 liters of chemical agents, and 1.8 million liters of precursor chemicals. The fate of about 31,600 chemical shells and 550 mustard gas bombs remains unknown. Iraq did not prove it destroyed the chemical precursors, and UNSCOM's main outstanding questions centered on VX nerve agent. By 1995, enough evidence had been uncovered to force Iraq to admit to producing chemical weapons. In 1995, UNSCOM uncovered evidence of Iraq producing 4 tons of VX nerve agent, with enough precursor imported to produce 200 tons. Tests on missile warheads revealed traces of VX, contradicting Iraq's claims. Iraq proposed a method to prove VX destruction in 1991. 170 chemical sites were monitored, and Iraq did not sign the Chemical Weapons Convention. CIA reported Iraq expanding its chemical weapons capability in 2002. Iraq's production capability of chemical agents, including VX, sarin, cyclosarin, and mustard, was strongly suggested by evidence. A British assessment in September 2002 indicated that Iraq had distributed chemical weapons to its field units and could deploy them within 45 minutes. UNMOVIC found 16 chemical artillery munitions during pre-war inspections in January 2003. An Iraqi Air Force document from December 2002 revealed that 6,500 chemical bombs were unaccounted for. UNMOVIC also discovered previously undeclared cluster munitions in Iraq that could deliver chemical or biological agents. U.S. teams found chemical weapons protection gear and antidote shortly after searching post-Saddam Iraq. In post-Saddam Iraq, U.S. teams found chemical weapons protection gear and antidote vaccinations, but no chemical weapons stockpiles. Insurgents attempted to detonate munitions containing sarin nerve agent and mustard gas in 2004. Additional shells with chemical weapons, including cyclosarin, were discovered by Polish troops. The origin of the munitions is unknown, believed to be leftover from previous conflicts. U.S. officials are concerned about insurgents seeking chemical munitions and technical assistance. Iraq's insurgents are seeking chemical munitions and technical assistance from Iraqi technicians involved in Iraq's chemical weapons programs. The Duelfer report stated that Iraq destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991 and did not resume production thereafter. Iraq retained the knowledge to restart a chemical weapons program and conducted dual-use research. According to the report, Iraq had unresolved questions about its biological weapons capabilities from 1991-1998. Iraq initially did not declare any biological materials, weapons, research, or facilities, and no biological weapons stockpile was found. Iraq admitted to having a biological weapons research program in August 1991, and later acknowledged it in July 1995. Iraq admitted to an offensive biological weapons program in July 1995, producing botulinum, anthrax, and aflatoxin. UNSCOM found 4 tons of unaccounted growth media for biological agents. Iraq did not disclose information on drop tanks and aerosol generators for biological weapons. UNSCOM dismantled the Al Hakam facility in June 1996. The CIA reported in October 2002 that Iraq's biological weapons program was active and advanced. The white paper revealed that Iraq was developing unmanned aerial vehicles for delivering biological weapons. Iraq's WMD declaration to UNMOVIC in December 2002 contained little new information. In February 2003, Iraq unearthed fragments of biological bombs destroyed in 1991 under UNMOVIC's supervision. The CIA assessed in June 2003 that trailers found in Iraq were biological labs, but no biological agents were found. The Duelfer report indicated that Iraq may have had a biological weapons program in 1991 and 1992. The Duelfer report states that Iraq may have destroyed its undeclared stocks of biological weapons in 1991 and 1992, but lacks evidence of complete destruction. It also mentions Iraq's intention to preserve its biological weapons capability between 1991 and 1996. However, there is no evidence of Iraq planning a new biological weapons program after 1996. The report found a network of labs and safehouses with biological-capable equipment but no evidence of mobile biological weapons production systems. The ISG report found that Iraq was developing BW agent production systems mounted on road vehicles or railway wagons. Resolution 687 required the destruction of Iraqi ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 km, and UNSCOM accounted for most of the missiles and launchers. U.S. analysts suspected Iraq of concealing Scud-like missiles and manufacturing propellants for longer-range missiles. Evidence of Iraqi cheating on missile issues was also reported, including the procurement of missile components. Iraq was found to have procured missile components in violation of sanctions, including prohibited missile guidance gyroscopes. UNSCOM was able to account for most of the chemical and biological warheads Iraq claimed to have destroyed in 1991. Progress was made in accounting for Scud warheads and engine components, but unresolved issues included missile program documentation and indigenous production. Iraq was also developing permitted-range missiles. Iraq was developing permitted-range missiles\u2014the Ababil and Samoud programs. The October 2002 CIA white paper stated that Iraq had exceeded the 150 km range limitation for ballistic missiles. Blix ordered the destruction of the Al Samoud missiles and related production equipment, with about half destroyed before the war started. Iraq's \"Fatah\" program was also under scrutiny for exceeding allowed limits. Some missiles were fired into Kuwait during the 2003 war. According to the Duelfer report, Iraq did not retain Scud-variant missiles after 1991 and was developing new delivery systems potentially for WMD. Iraq developed the Al Samoud and Fatah missiles and was pursuing new small UAV systems. The ISG uncovered Iraqi plans for long-range ballistic missiles and a cruise missile, with assistance from Russian experts and imports from other countries. Resolution 688 required Iraq to stop repressing its people, but it is unclear if it still applies to the current regime. Reports after the 1991 Gulf war described Saddam Hussein's regime as a gross violator of human rights, with estimates of over 400,000 Iraqis killed. International organizations estimate that over 400,000 Iraqis were killed by regime security forces during Saddam's rule, with some estimates as high as 1 million. In 1994, the Clinton Administration considered presenting a case against Iraq to the International Court of Justice for violating the Genocide Convention. Reports highlighted Iraq's abuses against the Shiite \"Marsh Arabs\" in southern Iraq. In 2002, Iraq allowed the U.N. human rights rapporteur to visit, and Saddam Hussein granted amnesty to prisoners amid concerns of military intervention. Some in the Bush Administration blame post-war unrest in Iraq on criminals released by Saddam during an amnesty. U.S. State Department documents mention women being raped in custody to extract information. Amnesty International reported over 200 women accused of prostitution were beheaded by the former regime. Detainees were routinely tortured, including by electric shock and burnings. The former regime also targeted Shiite religious leaders and their supporters. Shiite religious leaders and supporters were targeted by Saddam Hussein's regime, with bans on religious activities and publications. Uday Hussein reportedly threatened and dismissed individuals, while mass graves containing Shiite Muslims killed in uprisings were discovered post-1991 war. Over 270 mass graves have been reported, with about 50 confirmed by Iraq's Human Rights Ministry. In October 2004, nine mass graves were discovered in Hatra, northern Iraq, containing hundreds of bodies, believed to be Kurds killed during the Anfal campaign of 1987-1988. Funding from an FY2004 supplemental appropriation was allocated for investigations into human rights practices of the former regime, including $75 million for crimes against humanity investigations and $15 million for a human rights commission. The $15 million allocated from an FY2004 supplemental appropriation was used for various activities in Iraq, including assisting the Ministry of Human Rights and funding forensic training. It also supported a project to document human rights violations by the former regime for a \"Truth Commission.\" Additionally, the trial of Saddam Hussein and his associates for war crimes and crimes against humanity was a separate issue addressed by previous U.S. administrations and the international community. The sense of Congress was for the President to propose a war crimes tribunal for Saddam Hussein. Legislation was passed in support of this, and the U.S. sought to establish an Iraq war crimes tribunal focusing on nine major criminal episodes, including the use of chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians. The State Department contributed $4 million to a U.N. \"Iraq War Crimes Commission\" for potential trial of Saddam Hussein and his associates, including those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Iraq. Several key members of Saddam Hussein's regime have been captured or surrendered, including Taha Yasin Ramadan, Izzat Ibrahim, Barzan al-Tikriti, Watban al-Tikriti, Sabawi al-Tikriti, Tariq Aziz, and Aziz Salih Noman. As of August 2004, 45 out of 55 former regime officials sought by the United States are in custody or deceased. In 2004, 45 out of 55 sought Iraqis are in custody or deceased. A war crimes tribunal was formed for former regime members, including Saddam Hussein. Saddam was captured in December 2003 and formally charged with crimes against humanity in July 2004. He surrendered to U.S. forces and was held at Camp Cropper near Baghdad for interrogation. Documents captured with Saddam led to the arrests of other officials. Saddam Hussein was charged with major crimes against the Iraqi people and humanity in July 2004, including invading Kuwait, using chemical weapons against the Kurds, and suppressing uprisings by Shiites and Kurds. He remained in U.S. custody near Baghdad International Airport, spending his time reading, writing, and tending a small garden. Saddam Hussein was convicted for the Dujail killings and hanged by the Iraqi government in December 2006. The government elected in December 2005 was dominated by Shiite Islamists. Despite a declaration to end support for terrorism in 1991, some known terrorists lived in Iraq until the 2003 war. Abu Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, was arrested by U.S. forces in Iraq in 2003 and died in custody in 2004. Abu Nidal, an aging terrorist leader, died in Iraq in August 2002. In 2002, Abu Nidal, an aging terrorist leader, died in Iraq as Iraqi police attempted to arrest him for alleged ties to foreign governments. Iraq was reported to have paid families of Palestinian suicide bombers and invited Arab volunteers to fight against the United States during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Despite debates within the Bush Administration, little evidence has been found linking Saddam's regime to Al Qaeda post-war. U.S. commanders believe foreign fighters, possibly linked to Al Qaeda, are involved in the insurgency against U.S. forces in Iraq. Iraq, previously removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, is seeking closure on issues related to Al Qaeda ties and Kuwait sanctions. The U.S. is obligated to assist Iraq in closing out Chapter 7 under the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement. The U.S. is obligated to help Iraq close out Chapter 7 resolutions, but Kuwait wants issues resolved before closing files. The U.N. Secretary-General will report on closing resolutions in 2009. Resolutions required Iraq to annul annexation of Kuwait and establish a demilitarized zone. The Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission endorsed border decisions in November 1992, finalizing the border as per a 1963 agreement. The new border deprived Iraq of part of Umm Qasr port and the Rumaylah oil field. The sea border was determined on March 18, 1993, allowing both countries access to the Gulf. Resolution 833 demanded acceptance of the final border demarcation. Iraq formally recognized Kuwait on November 10, 1994. At the Arab summit in Beirut in 2002, Iraq reaffirmed commitment to Kuwait's territorial integrity and pledged cooperation on missing Kuwaitis. Saddam Hussein issued an \"apology\" to Kuwait for the invasion on December 7, 2002. Saddam Hussein issued an \"apology\" to Kuwait for the invasion on December 7, 2002, but Kuwait rejected it as insincere. The 32-nation U.N. Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM) monitored border violations until it ended operations after the launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Resolution 1490 set a date of October 6, 2003 for the disbanding of UNIKOM and the termination of the demilitarized zone, but contention remains over border pillars. The Demarcation Commission recommended annual inspections of boundary pillars and border markers between Iraq and Kuwait. The U.N. proposed maintenance through a joint trust fund, taken over by the DPKO in 2003. Transition to Iraq and Kuwait was delayed due to an Iraqi building in Kuwait territory and road construction. Iraq approved a new transition schedule for September 2009, removed the building, and began road work, fulfilling financial obligations to the maintenance trust fund. Iraq fulfilled financial obligations towards the maintenance trust fund as required by Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687. After the 1991 war, 605 Kuwaitis and other nationals were missing. Meetings between Iraq and Kuwait, along with other representatives, were held monthly until Iraq boycotted them after Operation Desert Fox. In 2000, Yuli Vorontsov was appointed as the U.N. coordinator on Kuwait-related issues. Despite concerns about lack of progress, Iraq did not allow him to visit. In January 2003, Saddam attempted to appear cooperative to avoid a U.S. invasion. In January 2003, Saddam regime representatives met with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to address missing Kuwaitis and property. Resolution 1483 tasked Vorontsov with resolving these issues post-Saddam's fall. Iraq returned some Kuwaiti property post-ceasefire, including U.S.-made missiles. U.S. accused Iraq of returning captured Iranian equipment to Kuwait in 1994. In 1994, U.S. officials accused Iraq of returning captured Iranian equipment to Kuwait, including military equipment like Mirage F-1 aircraft, fighting vehicles, and anti-tank missiles. Iraq claimed the materiel was left behind or destroyed during their evacuation of Kuwait. In July 2002, an agreement was reached for Iraq to return Kuwait's state archives, but key archives were not returned. Iraq returned some additional property in early February 2003 to try to prevent a U.S. invasion. In July 2004, Iraq and Kuwait restored diplomatic relations. Kuwait has provided humanitarian aid to Iraqis, mainly in the Shiite south, to promote stability. Ambassador Gennady Tarasov of Russia replaced Yuli Vorontsov as High-level Coordinator in April 2008. 369 missing Kuwaiti and third-country nationals were found near Kuwait's border with Iraq after five years of searching. Since April 2008, only one additional person had been identified among the 369 missing persons near Kuwait's border with Iraq. The task of finding, exhuming, and identifying the remains is challenging due to the passage of 20 years and the Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights' limited capacity. Kuwaiti teams face obstacles in carrying out exhumation work in Iraq due to security concerns. U.S. investigators believe U.S. Navy pilot Michael Speicher, missing since the 1991 Gulf War, is dead but his remains have not been located. The whereabouts of Kuwaiti national archives remain unknown despite efforts to locate them. The Security Council noted limited progress on human remains and Kuwaiti property return, welcomed positive efforts on Kuwaiti Airways spare parts, and extended funding for the High-level Coordinator. Reparation payments from the 1991 Gulf war are a sensitive issue, with Iraq aiming to end the Chapter 7 process. The UN Compensation Commission (UNCC) was established to compensate victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, using a percentage of Iraqi oil sales. Over $52.4 billion has been awarded in compensation, with $27.6 billion paid out and $24.8 billion remaining unpaid. Iraq needs this money to improve security and recover from years of warfare. Kuwait's firms are owed approximately the same amount as UNCC awards. U.S. claimants have received over $700 million, with $552 million already paid. Iraq proposed to annul remaining claims and end revenue deductions, but Kuwait opposes this. Iraq suggested reducing deductions to 2.5% or 1%, but Kuwait has not agreed. UNCC Governing Council members sympathize with Kuwait's stance. The UNCC Governing Council recommended a phase-out strategy in 2004 and 2006. Ongoing activities include paying successful claims and overseeing environmental projects worth $4.3 billion. In 2009, $460 million was distributed to twelve claimants, followed by $730 million to ten claimants in Kuwait. Payments to individuals of all nationalities have been completed. The next Governing Council session is scheduled for November 2009. Legislative proposals are being considered to distribute Iraq's frozen assets in the United States. Iraq's frozen assets of about $2.4 billion in the United States were not distributed due to disagreements over priority claimants. President Bush issued an executive order in 2003 to use these assets for post-war reconstruction. Resolution 1483 in 2003 lifted the U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq but directed that export sales be deposited into a Development Fund for Iraq until a new government is established. Resolution 1483 directed the freezing and transfer of assets from the previous regime into the Development Fund for Iraq. The fund was audited by an International Advisory and Monitoring Board. Resolution 1546 reaffirmed these processes, with subsequent resolutions extending monitoring arrangements. The \"1518 Committee\" was established to identify individuals with funds from the Saddam Hussein regime for transfer to the DFI, while the Iraqi government closed the Saddam-era \"oil for food program\" in accordance with Resolution 1483. The oil-for-food program, established in the 1990s to improve Iraq's living standards, was closed out in 2003 by Resolution 1483. Resolution 1546 empowered the Iraqi government to wind down residual contracts under the program. Several U.N. resolutions assigned a role for the United Nations in post-Saddam reconstruction and governance. Resolution 1500 established UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) to provide stabilization forces. Iraqi factions prefer managing their affairs without UN interference. US military deployments in the Gulf focused on containing Iraq pre-2003 war. United States and Britain enforced \"no fly zones\" to protect Kurdish and Shiite populations. The \"no fly zones\" were established to protect Iraq's Kurdish minority and Shiite population, monitor Iraqi forces, and enforce a punitive policy towards Saddam Hussein's regime. France dropped out of the enforcement operations due to opposition. ONW extended north of the 36th parallel, with Turkey providing basing rights at Incirlik Air Base. OSW, established in 1992, extended south of the 32nd parallel and was expanded to the 33rd parallel in 1996. The no-fly zones were expanded to the 33rd parallel in 1996 by the United States and the United Kingdom to enforce U.N. resolutions and prevent Iraqi interference with allied air operations. In response to Iraq's movements towards Kuwait in 1994, Security Council Resolution 949 established no-fly zones. The United States and Britain interpreted this as authorization for military action if Iraq enhanced its forces below the 32nd parallel. Prior to the 2003 war, there were occasional U.S. strikes on Iraqi military positions, with Iraqi air defenses firing at allied aircraft enforcing the zones. In 2001, the U.S. and Britain struck parts of the air defense network north of the southern no-fly zone. During 2002, Iraqi air defenses and infrastructure were bombed in response to provocations. The target list expanded to include systems that could be used against U.S. forces. No-fly zone enforcement ended after Saddam Hussein's regime was overthrown in 2003. U.S. personnel in Saudi Arabia were reduced from about 6,000 to a few hundred, with many forces redeployed to Qatar. In the post-Saddam period, U.S. military teams secured Iraq's conventional military infrastructure, including ammunition storage sites holding over 600,000 tons of explosive ordnance. Some sites in Anbar Province remain unsecured, potentially supplying Iraqi resistance with explosives. In Ramadi, 103 former regime ammunition storage sites were identified, with 35 cleared of munitions by July 2004. U.S. forces did not find many shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles. Combat aircraft buried by the regime were discovered, but their operational status is unknown. Iraq demands the return of 22 combat aircraft flown to Iran in 1991. As of July 2009, 125,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq under the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement. Non-U.S. forces have mostly left Iraq. Under the Obama Administration withdrawal plan, most non-U.S. forces have left Iraq, leaving only 35,000-50,000 U.S. troops in advisory roles by August 2010. All U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by the end of 2011. Concerns exist about the need for continued advice, mentoring, and air support for Iraqi forces post-withdrawal. The Defense Department spent $12 billion from 1991 to 2003 on containing Iraq and providing aid to the Kurds, with $1.2 billion spent in FY2002. Additionally, the Department supported UNSCOM with U-2 surveillance flights, intelligence, personnel, equipment, and logistical support at a cost of $15 million per year."
