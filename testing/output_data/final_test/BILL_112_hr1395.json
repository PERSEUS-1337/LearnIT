The \"Leading and Expediting Aerotropolis Development Act of 2011\" establishes an aerotropolis grant program to assist in developing aerotropolis transportation systems. The Secretary of Transportation can provide grants for highway, bridge, public transportation, and rail projects to benefit aerotropolis transportation systems. The \"Leading and Expediting Aerotropolis Development Act of 2011\" establishes a grant program for projects such as improving rail transportation, ports, access to terminals, multimodal terminal facilities, and intelligent transportation systems for freight movement. Grant funding awarded under the program remains available for obligation by the recipient for the fiscal year it is disbursed and the following three fiscal years. The Secretary establishes a grant program for aerotropolis transportation systems. Eligible entities must submit an application describing the system's scope and components, as well as project details and status. Unobligated grant funding is returned to the Secretary for other grants. The grant program for aerotropolis transportation systems requires applicants to describe the project's status, development plan, job creation, costs, benefits, and completion timeline. The Secretary considers project proposals based on their impact on goods and passenger mobility, intermodal connectivity, and freight conditions. Improvement of transportation infrastructure, reducing congestion, enhancing safety, incorporating new technologies, boosting economic development, encouraging non-Federal contributions, and reducing dependence on foreign oil are key factors considered for the grant program. The Secretary will prioritize applicants with strategic plans, existing infrastructure, capacity for efficient fund use, and public-private partnerships for developing an aerotropolis transportation system. The grant recipient must submit an annual report detailing activities and their impact. Definitions for an aerotropolis transportation system are provided. Eligible entities for the aerotropolis transportation system include State and local governments, metropolitan planning organizations, regional planning organizations, and organizations comprised of these entities."
