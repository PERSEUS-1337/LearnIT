    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North Korea Democracy Act of 2003\". Congress finds that North Korea committed to freezing and dismantling its nuclear facilities under the Agreed Framework of 1994. The General Accounting Office reported that North Korea diverted heavy oil received from the United States. North Korea violated the Agreed Framework by diverting heavy oil for unauthorized purposes, pursuing uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons, and declaring the agreement nullified. They also announced plans to restart a reactor and reprocessing facility. North Korea has announced its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and has expelled IAEA personnel monitoring the frozen 5-megawatt reactor and reprocessing facility at Yongbyon. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nAgreed Framework refers to the agreement between the US and North Korea in 1994. IAEA is the International Atomic Energy Agency. KEDO stands for Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization. North Korea is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. NPT is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Agreed Framework with North Korea is considered null and void due to their illicit actions. North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to the US and its allies, undermining security in Northeast Asia. North Korea is urged to comply with international obligations on nuclear non-proliferation. North Korea is urged to comply with international obligations by renouncing its nuclear weapons and materials production ambitions, dismantling its nuclear infrastructure, transferring all sensitive nuclear materials to the IAEA, and allowing full access to IAEA inspectors. Any diplomatic solution should consider North Korea's untrustworthiness as a negotiating partner. North Korea must achieve total dismantlement of its nuclear weapons and production capability, with highly intrusive verification requirements similar to those imposed on Iraq under UN Security Council Resolution 1441. The United States Government is prohibited from providing assistance to North Korea or the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization under the Agreed Framework. Additionally, there are limitations on nuclear cooperation. The United States is restricted from providing nuclear cooperation or assistance to North Korea until certain conditions are met, as outlined in the Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The United States is prohibited from transferring any nuclear material, facilities, components, or technology to North Korea that would be subject to an agreement. Additionally, no license may be issued for the export of items that could be used for nuclear explosive purposes or the production of nuclear materials. The United States is prohibited from transferring any nuclear material, facilities, components, or technology to North Korea that could be used for nuclear explosive purposes or the production of nuclear materials. No licenses may be issued for the export of such items, and retransfer or engagement in related activities is also restricted. The United States is prohibited from transferring nuclear material to North Korea for nuclear purposes. Conditions for engagement include North Korea complying with safeguards agreements with the IAEA. North Korea has allowed the IAEA full access to additional sites and information to verify the accuracy of their initial nuclear report. They have also consistently implemented steps to comply with safeguards agreements. North Korea has verifiably implemented the Joint Declaration on Denuclearization, complying with obligations regarding uranium enrichment, nuclear reprocessing facilities, and nuclear weapons. They have not made any progress towards acquiring or developing such facilities or weapons. The United States deems it in its national interest to prohibit the transfer of materials, components, goods, services, technologies, data, substances, or production to North Korea unless approved by Congress. A conforming amendment is made to the Act. The United States sanctions apply to prohibit the transfer of various items to North Korea without Congressional approval. The President is authorized to impose full economic sanctions against North Korea under various laws in response to their nuclear weapons development activities. No funds can be used to ease sanctions against North Korea. The President can impose economic sanctions against North Korea in response to their nuclear weapons development activities, but funds cannot be used to ease sanctions against North Korea. The sanctions regime against North Korea was less restrictive after the President announced an easing of sanctions in September 1999. SEC. 8. The President must seek international condemnation and multilateral sanctions against North Korea for its nuclear weapons pursuit. SEC. 9. Addressing the treatment of refugees from North Korea. The sense of Congress is to work with other countries to adopt a policy for North Korean refugees, ensuring safe arrival in a first asylum country and promoting burden-sharing for resettlement. North Korean nationals can establish refugee status based on fear of persecution. The text chunk discusses the eligibility for refugee status for North Korean nationals based on fear of persecution. It also states that a national of North Korea shall not be considered a national of South Korea for refugee status purposes. Additionally, it authorizes appropriations for the implementation of this section. SEC. 10. INCREASED BROADCASTING BY RADIO FREE ASIA.\n\nRadio Free Asia must increase broadcasting to North Korea to 24 hours per day. Authorization of appropriations is provided.\n\nSEC. 11. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\nThe U.S. and allies should enhance deterrence against North Korea through military reinforcements and readiness. \n\nSEC. 12. PRESIDENTIAL REPORT. The President must submit a report to Congress within 180 days of this Act's enactment on the implementation of its provisions."
