    "content": "The \"Slamming Protection Act\" provides additional protections against unauthorized changes of telephone service providers. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 is amended to include criminal penalties for individuals and telecommunication carriers who make unauthorized changes to telephone service providers. Penalties include fines and imprisonment for both first and subsequent offenses. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 imposes fines of up to $50,000 for the first offense and up to $100,000 for subsequent offenses for unauthorized changes to telephone service providers. Subscribers have a private right of action to seek damages or reversal of the change within one year of discovery. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 allows for increased awards up to three times the maximum amount for willful violations of procedures. States can take action against unauthorized changes in telephone service providers. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 allows states to bring civil actions on behalf of residents to enjoin unauthorized practices and recover damages. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over these actions and may award up to three times the monetary loss for willful violations. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 grants states the authority to seek declaratory relief, injunctions, and restraining orders against non-compliant defendants. States must notify the Commission before initiating civil actions, allowing the Commission the right to intervene and be heard in the proceedings. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 allows states to take civil action against non-compliant defendants, with the Commission having the right to intervene and file appeals. Venue for such actions can be where the defendant is located or where the violation occurred, and state court proceedings are not prohibited. Class actions can also be brought under this section. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1984 allows states to take civil action against non-compliant defendants, with the Commission having the right to intervene and file appeals. Class actions brought for violation of prescribed procedures may not exceed three times the total actual damages suffered by the class members. State law relief for unauthorized changes of providers is not preempted."
