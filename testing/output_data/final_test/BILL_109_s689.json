    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Drinking Water Assistance Act\". Congress acknowledges that drinking water standards can financially burden public water systems, especially in rural communities serving small populations. Limited resources in small communities make it difficult to meet regulatory requirements, upgrade water systems, and train personnel. Small communities lack the tax base to cover the costs of improving water quality, leading to high per capita expenses. Small communities need funding for water quality projects as current federal programs do not meet their needs. New arsenic drinking water standards are expected in 2006, and the grant program should ensure timely implementation. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to provide assistance for small public water systems, including defining Indian tribes and establishing a new program for small communities. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to assist small public water systems with eligible activities like obtaining technical assistance and training operators to comply with drinking water standards. This excludes projects to increase the population served by a small public water system unless deemed necessary by the Administrator. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to assist small public water systems in achieving compliance with regulations and providing water supply to unserved populations. Eligible entities are small public water systems in states or areas governed by Indian Tribes, serving disadvantaged communities as determined by state affordability criteria. The term 'Program' refers to the small public water systems serving disadvantaged communities or communities expected to become disadvantaged as a result of eligible activities. The term 'Program' refers to the small public water assistance program for communities with populations of not more than 200,000 individuals or specific locations in New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Program includes specific locations in Mesquite or Washoe County, Nevada, and El Paso County, Texas. SEC. 1472. SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. Establishment of a program to provide grants to eligible entities for projects to comply with drinking water standards, prioritizing based on financial need and per capita cost of compliance. Grants are awarded within one year of enactment, with a focus on small communities. The Administrator ensures that at least 20% of grant funds are used for eligible activities in communities with a population of less than 50,000 individuals. Eligible entities must submit a concise application describing the activities for which the grant is needed. The Administrator forwards grant applications to the Council for review and approval within 90 days. The application must include information on compliance with drinking water standards and any other required details. If approved, a grant is awarded to the applicant. The Administrator forwards grant applications to the Council for review and approval within 90 days. If the application is disapproved, the Administrator informs the applicant in writing with reasons and a deadline for resubmission. The Federal share of the cost for eligible activities funded by the grant should not exceed 90 percent. The Administrator may waive the requirement for the non-Federal share of the cost if an eligible entity faces financial hardship. Enforcement of drinking water standards is suspended for eligible entities applying for a grant under the Program. The Program grants have a deadline for disapproved applications and approved applications. Arsenic standards in drinking water cannot be enforced until the Program is implemented in the State or January 1, 2006, whichever comes first. The Council plays a role in reviewing and recommending grants for eligible entities under the Program, considering priority lists developed by States for drinking water treatment funds. Authorization of appropriations for the Program is set at $1.9 billion annually from 2006 to 2011."
