    "content": "Prior to the September 2001 terrorist attacks, insurers did not exclude or charge separately for terrorism risk coverage. The 9/11 attacks led to over $45 billion in insured losses, with business interruption insurance, property insurance, and liability insurance being the most affected. Primary insurance companies suffered losses, but reinsurers, who insure insurance companies, bore the heaviest losses due to the lack of data on terrorism risk. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, reinsurers and primary insurers struggled to price terrorism risk accurately, leading to a withdrawal from the market for terrorism risk insurance. State regulators approved exclusions of terrorism risks from commercial policies, making terrorism risk insurance either unavailable or extremely expensive. This left many businesses unable to purchase insurance to protect them in future terrorist attacks, impacting various sectors such as real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utilities. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the lack of terrorism risk insurance availability impacted industries such as real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utilities. In response, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in November 2002 to provide a government reinsurance backstop for terrorist attacks. The TRIA program has been amended and extended multiple times, with the latest extension set to expire at the end of 2020. The executive branch has shown skepticism towards the TRIA program in the past. The current Administration is evaluating reforms to decrease taxpayer exposure for the TRIA program. The insurance industry and commercial insurance consumers largely support TRIA, while some, like the Consumer Federation of America, have questioned its need in the past. Despite attacks deemed terrorism since TRIA's passage, no certified acts of terrorism have led to payments under the program. Since the passage of TRIA, no certified acts of terrorism have led to payments under the program. The original goals of TRIA were to create a federal program for compensation of terrorism losses, protect consumers, and preserve state regulation of insurance. Changes to the program have reduced government coverage for terrorism losses. The TRIA program was originally created to compensate for terrorism losses and protect consumers. Changes to the program have reduced government coverage for terrorism losses, except for domestic terrorism. The federal government shares insured losses with the private insurance market based on the size of the loss, recouping payments through levies on insurance policies. For large losses, the government pays most of the losses with optional recoupment. The TRIA program was created to compensate for terrorism losses and protect consumers. Changes to the program have reduced government coverage for terrorism losses, except for domestic terrorism. Loss sharing among insurers depends on meeting certain thresholds, with losses exceeding $5 million required for certification of an act of terrorism. The federal government shares in an insurer's losses for certified acts of terrorism only if industry insured losses exceed $180 million. Insurers must pay a deductible equal to 20% of their annual direct earned premiums. The government covers 81% of losses above the deductible until reaching $100 billion in total losses. After $100 billion in losses, federal government coverage ends, and insurers are not required to provide coverage. The Secretary of the Treasury must establish surcharges on insurance policies to recoup 140% of outlays to insurers under the program. Surcharges may be assessed if losses are high, but it is not mandatory. The deductible for TRIA coverage depends on how losses are distributed among insurance companies. In 2017, 20% of direct-earned premiums for property and casualty lines under TRIA totaled $42 billion. The Treasury Department determines the amount to recoup after initial loss sharing, with the Secretary required to recoup 140% of government outlays for attacks under $37.5 billion in insured losses. For events over $37.5 billion, the Secretary has discretionary authority to recoup all government outlays. The Secretary has discretionary authority to recoup government outlays for attacks under TRIA, with recoupment required depending on the size of the attacks and uncompensated losses paid by the insurance industry. If triggered, recoupment must be completed by the end of FY2024, with surcharges imposed on TRIA-eligible insurance policies. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program allows the Secretary to adjust premiums based on rural/urban differences and terrorism exposures. The administration of the program involves the Treasury Secretary and the Federal Insurance Office. Insurers offering TRIA-covered lines must provide terrorism insurance to commercial policyholders without significant differences in coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program allows insurers to offer terrorism insurance to policyholders, with details on premiums and federal compensation. Policyholders are not required to purchase terrorism coverage, but insurers can exclude terrorism losses if coverage is declined. State regulators can adjust insurance rates, and TRIA preserves state regulation of insurance. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program preempts state definitions of terrorism and rate approval laws, as well as insurance policy exclusions for acts of terrorism. It does not specifically address coverage for nonconventional terrorist attacks like NBCR and cyber terrorism, which have raised concerns. Observers believe NBCR attacks are the most likely type of terrorist attack. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program covers insured losses from terrorist actions, including NBCR events. However, most insurance policies have exclusions that may limit coverage for NBCR events, whether due to terrorism or accident. If these exclusions are invoked, they would also limit TRIA coverage for NBCR terrorism. Language to extend TRIA coverage to NBCR events was proposed. In the past, efforts to extend TRIA coverage to NBCR events were not included in legislation. Insurers are hesitant to offer NBCR coverage due to uncertainties and potential catastrophic losses. Concerns about cyber terrorism coverage under TRIA have grown as more economic activity moves online. Legislation addressing differential treatment for NBCR attacks has not been enacted. In 2016, state insurance regulators introduced Cyber Liability insurance, raising questions about coverage under TRIA. The Department of the Treasury clarified that standalone cyber insurance policies are included in TRIA's definition of 'property and casualty insurance'. Despite this guidance, concerns remain about cyber terrorism coverage. Treasury reported that 50% of standalone cyber insurance policies include terrorism coverage, with a 54% take-up rate for embedded cyber coverage in policies. The take-up rate for embedded cyber coverage in policies is 54%, similar to the 62% rate for general terrorism coverage across all TRIA-eligible lines. Insurers pool risks to ensure ongoing losses do not exceed premiums, past premiums, and potential future profits. Accurate estimation of loss probability and severity is crucial for successful insurer operation. Insurers rely on past loss data to set rates accurately. Terrorism risk is often seen as uninsurable without government support due to lack of public data on probability and severity of attacks. Insurers need measurable data to assess catastrophic terrorism risk. The insurer needs measurable data to assess terrorism risks, as models are used to predict future losses. Insurers require a large number of insureds, definite and measurable losses, fortuitous events, and non-catastrophic losses to consider a risk insurable. Terrorism risk in the United States may not meet these criteria. Terrorism risk in the United States may not meet the criteria for insurability due to unpredictable losses, constantly changing motives of attackers, and insurers limiting exposure in high-risk areas. Other countries like Spain and the United Kingdom have developed their own responses to terrorism risk, with Spain insuring against terrorism through a government-owned reinsurer and the UK creating Pool Re to specifically insure terrorism risk. After the 9/11 attacks, many countries reassessed their terrorism risks and implemented various approaches, such as the UK expanding Pool Re and Germany creating a private insurer with government backing for terrorism insurance. Germany, like the United States, offers terrorism insurance with government backing as a temporary measure. Canada considered but rejected a similar program after 9/11. The US has a history of addressing uninsurable risks through government action, such as with war damage insurance during World War II and the National Flood Insurance Program since 1968. Following large scale riots in American cities in the late 1960s, insurers pulled back from insuring in those markets. Congress then created a federal riot reinsurance program in 1968, offering reinsurance contracts similar to commercial excess reinsurance. The program covered a percentage of insurance company losses above a deductible. Private reinsurers eventually returned to the market, leading to the termination of the federal riot reinsurance program in 1985. The September 2001 terrorist attacks caused upheaval in the insurance market, leading to higher prices and limited availability. Insurers and reinsurers started adding surcharges for terrorism risk or excluding coverage altogether. Reinsurance contracts and rates are generally unregulated, allowing for rapid adjustments, while primary insurance contracts are more closely regulated by states. The lack of terrorism insurance coverage post-9/11 caused economic concerns, leading to regulatory approval for exclusion in insurance policies. This resulted in fears of economic impact on real estate and potential defaults on loans, affecting construction and lending industries. The November 2002 passage of TRIA shed light on the impact of a lack of terrorism insurance. In September 2002, real estate projects worth $15.5 billion were stalled due to the scarcity of terrorism insurance. Moody's downgraded $4.5 billion in securities. However, there were exceptions like trophy properties being in demand despite concerns over insurance. CBO found in 2005 that TRIA had little measurable effect on office construction and employment but noted potential positive macroeconomic effects. The passage discusses how TRIA addressed the availability problem in the terrorism insurance market, but uncertainty existed due to high pricing and lack of general requirement to purchase coverage. Analyzing the market post-TRIA is challenging due to inconsistent regulatory reporting until 2016. It is important to note that no terrorist attacks meeting TRIA thresholds have occurred. Since the enactment of TRIA, there have been no terrorist attacks meeting the thresholds, resulting in minimal payouts for terrorism damages in the property and casualty insurance sector. Consumer interest in terrorism coverage initially was low, with only 27% purchasing in 2003, but steadily increased to 62% in 2017. The take-up rate based on premium volumes was 62% in 2017, while based on policy counts, it was 78%. Pricing for terrorism insurance has generally decreased over time. The 2013 report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, based on survey data by insurance broker Aon, showed a high of above 7% for the median terrorism premium as a percentage of the total property premium in 2003, with a generally downward trend to around 3% in more recent years. Pricing for terrorism insurance has generally decreased over time, with variability across industries such as financial institutions and food and beverage. Marsh reported rates as high as 24% in 2009 for financial institutions and as low as 2% in the food and beverage industry. In 2017, Marsh found rates varying from 10% in hospitality and gaming to 2% in energy and mining and construction industries. The 2018 Treasury report found that total premiums for terrorism coverage in 2017 were approximately $3.65 billion, representing 1.75% of total premiums for TRIA-eligible lines of insurance. Insurers have earned around $38 billion for terrorism coverage since the passage of TRIA, with an additional $7.4 billion earned by captive insurers. The capacity of insurers to bear terrorism risk has increased over the life of the TRIA program, with a combined policyholder surplus of $686.9 billion at the end of 2017 compared to $408.6 billion at the start of 2002. The policyholder surplus for property and casualty insurance in the United States has grown to $686.9 billion by the end of 2017, supported by $38 billion in premiums for terrorism coverage. Extreme weather events could deplete this surplus, affecting the terrorism insurance market. Table 1 compares provisions from the original TRIA law and subsequent reauthorizing laws. Table A-1 provides examples of how the government recoups terrorism losses under TRIA. The total combined deductibles under TRIA are assumed to be 30% of insured losses for illustrative purposes. The actual deductible amount is based on premiums collected by each insurer. The law defines the \"insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount\" for 2019 as the lesser of $37.5 billion or total insured losses. The \"mandatory recoupment amount\" is the difference between $37.5 billion and insurer losses not compensated by the program. The law requires recoupment of insurer losses not compensated by the program, with mandatory recoupment decreasing for losses over $37.5 billion. The Secretary retains discretionary authority to apply recoupment surcharges regardless of uncompensated losses reaching a certain level."
