    "content": "The Act of 1998 may be cited as the \"Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act.\" Congress finds that the populations of all but 1 species of rhinoceros and the tiger have significantly declined and continue to decline. These species are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act and on Appendix I of CITES. Resolutions have been adopted urging Parties to CITES to implement legislation to reduce illegal trade in their parts and products. The decline in tiger and rhinoceros populations is primarily due to poaching for traditional medicines. Legal mechanisms are insufficient to control trade in their parts and products. Legislation is needed to prohibit the importation and exportation of products containing rhinoceros or tiger parts, and to educate the public on conservation efforts and alternatives for traditional medicine products. The Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 aims to prohibit the sale, importation, and exportation of products containing substances derived from rhinoceros or tiger species intended for human consumption or application. The Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 prohibits the sale, importation, and exportation of products containing substances derived from rhinoceros or tiger species for human use. Section 4 of the Act is amended to define 'person' as an individual, corporation, partnership, trust, association, or government entity. The Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994 prohibits the sale, importation, and exportation of products containing substances derived from rhinoceros or tiger species for human use.
