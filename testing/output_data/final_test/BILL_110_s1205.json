The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program called the \"Heroes Helping Heroes Program\" to provide community reintegration support to veterans through peer support programs. The program will run for three years starting on October 1, 2007, with up to 20 eligible entities selected to participate. Each entity must submit an application to be considered. Participants in the pilot program must submit an application to the Secretary with required information. The Secretary will select participants based on existing peer support programs or the capacity to develop new ones for community reintegration support to veterans. The Secretary will award grants to pilot program participants to develop and promote peer support programs for veterans' community reintegration. The average grant amount will be around $300,000. The program participant must contribute matching funds equal to at least ten percent of the grant awarded. The duration of the grant may not exceed three years. Funds awarded must be used for developing and promoting peer support programs for veterans' community reintegration. The grant awarded for developing peer support programs for veterans includes costs for program staff, consultation services, program operations such as advertising, printing, training, incentives, and overhead expenses. The grant recipient must contribute matching funds of at least ten percent, and the grant duration is limited to three years. The Secretary provides technical assistance to pilot program participants in developing peer support programs for veterans. Eligible entities include veterans service organizations and not-for-profit organizations with a primary mission to assist veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs authorizes $4,500,000 for fiscal years 2008-2010 to support a pilot program for eligible entities, including veterans service organizations, to develop peer support programs for veterans."
