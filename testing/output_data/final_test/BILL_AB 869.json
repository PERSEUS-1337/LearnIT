    "title": "AB 869",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 99580 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow public transportation agencies to enforce penalties for fare evasion, misuse of tickets, playing loud music, smoking, eating, spitting, and disturbing others on system facilities or vehicles. (7) Prohibited actions include carrying dangerous substances, (8) urinating or defecating outside designated areas, and (9) intentionally obstructing others in system facilities or vehicles, with exceptions for disabilities or lawful activities. Unauthorized use of discount tickets or failure to provide proof of eligibility when using a discount ticket in a system station or vehicle is prohibited. Acceptable proof of eligibility must be clearly defined in posted policies. In case of lacking acceptable proof, a notice of fare evasion or passenger conduct violation will be held for 72 hours for the user to provide proof. If proof is not provided within the time frame, the notice will be processed. Unauthorized sale of goods on public transportation property is prohibited. The agency may contract with a vendor for processing notices of violations. (2) \"Processing agency\" refers to the agency issuing or processing notices of fare evasion or passenger conduct violations. (3) \"Fare evasion or passenger conduct violation penalty\" includes late payment penalties, administrative fees, fines, assessments, and collection costs. (4) \"Public transportation agency\" means a public agency providing public transportation services. All fare evasion and passenger conduct violation penalties collected are deposited in the county's general fund. A notice of violation is issued by authorized personnel, detailing the violation, date, time, location, payment deadline, contesting procedure, and potential legal consequences for non-payment. When a notice of fare evasion or passenger conduct violation is served, it must be personally delivered to the violator. The notice is considered an official record and serves as evidence of the violation, creating a rebuttable presumption. The issuing agency must file the notice with the processing agency. If there are errors on a notice of fare evasion or passenger conduct violation, the issuing officer can make corrections on a form attached to the original notice. The corrected notice will be entered into the processing agency's data system, and a copy of the correction will be sent to the cited person. If the person contests the notice, the issuing agency will follow procedures outlined in Section 99581. In determining administrative penalties for violations, a public transportation agency cannot exceed the maximum fine set by the Penal Code. If a person pays the penalty on time or completes the civil administrative process, they will not be cited for a Penal Code violation. Failure to pay may result in being charged with an infraction or misdemeanor under the Penal Code. If a person fails to pay the administrative penalty or complete the civil administrative process for a fare evasion or passenger conduct violation, the processing agency will dismiss the original notice and not pursue further collection. The person will then be served with a new notice specifying the violation under Section 640 of the Penal Code. The entity enacting an ordinance must report information to the Senate and Assembly Committees on Transportation and Housing two and five years after enactment. This includes details of the ordinance, administrative penalties, citations issued, and a comparison with citations issued through the courts for similar offenses. The ordinance's impact on passenger behavior and revenues to the entity described in subdivision (a) and cost savings to county courts will be reported to the Senate and Assembly Committees on Transportation and Housing. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to the creation, elimination, or changes in penalties for crimes or infractions."
