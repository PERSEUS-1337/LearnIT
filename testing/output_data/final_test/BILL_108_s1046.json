    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity, and Competition in Television Broadcast Service Act of 2003\". The findings of Congress highlight the importance of localism in the Communications Act and the limitations on national multiple television ownership set by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to prevent further national concentration. The repeal of financial and syndication regulations by the Commission could increase the power of national television networks. If network ownership exceeds 35 percent, the independence of non-network-owned stations would be at risk. Without a limit on national audience reach for TV stations, further concentration may occur, threatening the independence of non-network-owned stations and turning local stations into passive conduits for network transmissions. The landscape of national television ownership has changed significantly in the past two decades, with networks now able to own multiple stations in local markets, engage in various programming ventures, and own popular cable and Internet content businesses. A cap on national multiple television ownership is necessary to preserve localism and prevent networks from dictating programming on local stations. The landscape of national television ownership has changed significantly in the past two decades, with networks now able to own multiple stations in local markets and engage in various programming ventures. Network-owned stations have multiple interests to consider, including national advertising, syndicated programming, foreign sales, cable programming, and local station interests. The networks' increased power has led to affiliation agreements that favor them, potentially threatening the balance between non-network-owned affiliates and networks. The Act aims to preserve localism in television broadcasting by promoting diversity, competition, and preventing excessive ownership concentration. Networks have affiliation agreements that favor them, limiting the ability of non-network-owned affiliates to reject programming not in the best interest of their local communities. This imbalance of power threatens the balance between affiliates and networks. The Act aims to prevent excessive ownership concentration in television broadcasting by establishing limits on national audience reach for stations owned or controlled by a single party. SEC. 340 of the Communications Act of 1934 establishes National Television Multiple Ownership Limitations to prevent excessive ownership concentration in television broadcasting. The Commission is prohibited from granting a license for a commercial television broadcast station if it would result in the party owning stations with a national audience reach exceeding 35 percent. Any party exceeding this limit must divest themselves of excess licenses within one year. The section prohibits the granting of a license for a commercial TV station if it would result in a party owning stations with a national audience reach exceeding 35 percent. The term \"national audience reach\" is defined as the total number of TV households in Nielsen DMA markets where the stations are located divided by the total national TV households at the time of a license grant, transfer, or assignment. No market can be counted more than once in this calculation. The Telecommunications Act prohibits granting a license for a commercial TV station if it would result in a party owning stations with a national audience reach exceeding 35 percent. The term \"national audience reach\" is defined as the total number of TV households in Nielsen DMA markets where the stations are located divided by the total national TV households at the time of a license grant, transfer, or assignment. Cognizable interest means any partnership or direct ownership interest and any voting stock interest amounting to 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of a licensee. Amendments are made to Section 202(c)(1) by eliminating certain regulations. SEC. 4. NO GRANDFATHERING. Notwithstanding any provision allowing exceeding local radio ownership caps, no party shall exceed those caps 1 year after the enactment of this Act. Definitions include terms from the Communications Act of 1934. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL INTENT WITH RESPECT TO OWNERSHIP RULES REVIEW. Section 202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is amended to require the Commission to review its ownership rules biennially and determine whether to strengthen, limit, repeal, or retain them in the public interest. SEC. 6. PUBLIC HEARING REQUIREMENT. The Commission must hold at least 5 public hearings in different areas of the United States before making any determination on ownership rules. SEC. 7. RESTORATION OF CROSS-OWNERSHIP RULES. The FCC's cross-media limits rule from 2003 is declared null and void, reinstating the broadcast-newspaper and radio-television cross-ownership rules from June 1, 2003. A waiver may be granted in small markets with a Designated Market Area of 150 or higher. The FCC may grant a waiver of cross-ownership rules if it benefits local news, financial stability of media outlets, or the public interest. Each media outlet covered by the waiver must maintain a separate editorial board, and their views must be broadcast or printed when necessary."
