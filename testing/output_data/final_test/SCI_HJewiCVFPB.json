    "content": "While deep learning and deep reinforcement learning systems have shown impressive results in various domains, data efficiency remains a challenge, especially when learning individual tasks from scratch. Multi-task learning is a promising approach for more efficient learning by sharing structure across tasks. However, optimizing in a multi-task setting presents challenges, with gradient interference being a key issue. To address this, a technique called \"gradient surgery\" is proposed to avoid interference between gradients from different tasks. \"Gradient surgery is a technique proposed to address gradient interference in multi-task learning. By projecting the gradient of a task onto the normal plane of conflicting gradients, it leads to efficiency and performance gains in challenging multi-task problems. This approach can be combined with existing multi-task architectures for enhanced performance in a model-agnostic way.\" The optimization challenges of multi-task learning can lead to worse performance and data efficiency compared to learning tasks individually. Various multi-task RL algorithms have attempted to address these challenges by using independent training before combining models into a multi-tasking model, but this approach may sacrifice efficiency gains. If these optimization challenges can be effectively tackled, greater efficiency in multi-task learning could be achieved. The optimization challenges in multi-task learning can hinder performance and efficiency. Research has focused on learning speeds, plateaus in the optimization landscape, and model architecture. This work suggests that conflicting gradients from different tasks may be a central issue. In multi-task learning, conflicting gradients from different tasks can hinder optimization efficiency. A method for mitigating gradient interference by altering the gradients directly is proposed to address this issue. PCGrad is a model-agnostic method for mitigating gradient interference in multi-task learning by projecting conflicting gradients onto the normal plane of each other. It requires only a single modification to the application of gradients and can be easily applied to various problem settings. PCGrad has been evaluated on multi-task CIFAR classification, multi-objective scene understanding, and multi-task reinforcement learning, showing significant improvements in optimization efficiency. PCGrad is a model-agnostic method for improving data efficiency, optimization speed, and final performance in multi-task learning. It can be combined with state-of-the-art methods for even greater performance on supervised learning tasks. The goal of multi-task learning is to find parameters that achieve high average performance across all training tasks. Task-conditioned models are used to solve specific tasks from a task distribution. In multi-task learning, the challenge of conflicting and thrashing gradients can impede progress, especially in reinforcement learning. A proposed solution involves mitigating this issue by addressing conflicting gradients from multiple tasks. Conflicting gradients in multi-task learning can lead to gradient thrashing, where large gradients for one task negatively impact performance on another task. PCGrad algorithm addresses conflicting gradients by projecting gradients onto normal vectors, preserving tasks with constructive interference. The issue of gradient thrashing in multi-task learning occurs when large gradients from one task negatively affect performance on another task. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in neural network optimization due to the structure of loss landscapes. The hypothesis is studied through two toy examples, showing that conflicting gradients can lead to suboptimal performance. The gradient thrashing hypothesis is consistent with observations when running Adam on a landscape, preventing it from reaching an optimum. A significant level of gradient thrashing is observed in multi-task learning with a neural network, leading to the development of an algorithm to alleviate optimization challenges caused by gradient conflict between tasks. PCGrad aims to prevent gradient thrashing by performing \"gradient surgery\" to modify gradients for each task, minimizing conflict between them. This is achieved by detecting conflicting gradients based on negative cosine similarity and adjusting them to mitigate thrashing during optimization. PCGrad aims to reduce destructive gradient interference between tasks by detecting conflicting gradients based on negative cosine similarity. If gradients conflict, one is projected onto the normal plane of the other to remove the conflicting component, minimizing thrashing during optimization. PCGrad aims to reduce destructive gradient interference between tasks by detecting conflicting gradients based on negative cosine similarity. The original gradient remains unaltered, and the procedure repeats across all tasks in a batch to minimize thrashing during optimization. PCGrad introduces a variant of gradient descent for multi-objective optimization, reducing thrashing gradients. The method can be combined with various optimizers like SGD with momentum and Adam. Experimental results show improved learning progress. The convergence of the procedure is analyzed in a two-task setting to ensure its effectiveness under standard optimization assumptions. The PCGrad update rule with Lipschitz continuous gradient will converge to either a specific location in the optimization landscape or the optimal value. The method ensures convergence in a two-task setting with a convex and Lipschitz multi-task loss function. In multi-task settings, PCGrad is applied to supervised learning and reinforcement learning problems with multiple tasks or goals. The method involves grouping data points by task encoding and precomputing gradients for each task in the batch. Further implementation details are discussed in Section 6. In multi-task settings, PCGrad is applied to supervised learning and reinforcement learning problems with multiple tasks or goals. The method involves precomputing gradients for each task in the batch and updating shared parameters without re-computing task gradients or backpropagating into the network. PCGrad can be applied to any architecture designed for supervised multi-task learning and can lead to noticeable performance improvements when combined with state-of-the-art architectures. For multi-task reinforcement learning, PCGrad can be readily applied to policy gradient methods and actor-critic algorithms. PCGrad can be easily incorporated into various model-free RL algorithms, including goal-conditioned RL. It operates on shared parameters, leaving task-specific parameters untouched. In experiments, PCGrad is applied to the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, known for its efficiency and performance gains in different domains. Significant gains in sample efficiency and performance across various domains are achieved in SAC by employing a Q-learning style gradient for the Q-function network (critic) and a reparameterization-style gradient for the policy network (actor). Training involves alternating between data collection and optimization of critic parameters to minimize the soft Bellman residual. Sampling is done from replay buffers to form stratified batches for each task. In the context of SAC, the temperature \u03b1 is adjusted to control the entropy of the policy per-task. This approach aims to prevent SAC from stopping exploration once easier tasks are solved, improving performance on harder tasks. The temperature is learned on a per-task basis using a parametrized model, allowing for better control over the policy's entropy. The method controls the entropy of \u03c0 \u03b8 (a|s, z i ) per-task by optimizing the parameters of \u03b1 \u03c8 (z i) using a constrained optimization framework. Multi-task learning involves training a single model for various tasks in different domains like vision, language, and robotics. Multi-task learning presents a challenging optimization problem, with various architectural solutions proposed in prior work. Some approaches involve multiple modules or attention-based architectures, while others decompose the problem into easier-to-learn local tasks. Our work is model-agnostic and can complement existing architectural approaches. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed scheme for multi-task learning allows simultaneous learning of tasks with a shared model, addressing the challenge of gradient thrashing. The proposed algorithm addresses gradient thrashing in multi-task learning by correcting both the scaling factor and direction of per-task gradients, effectively de-conflicting gradients. It uses cosine similarity between gradients to determine conflicts between tasks, unlike previous methods that only considered auxiliary tasks for single-task learning. Our work focuses on using gradient conflict measures in multi-task learning applications, different from previous methods in continual learning. We iteratively project gradients of each task onto the normal plane of gradients of other tasks to avoid conflicts, without the need for quadratic programming. Our method focuses on using gradient conflict measures in multi-task learning, distinct from previous approaches in continual learning. The goal of our experiments is to investigate the impact of conflicting gradients on optimization for multi-task learning and evaluate the effectiveness of PCGrad in various multi-task learning settings. For supervised learning, experiments were conducted on MultiMNIST, CIFAR-100, and NYUv2 datasets. Multi-task reinforcement learning was evaluated on the Meta-World benchmark for robotic manipulation tasks. In a shared, table-top environment, a simulated Sawyer arm is used for multi-task benchmarks MT10 and MT50, requiring diverse strategies to solve tasks. Goal-conditioned robotic pushing with a Sawyer robot is evaluated for learning goal-conditioned policies. Tasks involve regressing input to the output of a sine function with varied amplitudes and phases. We create 10 tasks with varied amplitudes and concatenate them with task encoding. Using a 3-layer neural network, we compare Adam and Adam with PCGrad-modified gradients. The cosine similarity plot in Figure 4 shows that PCGrad reduces conflicting gradients, leading to faster learning and improved performance in multi-task optimization. In multi-task optimization, reducing the problem can significantly boost performance. Experiments were conducted on three standard multi-task supervised learning datasets: MultiMNIST, multi-task CIFAR-100, and NYUv2. For CIFAR-100, 20 coarse labels were treated as distinct tasks, resulting in a dataset with 20 tasks and 2500 training instances, and 500 test instances per task. PCGrad was combined with routing networks, achieving 71% classification accuracy, outperforming prior methods. Routing networks showed better performance than PCGrad alone. Combining PCGrad with routing networks led to a 2.8% absolute improvement in test accuracy. PCGrad was also combined with MTAN and evaluated on the NYUv2 dataset, showing promising results. Comparisons were made with different weighting schemes, with weight uncertainty being the most effective for training MTAN. The results comparing Cross-Stitch, MTAN, and MTAN + PCGrad are presented in Table 2. MTAN with PCGrad achieves the best scores in 8 out of 9 categories in multi-task supervised learning. PCGrad can be seamlessly combined with state-of-art multi-task learning architectures to improve results. Testing on 10 and 50 manipulation tasks shows promising accuracy improvements with PCGrad. In a study comparing different methods for multi-task learning, PCGrad combined with SAC showed the best data efficiency and success rates in solving tasks. The results were measured using metrics from the Meta-World benchmark, with PCGrad successfully solving all tasks in MT10 and 70% of tasks in MT50. Training a single SAC policy and a multi-head policy was less effective, indicating that eliminating gradient interference across tasks can significantly improve performance. Eliminating gradient interference across tasks can boost multi-task RL performance. PCGrad with SAC outperforms training independent SAC agents in solving tasks in MT10 and MT50, requiring fewer samples. This approach leverages shared structure among tasks, expediting multi-task learning. Learning these tasks together opens possibilities for meta-learning, goal-conditioned RL, and generalization to novel tasks. In an ablation study, two variants of PCGrad were compared to the original method, showing that modifying both gradient directions and magnitudes is crucial for performance. PCGrad also outperformed GradNorm in scaling gradient magnitudes across tasks. GradNorm suggests modifying both gradient directions and magnitudes for good multi-task learning results. PCGrad outperforms both ablations and GradNorm, emphasizing the importance of modifying both gradient aspects. For goal-conditioned RL evaluation, a robot-pushing environment is used with goals represented as concatenations of initial puck positions and goal locations. PA is applied to predict temperature for entropy term based on the goal. The results are summarized in a plot in Figure 5. PCGrad with SAC and PA achieves the best performance in goal-conditioned RL, improving over baseline methods.

In the optimization visualizations, a parameter vector \u03b8 = [\u03b8 1 , \u03b8 2 ] \u2208 R 2 was used with task loss functions. Gradient updates were performed using the Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001. The PCGrad method was compared to using Adam alone in a multi-task learning problem involving classifying digits in different image locations. PCGrad method improves performance over Sener & Koltun (2018) by 0.13% and 0.55%. Tasks are sampled and shuffled before update steps in PCGrad to achieve symmetry. Random task order in PCGrad outperforms fixed task order in MT50 setting. In the MT50 benchmark, PCGrad with a random task order outperforms PCGrad with a fixed task order. Different architectures are used for experiments on CIFAR-100 and NYUv2 datasets, with SAC algorithm as the base for reinforcement learning experiments. Baseline algorithms are also used in the CIFAR-100 multi-task experiment. In the CIFAR-100 multi-task experiment, various baseline architectures are compared, including task-specific fully-connected layers, cross-stitch units, trainable router with multi-agent RL algorithm, and independent neural networks for each task. For the NYUv2 dataset, baselines include Single Task with vanilla SegNet, Single Task with STAN, and Multi-Task with Split Wide architecture. In the multi-task and goal-conditioned RL domain, PCGrad is applied to the vanilla SAC algorithm with task encoding as part of the input to the actor and the critic. The method is compared to the vanilla SAC without PCGrad and training actors and critics for each task individually. The pushing environment from the Meta-World is used for evaluation. The study presents results on three tasks (semantic segmentation, depth estimation, surface normal prediction) using a multi-task architecture in the pushing environment from the Meta-World benchmark. Performance comparisons with prior methods are highlighted."
