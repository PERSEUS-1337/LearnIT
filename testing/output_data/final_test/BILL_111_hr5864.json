    "content": "The \"Small Business Innovation through Investment Act of 2010\" may provide a tax credit for equity investment in small businesses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax credit for equity investment in small businesses is 30% of the qualified equity investment made by a qualified investor during the taxable year. Fifty percent of the credit is allowed in the year of investment, with 25% in the following year and another 25% in the year after that. The small business tax credit allows for 25% of the credit to be claimed in the second taxable year after the initial investment. The credit amount is capped at $500,000, reduced by $250,000 for investments in specific types of small businesses. A qualified investor is defined as someone who meets certain criteria. A qualified investor is an individual or partnership meeting specific criteria set by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A qualified equity investment involves exchanging cash for stock in a qualified small business. A qualified small business, as defined by the Small Business Act, must meet size standards and have its main operations in the United States. All related corporations and individuals under common control are considered one qualified small business. Holding stock in a qualified small business does not count as a qualified equity investment. During the qualified investor's holding period, a qualified small business must meet active business requirements by using at least 80% of its assets in the active conduct of qualified trades or businesses. Assets used in start-up activities, research and experimental expenditures, or in-house research expenses by a qualified small business are considered used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business, regardless of whether the business is qualified in the future. For qualified small businesses, assets used in start-up activities or research are considered active in a qualified trade or business, regardless of future qualification. Stock and debt in subsidiaries are disregarded, with the parent business owning a share of assets and activities. A qualified small business may fail to meet requirements if over 10% of its assets consist of stock or securities in non-subsidiary entities. A subsidiary is defined as an entity where the parent owns more than 50% of the voting power. Working capital assets held for qualified trade or business needs or investment expected to be used within 2 years for research or increasing working capital. A qualified small business must have assets used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business, with a limit of 50 percent after 2 years of existence. Additionally, no more than 10 percent of total assets can consist of real property not used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or business. The ownership, dealing in, or renting of real property is not considered active conduct of a qualified trade or business. Computer software royalties are treated as assets used in the active conduct of a trade or business. Stock acquired by a qualified investor is not a qualified equity investment if redeemed by the investor or a related person. During a 4-year period, a qualified small business issuing stock must not repurchase any stock from the qualified investor to be considered a qualified equity investment. Additionally, significant redemptions of stock by the small business within a 2-year period before issuance will disqualify it as a qualified equity investment. No credit allowed for qualified equity investment made by related party to qualified investor. Related parties are defined as individuals with specific relationships or common control in businesses. If a recapture event occurs within three years of a qualified equity investment, the tax for that year will increase by the credit recapture amount. The credit recapture amount is calculated as the decrease in credits under section 38 for prior years if no credit had been determined, plus interest at the underpayment rate. No deduction is allowed for the interest. A recapture event triggers the tax increase by the credit recapture amount within three years of a qualified equity investment. Recapture event occurs when a qualified equity investment is sold, transferred, or exchanged by the investor, not due to the business liquidation. Tax increase only applies to credits used to reduce tax liability. Unused credits affect carryforwards and carrybacks. The basis of a qualified equity investment is reduced by the amount of any credit determined under this section. Regulations require certification that the small business meets the requirements for the equity investment. The text discusses the requirements for equity investments in small businesses to qualify for a tax credit. It also mentions the termination of this section for investments made after December 31, 2016. Additionally, it states that the equity investment tax credit will be included as part of the general business credit. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by adding a new item. Sec. 45R provides a tax credit for equity investments in small businesses, effective for investments made after December 31, 2010. The Small Business Administration will oversee the implementation of this section. The Small Business Administration will receive data from the Treasury Secretary on the implementation of the equity investment tax credit under section 45R of the Internal Revenue Code. The Administrator will submit annual reports to Congress on the use of this tax credit."
