    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Prehistoric Trackways National Monument Establishment Act\" and defines key terms such as \"Monument,\" \"public land,\" and \"Secretary.\" In 1987, Paleozoic Era fossilized footprints were discovered in the Robledo Mountains in southern New Mexico, dating back approximately 280,000,000 years. The trackways contain footprints of various species, providing new insights into animal behaviors predating the dinosaurs. Public Law 101-578 provided interim protection for the site and directed the Secretary of the Interior to assess its significance. The Paleozoic Trackways site in southern New Mexico contains scientifically significant Early Permian tracksites. Despite recommendations for protection, the site remains vulnerable to vandalism and theft. Designation as a National Monument would safeguard the unique fossil resources for future generations. Establishment of the Paleozoic Trackways site in southern New Mexico. The Prehistoric Trackways National Monument is established in New Mexico to conserve important paleontological, scientific, educational, scenic, and recreational resources on approximately 5,367 acres of public land in Dona Ana County. The Secretary will prepare an official map and legal description of the Monument for Congress. The Secretary may correct errors in the legal description and map, with the map controlling in case of conflict. Copies of the map and legal description will be available for public inspection. The Secretary can make minor boundary adjustments to include additional paleontological resources in the Monument if discovered on adjacent public land. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary shall manage the Monument to conserve, protect, and enhance its resources and values in accordance with relevant laws. The Monument is part of the National Landscape Conservation System and public land adjacent to it must be managed to protect its resources. The Secretary must develop a management plan within 3 years to protect and manage the Monument, allowing for scientific research. The plan should describe appropriate uses and may incorporate decisions. The Secretary must develop a management plan within 3 years to protect and manage the Monument, allowing for scientific research, interpretation, and education. The plan should incorporate decisions from current management plans and use information from previous studies. Authorized uses of the Monument must further its established purposes. The Monument's paleontological resources are prioritized for exhibition and curation in Dona Ana County, New Mexico. The Secretary can enter cooperative agreements for this purpose. The establishment of the Monument does not change the management status of designated wilderness study areas or critical environmental concern areas within its boundary. The use of motorized vehicles in the Monument is restricted to designated roads and trails, with permits available for special events like the \"Chile Challenge\" as long as they do not harm paleontological resources. In case of conflicting laws, the more restrictive provision will apply. The Secretary can impose necessary terms and conditions on Federal land within the Monument. Any land acquired after the Act's enactment is withdrawn from public land, mining, and mineral leasing laws. Grazing may continue in designated areas, and hunting rights are preserved. In New Mexico, hunting regulations on public land within the Monument are under state jurisdiction. The Secretary can designate hunting zones and periods for safety or administration reasons. The Act does not reserve water rights for the United States within the Monument. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out the Act."
