    "content": "The report discusses the economic impact of 17 business-related tax provisions set to expire before 2025, with 13 expiring in 2020. These provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" offer various tax relief to businesses in different industries. Congress recently extended some provisions through 2020 in the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 extended temporary tax provisions, including the employer credit for paid family and medical leave, work opportunity tax credit, and New Markets Tax Credit. These provisions were set to expire in 2019 but were extended for one year. Other provisions that had expired in 2017 were extended through 2020, effectively for three years. Additionally, four other business-related provisions are set to expire in 2021 or 2022. The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act extended the housing tax credit authority for four years at a cost of $2.7 billion. The computation of adjusted taxable income for the interest deduction limit was also extended. The rum cover over was extended for five years at a cost of $0.6 billion, and the credit for maintaining railroad tracks was extended through 2022 at a cost of $1.1 billion. Congress has various options to consider regarding temporary provisions. In 2020, there are 13 business-related provisions scheduled to expire, all of which were extended in the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019. Depreciation deductions for assets like machines and buildings vary based on the asset's life, with straight-line depreciation for structures and accelerated deductions for equipment. Depreciation deductions for equipment are accelerated, with varying asset lives ranging from 3 to 39 years. The goal is to align tax depreciation with economic depreciation, allowing for earlier deductions to account for the time value of money. Expensing provisions enable immediate deduction of asset costs, with bonus depreciation allowing for full expensing of qualifying investments until 2022. The bonus depreciation allows for full expensing of investments in qualifying equipment and property, scheduled to decrease over the years. This provision impacts temporary tax benefits for various industries, such as motorsports complexes. Film and television production costs can be expensed using the income forecast method, with special rules introduced in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The provision for expensing film and television production costs aims to discourage productions in other countries. It allows immediate deduction of up to $15 million ($20 million in certain areas) in production costs. Productions must have at least 75% of compensation paid for services in the US. The expensing deduction for film and television production costs in the United States is limited to $15 million ($20 million in specific areas) for productions starting before 2008. Qualifying live theatrical productions are those with an audience capacity of not more than 3,000 (or 6,500 for seasonal productions). This provision allows for immediate deduction of production costs, benefiting by deferring tax liability. The expensing deduction for film and television production costs in the United States is limited to $15 million ($20 million in specific areas) for productions starting before 2008. This provision accelerates cost recovery by one year for independent and smaller productions. The primary policy objective is to deter productions from moving overseas. Expensing for live theatrical production costs could encourage investment in such productions and provide parity with film and television. Investment in live theatrical production costs aims to provide parity with film and television. An exception from the 39-year depreciation life exists for the theme and amusement park industry, with a seven-year recovery period for assets. Motorsports racing facilities were included in this industry, with a mandatory seven-year treatment extended through tax legislation. The provision for motorsports racing facilities, extended through tax legislation, allows for a seven-year depreciation life instead of the standard 39 years. Supporters argue that this subsidy helps make motorsports facilities more competitive and stimulates business. Taxpayers using racehorses in a trade or business must capitalize the cost of purchasing racehorses and recover the cost through annual depreciation deductions over time. The cost recovery period for racehorses is typically seven years, but a temporary provision extended the three-year recovery period to all racehorses placed in service after December 31, 2008. This provision was further extended through December 31, 2020, aligning the recovery period with the racing life of a horse. The IRS cost recovery period for racehorses was extended from three years to align with their racing life, estimated at nine years. This benefits investors purchasing horses, while breeders who race their own horses are not affected. Additionally, businesses on Indian reservations were made eligible for accelerated depreciation to increase investment in these areas. The provision for accelerated depreciation on Indian reservations was extended through December 31, 2020, to encourage investment. However, it is uncertain if this tax subsidy will effectively improve the economic status of individuals on reservations, as it benefits businesses rather than workers directly. Capital subsidies may not necessarily benefit workers and could potentially lead to lower wages if determined by regulation. Empowerment Zones (EZs) are designated areas for federal grants and tax incentives to revitalize economically distressed communities. Studies on EZs, Enterprise Communities (ECs), and Renewal Communities (RCs) show mixed results on community outcomes. Studies on Empowerment Zones (EZs), Enterprise Communities (ECs), and Renewal Communities (RCs) have shown mixed results on their impact on community outcomes. While some research suggests positive effects, others question the cost-effectiveness of these programs. The inability to link these programs to improvements in community-level outcomes does not mean they did not aid economic development. However, it has not been conclusively proven that these programs have caused a general improvement in economic conditions in the examined localities. Possible reasons for this include the relatively small size of EZ tax incentives and the focus on business owners rather than direct benefits to workers in EZs. The Empowerment Zones (EZs) were created in 1993 to provide various tax incentives such as increased exclusion of gain, issuance of qualified bonds, EZ employment credits, increased expensing for businesses in EZs, and nonrecognition of gain on EZ investments. These provisions were extended in the PATH Act of 2015 and further extended through 2020. The American Samoa economy relies on public works, tuna canning, and the private sector. The American Samoa economic development credit (EDC) offers a credit against U.S. corporate income tax for certain expenses related to conducting business in American Samoa. The American Samoa economic development credit (EDC) offers a credit against U.S. corporate income tax for qualified production activities income in American Samoa. The EDC aims to encourage eligible companies to locate, retain, or expand manufacturing operations in the territory, with StarKist being a major beneficiary. Initially enacted in 2006, the EDC has been extended multiple times and expanded to include corporations that had not previously claimed the possession tax credit. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) was enacted to encourage investment in low-income communities. It is overseen by the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund and awards tax credits to corporations that score highest in each round authorized by Congress. A CDE is an intermediary for providing loans and investments in LICs. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) incentivizes investments in low-income communities by providing tax credits to eligible investors like banks and venture capital firms. Community Development Entities (CDEs) benefit from organizing NMTC applications and structuring financing for projects, while private investors receive annual tax credits over seven years. The tax credit amounts to 39% of the qualified equity investment, generating value even if the funded project incurs losses. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) provides tax credits to investors like banks and venture capital firms for investing in low-income communities. Despite some losses in funded projects, the tax credit can still yield positive returns for private financiers. Critics argue that the NMTC primarily benefits corporations and higher-income investors, but studies have shown that it can lead to significant reductions in poverty and unemployment rates in targeted areas. Additionally, the NMTC's impact is most beneficial when it represents new investment in the U.S. economy rather than a relocation of existing investments. The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) has been extended multiple times since its initial authorization expired in 2007. The latest extension through 2020 allows for a maximum allocation authority of $5 billion. The NMTC aims to attract investment to low-income communities and has shown to reduce poverty and unemployment rates in targeted areas. The Indian employment tax credit is a 20% credit for qualified wages and health insurance costs paid by employers for enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses. The credit is limited to services within an Indian reservation and is incremental to 1993 wages and health insurance costs. The Indian employment credit, enacted in 1993, is a 20% credit for wages and health insurance costs paid to enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses within an Indian reservation. The credit is not available for wages exceeding $30,000 ($50,000 in 2019) and the employer must reduce the deduction for wages by the credit amount. The credit has been regularly extended, with the most recent extension through 2020 in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. Some propose updating the base year to simplify record-keeping and restore the credit's incremental design. The Indian employment credit, enacted in 1993, provides a 20% credit for wages and health insurance costs paid to enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses within an Indian reservation. The credit has been extended through 2020. Additionally, taxpayers employing miners in underground mines in the US can claim a tax credit for mine rescue team training expenses, limited to 20% of training costs per employee or $10,000. The employee must be a full-time miner eligible to serve as a mine rescue team member. The mine rescue team training credit, enacted in 2006, was extended through 2020. It was a response to the Sago Mine disaster and subsequent coal mining fatalities. Fatalities have decreased over the years, with 2010 having the highest number at 29 and 2016 the lowest at 8. In 2019, there were 11 coal mining fatalities. The fatality rate in coal mining has been decreasing over time, partly due to a decline in coal production and miners. A credit for mine rescue team training incentivizes investment in training and reduces compliance costs. Another credit for paid family and medical leave can be claimed by employers providing wages to employees under FMLA, with a credit amount of up to 25% of wages paid. The employer credit for paid family and medical leave can be claimed for up to 25% of PFML wages paid to qualifying employees. The credit is limited to employees with incomes below a certain threshold and cannot exceed 12 weeks per employee per year. To claim the credit, employers must have a written policy in place that includes all qualifying employees and cannot exclude certain classifications. The employer credit for paid family and medical leave, established in the 2017 tax revision, was extended through 2020. The effectiveness of the credit in increasing access to PFML remains uncertain, as some employers may already provide PFML without the credit. Employers could potentially substitute credit-eligible PFML for other forms of leave. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a nonrefundable wage credit aimed at increasing job opportunities for disadvantaged individuals. Eligible hires include those receiving TANF or food stamp benefits, ex-felons, and certain veterans. Employers can claim a 40% income tax credit for eligible hires who remain on the payroll for at least 400 hours. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) allows employers to claim a 40% income tax credit for eligible hires who work at least 400 hours. The maximum credit is $2,400 for most hires, with varying maximum wages for eligible veterans and summer youth hires. A 25% credit is available for hires working at least 120 hours but fewer than 400 hours. The WOTC originated from the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit and was created as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) was initially available from 1978 to 1994 and has been extended multiple times since then. The credit aims to incentivize employers to hire disadvantaged individuals by offsetting training costs and potential lower productivity. It was most recently extended through 2020. Studies have evaluated its effectiveness in increasing job opportunities for targeted groups. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) aims to incentivize employers to hire disadvantaged individuals by offsetting costs. Studies show limited impact on hiring decisions but benefits for certain groups like disabled veterans and long-term welfare recipients. Evidence does not support claims of employers replacing workers to take advantage of the credit. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-222) allows U.S. corporations to reduce taxes by shifting income from high-tax to lower-taxed foreign subsidiaries. Income earned abroad by foreign-incorporated subsidiaries of U.S. parents can be taxed at full rates, not taxed, or not taxed at all. Certain types of income, known as Subpart F income, must be taxed at the full rate if earned by controlled foreign corporations. Foreign taxes paid on this income can be credited against U.S. taxes imposed. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 allows U.S. corporations to reduce taxes by shifting income to lower-taxed foreign subsidiaries. Income earned abroad by foreign-incorporated subsidiaries of U.S. parents can be taxed at full rates, not taxed, or not taxed at all. Subpart F income must be taxed at the full rate if earned by controlled foreign corporations, with credits allowed for foreign taxes paid. GILTI provision taxes foreign-source income at half the corporate tax rate, with a scheduled increase to 13.125% after 2025. Subpart F income includes dividends, interest, rent, and royalty payments between related firms to prevent income shifting and tax avoidance. For example, a U.S. parent's subsidiary in a no-tax country could lend money to a high-tax country subsidiary, shifting income. Subpart F taxes this income at full rates to prevent avoidance methods. Methods of avoiding Subpart F taxation were simplified in 1997 with the introduction of \"check-the-box\" regulations, allowing firms to elect treatment as an unincorporated entity to avoid Subpart F income classification. Despite initial regulations to disallow this practice, they were withdrawn after protests. If a high-tax subsidiary is not a direct subsidiary of the U.S. parent but a second-tier subsidiary of a Cayman Islands subsidiary, the Cayman Islands subsidiary can elect to avoid Subpart F taxation. The \"check-the-box\" regulations allow a Cayman Islands subsidiary to treat a high-tax subsidiary as a disregarded entity, combining them into a single firm. This avoids Subpart F taxation by not recognizing income at the Cayman Islands level. The look-through rules expand the scope of check-the-box, originally enacted in 2005 and extended through 2020. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-94) introduced check-the-box rules, which may not apply in all circumstances. The look-through rule expands on this planning strategy by incorporating it into the tax code, allowing related firms under common control to benefit. The look-through rules allow related firms under common control to redeploy earnings without U.S. tax consequences, potentially reducing taxes collected by foreign governments. This provision offers flexibility but may undermine Subpart F's purpose of preventing tax avoidance. The temporary provisions modifying excise taxes on alcoholic beverages were enacted through 2019 in the 2017 tax revision. The uniform capitalization rules require certain costs to be added to inventory or property costs and deducted in the future. The temporary excise tax modification provisions exempt aging periods for alcoholic beverages from the production period for UNICAP interest capitalization rules, leading to shorter production periods. Small brewers producing no more than 2 million barrels annually are subject to reduced excise tax rates, with a rate of $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels. Beer importers and large producers meeting certain requirements may also qualify for reduced taxation rates. Producers meeting requirements may qualify for reduced excise tax rates on beer and wine based on alcohol content and carbonation levels. Beer tax is due upon removal from the brewery, with exemptions for transfers between commonly owned breweries or to unrelated brewers who accept tax responsibility. Wine is taxed at varying rates per wine gallon depending on alcohol content, with still wines taxed between $1.07 to $3.15 per w.g. and sparkling wines at $3.40 per w.g. The excise tax rates for sparkling wines and artificially carbonated wines are $3.40 and $3.30 per wine gallon respectively. Small domestic wineries producing up to 150,000 wine gallons per year may qualify for a tax credit of up to $0.90 per wine gallon for the first 100,000 wine gallons removed. The credit is phased out for production exceeding 150,000 wine gallons. Temporary provisions allow the credit to be claimed by domestic and foreign producers, including sparkling wine producers. Additionally, a $1.00 credit per wine gallon may be available for the first 30,000 wine gallons removed annually by eligible wine producers or importers. The excise tax rates for sparkling wines and artificially carbonated wines are $3.40 and $3.30 per wine gallon respectively. Small domestic wineries producing up to 150,000 wine gallons per year may qualify for a tax credit of up to $0.90 per wine gallon for the first 100,000 wine gallons removed. The credit is phased out for production exceeding 150,000 wine gallons. Temporary provisions allow the credit to be claimed by domestic and foreign producers, including sparkling wine producers. Additionally, a $1.00 credit per wine gallon may be available for the first 30,000 wine gallons removed annually by eligible wine producers or importers. For hard cider, the credit rates are adjusted to $0.062 per gallon, $0.056 per gallon, and $0.033 per gallon. Mead is taxed according to wine excise tax rates depending on its alcohol and carbonation content. Under the temporary provision, mead and certain sparkling wines are to be taxed at the lowest rate applicable to still wine of $1.07 per wine gallon. The excise tax rates for sparkling wines and artificially carbonated wines are $3.40 and $3.30 per wine gallon respectively. Small domestic wineries producing up to 150,000 wine gallons per year may qualify for a tax credit of up to $0.90 per wine gallon for the first 100,000 wine gallons removed. Distilled spirits are taxed at a rate of $13.50 per proof gallon (ppg) of production, with temporary provisions lowering the rate to $2.70 ppg on the first 100,000 proof gallons. The low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) program, created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, is a federal policy tool for affordable rental housing development. LIHTCs are awarded to developers to offset construction costs in exchange for reserving units for lower-income households. State housing finance agencies primarily administer the program by awarding tax credits to developers. In 2020, states can award tax credits based on population, with a minimum authority of $3,217,500. This reflects a temporary increase due to the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, equal to 12.5% above previous levels. The increase is in effect through 2021. For more information on LIHTC, refer to CRS Report RS22389 by Mark P. Keightley. The revision limited deductible interest to 30% of adjusted taxable income for businesses with gross receipts greater than $25 million. Certain exceptions apply, such as floor plan financing for motor vehicles and certain real property and farming businesses can elect out of this limit but must adopt a slower depreciation method. The thin capitalization rules aim to prevent large multinational businesses from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions. After the 2017 tax revision, the limit on deductible interest for businesses with gross receipts over $25 million is set at 30% of adjusted taxable income. The measure of income changed from EBITDA to EBIT, resulting in a smaller base for interest deductions. Businesses with depreciable assets benefit more from the current rules, but leasing assets from financial institutions could help mitigate the impact of the deduction changes. The change in base for deductible interest for businesses with gross receipts over $25 million is projected to increase revenue significantly, with an estimated gain of $10 billion annually. The excise tax on rum is $13.50 per proof gallon, with $10.50 per proof gallon of imported rum transferred to the Treasuries of Puerto Rico. For more details on the interest limitation, refer to CRS Report R45186. The excise tax on rum is transferred to the Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. The transfer amount has been increased to $13.25, with no restrictions on how the revenues can be used. The cover-over provisions date back to 1917 for PR and 1954 for USVI, with a cap of $10.50 imposed in 1984. Temporary increases to the cap were made in 1993. The rum cover-over provisions have been extended through 2021, with a cap of $13.25. Qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures qualify for a 50% business tax credit, limited to $3,500 per mile of track owned or leased. The tax credit for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures is available to smaller railroads and individuals using these facilities. The credit is based on gross expenditures and cannot be carried back before 2005. It is allowed against the alternative minimum tax and was enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, with an extension added by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The tax credit for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures, initially enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, was extended through 2022 by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. This provision aims to lower the cost of track maintenance for regional and local railroads, covering half the costs for firms and individuals with sufficient tax liability. The purpose of the credit is to encourage the rehabilitation of short-line railroads, which play a crucial role in transporting agricultural products. The deregulation of railroads in the early 1980s led to the abandonment of short-line railroads. Advocates are concerned about the use of heavier 286,000-pound cars and suggest preserving local lines to reduce truck traffic. A tax credit is seen as more achievable than grants for rehabilitation and improvement, as indicated by the Federal Railroad Administration. Limited access to bank loans is also a challenge for these firms."
