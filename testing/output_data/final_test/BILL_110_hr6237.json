    "content": "The \"Tax Relief for Long-Term Care Act of 2008\" provides a credit for long-term care insurance premiums and for taxpayers with long-term care needs under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Tax Relief for Long-Term Care Act of 2008\" offers a credit against taxes for eligible long-term care premiums paid during the taxable year for coverage under a qualified long-term care insurance contract. The credit also includes a long-term care amount multiplied by the number of applicable individuals for whom the taxpayer is an eligible caregiver. The \"Tax Relief for Long-Term Care Act of 2008\" provides a credit for long-term care premiums paid during the taxable year. The long-term care amount varies from $1,000 to $3,000 depending on the year. The credit is reduced by $100 for each $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income exceeding the threshold amount. Adjusted gross income is defined as income increased by any excluded amounts under specific sections. The threshold amount is $150,000 for joint returns and $75,000 for other cases. The reduction in the long-term care credit is coordinated with the threshold amount. Dollar amounts are indexed for inflation after 2009. The medical care cost adjustment for the taxable year is determined based on specific criteria, with any increase rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. An \"applicable individual\" is defined as someone certified by a physician before the tax return due date. Individuals with long-term care needs must be certified by a physician within a specific time frame to qualify for the medical care cost adjustment. Individuals aged 6 or older who are unable to perform at least 3 daily living activities without substantial assistance or require supervision due to severe cognitive impairment may qualify for the medical care cost adjustment. Individuals aged 2 to 6 years who are unable to perform at least 2 daily living activities without substantial assistance may qualify for medical care cost adjustment. Individuals under 2 years of age with severe health conditions or requiring specific durable medical equipment may qualify for caregiver tax benefits. Eligible caregivers include the taxpayer, their spouse, and individuals for whom the taxpayer can claim a deduction. The taxpayer can claim a deduction under section 151(c) for the taxable year if certain requirements are met, including a residency test where the individual resides in the taxpayer's home. The taxpayer can claim a deduction under section 151(c) for the taxable year if the individual resides in the taxpayer's home for over half the year or the entire year. If multiple individuals are eligible caregivers for the same person, the taxpayer will be treated as the eligible caregiver if each individual (other than the taxpayer) files a written statement. If individuals are eligible caregivers for the same person, the taxpayer can claim a deduction under section 151(c) if each individual (other than the taxpayer) files a written declaration stating they will not claim the credit. If not, the individual with the highest adjusted gross income will be treated as the eligible caregiver. Married individuals filing separately will have the determination made based on their circumstances. The taxpayer must include the name, taxpayer identification number, and physician identification number of the applicable individual to claim the credit. The credit is not allowed for a taxable year less than 12 months, except in the case of the taxpayer's death. The taxpayer must provide specific identification numbers to claim the credit for long-term care needs. The credit is not allowed for a taxable year of less than 12 months. Coordination with other deductions is also specified. The table of sections for tax credits is amended to include a new item after section 25D. Section 25E introduces a credit for long-term care insurance premiums and for taxpayers with long-term care needs, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2008."
