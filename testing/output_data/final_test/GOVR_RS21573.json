    "content": "Four types of tax-advantaged accounts (FSAs, HRAs, HSAs, MSAs) can be used for medical expenses like deductibles and copayments. The report compares these accounts and their prevalence, along with tax deductions for medical expenses. Tax filers can use tax-advantaged accounts to pay for qualifying medical expenses, providing tax savings as the contributed income is not part of adjusted gross income. This income is not taxed, including interest earned in the account, and no itemized deductions are needed. Double counting is prohibited, and expenses funded through these accounts cannot be declared as itemized deductions. Qualifying medical expenses are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and include deductibles, copayments, and services not covered by insurance. Medical care must primarily alleviate or prevent a physical or mental defect. Examples include breast reconstruction surgery, disabled dependent care, and hospital services. General health expenses like exercise equipment and vitamins are not qualifying medical expenses. The curr_chunk discusses qualifying medical expenses for various accounts such as FSAs, detailing what expenses are covered and not covered. It also mentions that FSAs are employer-established arrangements that reimburse employees for qualifying expenses. Employees can enter into salary reduction agreements to contribute to their flexible spending accounts in compliance with Section 125(i) of the IRC. Contributions are limited to $2,500 per employee annually, with adjustments for inflation. Married couples can each contribute up to $2,500 if both are eligible. The full annual FSA amount is available at the start of the year, allowing employees to use the funds for qualifying medical expenses even if they have not contributed the full amount yet. Employees can contribute up to $2,500 annually to their flexible spending accounts, with adjustments for inflation. Employers can choose policies for unused contributions, including forfeiture, a grace period for additional claims, or a carry-over period for up to $500. Employees can contribute up to $2,500 annually to their flexible spending accounts. They have the option to transfer up to $500 in unused contributions into an FSA for the next plan year. FSA contributions are not subject to income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes, making them a preferred choice for employees with anticipated health expenses. FSAs funded by salary reduction agreements are governed by Section 125 of the IRC, exempting contributions from taxes. Health reimbursement accounts (HRAs) are employer-established accounts used to reimburse employees for qualifying medical expenses. Contributions to HRAs are not subject to income or employment taxes. HRAs are governed by separate provisions of the Code, not by cafeteria plan provisions in Section 125. For example, employer-funded FSAs for health care are tax-exempt under Sections 105 and 106. Rules regarding FSAs were initially included in proposed regulations by the IRS in 1984 and 1989. HRAs differ from FSAs in several important ways. Employers may restrict eligible medical expenses, funding is not required until employees use it, reimbursement amounts can be limited, and unused balances can be carried over indefinitely. HRAs allow for indefinite balance carryovers, with limits set by employers and funds can be used for qualified medical expenses. Employees can take HRA funds with them when changing jobs or retiring if the employer allows it. HRAs are governed by Sections 105 and 106 of the IRC, providing tax benefits. HSAs are tax-exempt accounts for medical expenses, established by individuals with a high deductible health plan. To be eligible for a Health Savings Account (HSA), an individual must have a high deductible health plan (HDHP) with certain requirements, including a minimum deductible of $1,250 for self-only coverage and $2,500 for family coverage in 2013. HSA contributions are limited to $3,250 for self-only coverage and $6,450 for family coverage in 2013, with an additional $1,000 allowed for individuals aged 55 and older. HSA holders age 55 and older can contribute an additional $1,000; contributions are not indexed for inflation. Contributions made by employers are tax-exempt, and account owners can deduct their contributions from adjusted gross income. Withdrawals for qualifying medical expenses are tax-free, while non-medical withdrawals are taxable with a 20% penalty, except in cases of disability, death, or reaching age 65. Unused balances can be carried over from year to year. HSAs, authorized by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, allow for contributions to be carried over without limit. MSAs, a precursor to HSAs, require holders to have an HDHP and no other coverage. Employer contributions are tax-exempt, while account owner contributions are deductible. Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free, with non-medical withdrawals subject to taxation and a 20% penalty, except in cases of disability, death, or reaching age 65. MSAs, a precursor to HSAs, have higher minimum deductible levels and lower contribution limits. MSAs were authorized by HIPAA in 1996, with a limited number allowed to be created. No new MSAs could be created after 2007, except for employees joining an existing MSA program. Most rules for MSAs are in Section 220 of the IRC. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits health insurance plans from capping benefits. The IRS allows HRAs integrated with other employer-provided coverage but not stand-alone HRAs after January 1, 2014. Stand-alone HRAs, like funding for individual market coverage, will not be permitted. The ACA prohibits health insurance plans from capping benefits. HRAs funded by employers can be used to purchase coverage on the individual market. Data limitations make it challenging to compare account usage across different types. Published data are more accessible on account access than on enrollment. Limited data are available on the number of MSAs. The report presents enrollment measures for the four account types, but data comparability is limited. The National Compensation Survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 40% of civilian workers had access to health care FSAs in 2012. Larger firms with 100 or more workers had a higher access rate of 53%, while smaller businesses had a lower rate of 20%. Accessibility of HSAs is tied to having HDHPs. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 26% of firms offering health benefits also offered HSAs in 2012. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2012, 26% of firms offering health benefits provided an HSA-qualified HDHP. The percentage of firms offering an HDHP and an HRA remained relatively stable at 4% in 2010, 7% in 2011, and 5% in 2012. The Employee Benefit Research Institute's surveys showed a steady increase in the number of adults with either an HSA or an HRA, reaching 11.6 million in 2012. The number of adults with either an HSA or an HRA steadily increased from 5.4 million in 2010 to 8.5 million in 2011, and finally to 11.6 million in 2012."
