    "content": "The \"Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013\" allows for permits to construct and manage artificial reefs. The National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 is amended to redesignate subsections and specify actions on permits for artificial reefs under various Acts. The Shelf Lands Act requires consultation with relevant parties, adherence to established criteria, clear ownership of construction materials, maintenance responsibility, and financial liability assurance for artificial reef projects. The Shelf Lands Act mandates consultation, criteria adherence, material ownership, maintenance responsibility, and financial liability assurance for artificial reef projects. Directors must expedite application reviews and render decisions within 150 days. Commanding General must also promulgate regulations within 180 days of the Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013 enactment. The Commanding General must designate at least 20 artificial reef planning areas within 1 year of the enactment of the Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013, in consultation with Directors and State agencies. Six of these areas must be located outside the seaward boundary of Texas. Regulations must expedite final application reviews, with decisions made within 120 days of submission. The Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013 requires the designation of at least 20 artificial reef planning areas, with specific allocations for locations outside the seaward boundaries of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. Existing artificial reef planning areas can be included if modified to meet the Act's requirements. The Directors, in consultation with the Commanding General and State agencies, determine boundaries and proximity to shoreline for artificial reef planning areas. They ensure sites are reasonably close to the shoreline and include as many platforms as practical. The appropriate size and boundaries for each site are also determined. The Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013 mandates that each artificial reef planning area must consist of at least 12 contiguous lease blocks. The Director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement will regulate the distance between platforms used as artificial reefs within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013 requires artificial reef planning areas to have a maximum distance of 2 miles between platforms. Artificial reef sites must be located at water depths of at least 100 feet and not greater than 200 feet, with additional sites at depths greater than 200 feet. The Commanding General, in consultation with Directors and State agencies, designates artificial reef planning areas at a water depth not exceeding 100 feet. Permittees must construct artificial reefs in designated areas and comply with regulations from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. The Commanding General designates artificial reef planning areas at a water depth not exceeding 100 feet. Permittees must submit notice identifying 20 percent of platforms to be used as artificial reefs to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and State agencies. A person must include the artificial reef planning area and site for donated platforms in their final application, meeting depth requirements. If the chosen area is full, approval from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement or State agency is needed. The person must choose a different area if the artificial reef planning area is full. Regulations state that artificial reef planning areas do not need to be filled to capacity before establishing another area. The Secretary will establish regulations for the minimum water depth required for an artificial reef. The Secretary will evaluate artificial reef sites to ensure proper marking and review applications within 30 days to confirm markings are in place if the water depth is not greater than 85 feet. The Artificial Reef Promotion Act of 2013 requires markings on nautical charts for artificial reef planning areas and sites, providing mariners with location notice. The Director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement will review the implementation within 3 years of enactment. The Director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement will review artificial reef planning areas to assess the use of decommissioned platforms as artificial reefs. Regional Supervisors will prioritize applications for using decommissioned platforms as artificial reefs. Existing regulations governing decommissioning or removal of platforms not intended for artificial reefs will remain in effect. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. Section 206 of the National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 is amended to include definitions related to artificial reefs in the Gulf of Mexico, enhancing fishery resources and fishing opportunities. This includes terms like artificial reef, artificial reef planning area, and artificial reef site. The term 'artificial reef site' refers to an area within an artificial reef planning area cleared for decommissioned platforms to be used as artificial reefs. The term 'Commanding General' refers to the Commanding General of the Corps of Engineers. 'Decommissioning' includes moving platforms to an artificial reef site. The term 'Directors' refers to the Directors of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. 'Final application' is a submission for disposing of or removing a platform. A final application is a submission to dispose of or remove an offshore oil and gas platform in the Gulf of Mexico for use as an artificial reef under specific regulations. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. SAVINGS CLAUSES. Section 208 of the National Fishing Enhancement Act of 1984 is amended to clarify that the Act does not hinder the transfer of liability for platforms donated as artificial reefs, or impact existing lease terms. It also states that platforms do not need to remain above water and owners do not need to notify parties other than specified agencies before decommissioning."
