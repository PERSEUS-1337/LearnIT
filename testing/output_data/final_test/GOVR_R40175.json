    "content": "The United States asserts jurisdiction over the Outer Continental Shelf up to 200 nautical miles from the coast, in accordance with the UNCLOS. This allows for sovereignty over the air space, water, seabed, and subsoil within its territorial sea. Despite not ratifying UNCLOS, the U.S. generally follows its principles. The contiguous zone extends to 24 nautical miles, allowing regulation for protection and enforcement purposes. The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 granted coastal states title to lands beneath coastal waters up to 3 geographical miles from the shore. States can regulate within this area, subject to federal authority for certain purposes. The federal government has jurisdiction over waters beyond this limit, including the potential locations for offshore wind farms up to the Exclusive Economic Zone boundary. The federal authority is limited by the right of free passage and state jurisdiction under the Submerged Lands Act. States have a regulatory role in wind energy projects in coastal waters under the Coastal Zone Management Act, promoting habitat protection and sustainable development. Approved state programs receive federal assistance for conservation measures and pollution control. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires federal and permitted activities to comply with state programs, including addressing water pollution sources. Congress amended the CZMA to include state review of impacts on coastal zones from actions in federal waters. States have authority to ensure consistency between federal projects in federal waters and state regulations. State waters projects, including cables for power transmission, are subject to state regulations. Coastal zone regulation varies among states under the CZMA. The CZMA establishes regulatory frameworks for coastal zone management, with states having authority to implement criteria and standards. Some states consolidate authority in one agency, like New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. Other states operate programs under networks of parallel agencies with defined roles. Offshore wind energy projects are subject to comprehensive regulation with permitting authority spread among multiple state and local agencies. Federal permission is required for the use of federal lands, with the Department of the Interior overseeing onshore wind projects on federal public lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a federal statute governing offshore wind energy development. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established federal permitting authority for offshore wind energy projects, addressing conflicts with previous regulatory regimes led by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Act clarified jurisdiction over potential offshore wind projects on the Outer Continental Shelf Lands. Section 388 of EPAct amended the OCSLA to establish federal authority for offshore wind energy projects, granting the Secretary of the Interior the power to approve leases, easements, and rights-of-way on the OCS for activities like wind energy development. A memorandum of understanding with FERC confirmed the Secretary's exclusive jurisdiction. The EPAct amended the OCSLA to grant the Secretary of the Interior authority over offshore wind energy projects on the OCS. The legislation does not clearly specify which agency should lead federal permitting and NEPA analysis, but suggests DOI has primary responsibility. Other federal agencies retain jurisdiction over specific issues like species impacts. The EPAct amended the OCSLA to grant the Secretary of the Interior authority over offshore wind energy projects on the OCS. Section 388 directs DOI to consult with other agencies for leasing, easements, and right-of-way granting. DOI is responsible for coordinating with relevant federal agencies and establishing a system of royalties for property interests. Leases are issued competitively, with some exceptions. The EPAct amended the OCSLA to grant the Secretary of the Interior authority over offshore wind energy projects on the OCS. Leases for property interests are issued competitively, with exceptions, and the Secretary can determine the duration and suspend/cancel leases. Section 388 of EPAct outlines the allocation of royalties and payments among states based on project proximity to their offshore boundaries. States within 15 miles of a project's center are entitled to a revenue share. Multiple states may receive a portion of revenues depending on project location. The EPAct amended the OCSLA to grant the Secretary of the Interior authority over offshore wind energy projects on the OCS, including regulation of impacts, financial security requirements, and restoration obligations for lease holders. The EPAct amended the OCSLA to grant the Secretary of the Interior authority over offshore wind energy projects on the OCS, including regulation of impacts, financial security requirements, and restoration obligations for lease holders. The Secretary can impose additional requirements to protect public interests. State consultation is also required in the permitting process, ensuring coordination with local governments. The law does not affect states' jurisdiction over submerged lands. The Minerals Management Service issued a final rule in 2009 for OCS energy projects, creating limited and commercial leases for renewable energy production. The rule sets payment amounts, including lease payments and royalties, for parties involved in OCS renewable energy projects. The rulemaking for OCS renewable energy projects establishes revenue allocation with affected states. BOEM shares 27% of revenues as mandated by EPAct. Revenues are shared with states within 15 miles of project center. Sharing is based on lease area activity at the end of the fiscal year. The configuration of the lease area at the end of the fiscal year determines state payments for that year under Section 388 of EPAct, which includes wind energy production in federal waters. Certain actions are exempt from specific requirements, such as not needing to resubmit documents or reauthorize actions for projects with offshore test facilities or issued proposals by a public authority. The provision under Section 388 of EPAct exempts certain projects from the need to resubmit documents or reauthorize actions if they were requested by a public entity or associated with an existing offshore test facility. However, any unauthorized actions after August 8, 2005, would still need to comply with property interest acquisition provisions. Section 388 of EPAct exempts certain projects from resubmitting documents or reauthorizing actions if requested by a public entity or associated with an existing offshore test facility. Exceptions to competitive basis requirements exist if there is no competitive interest or if the project has limited scope. Various laws pre-dating EPAct still apply to offshore wind energy development, with Section 388 not affecting the jurisdiction of federal or state agencies. State roles under CZMA and Corps permitting authority under RHA remain intact. Other federal laws are relevant in the permitting process. The permitting process for offshore wind energy development involves environmental review mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental consequences of their actions through various levels of analysis. Certain actions with minimal environmental impact are exempt from NEPA documents, known as \"categorical exclusions.\" If uncertainty exists about environmental impact, an environmental assessment (EA) may be prepared. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) mandates environmental review for offshore wind energy development projects. Agencies prepare environmental assessments (EAs) to evaluate impacts, leading to a \"finding of no significant impact\" (FONSI) if no significant effects are found. Major actions with significant environmental impact require an environmental impact statement (EIS) detailing project analysis and alternatives. NEPA does not dictate a specific course of action but ensures environmental considerations are disclosed for public input. The Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Alternative Energy Development and Production on the Outer Continental Shelf was published by MMS in late 2007. It includes an analysis of impacts on various resources and establishes a baseline for offshore renewable energy leasing. Additional environmental review will be required for future site-specific projects on the Outer Continental Shelf. Certain federal agencies have independent sources of jurisdiction over specific ocean resources, in addition to the role interested parties and cooperating agencies may play under NEPA. They would likely be involved in permitting offshore wind energy facilities. Relevant authorities include the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), which set parameters for federal activities that could harm designated species. The ESA prohibits \"taking\" listed species, defined broadly as actions that harm or harass them. Federal agencies undertaking actions impacting listed species are subject to Section 7 of the ESA. Federal agencies impacting listed species must consult with FWS or NMFS under Section 7 of the ESA. The consultation process determines if a listed species or critical habitat is present, requiring a biological assessment. If adverse effects are possible, formal consultation and a biological opinion are necessary to analyze the impact of the agency action. The biological opinion assesses the effects of agency actions on species and habitats, determining if they jeopardize survival. Reasonable alternatives may be suggested to allow projects to proceed. Incidental takings of listed species may be permitted without penalties under the ESA. Non-government entities can take a listed species with an Incidental Take Permit from FWS or NMFS under the ESA. To qualify, a habitat conservation plan must be prepared to monitor and mitigate impacts. The MMPA prohibits taking marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. citizens, as well as importing marine mammals into the United States. Administered by the Department of Commerce. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) prohibits taking marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. citizens, as well as importing marine mammals into the United States. Administered jointly by the Department of Commerce (NOAA/NMFS) and the Department of the Interior (FWS), the MMPA allows for incidental taking of small numbers of marine mammals under certain conditions. Regulations establish procedures for authorization and review of such incidental takes. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) implements U.S. obligations under treaties for bird protection. It prohibits taking, killing, possession, or trafficking of migratory birds. Unlike other wildlife laws, MBTA imposes strict liability and allows waivers for certain activities. The Secretary of the Interior can authorize taking of migratory birds, and permits are issued by the FWS. The MBTA regulations provide exceptions for permits for various purposes, including import/export, banding, marking, and scientific collection. General permits for special uses require a showing of benefit to migratory birds or important research reasons. Unlike other wildlife laws, the MBTA does not explicitly authorize incidental taking of birds, such as by wind energy projects. FWS has not set specific regulations for unintentional harm caused by wind turbines, raising questions about the current permitting process. The FWS permits 30-year projects with low eagle risk under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. Voluntary guidelines exist for minimizing wildlife impacts from wind turbines, but compliance does not guarantee immunity from MBTA violations. Enforcement discretion has been used for good faith efforts. Interest in offshore wind energy is growing with projects in development. The United States is developing a legal framework for offshore wind energy projects, with the DOI granting permits for development. States may also have a role in permitting under existing federal law."
