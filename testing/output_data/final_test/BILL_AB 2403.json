Section 11834.02 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define \"alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility\" as a place providing 24-hour residential nonmedical services for adults recovering from alcohol or drug-related issues. This includes mothers over 18, emancipated minors, and individuals under 18 who have acquired emancipation status. Integral facilities, as defined in this chapter, refer to two or more facilities serving seven or more persons under the control of the same owner or management, providing housing in one facility and services in another, or through staff assigned to multiple facilities. An alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facility can serve adolescents with a waiver from the department. The Health and Safety Code is amended to issue licenses to different types of recovery facilities upon meeting requirements. The Health and Safety Code requires timely submission of applications, fire clearance, and fees for licensing of alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facilities. Failure to comply may result in termination of licensure review or denial of application. The state policy encourages the development of sufficient recovery facilities based on local needs. The Health and Safety Code requires timely submission of applications, fire clearance, and fees for licensing of alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facilities. Failure to comply may result in termination of licensure review or denial of application. For any licensing application submitted on or after January 1, 2017, the department may deny an application for a new facility license if the proposed location is in proximity to an existing facility that would result in overconcentration, defined as two or more facilities within 300 feet of each other. Based on special local needs, the department may approve a separation distance of less than 300 feet for facilities if it does not conflict with city or county regulations. Cities or counties can request denial of a license due to overconcentration of facilities. The department must notify the planning agency at least 45 days before approving a new facility application. These regulations apply to all local public entities. An alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facility serving six or fewer persons is considered a residential use of property.

Local ordinances cannot classify it as a boarding house or similar business, but restrictions on building features can still apply. (d) This section clarifies that local ordinances can apply to alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facilities for health and safety, building standards, and environmental impact. However, these facilities serving six or fewer persons cannot be distinguished from single-family dwellings or their residents. (e) Such facilities do not require special permits or zoning clearances beyond what is needed for a single-family residence in the same zone. The text clarifies that local ordinances can apply to alcoholism or drug abuse recovery facilities for health and safety, building standards, and environmental impact. Facilities serving six or fewer persons are not considered a change of occupancy for building codes. Cities and counties can pursue administrative appeals or seek judicial review of licensing decisions for these facilities. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as determined in Section 4."
