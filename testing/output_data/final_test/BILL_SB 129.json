    "title": "SB 129",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2196 of the Elections Code is amended to allow individuals with a valid California driver's license or state ID to register to vote online through the Secretary of State's website. The affidavit submitted electronically is effective upon receipt and the applicant must affirm the truth of the information provided. The Secretary of State requires individuals to submit their California driver's license or state ID number, date of birth, last four digits of their social security number, and any other necessary information to establish identity when submitting an electronic affidavit for voter registration. Immediate verification is provided upon submission. The Secretary of State requires verification of identity for voter registration, including matching the applicant's driver's license or state ID number and date of birth with records from the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Department of Motor Vehicles must use the electronic voter registration system to comply with the National Voter Registration Act. The Department of Motor Vehicles and the Secretary of State will develop a process for transferring electronic signatures and required information for voter registration. If unable to submit electronically, applicants can complete the registration affidavit online, print it, and mail it in. This chapter will be in effect once certain conditions are met. The chapter will be in effect when the Secretary of State certifies compliance with the Help America Vote Act or when specific conditions are met, including approval for online voter registration funding and infrastructure development by the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Secretary of State. All county election management systems have been modified to receive and store electronic voter registration information from the Secretary of State for voter registration in California. The Secretary of State's office is exempt from certain information technology requirements and project approvals for implementing this chapter quickly."
