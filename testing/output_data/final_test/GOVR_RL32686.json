    "content": "The ongoing international efforts to combat Afghanistan's narcotics trade are challenged by the fact that Afghanistan supplies over 90% of the world's illicit opium. Opium poppy cultivation and drug trafficking are seen as serious threats to the country's security and stability, impacting post-9/11 counterterrorism and reconstruction efforts. Counternarcotics policy has become a focal point in debates about U.S. strategic objectives in Afghanistan, with concerns about balancing counterterrorism and counternarcotics goals. Counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan involve cooperation with security commanders, tribal leaders, and local officials involved in the narcotics trade. The challenge lies in balancing efforts to limit poppy cultivation while maintaining positive relationships with farmers. The introduction of democracy has led to the appointment of narcotics-associated individuals to public office. Combatting the opium trade faces difficulties due to its profitability and integration into the country's economic, political, and social fabric. The opium trade in Afghanistan is deeply intertwined with the country's economic, political, and social fabric. Efforts to combat opium production involve various strategies such as public awareness campaigns, judicial reforms, and drug interdiction operations. Questions about the effectiveness and resource requirements of counternarcotics policies in Afghanistan are being debated by the 111th Congress. Opium production has become a persistent issue in Afghanistan despite ongoing efforts to address it over the past 30 years. Despite ongoing efforts to combat opium production in Afghanistan over the past 30 years, the country has seen a significant increase in opium poppy cultivation and production. In 2006-2007, Afghanistan produced a world record opium poppy crop, accounting for 93% of the global supply. While there was a slight reduction in cultivation and output in 2007-2008, the issue remains a persistent challenge despite international engagement. In 2007-2008, poppy cultivation and opium output decreased due to counternarcotics efforts, including bans and eradication. Further reductions were seen in 2008-2009, attributed to bad weather, interdiction, and improved agricultural assistance. Estimates for 2010 suggest stable production, with crop disease and weather affecting output. Reductions in cultivation were noted in some provinces, while large-scale cultivation continued in conflict-ridden areas. Opiate trafficking and corruption remain nationwide problems in Afghanistan, with ongoing debates on the causes and sustainability of reductions in poppy cultivation. Experts discuss the need for targeted development assistance to capitalize on these reductions, while also considering the importance of replacing poppy cultivation as a source of income for Afghan households. Concerns are raised about the likelihood of further progress without fundamental improvements in insecure and remote areas. In Afghanistan, insecurity and corruption allow drug-trafficking groups to operate freely, hindering economic activity and development efforts. The drug trade supports corrupt officials, criminal groups, and insurgents, perpetuating chaos. Current U.S. policy aims to break cycles of insecurity, reduce poppy cultivation, and take direct action against traffickers and corrupt officials. Opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan decreased by 22% to 123,000 hectares in 2008-2009, with cultivation mainly concentrated in Helmand province. The 2008-2009 opium poppy crop had the potential to impact three provinces' poppy-free status in 2010. The 2008-2009 opium poppy crop in Afghanistan had the potential to produce 6,900 MT of illicit opium, with improved crop yields due to better weather conditions. Approximately 254,000 Afghan households cultivated opium poppy, involving laborers, traffickers, warlords, and officials. The estimated farmgate value of the opium harvest was $438 million, equivalent to 4% of the country's licit GDP, with an export value possibly exceeding $3.4 billion. The opium poppy crop in Afghanistan in 2008-2009 had the potential to produce 6,900 MT of illicit opium, involving various groups in cultivation and trafficking. The export value of the opium harvest was estimated to exceed $3.4 billion, contributing significantly to the country's economy. Experts attribute declines in poppy cultivation to factors like political stability, economic integration, and effective law enforcement. Weather conditions and prices of opium and licit crops also influence farmers' decisions to grow poppy. The 2008-2009 opium poppy crop in Afghanistan had the potential to produce 6,900 MT of illicit opium, contributing significantly to the country's economy. Factors like political stability, economic integration, and effective law enforcement have led to declines in poppy cultivation. Prevailing price relationships undermining poppy cultivation may be reversing, while weather conditions and disease patterns favoring high opium yields have shifted. The December 2009 UNODC/Afghan Government opium survey reported consolidation of poppy cultivation in certain provinces, with a significant decrease in national cultivation levels in 2009. Three provinces became \"poppy-free\" in the last year. In 2009, poppy cultivation decreased in Afghanistan, with some provinces becoming \"poppy-free.\" Wheat prices remained high, making it a more attractive crop than opium. Government intervention varied across provinces, with a successful program in Helmand province. Alternative development programs effectiveness varied among farmers. The effectiveness of alternative development programs in Afghanistan varies across the country, with an emphasis on reaching remote areas. Security is crucial for the Afghan government and its international partners to implement counternarcotics strategies. The government relies on international assistance, but more political will and institutional capacity are needed to reduce cultivation and combat trafficking. The 2010 INCSR report highlights the challenges faced in implementing successful poppy reduction programs in Afghanistan due to security issues and high levels of corruption among government officials. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to corruption in Afghanistan as a \"cancer\" that undermines trust in the government. The Obama Administration is working on new counternarcotics policies as part of its strategic reviews of U.S. policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Obama Administration's strategic review called for a complete overhaul of civilian assistance strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan, focusing on agricultural sector job creation to undermine the appeal of al Qaeda. The review emphasized the need for improved crop substitution and alternative livelihood programs, with a shift towards targeting higher-level drug lords in interdiction and eradication operations. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Regional Stabilization plan outlined a two-pronged approach of robust interdiction efforts supported by agricultural development assistance. The Obama Administration's strategic review emphasized the need for improved crop substitution and alternative livelihood programs in Afghanistan and Pakistan to undermine the appeal of al Qaeda. A new National Security Council-approved counternarcotics strategy document outlines goals to counter the link between narcotics and insurgency, address narcotics corruption, and reinforce the Afghan government. The Administration requested funding for civilian staff, development assistance, and enforcement in FY2009 and FY2010 budgets to support these objectives. The Obama Administration requested funding for expanded interagency staffing in various areas to support counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. This included requests for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) account funding and Economic Support Fund (ESF) account funding to primarily support counternarcotics efforts in the south and east of Afghanistan. The FY2010 request did not significantly increase economic assistance specifically for counternarcotics purposes, despite acknowledging past under-resourcing of these programs. ESF assistance requests for agricultural programs in Afghanistan were significantly larger for FY2010. Congress had appropriated approximately $3 billion for counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan from 2001 through 2008. Since 2006, Congress has placed conditions on some amounts of U.S. economic assistance to Afghanistan by requiring the President to certify that the Afghan government is cooperating fully with counternarcotics efforts prior to the obligation of funds. Efforts to combat narcotics trafficking in Afghanistan are crucial for international security and stability. The U.S. has implemented a comprehensive interagency initiative to assist Afghan authorities in this endeavor. While progress has been made in some areas, regional insecurity and corruption remain significant obstacles to counternarcotics efforts. Congressional interest focuses on program funding and effectiveness. During the term of the 110th Congress, the Bush Administration faced challenges in implementing counternarcotics strategies in Afghanistan due to insecurity, delays in institution-building, and corruption. The Obama Administration and the 111th Congress have increased resources for counternarcotics efforts as part of a broader civilian-military strategy to stabilize Afghanistan. Narcotics trafficking and political instability are closely linked in Afghanistan, posing ongoing challenges for U.S. counternarcotics efforts. The narcotics trade in Afghanistan fuels corruption, violence, and instability, hindering counternarcotics operations and reconstruction efforts since 2001. Proceeds corrupt officials, fund insurgents, and impede economic development, creating self-reinforcing cycles in conflict-prone areas. The persistence of violence and criminality in Afghanistan undermines civilian confidence in government institutions. Critics argue that authorities are hesitant to confront key figures in the opium trade due to fears of security disruptions. The Obama Administration has implemented more robust interdiction efforts targeting major drug traffickers. The U.S. has targeted major drug trafficking figures in Afghanistan as part of a counterinsurgency strategy. Rural security and rule of law are seen as crucial for effective counternarcotics policies. The State Department highlighted the need for responsible governance and poverty reduction to address poppy cultivation. Despite training Afghan authorities, challenges remain in establishing security and enhancing drug law enforcement capabilities. Despite training Afghan authorities, the limited size and capability of Afghan forces hinder their ability to effectively challenge drug-trafficking groups and insurgents. Coalition military operations aim to establish security conditions for the Afghan government to disrupt relationships between insurgents and narcotics traffickers. Difficult political choices are faced when confronting corrupt officials and militia. Authorities face difficult political choices when dealing with corrupt officials, militia leaders, narcotics traffickers, and poppy farmers in Afghanistan. These choices have evolved over time and vary by region. Regional militia commanders with ties to the opium trade played key roles in post-9/11 efforts against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Some of these figures later joined government and security structures, like Governor Gul Agha Sherzai, who enforced bans on poppy cultivation. In 2001 and 2002, as governor of Kandahar province, there were allegations of a close relationship with a Taliban-associated narcotics kingpin indicted in the US. Afghan officials faced challenges in implementing counternarcotics policies due to the risk of antagonizing local populations and corruption in eradication efforts. The opium economy's expansion led to increased interdiction targets, but also fueled corruption and strengthened trafficking groups. The expansion of the opium economy led to corruption and strengthened trafficking groups, creating political and security costs for officials. Counterterrorism operations and relationships with figures benefiting from the drug trade have hindered the central government's ability to enforce counternarcotics policies. The Taliban resurgence since 2006 has been partly supported by narcotics proceeds, undermining Afghan security forces. Plans to employ counterinsurgency tactics against the Taliban may conflict with enforcing counternarcotics policies. The challenges of managing competing priorities in Afghanistan, particularly in Helmand province, have been highlighted by coalition military operations. The need to balance counternarcotics efforts with other policy objectives continues to be a challenge for the United States and its allies. The evolving roles and missions of military forces in the International Security Assistance Force have sparked debates over their involvement in counternarcotics strategies. The shift towards a counterinsurgency approach in Afghanistan has increased the military's role in targeting narcotics linked to the Taliban. Calls for NATO military involvement in counternarcotics operations have been made due to limited Afghan security forces' capabilities. Coalition forces should take action against narcotics traffickers for Afghanistan's national security and coalition goals. Some oppose direct military involvement in counternarcotics to avoid alienating Afghan population and diverting resources from counter-insurgency and counterterrorism operations. Concerns also exist about maintaining distinct authorities and capabilities among agencies. During the George W. Bush Administration, U.S. military officials resisted direct counternarcotics enforcement in Afghanistan due to limited resources and concerns about security threats. NATO directives until October 2008 prevented military action against narcotics targets. Changes in ISAF directives now allow military action against insurgency-linked narcotics targets if authorized under domestic laws. U.S. military forces can seize narcotics during stability and counterterrorism operations, with updated rules of engagement. Defense Department policy prohibits direct participation in certain activities without legal authorization. According to Department guidance, personnel can accompany law enforcement on counternarcotics operations in combat zones, including Afghanistan. A Senate report in 2009 mentioned U.S. military officers interpreting rules of engagement to target drug traffickers. The military can target drug traffickers linked to insurgency on a kill list without restrictions on the use of force. Generals require two human sources and evidence to add targets to the list, which currently includes around 50 major traffickers funding the insurgency. The Defense Department acknowledges the connection between the drug trade and terrorism financing. The U.S. military targets terrorists with links to the drug trade, not drug traffickers linked to terrorism. Criteria for targeting individuals involved in both the drug trade and insurgency are not publicly disclosed. Legal questions arise regarding targeting \"nexus targets\" under international humanitarian law. The ICRC released nonbinding guidelines on the issue in July 2009. The ICRC released nonbinding guidelines in July 2009 on direct participation in hostilities, stating that individuals involved in various activities retain protected status as civilians unless their actions are specifically designed to inflict harm in support of one party in an armed conflict. Reports suggest that some individuals involved in narcotics trafficking provide support to anti-Afghan government forces, potentially including direct participation in hostilities. The January 2009 Defense Department report highlighted the challenges of using limited forces in Afghanistan, emphasizing the trade-off between different mission sets. It argued that a shift in force application towards counternarcotics operations could impact the effectiveness of the counterinsurgency mission. Additional resources would be required to support expanded direct DoD involvement in counternarcotics efforts. The July 2009 report reiterated the need for caution in reallocating limited assets, emphasizing the interconnectedness of counterinsurgency and counternarcotics missions. The July 2009 report emphasized the importance of not shifting limited assets from counterinsurgency to purely counternarcotics activities, as it could have detrimental effects on the population. The distinction between \"nexus targets\" supporting the insurgency and \"purely civilian-criminal narcotics activities\" was not clearly defined. The Government of Afghanistan leads counternarcotics operations, partnering with various forces to target narcotics traffickers supporting the insurgency. Since 2002, Congress and the Bush Administration expanded U.S. military support for Afghan counternarcotics teams. Defense Department authorizations for counternarcotics activities in Afghanistan have been provided through specific legislative acts, with amendments made to extend authorizations and include new countries. Despite proposals to expand Defense Department counternarcotics authorities in Afghanistan, they have not been adopted. The Defense Department has authorized non-lethal counternarcotics assistance to Afghanistan and neighboring countries through various legislative acts, including the FY2009 and FY2010 Defense Authorization Acts. Afghanistan was added to the list of countries eligible for transfers of non-lethal counternarcotics equipment in 2004. Additional authorizations in 2005 and 2006 allowed for the provision of weapons, ammunition, vehicles, aircraft, and detection equipment. The FY2009 and FY2010 Defense Authorization Acts authorized the provision of weapons, ammunition, vehicles, aircraft, and detection equipment to Afghan counternarcotics forces. .50-caliber machine guns and night vision equipment have been provided, with requests for further weaponry due to attacks by trafficking groups. The FY2011 defense authorization may extend existing authorities and reporting requirements. The Obama Administration emphasizes alternative livelihood and agricultural development assistance as strategic priorities. USAID prioritizes agricultural development assistance in Afghanistan, with programs targeting areas with reduced poppy cultivation and ongoing counterinsurgency operations. The $150 million IDEA-NEW program focuses on the north, east, and west regions, while the $300 million Afghanistan Vouchers program targets southern and eastern areas to support newly cleared areas. The $300 million Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased Production in Agriculture (AVIPA-Plus) program, running through FY2010, includes initiatives coordinated with U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Helmand and Kandahar provinces. The Obama Administration has phased out U.S. support for poppy eradication efforts in Afghanistan, focusing on crop substitution instead. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has expanded its presence in the country to support new USAID programs. The policy change in Washington, DC, Kabul, and Europe shifts away from supporting Afghan government poppy eradication efforts due to concerns about cost efficiency and counterproductive results. Proponents argue eradication is necessary for deterrence, while critics believe it lacks alternative livelihood options for farmers and may support anti-government elements like the Taliban. U.S. and Afghan authorities previously supported the Central Poppy Eradication Force and governor-led efforts. The Central Poppy Eradication Force and governor-led programs in Afghanistan have been effective in reducing opium poppy cultivation, but concerns have been raised about clashes with farmers and politicized eradication efforts. The Bush Administration embedded Counternarcotics Advisory Teams in key provinces to advise on eradication activities and minimize resistance. The Obama Administration redirected $150 million in funding to address these issues. The Obama Administration redirected $150 million in funding from central poppy eradication efforts to other initiatives, including interdiction operations and advisory efforts. The Central Poppy Eradication Force has been disbanded, with personnel redirected to other activities. The Counternarcotics Infantry Kandak may be redirected to support other counternarcotics or security operations. Afghan governors remain committed to supporting eradication efforts. The Afghan government, with support from Afghan governors, continues eradication efforts. A 2010 report to Congress highlighted successful poppy eradication in Helmand and Farah provinces. Discussions on aerial herbicide-based eradication in 2004 were halted in 2005 due to various challenges. Ground-based eradication results have been inconsistent since 2006, prompting calls for stronger methods like herbicide use. The Obama Administration's policy changes have influenced these efforts. The Obama Administration's policy changes have made the use of herbicides to kill poppy plants increasingly unlikely in Afghanistan. Policy makers and Members of Congress may still debate the options for manual or aerial poppy eradication, considering the risks and rewards. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has opposed aerial eradication due to public health and environmental concerns, preferring ground-based methods. Congress has been involved in decisions regarding herbicide use since FY2005. Since FY2005, Congress has sought to prohibit or condition the use of funds for aerial herbicide spraying in Afghanistan. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 specifies that funds for assistance in Afghanistan cannot be used for aerial eradication programs unless the President of Afghanistan requests it for counternarcotics or counterterrorism purposes. The Act also requires consultation with the Committees on Appropriations before funds are obligated for such programs. Since 2002, U.S. funding for counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan has included program costs and assistance to Afghan organizations. Funding increased significantly in FY2005 for the introduction of a five pillar counternarcotics strategy. Congress has placed conditions on economic assistance to Afghanistan since 2006, requiring certification of full cooperation with counternarcotics efforts. The 2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-102) requires certification of Afghan government cooperation with counternarcotics efforts before funds can be obligated. The Act allows for a national security waiver if necessary. The Bush Administration waived the certification requirement for FY2006 ESF appropriations for Afghanistan in May 2006. Subsequent appropriations legislation included these provisions, with FY2007 conditions carried forward. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act limited ESF assistance to Afghanistan to $300 million until the Afghan government fully cooperated with U.S.-funded poppy eradication and drug interdiction efforts. The Bush Administration waived the certification requirement for FY2008 ESF appropriations for Afghanistan in May 2008. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, set conditions for ESF funding related to Afghan cooperation with U.S.-funded counternarcotics efforts. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, set conditions for ESF funding related to Afghan cooperation with U.S.-funded counternarcotics efforts, unless the Secretary of State certifies full cooperation with U.S. efforts against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and to reduce poppy cultivation and illicit drug trafficking. Waiver authority is provided based on national security interests determination. Congress has required detailed reports on counternarcotics strategies and the use of funds to support programs in Afghanistan since 2002. Reports include surveys of Defense Department counterdrug activities, justifications for waivers on U.S. ESF assistance conditions, and plans to combat the opiate trade in and around Afghanistan. Several reports of interest to Congress for oversight purposes have been submitted, including one on progress in reducing poppy cultivation and heroin production in Afghanistan. The DEA was required to submit a report targeting Afghan drug kingpins, and the Administration was required to report on the use of aerial assets in DEA counternarcotics operations. The National Defense Authorization Act, 2008 requires reports on the comprehensive strategy for security and stability in Afghanistan every 180 days. Reports include counternarcotics policy, police training, and judicial reform. The FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act extended reporting on Defense Department counterdrug activities. The FY2010 Defense Authorization Act mandates annual reporting on Defense Department counterdrug activities, including a comprehensive strategy for counternarcotics efforts in South and Central Asia."
