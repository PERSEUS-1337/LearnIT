    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act\" and aims to return human-powered travel to wilderness areas. The \"Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act\" defines key terms such as \"local official,\" \"nonmotorized,\" and \"permitted route\" for the purpose of allowing nonmotorized recreational use in wilderness areas. The \"Human-Powered Travel in Wilderness Areas Act\" allows nonmotorized recreational use on permitted routes in wilderness areas, as defined by key terms such as \"local official,\" \"nonmotorized,\" and \"permitted route.\" The term \"wilderness area\" refers to a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Act specifies that the Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for National Forest System land, while the Secretary of the Interior oversees public land. The Act allows local officials to determine permissible forms of nonmotorized recreational use on permitted routes within their jurisdiction. If officials fail to make a determination within 2 years, any form of nonmotorized recreational use is allowed on the route. Local officials have the authority to determine permissible nonmotorized recreational use on permitted routes within their jurisdiction. If no determination is made within 2 years, all forms of nonmotorized transportation are allowed. Officials must accommodate all nonmotorized transportation forms to the maximum extent possible and can take actions to reduce environmental impacts and conflicts. To reduce environmental impacts and conflicts among nonmotorized transportation user groups, measures such as limiting party size, educating users on best practices, and designating permitted route directions can be implemented. Local officials have the authority to determine permissible nonmotorized recreational use, with actions required to minimize impacts and conflicts. Local officials have the authority to open or maintain permitted routes for public recreational use, including nonmotorized transport on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. SEC. 3. WILDERNESS MAINTENANCE. Prohibition of Certain Uses in Wilderness Areas under the Wilderness Act is amended to define terms like 'local official' and 'mechanical transport'. The term 'mechanical transport' refers to any ground, snow, or ice travel propelled by a nonliving power source, excluding human-powered travel. 'Motorized equipment' is defined as any equipment with a motor. The term 'motorized equipment' excludes small, battery-powered devices carried by hand. In this subsection, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, or any local official are not required to alter any wilderness area or allow any use that may change its wilderness character. Human-powered travel is presumed to preserve the wilderness character of a wilderness area. Maintenance of wilderness areas is addressed in Section 4 of the Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act is amended to allow the use of small-scale motorized equipment for trail maintenance while preserving the wilderness character of the area."
