    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Chapter 2.92, establishing the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) Pilot Program to improve public safety, reduce recidivism, and provide intensive case management services for participants. The Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program in California prioritizes housing with supportive services, coordinates human and social resources with law enforcement, and allows voluntary participation without requiring abstinence from drugs or alcohol. LEAD is administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections, which awards grants to jurisdictions based on established standards and procedures. The LEAD program in California requires applicants to demonstrate understanding and willingness to implement the program. They must also identify key local partners from various agencies for successful program implementation. Successful grant applicants for LEAD programs in California must demonstrate the jurisdiction's capacity to coordinate social services, law enforcement efforts, and justice system decision-making processes. They are also required to collect and maintain data on program effectiveness as indicated by the board. The programs funded under this chapter must consist of a strategy for effective intervention for eligible participants. LEAD diversion allows law enforcement officers to refer individuals for immediate crisis services instead of arrest. Participation is voluntary, and criminal charges will not be filed if the person completes the assessment intake interview within 30 days. LEAD allows law enforcement officers to refer individuals at high risk of future arrest for specified crimes to the program, provided they have prior involvement in low-level drug activity or prostitution. Verification is required through criminal history records. Law enforcement can refer individuals to the LEAD program if they have prior involvement in low-level drug or prostitution activity within the program area and within 24 months. The individual must not have a pending case in drug court or mental health court, and must not be prohibited from contacting a current LEAD participant. Offenses eligible for prebooking diversion or social contact referral include possession or sale of controlled substances for subsistence living, possession or being under the influence of prohibited substances, and prostitution. Services provided under this chapter may include case management, housing, medical and mental health care, substance use disorder treatment, counseling, employment support, legal services, and system navigation. Grant funding can be used for project management, temporary stabilization services, outreach, legal services for participants, and prosecutorial resources for criminal cases. Dedicated law enforcement resources, training from LEAD experts, and data collection for program evaluation are essential components for successful implementation. The board will contract with a research entity to evaluate the LEAD program's effectiveness, including cost-benefit outcomes compared to traditional booking and prosecution. The evaluation will assess various measures such as jail bookings, incarceration rates, and costs to the criminal justice system. A report of the findings is due by January 1, 2020 to the Governor and Legislature. The board may contract with experts for technical assistance in implementing LEAD. Administrative costs shall not exceed 5% annually. Chapter 2.92 is added to the Penal Code for Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion. This chapter will be in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. The Penal Code will include a Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) pilot program in three approved counties. The program allows designated peace officers to take individuals with probable cause for arrest for certain offenses to a drug treatment facility instead of arresting them. Interested counties must submit applications to the Board of State and Community Corrections for approval. The Penal Code includes provisions for possession, sale, and transfer of controlled substances or prohibited substances, as well as being under the influence of such substances. The Penal Code addresses possession, sale, and being under the influence of controlled substances. Designated peace officers can take individuals arrested for prostitution to receive services instead of being arrested, similar to the LEAD program in Seattle. Services may include housing, medical care, substance abuse treatment, counseling, employment, and education."
