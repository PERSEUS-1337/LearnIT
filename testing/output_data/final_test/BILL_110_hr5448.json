    "content": "The Act titled \"Full Faith in Veterans Act of 2008\" is also known as the \"Full Faith in Veterans Act.\" The findings of Congress emphasize the sacrifices made by men and women in the Armed Forces, the importance of integrity in service members, and the need to support veterans in their claims for disability compensation. Additionally, it recognizes the dangers and stress of military service, including the debilitating condition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \"PTSD is a mental health condition linked to military service that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should diagnose and treat. It can onset at any time after a traumatic event, with periods of relapse and remission. Denying disability claims for PTSD due to incomplete military records is a disservice to veterans, as records validating claims may have been lost. The fast-paced environment of the Armed Forces can lead to challenges in documenting such claims.\" Evaluations for disability compensation for PTSD can be traumatic for veterans, often completed quickly in as little as 20 minutes despite recommendations for longer evaluations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 established recommendations to improve care for veterans with PTSD, including updating disability ratings, new diagnosis criteria, and a holistic treatment approach.

SEC. 3 addresses the standard of proof for service-connection of post-traumatic stress disorder. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 recommended improvements for veterans with PTSD, including updating disability ratings and treatment approaches. Section 1154 of title 38, United States Code, now includes a new subsection (c) stating that a diagnosis of PTSD by a mental health professional, along with a determination linking the disorder to the veteran's service, is sufficient proof for service-connection. Any doubts should be resolved in favor of the veteran, although clear and convincing evidence can rebut the connection. The Secretary must provide all documents related to the service-connection of a veteran's disability in case of a rebuttal. Section 1154 of title 38, United States Code applies to disability compensation claims for which no final decision has been made before the enactment of this Act. Improvement of Department of Veterans Affairs evaluations of claims related to post-traumatic stress disorder.

The program includes periodic recertification. The program for rating disabilities and evaluating claims for post-traumatic stress disorder must provide specialized training on psychological and medical issues, including comorbidities, and incorporate recommendations from the Best Practice Manual for PTSD Compensation and Pension Examinations. The Department of Veterans Affairs regularly reviews and updates certification program requirements to consider medical advances and lessons learned. Training is provided to support the certification program. Audits are conducted on examinations for veterans claiming disability compensation for post-traumatic stress disorder to ensure accurate diagnosis and rating. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will update the schedule for rating disabilities, focusing on post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental disorders. New criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders will be implemented for rating post-traumatic stress disorder. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a holistic approach for treating veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, combining treatment, compensation, and vocational assessment. Employees responsible for adjudicating disability compensation ratings must consider treatment records from centers providing mental health services to veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will consider treatment records and written opinions from mental health professionals when determining disability compensation ratings for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. Materials on PTSD and mental health from specific organizations will also be taken into account. The term \"employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs\" includes individuals working for contracted entities conducting examinations or rating disabilities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs considers treatment records and opinions from mental health professionals to determine disability compensation for veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will report to Congress within two years of the enactment of this Act on its implementation, including any evidence of fraud or abuse."
