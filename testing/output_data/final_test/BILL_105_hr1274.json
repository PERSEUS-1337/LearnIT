    "content": "The \"Technology Administration Act of 1998\" is cited as the short title. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program Center may receive additional financial support after the sixth year if it passes an independent review every two years. The Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award is also addressed. SEC. 3. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to allow for a third Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award in certain cases. Additional categories for the award include health care providers and education providers. SEC. 4. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to include a new section on notice. Sec. 31 of the Act requires notice to be provided to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate for any reprogramming action or major reorganization of the Institute. A major reorganization of the Institute involves reassigning more than 25 percent of employees. The Congress urges the National Institute of Standards and Technology to prioritize fixing date-related issues in computer systems for the year 2000. Contingency plans should be developed for systems that cannot be corrected in time. Additionally, there is a focus on enhancing science and mathematics programs. In this section, \"educationally useful Federal equipment\" refers to computers and research tools for schools. The Congress recommends donating such equipment to enhance science and math programs in schools. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology must submit an annual report to the President detailing any donations of educationally useful Federal equipment to schools. The Teacher Science and Technology Enhancement Institute Program is established. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to establish a teacher science and technology enhancement program for professional development of math and science teachers in elementary, middle, and secondary schools. The program focuses on scientific measurements, tests and standards development, industrial competitiveness, manufacturing, technology transfer, and other areas of expertise of the Institute. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology shall establish a teacher science and technology enhancement program for professional development of math and science teachers in elementary, middle, and secondary schools. The program will be conducted annually during the summer months and will include activities at the Institute's laboratory facilities or other means determined by the Director. The Office of Space Commercialization is established. The Office of Space Commercialization is established within the Department of Commerce, headed by a Director who coordinates space-related issues and promotes commercial investment in space activities. The Office of Space Commercialization within the Department of Commerce promotes commercial space opportunities, assists US commercial providers in conducting business with the government, advocates for industry interests, prevents government competition with commercial providers, promotes export of space goods and services, and represents the Department of Commerce in policy development and negotiations with foreign entities. The Office of Space Commercialization in the Department of Commerce promotes commercial space opportunities, assists US providers in government business, advocates for industry interests, prevents government competition, promotes export of space goods and services, and represents the Department in policy development and negotiations with foreign countries to ensure free and fair trade in space commerce by seeking the removal of legal, policy, and institutional impediments. SEC. 9. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM TO STIMULATE COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to establish the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Technology in order to enhance technological competitiveness in states with historically lower federal research funding. The program will be coordinated through the states. The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research aims to enhance technological competitiveness in states with historically lower federal research funding. The program coordinates through State committees and cooperates with State science and technology councils, small business firms, and technology-based businesses. The Secretary may provide grants for technology research and development, technology transfer, deployment, diffusion, and strengthening of technological capabilities. The program aims to enhance technological competitiveness through consortia involving technology-based small businesses, industries, universities, and state/local development agencies. Awards are made on a competitive basis with a 25% matching requirement for non-Federal share of activities. The Technology Administration Act of 1998 establishes criteria for states participating in the program, with coordination efforts with other Department of Commerce programs. The Under Secretary must submit a report meeting specific requirements to the Secretary within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Technology Administration Act of 1998 sets criteria for states in the program, with a report to be submitted to the Secretary within 90 days. The report includes program structure, management plan, review process, milestones, and state eligibility assessment. The Secretary then transmits the report to specific Senate and House committees. The Technology Administration Act of 1998 establishes criteria for states in the program, including evaluation criteria for program management and effectiveness. SEC. 10. National Technology Medal for Environmental Technology is established as a separate nomination category with unique criteria. SEC. 11. The International Arctic Research Center is recognized as an important effort for weather and climate studies, similar to research in the Antarctic, and should receive similar support from the United States."
