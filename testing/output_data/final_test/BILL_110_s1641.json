    "content": "The \"Wetlands Loan Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. Public Law 87-383 is amended to authorize funds for the conservation of migratory waterfowl habitat. The \"Wetlands Loan Act of 2007\" authorizes $40,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2009 through 2018 for the conservation of migratory bird habitats. Funds appropriated are treated as an advance to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, to be repaid without interest starting July 1, 2010. Repayment amounts equal funds accruing annually to the Fund from the price of migratory bird conservation. The excess amount from the sale of migratory bird hunting stamps above $15 per stamp is deposited into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund if no funds are appropriated for that year. SEC. 3. PRICE OF STAMPS. Section 2 of the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act is amended to adjust the price of stamps sold by authorized entities. The price will be $22 for hunting years 2009-2015, $29 for hunting years 2016-2022, and $35 for hunting year 2023 onwards. The Secretary of the Interior is required to submit reports on this pricing structure. The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service must submit a report to Congress comparing the price of stamps sold under subsection (a)(1) after the Wetlands Loan Act of 2007 with the purchasing power of revenue generated by total stamp sales from hunting years 1991 to the enactment of the Wetlands Loan Act of 2007. The Secretary of the Interior will submit a final report to Congress comparing the price of each stamp sold during the hunting year when funds are repaid under Public Law 87-383 with previous hunting years. The Secretary of the Interior will submit a final report to Congress comparing the price of each stamp sold during hunting years from 1991 until funds are repaid under Public Law 87-383. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE USE OF CERTAIN FUNDS. The funds generated by this Act should be used to preserve and increase waterfowl populations in line with the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. The funds should supplement, not replace, current conservation funding. Fee title acquisitions should prioritize public access where possible. The Act aims to implement amendments that support private landowners in achieving long-term land use goals while enhancing wetland and wildlife habitat conservation."
