    "content": "The \"Go Pack Go Act of 2018\" amends the Communications Act of 1934 to include the carriage of network station signals in certain counties. The \"Go Pack Go Act of 2018\" defines terms related to cable operators, covered counties, in-State adjacent-market network station retransmission, local markets, and local network stations. The \"Go Pack Go Act of 2018\" requires cable operators or satellite carriers to provide subscribers in covered counties with retransmission options for local network stations within the subscriber's local market. Subscribers can elect to receive retransmission of local network stations, in-State adjacent-market network stations, or both. If a subscriber chooses to receive only in-State, adjacent-market network station retransmissions, it fulfills the cable operator or satellite carrier's obligation to provide local network station signals. For satellite carriers recognized under section 119(g) of title 17, providing these retransmissions instead of local network signals does not impact their qualified carrier status. A satellite carrier must provide retransmissions under subsection (b) if technically feasible. Cable operators are exempt from retransmission consent requirements for in-State, adjacent-market network stations in covered counties. The signal of these stations is deemed significantly viewed. The signal of in-State, adjacent-market network stations in covered counties is deemed significantly viewed for retransmissions by satellite carriers, exempt from consent requirements.

The term 'covered county' refers to specific counties in Wisconsin for in-State, adjacent-market network station retransmissions to subscribers. These counties must not be in the local market of any television broadcast station affiliated with the same network.
