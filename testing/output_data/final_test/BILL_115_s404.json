    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that there is a lack of transparency and consistency in FDA inspections of medical device establishments worldwide, leading to inefficiencies and undermining confidence in US standards. Inspections of foreign establishments are often more efficient than domestic ones, and a risk-based approach to inspections would focus on significant health risks while reducing burdens on compliant establishments. Greater transparency and consistency are needed in FDA inspections of device establishments in the United States. Improving communication before, during, and after inspections, as well as providing guidance for establishments, would enhance the safety and effectiveness of devices. Enhanced training for device establishment investigators can improve inspection consistency and efficiency. There is a lack of transparency in the export certification process for device establishments, leading to issues with marketing devices in other countries. Device establishments facing deficiencies identified by FDA inspections lack sufficient opportunities to confirm the appropriateness of corrective actions taken. SEC. 2. RISK-BASED INSPECTIONS FOR DEVICES. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to establish a risk-based inspection schedule for device establishments. The Secretary will inspect these establishments based on factors and considerations to ensure compliance. The Secretary will apply factors for device establishments and consider participation in international device audit programs recognized by the United States for inspection purposes. Improvements to inspections process for device establishments will be made, including the consideration of participation in international device audit programs recognized by the United States. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will be amended to establish uniform standards for inspections of domestic and foreign device establishments, including notification, announcement, and communication protocols. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act will be amended to establish uniform standards for inspections of domestic and foreign device establishments, including notification, announcement, and communication protocols. This includes providing advance notice of records requested for inspections, daily communications with establishment personnel, and nonbinding feedback on proposed actions within 45 days. The Secretary has the authority to conduct inspections to ensure compliance with the Act. Within a year, draft guidance will be issued specifying implementation processes, standardized communication templates, a standard inspection timeframe, and investigator practices for domestic and foreign inspections. The Secretary will issue final guidance within 18 months after enactment to facilitate inspection continuity for investigators and device establishments. SEC. 4. CERTIFICATES TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FOR DEVICES. Subsection (e)(4) of section 801 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require the Secretary to provide written explanations for denying certification requests for devices, including specific findings and deficiencies identified. The Secretary must not deny certification for a device if a plan of correction is agreed upon with the establishment that received a report. A process is provided for denied certification requests to be reviewed, allowing for new information to be presented at any time. The Secretary must address reasons for denial of certification, provide guidance within 1 year, apply rules to device establishments in the US or abroad, charge fees for certification issuance, and adjust margins of certain subparagraphs."
