The Act \"Retiree Health Benefits Act of 2005\" addresses the funding of retiree health benefits. A collectively bargained transfer is treated as a qualified transfer under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Amendments are made to define and limit the amount transferred for pension benefits. The amount of excess pension assets that can be transferred in a qualified transfer is limited based on the estimated amount the employer will pay for retiree health liabilities. There is an exception for collectively bargained transfers, where the amount transferred is based on the collective bargaining agreement. The collective bargaining agreement and generally accepted accounting principles determine the amount the employer will pay for retiree health liabilities during the collectively bargained cost maintenance period. Section 420 of the Internal Revenue Code outlines the requirements for plans making collectively bargained transfers. Assets transferred to a health benefits account must be used to pay qualified current retiree health liabilities, except in collectively bargained transfers where they are used for collectively bargained retiree health liabilities. Assets transferred to a health benefits account must be used to pay for retiree health liabilities, except in collectively bargained transfers where they are used for specific retiree health liabilities. Any amount that cannot be used as provided in a collectively bargained transfer shall be transferred out of the account to the transferor plan. The transferred amount is not included in the employer's gross income but is treated as an employer reversion for tax purposes. \"For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of a health benefits account is treated as paid first out of specified assets and income. Conforming amendments ensure requirements are met for group health plans providing applicable health benefits.\" The applicable employer cost for health benefits must not be lower than the previous two years for qualified transfers, and for collectively bargained transfers, the collectively bargained employer cost must be maintained. The collectively bargained employer cost for health benefits must not be less than the amount specified in the collective bargaining agreement. The agreement may reduce employer costs for retiree health benefits financed by a government program. Subparagraph (E) of section 420(c)(3) is amended to define the cost maintenance period as 5 taxable years after a qualified transfer. The cost maintenance period for retiree health benefits is defined as 5 taxable years after a qualified transfer. In cases where the taxable year overlaps with multiple cost maintenance periods, the highest applicable employer cost is considered. The term 'collectively bargained cost maintenance period' refers to the shorter of the remaining lifetime of the covered retiree and their spouse and dependents, or the period of coverage. The collectively bargained health plan's coverage period for retirees and their spouses and dependents is determined at the time of transfer. Deduction limitations apply to transfers to health benefits accounts under the Internal Revenue Code. The text chunk discusses the conditions for transferring funds for retiree health liabilities, including limitations and calculations based on different scenarios. An employer may not contribute to a health benefits account for retiree health liabilities after December 31, 1990, except for collectively bargained retiree health liabilities. The text discusses the deductibility of contributions to a welfare benefit fund under a collective bargaining agreement without regard to whether the contributions are made to a health benefits account or welfare benefit fund. It also defines a \"collectively bargained transfer\" as a specific type of transfer. The text defines a \"collectively bargained transfer\" as a transfer of excess pension assets to a health benefits account in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement. The term 'collectively bargained retiree health liabilities' refers to the present value of health benefits for retirees as determined in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement. The amount determined for the collectively bargained cost maintenance period may be reduced by the value of assets in health benefits accounts or welfare benefit funds set aside for retiree health liabilities, excluding key employees. The term 'collectively bargained health benefits' refers to health benefits provided to retired employees entitled to receive benefits upon retirement and their spouses and dependents, as well as potentially active employees as specified in the collective bargaining agreement. The term 'collectively bargained health plan' refers to a group health plan for retired employees, their spouses, and dependents maintained under collective bargaining agreements. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code include provisions for collectively bargained retiree health liabilities. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code are made regarding retiree health benefits, replacing references to the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 with the Retiree Health Benefits Act of 2005. Amendments to ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code replace the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004 with the Retiree Health Benefits Act of 2005 for retiree health benefits, effective for years after December 31, 2004."
