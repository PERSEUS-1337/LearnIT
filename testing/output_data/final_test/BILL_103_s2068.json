The Act, known as the \"Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1994,\" defines terms related to environmental enhancement, feasibility study, and components of the wetland and wildlife enhancement activities. The \"Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1994\" defines terms related to water conservation, member entities, project construction budget, and pumping and operational requirements for the water supply system. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1994 defines terms related to water supply system facilities, reservoirs, pipelines, and the Secretary of the Interior. The water supply system is established and operated in accordance with a feasibility study. Federal assistance is provided for the water supply system. The Secretary can grant funds to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System for planning and constructing a water supply system in specific counties in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. The system aims to provide safe water supplies for various purposes and environmental enhancements. Grants should not exceed a certain amount. The Secretary can grant funds to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System for planning and constructing a water supply system in specific counties in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa. The funds authorized for construction shall not exceed a certain amount. The Secretary cannot obligate funds until environmental requirements are met, an engineering report is submitted to Congress, and a water conservation program is developed and implemented. SEC. 4. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FOR WETLAND AND WILDLIFE ENHANCEMENT. The Secretary will provide grants for the initial development of the environmental enhancement component. Funds given will not need to be reimbursed. SEC. 5. WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. The water conservation program aims to promote the use of efficient technology and management practices to conserve water. It includes standards for plumbing fixtures, leak detection programs, specific rate schedules, public education initiatives, and coordinated operation among water systems and facilities. The water conservation program includes standards for plumbing fixtures, leak detection programs, rate schedules, public education initiatives, and coordinated operation among water systems. The programs will be periodically reviewed and revised in cooperation with the Secretary. Mitigation for fish and wildlife losses due to the water supply system's construction and operation will be based on ecological equivalency, on an acre-for-acre basis, as outlined in the feasibility study. Additionally, the use of Pick-Sloan power is authorized. The Western Area Power Administration will provide capacity and energy for irrigation and drainage pumping for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program from May 1 to October 31 each year. The water supply system must operate on a not-for-profit basis and purchase electric service from a qualified preference power supplier. The Western Area Power Administration provides capacity and energy for irrigation and drainage pumping for the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin program. The rate schedule for the power is based on the firm power rate schedule of the Pick-Sloan Eastern Division. Contracts are agreed upon by the Western Area Power Administration, power suppliers, and Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, Inc. to determine the rate schedule for the capacity and energy provided. The rate schedule for the power provided by the Western Area Power Administration is passed through to the water supply system, allowing the power supplier to include other charges for electric service. SEC. 8. NO LIMITATION ON WATER PROJECTS IN STATES. This Act does not limit water projects in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota. SEC. 9. WATER RIGHTS. This Act does not affect State water law, interstate compacts, or water rights. SEC. 10. FEDERAL COST SHARE. SEC. 10. FEDERAL COST SHARE. The Secretary can provide funds equal to 80% of the project construction budget for the water supply system under section 3, and cover increases in development costs. SEC. 11. NON-FEDERAL COST SHARE. The non-Federal share is 20% of the project construction budget for the water supply system and increases in development costs. SEC. 12. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. SEC. 12. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. The Secretary authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to oversee project construction for the water supply system and environmental enhancement component. The Bureau's funds for planning and construction cannot exceed 1% of the total project budget. SEC. 13. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $226,320,000 is authorized for this Act, with $8,487,000 allocated for the initial development of the environmental enhancement component."
