    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fairness in Ambulance Reimbursement Act of 2015\". Congress finds that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services made adjustments to geographic area designations for ambulance providers in the 2015 physician fee schedule rules, impacting zip codes in California, Louisiana, and Texas. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services made adjustments to geographic area designations for ambulance providers in the 2015 physician fee schedule rules. This resulted in changes to zip codes in California, Louisiana, Texas, and Oregon based on revised delineations of Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes. The final rule on geographic area designations for ambulance providers in the 2015 physician fee schedule was published without proper notice and comment, violating the Administration Procedures Act. The corrected list of zip code changes was posted less than a month before the new policy took effect, giving insufficient time for preparation. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services failed to provide an impact analysis on small entities as required by law, resulting in a nearly 9 percent cut in reimbursement for transports from areas losing rural status. SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF RURAL TO URBAN ZIP CODE RECLASSIFICATIONS FOR MEDICARE AMBULANCE PAYMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will suspend the reclassification of rural to urban zip codes for ambulance services payment until December 31, 2015, as per the final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Claims for ambulance services in 2015 will be paid based on the previous zip code classification. The final rule delayed the reclassification of zip codes for ambulance services payment until December 31, 2015. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reclassify rural to urban zip codes for ambulance services payment through notice and comment rulemaking by November 1, 2015, taking into account revised geographic delineations. Claims for ambulance services in 2015 will not be affected by these changes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to re-process claims for ambulance services provided in 2015 under the fee schedule of the Social Security Act. The Secretary must estimate any potential excess payments made in 2015 under the fee schedule for ambulance services. The Secretary will adjust payments for ambulance services in 2016 if estimated excess payments were made in 2015 under the fee schedule. Adjustments will be made to ensure the total amount of adjustments equals the excess amount."
