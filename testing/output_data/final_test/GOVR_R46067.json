    "content": "The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) mandates annual financial audits of federal agencies to ensure reliable financial information, prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of government resources, and aid in program evaluation. The Department of Defense (DOD) completed its first agency-wide financial audit in FY2018, with data for the FY2019 audit still pending. Congressional interest in DOD's audits is high due to its significant share of federal expenditures. The Department of Defense Inspector General (DOD IG) contracted nine Independent Public Accounting firms (IPAs) to conduct FY2018 and FY2019 audits. The audits resulted in a disclaimer of opinion due to unreliable financial information. DOD components with disclaimer opinions represent a significant portion of DOD assets and budgetary resources. DOD anticipates a clean audit opinion could take up to a decade to achieve. The Department of Defense (DOD) received a disclaimer of opinion on its financial report. DOD's budget of $708 billion in FY2019 is a significant factor preventing an overall clean audit opinion. DOD employs 2.9 million personnel at 4,800 sites in 160 countries. The FY2018 audit cost DOD $413 million. The Department of Defense (DOD) spent $406 million on audit remediation and $153 million on financial system fixes. Financial statements communicate financial performance based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Auditors provide assurance on financial statement accuracy by assessing risks and controls. The CFO Act requires federal agencies' financial statements to be audited annually by agency inspectors general or external auditors. An audit of DOD can lead to cost reduction, improved decision-making, and compliance with regulations. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) and GAO establish financial reporting and auditing standards for federal government entities. GAO issues the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as the Yellow Book, which requires auditors to consider the visibility and sensitivity of government programs in determining materiality thresholds. GAGAS mandates disclosure of compliance with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements that impact financial reporting. Auditors evaluate an entity's financial statements in accordance with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. They first assess the reliability of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and internal controls. ERP systems manage an entity's resources and functions, including financial information. Effective internal controls require dynamic judgment from management. Personnel play a crucial role in the success of internal controls. The success of an entity's internal controls depends on personnel understanding and implementing effective systems. Federal agencies must report to Congress on internal controls as mandated by the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, known as the Green Book, provides the framework for designing and operating internal controls. Audits of internal controls include computer systems at various levels. The federal government follows specific frameworks for internal control policies and procedures, including guidance from OMB Circular No. A123 and the COSO framework. The COSO framework aims to enhance organizational performance through effective internal control, enterprise risk management, and fraud deterrence. The COSO framework provides an integrated perspective on internal controls, focusing on objectives like Operations, Reporting, and Compliance. It includes components like Control Environment and Risk Assessment, organized by levels of organizational structure. Effective internal controls are crucial for organizations to achieve their objectives, as per COSO. They must be integrated across all levels to help DOD leadership achieve desired financial results and obtain a clean audit opinion. Properly designed internal controls can reduce audit detail and time, ultimately cutting costs. DOD faces numerous internal control weaknesses at both agency-wide and component levels, ranging from financial management to inventory issues. The DOD faces internal control weaknesses, including financial and inventory management issues. Material weaknesses in internal control can lead to misstatements in financial reporting. Properly designed internal controls are essential for safeguarding assets and achieving organizational objectives. The lack of entity-level internal controls in multiple DOD components increases the risk of material misstatements. The lack of entity-level internal controls in DOD components led to increased risk of material misstatements in financial statements. Auditors issued 2,377 notices of findings resulting in 20 agency-wide material weaknesses and 129 DOD component-level weaknesses. Resolving internal control issues is crucial for DOD to receive a clean audit opinion. As of June 2019, auditors identified 20 agency-wide material weaknesses in DOD, with corrective action plans created to address issues captured in notices of findings. The majority of findings were related to financial management systems, financial reporting, and property. While the overall number of findings slightly increased, there was a significant decrease in certain categories, reflecting the expected result of the audit process. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) has established an audit NFR database to track auditor-issued NFRs and link them to CAPs. The military service branches account for over 60% of NFRs identified in the FY2018 audit. Collaboration between civilian leadership and uniformed Armed Forces personnel is crucial for DOD to receive a clean audit opinion. DOD is prioritizing CAPs aligned with the National Defense Strategy for the FY2019 financial audit. Auditors issued an agency-wide disclaimer of opinion for FY2019 due to the complexity of DOD operations. Most financial audits stop when the entity is deemed unauditable, but DOD requested auditors to continue to identify issues. Comprehensive data for the FY2019 audit is not yet available. The Department of Defense (DOD) has requested auditors to continue audits despite being deemed unauditable, aiming to identify systemic issues and drive business reform aligned with the National Defense Strategy. The annual audit process is crucial for reforming DOD's business practices and guiding strategic goals and priorities. The audits aim to provide value to the warfighter and support long-term reform for efficiencies and increased public confidence in DoD's stewardship of funds. Congressional oversight could help achieve a clean audit opinion, potentially reducing audit costs. In FY2018, DOD incurred nearly $1 billion in audit costs, less than 0.25% of its budget. The audits identified critical areas for improvement in financial management systems and IT, aligning with the National Defense Strategy. DOD's financial management systems and IT, financial reporting, and property management are critical areas for improvement to help resolve audit issues and improve business practices. Compliance with laws and regulations is essential for DOD to support its mission and the warfighter. The DOD is required to maintain internal controls for reliable financial information, as mandated by various laws and regulations. Challenges in financial management systems and IT compromise a significant portion of non-compliance issues. One key issue is the partial implementation of initiatives to address access controls for IT systems, which could restrict access rights, monitor user activity, and safeguard sensitive data. DOD is taking corrective action by limiting access to appropriate personnel. The DOD has implemented security controls and standardized test plans to restrict access to financial systems. Components without proper software maintenance policies are directed to establish one and monitor software changes. The department also requires reports on privileged users and transactions, periodic review of user access rights, and removal of unauthorized users. The complexity of over 400 financial systems complicates DOD's financial statement audits. The DOD has over 400 financial systems, including legacy systems not designed for financial reporting. The IT modernization program aims to migrate 51 legacy systems to modern ERPs by 2023. The success of remediation plans during this migration will be crucial for auditable financial reports. The DOD's policies and procedures for financial reporting are inadequate, leading to unreliable financial statements. This poses challenges for decision-making and budget appropriation. DOD's assets increased by $200 billion in FY2018, with Fund Balance with Treasury increasing by $78.6 billion. The DOD's Fund Balance with Treasury increased by $78.6 billion in FY2018 due to additional appropriations. However, DOD faces challenges in tracking and reconciling financial activities, leading to discrepancies between its general ledger and Treasury accounts. Monthly reconciliations are crucial for supporting budget authority and financial statements. The auditors identified deficiencies in internal controls for fund balance with the Treasury, leading to DOD-wide material weakness. DOD is working on process improvements to streamline reporting and support account reconciliations. Challenges with recording, valuing, and locating real property complicate oversight and budget appropriations. Inventory issues also hinder effective management and oversight. The auditors found issues with inventory management at DOD, leading to concerns about the accuracy of inventory records and valuation. This could result in additional costs and the potential purchase of unnecessary inventory. DOD also struggles to account for all its buildings and structures, with examples of missing properties in the real property system. The DOD is working on improving its property records and ownership documentation to assist in future base realignment and closure decisions. The military branches are facing challenges in obtaining source documents, establishing property values, and assessing maintenance costs. The Air Force is focusing on correcting building records, while the Navy has completed its physical inventory with a high accuracy rate. The Marine Corps is also undergoing a similar process. The Marine Corps has achieved a 99.7% accuracy rate in counting and recording its physical inventory. The Department of Defense manages inventory and property at numerous facilities across different locations. The Defense Logistics Agency holds a significant portion of the Army, Navy, and Air Force's inventory. The complexity of managing DOD resources across vast geographic areas poses challenges in maintaining accurate records. The accuracy of inventory management is crucial for DOD leadership to understand available resources. Examples from GAO's high-risk series include discrepancies in Blackhawk helicopters, rotor blades, fuel injector assemblies, and gyro electronics. Accurate inventory helps prevent unnecessary purchases and ensures mission readiness by having the right supplies available. The DOD's inventory management is vital for mission readiness and cost efficiency. Unique parts with long lead times are crucial, and accurate records can expedite availability. Government-provided property to contractors must be properly recorded and managed for disposal or return. The DOD property system needs to accurately differentiate ownership between DOD and contractors for a clean audit opinion. The DOD should require contractors to maintain accurate records for a clean audit opinion. Audit-related costs for FY2018 were $973 million and are expected to remain consistent until more components achieve unmodified opinions. Agency-level issues contribute to the constant audit costs. The DOD's annual audit costs for FY2018 were $973 million and are expected to remain consistent until more components achieve clean audit opinions. The audit costs may increase in the near term but are expected to decrease after the first few years. Auditors rely on substantive testing to validate financial information due to internal control weaknesses. The DOD's audit costs for FY2018 were $973 million and are expected to stay high until internal control weaknesses are resolved. Auditors use two categories of substantive testing: Analytical Procedures and Tests of Details. Analytical procedures involve comparing current-year information with prior years, examining trend lines, and reviewing financial ratios. Tests of details involve verifying individual items, such as matching vendor invoices with DOD payments and physically locating inventory items. Due to unreliable systems of records, auditors may rely more on tests of details than analytical procedures. The DOD has requested comprehensive completion of audit procedures even after auditors determine components will receive disclaimers of opinion. This approach may help resolve issues quickly and lower financial audit costs in the long run. Some DOD organizations provide common IT services, with 20 service provider examinations completed in FY2018 resulting in 14 unmodified opinions and 6 qualified opinions. For FY2018, 20 service provider examinations were completed by DOD, resulting in 14 unmodified opinions and 6 qualified opinions. These examinations assess IT control activities to provide reasonable assurance to management. In FY2019, DOD plans to complete 23 common service provider examinations, potentially increasing audit costs. Passing the CFO Act of 1990 has led to continued focus on comprehensive audit procedures. Financial audits can help DOD increase transparency and accountability, improve business processes, and improve the visibility of assets and financial resources. However, audits have inherent limitations on the benefits they can provide. They focus on whether an entity's assets are used to accomplish its programmatic purpose, but do not address program effectiveness or efficiency. DOD may struggle to measure cost savings or business process improvements to communicate the benefits of the annual audit to Congress and stakeholders. DOD may have difficulty quantifying all the benefits of audits, as daily operational improvements are often organic and informal. Auditors only highlight significant issues in their reports, and DOD can benefit from auditors' informal feedback and ongoing dialogue. Addressing issues immediately is more efficient than waiting for a formal report, as not all issues need to be documented. In the private sector, only critical audit matters are included in reports, with other issues handled in the normal course of business. Reporting every instance of savings or process improvement based on auditors' feedback may detract from the audit's purpose. Allowing flexibility to identify and report significant cost savings and process improvements may help DOD focus on audit findings. Independent audit opinions provide reasonable assurance but do not guarantee all financial statements are presented fairly. Auditors use statistical methods for sampling and cannot detect all instances of fraud. Financial audits are not specifically designed to detect fraud. The annual audit assesses the potential for fraud by evaluating internal controls. Effective controls can prevent risks for fraudulent activities. Auditors consider if financial statements could be misstated due to fraud. Fraud risk factors do not always indicate fraud, but often exist when fraud occurs. Annual audits provide Congress with an independent opinion on DOD's financial systems and processes. The annual audit provides Congress with an independent opinion on DOD's financial systems and processes, improving transparency, accountability, and visibility of assets. It also helps streamline business processes and improve operational efficiencies within DOD. Assets and Financial Resources: Accurate data improves DOD readiness and decision-making by ensuring appropriate supplies for warfighters, reducing unnecessary spending on spare parts, and informing repair costs and future purchases. Strengthened internal controls minimize fraud, waste, and abuse, enhance cybersecurity, and contribute to national security. The identification of Blackhawk helicopters and parts, along with eliminating recurring annual costs, has shown positive results in operations at the U.S. Pacific Fleet. The U.S. Pacific Fleet improved operations by strengthening internal controls, freeing up funds for additional ship repair costs. The Army implemented a best practice for physical inventory at Army depots to avoid future costs. Congress has shown interest in DOD completing annual audits, with the first audits resulting in a disclaimer of opinion. Independent assessments of DOD's financial systems provide valuable insights for Congress and DOD leadership. Reliable financial systems producing auditable information for DOD could aid Congress in oversight and fund allocation. Annual audits may give DOD a competitive edge compared to other countries. Testing financial systems can identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities and improve military operations. DOD's efforts to address vulnerabilities and reduce wasteful practices could enhance its response to future threats. The implementation of new ERP systems and auditing complexities may delay DOD from achieving a clean audit opinion within the next decade. Material weaknesses in internal controls, including issues with financial and inventory management, pose challenges for DOD's financial reporting. The auditors identify deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that could lead to material misstatements in the financial statements. These deficiencies can be classified as material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, or control deficiencies, with the latter two being less severe but still requiring management's attention. Improvements in these deficiencies could enhance the business process. In FY2018, auditors completed 20 DOD service provider examinations, with 14 resulting in unmodified opinions and 6 in qualified opinions. These examinations provide assurance on the effectiveness of information technology control activities. In FY2018, auditors completed 20 DOD service provider examinations, with 14 unmodified opinions and 6 qualified opinions. Component-level auditors can use these results to reduce redundant testing, saving time and money. DOD expects to complete 23 common service provider examinations for FY2019."
