    "content": "Upon achieving independence from British rule in 1947, India pursued policies promoting government planning, infrastructure spending, state-owned companies, and trade barriers. These policies led to inefficiency, limited foreign investment, and stagnant GDP growth in the 1970s. Economic reforms in the 1980s helped boost GDP growth. Reforms and increased government spending in the 1980s boosted India's average real GDP growth to 6.0%. The 1991 economic crisis was caused by oil price shocks, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and depletion of foreign exchange reserves due to government budget deficits. To address the crisis, the Indian government implemented economic reforms including tariff cuts, liberalization of FDI rules, exchange rate and banking reforms, and reducing government control over private sector investment. These reforms led to economic growth and increased FDI flows to India in the mid-1990s. Following the economic reforms in the 1990s, India experienced a surge in FDI flows, with annual FDI rising from $100 million in 1990 to $2.4 billion by 1996. However, growth stagnated under weak coalition governments in the mid-1990s. The Asian financial crisis in 1997/1998 and U.S.-imposed sanctions in response to India's nuclear tests in 1998 further dampened economic growth. After parliamentary elections in 1999, the government launched second-generation economic reforms, leading to robust economic growth in recent years. Real GDP grew by 8.2% in 2003 and an estimated 5.7% in 2004, with projections of 6.3% in 2005 and 6.0% in 2006. India is now among the world's largest economies. India is one of the world's largest economies, with a GDP of $3 trillion on a purchasing power parity basis. However, its per capita GDP is only $2,780, indicating high poverty levels with 44.2% of the population living below the international poverty line. India is the world's fourth-largest economy but ranks 31st in merchandise exports and 25th in imports according to the World Trade Organization. India is the world's fourth-largest economy but ranks 31st in merchandise exports and 25th in imports. In 2003, merchandise exports and imports totaled $63 billion and $77 billion, respectively. India's top exports were pearls, precious stones, textiles, and clothing, while its major imports included petroleum, pearls, precious stones, and gold. The United States was a significant market for Indian exports and a key source of imports. The Indian government has prioritized the development of the Information Technology sector, which has seen significant growth in service exports, with software and service exports totaling $12.5 billion in 2003. In 2003, India's software and service exports totaled $12.5 billion, a 30% increase from the previous year. The government aims to boost exports to $50 billion by 2008 and increase IT's contribution to GDP from 2% to 7.7%. Over 60% of exports go to North America, mainly the United States. Analysts compare India's economy to China's, noting India's smaller GDP and lower living standards by 2003. China's FDI flows surpassed India's significantly by 2003, with China receiving nearly $54 billion in FDI alone, 54% higher than India's cumulative FDI stock of about $35 billion. The economic gap between India and China is attributed to China's more extensive economic and trade reforms, leading to higher GDP growth, trade, and FDI flows. China's average tariff dropped from 43% in 1992 to 12% in 2002, while India's decreased from 128% to 32%, remaining among the highest. In 2004, U.S. merchandise exports to and imports from India totaled $6.1 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively. U.S. exports to India rose by 22.6%, while imports rose by 18.4% over 2003 levels. Major U.S. exports to India included electrical machinery, chemicals, and unfinished diamonds. Top U.S. imports from India were non-metallic manufactured minerals, clothing and apparel, and miscellaneous manufactured items. The United States is India's second largest source of FDI with cumulative FDI at $4.1 billion or 10.6% of total FDI in India. India is a significant market for U.S. goods and services due to its large population and growing middle class. However, high tariff rates, surcharges, and non-tariff barriers hinder economic ties. U.S. FDI in India amounts to $4.1 billion, mainly in energy, telecommunications, and electrical equipment sectors. India maintains various trade restrictions, including discriminatory government procurement practices and export subsidies. Inefficient structural policies such as price controls and extensive government regulation hinder trade. Additionally, there are concerns about India's protection of intellectual property rights, with estimated U.S. losses of $420 million in 2003 due to trade piracy. India's trade piracy in 2003, particularly in business and entertainment software, has been a significant issue with very little progress in combating it. U.S. officials and business leaders criticize India's trade and investment barriers as hindering its economic development and stronger U.S.-Indian ties. U.S. exports to India have not performed well compared to Indian exports to the U.S., with slow economic reform in India being identified as the primary reason for the suboptimal situation. Some U.S. interest groups are concerned about closer U.S.-India economic ties leading to increased outsourcing of IT and customer service jobs to India. There have been proposals in Congress and State governments to restrict outsourcing. U.S. officials have urged India to enact new privacy and cybersecurity laws to address concerns over identity theft. India faces challenges in sustaining economic growth and reducing poverty. Economists suggest liberalizing trade, accelerating privatization, cutting red tape, and boosting infrastructure spending. However, government deficits and high debt levels hinder infrastructure investment. The World Bank and IMF emphasize the need for accelerating reforms for sustained growth and poverty reduction in India. The International Monetary Fund official urged greater trade liberalization and regional economic integration in India. Hindu nationalist groups, like the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, resist Western globalization and advocate for self-reliance. The surprise defeat of the BJP in the May 2004 election brought changes in government. The May 2004 election upset led to a new national coalition led by the Congress Party, supported by communist parties. Despite concerns about communist influence on economic reforms, Indian industrial leaders reassure investors. The Chief Minister of West Bengal actively seeks corporate investment. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an Oxford-educated economist, is the architect of major economic reforms in India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who served from 1991-1996, is known for his role in Indian economic reform and liberalization efforts. The new government's budget in July 2004 was praised by Indian industrial groups as progressive, but progress on key reform issues may be slow in the near- and medium-term."
