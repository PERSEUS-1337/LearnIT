    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Southern Border Security Assistance Act\" and includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that the United States and Mexico are facing increased violence along their shared border, which is being exploited by drug cartels and criminal organizations for illegal activities. The partnership between the two governments is crucial to address border violence and maintain legitimate cross-border commerce. National security is a top priority, and the Federal Government must secure the nation's borders. State, local, and tribal law enforcement play a crucial role in border security and responding to national security threats. Congress acknowledges the importance of providing financial assistance to law enforcement initiatives with Mexican partners and immediate resources to State and local entities dealing with border violence and criminal activities. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that defines key terms or concepts within a document or legislation.
