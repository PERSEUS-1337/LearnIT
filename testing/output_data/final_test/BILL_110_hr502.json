    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prosperous and Secure Neighbor Alliance Act of 2007\". Congress finds an alarming increase in illicit drugs and drug-related violence in Mexico and on the United States-Mexico border, impacting Americans in border communities. The security situation on the border has negative effects in the United States, with drugs reaching the nation's children. Mexico is identified as a country of concern for drug trafficking organizations undermining state authority. The United States aims to increase foreign assistance to Mexico to enhance security, promote economic development, and combat illicit drugs and criminal activities. Mexico, as a key trading partner and neighbor, requires support to address the escalating drug-related violence and threats to state authority. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to include a new chapter on assistance to improve security and promote economic development in Mexico, authorizing support for these purposes. The President, through the Director of Foreign Assistance, will provide assistance to improve security and promote economic development in Mexico by professionalizing law enforcement personnel, providing technology, training judges and prosecutors, and supporting anti-corruption programs. The President may provide assistance in Mexico for anti-corruption programs, vetting law enforcement personnel, reducing poverty through social development funding, micro-lending, and trade capacity building, under terms determined by the President. The President is required to evaluate and report on the programs carried out under this chapter annually to ensure transparency and accountability. Additionally, authorization of appropriations is specified. The President is authorized $170,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to carry out this chapter. Additional funds are available until expended and limited to 5% for administrative expenses. Congress recommends $40,000,000 for section 499H(a)(1) annually. $40,000,000 allocated for section 499H(a)(1), $50,000,000 for section 499H(a)(2), $20,000,000 for section 499H(a)(3), $10,000,000 for section 499H(a)(4), and $50,000,000 for section 499H(a)(5). The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, detailing effective strategies to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the United States, with a focus on those produced in or transported through Mexico."
