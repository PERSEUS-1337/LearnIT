    "content": "The \"NO Tobacco for Kids Act\" requires the Secretary to conduct annual surveys to track children's use of tobacco products. Manufacturers will be assessed based on the number of children using their products. Graduated performance standards will be implemented. Manufacturers must reduce the number of children using their tobacco products according to annual performance surveys, with decreasing targets over time. Manufacturers must meet decreasing targets in annual performance surveys to reduce children's use of tobacco products. The targets decrease over time, starting at 40% of the manufacturer's baseline level or the de minimis level, whichever is greater, and decreasing to 10% in the sixth annual survey and beyond. New manufacturers must also meet performance standards. Manufacturers must ensure that the number of children using their tobacco products in annual surveys is equal to or less than the de minimis level, set at 0.5% of the total number of children in the first survey. SEC. 4. NONCOMPLIANCE. SEC. 4. NONCOMPLIANCE. \nIf a manufacturer of a tobacco product violates a performance standard, they must pay a noncompliance fee of $1 per unit distributed for consumer use in the year following the violation. For subsequent violations in consecutive years, the fee increases by $1 per unit. However, if the manufacturer achieves over 90% of the required reduction in children using their products, the noncompliance fee is reduced proportionally. The noncompliance fee for manufacturers who violate performance standards is reduced by 10% for each percentage point over 90% achieved. Payment is quarterly, due within 30 days after each quarter. SEC. 5. USE OF NONCOMPLIANCE FEE.\n\n(a) The first $1,000,000,000 of noncompliance fees collected annually will fund Tobacco Enforcement and Education to enforce laws on tobacco use by children and educate the public.\n\n(b) Any noncompliance fees exceeding $1,000,000,000 will be paid into the United States Treasury.\n\nSEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW. SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\nManufacturers of tobacco products can seek judicial review in the US District Court for the District of Columbia only after paying a noncompliance fee. They can challenge annual performance survey results if they are deemed arbitrary and capricious, potentially leading to a reduced fee. SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.\n\nSection 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a noncompliance fee for failure to pay under the NO Tobacco for Kids Act.\n\nSEC. 8.
