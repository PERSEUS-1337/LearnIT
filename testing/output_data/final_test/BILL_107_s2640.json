    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the elementary schools for Yosemite National Park employees' children are located in remote mountainous areas, far from other educational facilities, resulting in limited services and basic facilities due to small student populations and challenging weather conditions. The Act aims to provide funding and support for educational services in Yosemite National Park for children of employees living in the area due to challenging weather and road conditions. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"District\" refers to the Bass Lake Joint Union Elementary School District and the Mariposa Unified School District. The term \"educational service\" includes maintenance, minor upgrades of Park school facilities, and transportation to and from Park schools. An \"eligible student\" is a student who is a dependent of a person engaged in the administration, operation, and maintenance of the Park, or lives at or near the Park on real property of the United States. The terms defined in this section include \"local educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \"Park\" as Yosemite National Park in California, \"Park school\" as a school within the Park serving eligible students, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, and \"State\" as the State of California. Funding for educational services is addressed in Section 3. For fiscal years 2003 through 2007, the Secretary may provide funding to Districts for educational services for eligible students, not exceeding $750,000 or the amount needed for services available to students in other public schools. Adjustments may be made if State or local agencies do not provide equal per student funding for Park schools. The Secretary may provide funding to Districts for educational services at Park schools, with limitations on use of funds for construction and unauthorized services. Funding source is from National Park Service appropriations, donations, or fees. The Secretary may not provide funding under this section from certain specified sources, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, recreational fee demonstration program, national park passport program, and emergency appropriations for Park flood recovery. SEC. 4 amends the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to allow park facilities outside Yosemite National Park. SEC. 5 establishes advisory commissions. The text amends the membership and considerations for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area Advisory Commission, ensuring representation of local historic recreational users. It also increases the membership of the Manzanar National Historic Site Advisory Commission from thirty to forty members. The Manzanar National Historic Site Advisory Commission membership is increased from thirty to forty members, with an amendment to the timeframe for its establishment."
