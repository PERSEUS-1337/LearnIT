    "content": "The Act titled \"Beach Act of 2015\" is also known as the \"Water Pollution Source Identification Act.\" The Beach Act of 2015, also known as the Water Pollution Source Identification Act, amends monitoring protocols and source tracking in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. It emphasizes protocols for monitoring pathogenic contamination and includes monitoring, public notification, storm event testing, source tracking, and sanitary surveys to address contamination sources. The Beach Act of 2015 updates monitoring protocols for pathogenic contamination in coastal recreation waters, emphasizing the identification of contamination sources. Authorization of appropriations is extended from 2016 through 2020. The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 is amended to change the year from 2005 to 2018. Additionally, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include all environmental agencies of the State in reporting on sources of pathogenic contamination in coastal recreation waters. Rapid testing methods are encouraged for use. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include rapid testing methods for State and Local Government Programs. The Administrator must validate a rapid testing method within six months of the Act's enactment. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include rapid testing methods for water quality criteria and standards for pathogens. The Administrator must publish guidance for the use of rapid testing methods at coastal recreation waters within 180 days of validation. The Administrator must prioritize rapid testing methods for water quality at popular public beaches to promptly notify of any pathogen exceedances. A rapid testing method is defined as providing results within 4 hours of sample receipt. Upon validation, revisions to rapid testing methods will be made. Upon completion of validation, the Administrator will identify and review rapid testing methods for water quality criteria for pathogens in coastal recreation waters every 5 years. If a new method improves speed and accuracy, it will be evaluated and validated promptly. Results of the review will be published in the Federal Register. The Federal Register will publish the results of the review, including any proposed rapid testing methods for evaluation. It is a national goal to develop a rapid testing method for water quality of coastal recreation waters by 2019 that can provide accurate results within 2 hours. SEC. 6. NOTIFICATION OF FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AGENCIES. Section 406(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require communication of water quality sample results within 2 hours. The Administrator or state agencies are responsible for notifying relevant parties accordingly. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act now includes measures for an annual report to the Administrator on water quality standards exceedances for pathogens and pathogen indicators. SEC. 7. CONTENT OF STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS. Section 406(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include the availability of a geographic information system database for informing the public about coastal recreation waters. The database must be publicly accessible, searchable online, and organized by beach or similar access points. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a publicly accessible database for coastal recreation waters. The database must be organized by beach access points, provide water quality standards, monitoring protocols, and be updated promptly with pathogen information. Closures or advisories must be issued within 2 hours of receiving water quality sample results exceeding standards. SEC. 8. COMPLIANCE REVIEW. Section 406(h) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a compliance review requirement for State and local governments receiving grants under this section. The Administrator must assess compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements annually. The Administrator must annually assess State and local governments receiving grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for compliance with requirements. Non-compliant governments must take corrective action within one year or risk losing grants. The Administrator must annually assess State and local governments receiving grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act for compliance with requirements. Non-compliant governments risk losing grants if corrective action is not taken within one year. The Federal share of funding shall not exceed 50 percent during non-compliance. The Comptroller General will review the Administrator's activities and submit a report to Congress by December 31 of the third calendar year after the enactment of the paragraph. SEC. 9 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require the publication of a list of pathogens and pathogen indicators studied under section 104(v) in the Federal Register. SEC. 10 addresses the adoption of new or revised criteria and standards. SEC. 10 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to adopt the most protective water quality criteria and standards practicable. SEC. 11 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to update the National List of Beaches biennially. SEC. 12 addresses the impact of climate change on pathogenic contamination of coastal recreation waters. The Administrator will conduct a study on the long-term impact of climate change on pathogenic contamination of coastal recreation waters and submit a report to Congress within one year. The report will include information on potential contamination impacts on water resources, public health, and ecosystem health in coastal communities, as well as highlight necessary Federal actions to protect public and ecosystem health. The Administrator will consult with relevant agencies to develop a report on the impact of climate change on coastal recreation waters, focusing on pathogenic contamination and its effects on public and ecosystem health. SEC. 13. IMPACT OF EXCESS NUTRIENTS ON COASTAL RECREATION WATERS. The Administrator will conduct a study on the impacts of excess nutrients on coastal recreation waters and submit a report to relevant committees within a year, including information on adverse effects like algal blooms and recommendations for addressing them. The Administrator will submit a report with recommendations to address the adverse impacts of excess nutrients and algal blooms on coastal recreation waters, including establishing numeric water quality criteria. Consultation with relevant federal agencies, states, and local governments is required during the report development."
