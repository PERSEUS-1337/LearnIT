    "content": "The \"Violence Prevention Training for Early Childhood Educators Act\" aims to provide grants to institutions of higher education and qualified entities for including violence prevention training in early childhood education programs. Congress finds that early childhood aggression is a strong predictor of later violent behavior, with an increasing trend of aggressive behavior among young children. Research shows that aggression is learned through observation and experience, putting children at risk if exposed to violence. In a study, 1 in 10 children had witnessed a violent incident before age 6. Research shows that early childhood exposure to violence, whether in the home or on the streets, can lead to a higher likelihood of violent behavior in adolescence. Aggression learned in early childhood can be difficult to change by adolescence, making it crucial to provide support for prosocial behavior during this critical period. Violence prevention programs for young children are essential in overcoming the risk of violent behavior. Violence prevention programs for very young children can yield economic benefits by promoting health and stability, potentially reducing costs for medical care, special education, and involvement with the judicial system. Primary prevention through teaching interpersonal problem-solving skills to preschoolers can decrease problem behaviors. Family support programs for children from birth to age 5 have shown effectiveness in preventing delinquency. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"at-risk child\" as a child affected by violence and \"early childhood education training program\" as a program that trains individuals to work with young children or provides professional development for those working in early child development programs or elementary schools. The term \"qualified entity\" refers to an organization that provides training for individuals working with young children, leading to a degree, certificate, or professional development. A \"qualified entity\" is a public or nonprofit organization with experience in administering programs and coordinating grants under the Act. The term \"violence prevention\" includes preventing and addressing violent behavior in children. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to institutions of higher education and qualified entities for violence prevention training in early childhood education programs. Grants will range from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and last for 3 to 5 years. Application process is outlined in Section 6. Each institution of higher education and qualified entity seeking a grant for violence prevention training must submit an application to the Secretary with a detailed plan outlining goals, curriculum, student recruitment and training, and methods for assisting students in finding employment. The detailed plan for violence prevention training grant application must include methods for assessing program success, sources of financial aid for students, qualified instructors using proven prevention methods, institutional capacity to implement the plan, and consultation with assisting agencies and organizations. SEC. 7. SELECTION PRIORITIES.
