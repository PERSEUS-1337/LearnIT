    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Geothermal Exploration and Technology Act of 2013\" and includes a Geothermal Exploratory Drilling Loan Program. The Geothermal Investment Fund and direct loan program for high risk geothermal exploration wells are defined in this section. The Secretary of Energy will establish the loan program and applicants can submit applications for loans. Project criteria will be considered when selecting applicants for loans under this section. The Secretary will consider the potential for geothermal resources, applicant expertise, and project importance in selecting loan recipients. Preference will be given to projects leading to successful geothermal development for electricity production. Data from exploratory wells will be shared for mapping national geothermal resources. The Secretary will determine cost share and number of wells for geothermal projects eligible for loans. Higher risk projects may receive higher Federal shares. Unproductive projects may receive further consideration. The Secretary may grant delays or waive repayment for unproductive geothermal projects. Repayment for geothermal facility loans starts 4 years after loan approval or when the facility begins commercial production, with a 4-year term for repayment. The Geothermal Investment Fund is established by the Secretary in the Treasury of the United States, available without fiscal year limitation and not subject to appropriation. It consists of appropriated amounts and repayments on loans made under this section. Loan terms can be extended for up to 4 years, and repayments are deposited into the Fund. The Geothermal Investment Fund is established by the Secretary in the Treasury of the United States, available without fiscal year limitation and not subject to appropriation. It consists of appropriated amounts and repayments on loans made under this section. Amounts in the Fund may not be used for any purpose other than those described. The Secretary of Energy must submit annual reports on the Fund's operation to specific committees, detailing amounts deposited into the Fund. The Secretary must issue guidelines for the Geothermal Investment Fund program within 180 days of enactment. The guidelines will specify terms and conditions for cost sharing levels. Additionally, annual reports must include expenditures, recommendations for additional authorities, and the remaining balance in the Fund. The guidelines for the Geothermal Investment Fund program will specify cost sharing levels, conditions for loan modifications or forgiveness, and information for loan applicants. Loans will only be provided after the developer commits their share of expenditures. The Geothermal Investment Fund program requires developers to share drilling costs and repay loans for successful wells within 10 years. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2013 through 2022. SEC. 3. LARGE-SCALE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. Amends Title VI of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 by adding section 616A for large-scale geothermal energy. Congress finds that the Geothermal Technologies Program focuses on direct use of geothermal energy, the Building Technologies Program includes geothermal heat pumps for energy efficiency in buildings, and both technologies can be utilized in large-scale applications. Geothermal energy has potential in large-scale applications but lacks representation in research and development. The section aims to enhance geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy, improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness in various settings. The term 'direct use of geothermal energy' refers to systems utilizing water between 38 to 149 degrees Celsius for heating buildings, industrial processes, agriculture, and other facilities. A 'geothermal heat pump' is a system that provides heating and cooling by exchanging heat from shallow ground or surface water through closed or open loop systems. The Secretary shall establish a program for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization of large-scale geothermal applications. The program for geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy includes research on ground loop efficiency improvements, thermal grouts, and installation cost reduction through improved drilling methods and equipment. The program for geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy includes research on ground loop efficiency improvements, thermal grouts, installation cost reduction, geothermal ground loops near foundation walls, using wastewater for heat exchange, integrating geothermal systems with other building systems, and advanced geothermal systems. The geothermal program includes advancements in geothermal systems such as variable pumping rates, heat pump efficiency improvements, utilizing hot water from mines and surface waters, heating large buildings and facilities, and integrating geothermal systems with solar technology for energy storage. The geothermal program includes utilizing hot water for energy storage, integrating direct use with electricity production, and mitigating environmental impacts. Grants are available for various entities to support geothermal initiatives. The geothermal program offers grants to various entities such as higher education, nonprofits, utilities, and for-profit companies to promote geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy. Priority is given to proposals for large buildings, commercial districts, and residential communities. The Secretary will conduct a national solicitation for grant applications within 180 days of enactment. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports to the Senate and House committees on progress and results of developing geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy. Reports must include an analysis of progress in specified areas and any relevant recommendations with plans to address them. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 to carry out the development of geothermal heat pumps and direct use of geothermal energy, including addressing recommendations and plans. Facilitation of coproduction of geothermal energy on oil and gas leases. Amendment to the Geothermal Steam Act allows land under oil and gas leases with approved drilling permits and production to be leased for geothermal energy production if it serves the public interest. The Geothermal Steam Act amendment allows for the coproduction of geothermal energy with oil and gas on land under oil and gas leases with approved drilling permits and production."
