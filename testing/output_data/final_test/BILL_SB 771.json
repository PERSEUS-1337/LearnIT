    "title": "SB 771",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699 of the Labor Code is amended to allow aggrieved employees to bring civil actions for code violations instead of the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. \"Person\" and \"aggrieved employee\" are defined for this purpose. For the purpose of this part, \"cure\" means the employer rectifying all alleged violations by aggrieved employees, complying with relevant statutes, and fully compensating the aggrieved employee. Courts have the authority to assess civil penalties similar to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, with the discretion to award a lesser amount if necessary to avoid unjust or oppressive outcomes. There is a civil penalty established for violations of provisions in this code. The penalty is $500 if no employees are employed, and $100 per aggrieved employee for the initial violation and $200 for subsequent violations if employees are present. No civil penalty applies to failures to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency. An aggrieved employee can recover a civil penalty in a civil action under Section 2699.3, along with attorney's fees and costs if successful. No action can be brought for certain violations unless they involve mandatory payroll or workplace injury reporting. An aggrieved employee cannot bring an action under this section if the agency has already taken action for the same violation. Civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees are distributed with 75% going to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education, and 25% to the employees. Civil penalties recovered under subdivision (f) are distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education. The workers' compensation provisions remain the exclusive remedy for employer liability. The superior court reviews and approves any penalties in settlement agreements. The agency may create regulations to implement the provisions of this part, excluding workers' compensation laws."
