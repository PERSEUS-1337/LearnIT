    "content": "Milk is mostly water (87.4%) with the remaining 12.6% as \"milk solids\" divided into fat, protein, lactose, and minerals. Milk protein consists of casein and whey protein, with casein used historically in industrial applications and foods, while whey protein is found in liquid whey and used in various food products. Milk protein concentrate (MPC) contains both casein and whey protein. Protein concentrates like \"milk protein concentrate\" (MPC) are manufactured through ultrafiltration, blending, or co-precipitation. They have various applications in the food industry, including infant formula, cheese products, frozen desserts, and sports nutrition. Different protein levels, such as MPC42-MPC56 for non-standardized cheeses and MPC70-MPC85 for sports drinks, are used in different products. MPC90 is used in lactose-free or sugar-free products. Some food manufacturers prefer milk protein concentrate (MPC) over nonfat dry milk for its functionality, including solubility, viscosity, water-binding, whipping, foaming, gelling, and heat stability. The United States produces minimal amounts of casein or milk protein concentrates due to federal dairy policies favoring nonfat dry milk production. The United States imports various dairy products valued at $3 billion in 2008, with cheese accounting for 38% of imports. MPCs and casein/caseinates make up 35% of total import value. Import barriers are necessary to protect the domestic dairy program from potential import surges. Unlimited market access could lead to import surges affecting federal government purchases and farm prices under the Milk Income Loss Contract program. Dairy imports are modest, primarily driven by cheese imports from suppliers like New Zealand, Australia, and the European Union. Import quantities have remained stable, with no discernible trend since the late 1990s. Imports of dairy products into the United States were subject to section 22 import quotas until 1995, which were converted into tariff rate quotas (TRQs) by the 1995 WTO Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. Dairy products not covered by section 22 quotas included casein, caseinates, whey, and soft-ripened cow's milk cheese. Legislation implementing the WTO Uruguay Round Agriculture Agreement amended section 22 to prohibit import limitations on dairy products from other WTO members. Importers of dairy products under a low tariff TRQ must obtain a license from USDA, while over-quota imports face a higher tariff without licensing requirements. MPCs and casein imports were not subject to TRQs or licensing under section 22. Dairy products are classified under specific subheadings in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. Imports of casein and caseinates are classified under specific subheadings with low tariffs. In the early 2000s, efforts were made to change the tariff treatment of milk protein concentrates (MPCs) through petitions and legislation. The National Milk Producers Federation petitioned to review the tariff classification of MPCs, aiming to establish quota classifications for them. The National Milk Producers Federation petitioned to classify milk protein concentrates (MPCs) under heading 0402 instead of 0404.90.10 to subject them to TRQs and import licenses. NMPF argued that MPCs must be produced using ultrafiltration and contain casein and lactalbumin in specific proportions, but CBP stated that the statutory language only requires a 40% protein content. The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act (S. 1542) and companion bill H.R. 3674 aimed to limit imports of MPCs, casein, and caseinates, introducing two separate TRQs for MPCs classified under HTS subheading 0404.90.10. Bills introduced in the 108th and 111th Congresses had similar purposes but did not progress beyond committee. The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act introduced two separate TRQs for milk protein concentrates (MPCs) and casein products. Imports exceeding specified annual quantities would incur higher duties. Over half of the annual trade in MPCs and casein/caseinates would be impacted by the increased duties. The proposed legislation would impact imports of milk protein concentrates (MPCs) and casein products, with higher duties for quantities exceeding specified annual amounts. The United States may need to negotiate compensation with WTO member countries under Article XXVIII of GATT 1947 if tariff concessions are modified or withdrawn. The United States may need to negotiate compensation with WTO member countries under Article XXVIII of GATT 1947 if tariff concessions are modified or withdrawn. Compensation involves offering benefits or concessions equivalent to those withdrawn, with formulas provided in the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article XXVIII from the 1994 WTO Uruguay Round Agreements. The calculation of compensation is based on exceeding the trade affected by the modification, with future trade prospects compared to the level of the quota. Based on trade data and specific formulas, the United States could potentially owe around $500 million in compensation to other countries under Article XXVIII of GATT 1947. This compensation could involve tariff reductions or other benefits, with negotiations conducted on a bilateral basis with key suppliers like New Zealand, the European Union, India, and Australia. Quota allocation for dairy products would be a major issue in these negotiations. The Canadian Minister of Agriculture announced negotiations under GATT Article XXVIII to restrict imports of MPCs from main suppliers like New Zealand and the European Union. The move was supported by Dairy Farmers of Canada to address challenges in the Canadian dairy industry. The scope of new restrictions would focus on items imported under HTS of Canada Chapter 35. The Canadian Minister of Agriculture announced negotiations under GATT Article XXVIII to restrict imports of MPCs with a milk protein content equal to or greater than 85% by weight. The Canada Gazette reported that the negotiations were concluded in June of 2008, with a TRQ for MPCs 85+ entering duty-free within quota quantities and subject to a 270% tariff for over quota amounts. U.S. milk producers support legislation to limit MPC imports, while the NMPF backs the proposed restrictions. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) and the National Farmers Union support legislation to restrict imports of certain dairy proteins to protect farm-level prices. However, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) opposes further restrictions, citing concerns about increased production costs and consumer prices. The potential impact of imposing TRQs on U.S. dairy exports depends on farm prices relative to the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP). If prices are low, stricter import controls could lead to higher government purchases and program costs. Conversely, if prices are high and the program is inactive, the impact shifts to the market. USDA purchased surplus dairy products. USDA purchased surplus dairy products from October 2008 to October 2009, primarily nonfat dry milk, with the pace slowing considerably in late summer 2009. Imposing TRQs on MPCs and caseins/caseinates may have affected farm prices as dairy product prices have since moved above support levels. The over-quota imports would equate to approximately 1.2 billion pounds of farm milk or about 0.7% of average U.S. milk production during 2006-2008.

The over-quota imports would equate to approximately 1.2 billion pounds of farm milk, which could impact U.S. dairy farmers' financial situation."
