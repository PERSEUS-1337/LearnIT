    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act of 2005\" establishes a Medicare operated prescription drug plan option under the Social Security Act. The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act of 2005 establishes a Medicare operated prescription drug plan option under the Social Security Act. Starting in 2006, the Secretary will offer one or more Medicare operated prescription drug plans with nationwide coverage. The Secretary will negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce the cost of covered drugs for eligible individuals and promote the use of more affordable alternatives. The Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act of 2005 introduces a Medicare operated prescription drug plan option. The plan offers qualified prescription drug coverage with negotiated prices. Monthly beneficiary premiums are determined for this coverage. The monthly beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage under a Medicare operated prescription drug plan is uniform nationally. The premium for months in 2006 is $35 and for succeeding years, it is based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost. The Secretary may adjust the premium for supplemental prescription drug coverage. There is a requirement for at least one plan with a $35 premium. The Secretary must ensure that at least one Medicare operated prescription drug plan offered in 2006 has a $35 monthly premium. A Medicare operated prescription drug plan may be offered as a fallback plan in addition to other qualifying plans in a PDP region. The Secretary has the authority to designate this plan as the fallback prescription drug plan for certain service areas. Section 1860D-13(c)(3) and Section 1860D-16(b)(1) of the Act are amended to include Medicare operated prescription drug plans as fallback options. The amendments add a new subparagraph for payments related to Medicare operated prescription drug plans and define the term \"medicare operated prescription drug plan.\" The effective date for these changes is retroactive to the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003."
