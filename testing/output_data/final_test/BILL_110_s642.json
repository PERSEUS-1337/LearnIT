    "content": "The Environmental Justice Act of 2008 may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Act of 2008\" and codifies Executive Order 12898. The President is authorized to enforce Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice, ensuring fair treatment and involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, education, or income in environmental laws. The text discusses the importance of fair treatment in environmental planning to prevent minority and low-income communities from bearing a disproportionate burden of negative health and environmental impacts. It also defines fair treatment as policies that prevent any group from experiencing high adverse effects from federal programs. The provisions of Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice are mentioned regarding judicial review and rights of action. Section 6-609 of Executive Order 12898 is exempted for this Act. SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must promptly implement Inspector General recommendations regarding environmental justice reviews of agency programs, policies, and activities to assess potential impacts on minority and low-income populations. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency should implement recommendations for conducting environmental justice reviews and designate a responsible office to compile results and recommend actions. EPA rules should incorporate recommendations from the Comptroller General to focus on environmental justice when developing clean air rules. The Administrator should ensure workgroups focus on environmental justice when developing clean air rules, enhance their ability to identify issues, improve assessments of environmental justice impacts in economic reviews, and direct actions accordingly. The Administrator should implement recommendations from the 2004 Inspector General Report to define the mission of the Office of Environmental Justice and improve agency staff understanding of its roles and responsibilities. The recommendation includes establishing specific time frames for developing definitions, goals, and measurements for environmental justice, providing standard definitions for minority and low-income communities, and ensuring comprehensive training programs include key environmental justice concepts. The Administrator will submit reports to Congress on the strategy for implementing recommendations related to environmental justice, including modifying emergency management procedures to incorporate environmental justice in the agency's Incident Command Structure."
