This funding aimed to accelerate the development of CCS in the United States. Approximately $1.4 billion of the allocated funds went unspent by the 2015 deadline. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $3.4 billion for carbon capture and sequestration projects at the U.S. Department of Energy. $1.4 billion of the funds went unspent by the 2015 deadline, with the largest portion intended for DOE's flagship CCS project, FutureGen. Several other large CCS demonstration projects were canceled, suspended, or failed to spend all of their Recovery Act funding before the deadline. This report assesses the reasons for project delays, suspensions, or cancellations within the broader context of DOE's CCS efforts. The DOE's Fossil Energy Research and Development Program has shifted focus towards emphasizing CCS as the main strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal. This shift reflects a consensus that CCS is a promising option to address the challenge of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. Congress has shown interest in CCS as a mitigation strategy. Since FY2008, Congress has appropriated over $7 billion for CCS activities at DOE. Several bills in the 114th Congress address CCS directly or indirectly. The Obama Administration has implemented rules on CO2 emissions and entered a global agreement to limit emissions. DOE continues to support CCS as part of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. Next generation carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are expected to become commercially available in the mid-2020s, providing a clean energy option for a world heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The Recovery Act doubled appropriations for CCS research and development until the end of FY2015, aiming to inform lawmakers on the progress of CCS technology and its potential as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has implemented rules to reduce CO2 emissions from large, stationary sources. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's final rule for reducing CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel power plants under the Clean Power Plan found that incorporating partial CCS is the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER). CCS was not deemed the BSER for existing power plants. Projects cited in the rule received Recovery Act funding, with Boundary Dam being the main example of successful full-scale CCS operations. Boundary Dam in Canada is the world's only fully integrated power plant with CCS, receiving $240 million from the Canadian government out of a total cost of $1.3 billion. While other projects supported by the Recovery Act are not currently operational, EPA states that they demonstrate the technical feasibility of CCS. Some projects faced delays and funding issues but may still become operational. The EPA's final rule on CCS projects highlights the cancellation of the AEP Mountaineer and FutureGen projects, which received significant funding but were ultimately not operational. Despite challenges faced by other projects, the EPA believes implementing partial CCS could boost future research and development in the technology, making it more cost-effective. These issues and the outcomes of the final rule are expected to shape the future of CCS projects. The EPA's final rule on CCS projects, including DOE Office of Fossil Energy spending from FY2010 through FY2016, shows funding for Recovery Act programs under CCS Demonstrations and Coal CCS and Power Systems categories. Recovery Act supported activities like FutureGen and the Clean Coal Power Initiative. DOE reorganized coal program areas after FY2010. The Department of Energy funded four main categories of activities related to CCS: FutureGen, the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS), and Site Characterization, Training, and Program Direction. The bulk of Recovery Act funds ($3.32 billion) went to FutureGen, CCPI, and ICCS. Funding was available through FY2015, with no new Recovery Act funds allocated from FY2010 onwards. DOE continued to fund other CCS programs with regular appropriations. The Department of Energy aimed to develop technologies for commercial-scale CCS demonstration in power plants and industrial facilities by 2020, with a target of five projects by 2016. The 2014-2018 strategic plan focused on next-generation CCS technologies for clean energy options. DOE's FY2016 budget justified the CCS and Power Systems R&D program for near-zero emissions fossil energy technologies. The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) programs focus on capture, transportation, and storage of CO2 underground. Funding levels for Other Fossil Energy R&D activities are also detailed, including support for fossil energy R&D and related programs. Program Direction, Natural Gas Technologies, and Unconventional Fossil activities receive significant funding in FY2016. In FY2016, the Department of Energy allocated funds for Natural Gas Technologies and Unconventional Fossil activities, totaling $43 million and $20.3 million respectively. Other activities such as Plant and Capital, Environmental Restoration, and Special Recruitment received approximately $24.5 million. The FY2016 appropriation for coal R&D saw a 7.5% increase from the previous year. The total fossil energy FY2016 appropriation was about 10% higher than FY2015. Recovery Act funds were not available for CCS-related projects in FY2016. Nine projects received $2.65 billion out of the $3.4 billion available for CCS projects under the Recovery Act. Five were large-scale demonstration projects for capturing CO2 from power plants, while four were industrial-scale demonstration projects. These projects were awarded over $100 million each, showing DOE's focus on large-scale demonstrations. Other smaller ICCS projects were not included in the list. The All Other Projects category received Recovery Act funds ranging from less than $1 million to $72 million, averaging about $12 million. The CCPI program originally supported new coal technologies to reduce pollutants. The program later focused on reducing GHG emissions by improving plant efficiencies and capturing CO2. The ICCS program demonstrates carbon capture technology for the non-power plant industrial sector. FutureGen aimed to include the full CCS spectrum\u2014capture, transportation, and storage\u2014as one facility, with a significant portion of funds allocated to capture. $995 million in Recovery Act funds allocated to FutureGen went to capture, with 40% used for transportation and storage. DOE canceled funding for the project on February 3, 2015, due to the deadline for spending the funds. The FutureGen Alliance had spent $200 million of the funds, leaving $795 million unspent. This was the largest amount of CCS-related Recovery Act funds left unspent. Approximately 57% of CCS-related Recovery Act funds, totaling $795 million out of $1.4 billion, were left unspent as of September 30, 2015. Excluding FutureGen, the percentage of unspent-to-awarded funds improves to about 26% for CCS-related Recovery Act-funded projects. Two other projects, Leucadia Energy, LLC, and American Electric Power (AEP) Mountaineer, were canceled or suspended. FutureGen spent close to $200 million, or 20% of its total project award. Lawmakers may question the tangible results of the FutureGen effort in achieving DOE's goal for commercial-scale CCS projects. FutureGen project, initially conceived in 2003, aimed to demonstrate coal-gasification technology for CO2 sequestration. However, in 2008, DOE restructured the project to focus on multiple commercial demonstrations. Despite receiving a $995 million Recovery Act award in 2010, questions remain about the project's tangible results and whether funding could have been better directed to other CCS programs. FutureGen 2.0, announced by the DOE in 2010, aimed to retrofit an existing power plant in Meridosia, IL with oxy-combustion technology. The project faced delays in spending the Recovery Act funds by 2015 due to ambitious timelines and unforeseen challenges. FutureGen faced delays in obtaining a unique injection permit from the EPA for CO2 sequestration, unlike other CCS projects focused on enhanced oil recovery. The project received the Class VI permit in 2014, four years after funding was awarded, contributing to delays in spending Recovery Act funds by the 2015 deadline. FutureGen faced delays in obtaining approval for a power procurement plan due to legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the Illinois Competitive Energy Association. The project also faced a lawsuit from the Sierra Club for not obtaining the proper well permit, leading to funding cancellation by the DOE. The CEO of FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Ken Humphreys, filed a motion to expedite the review of a case involving one billion dollars in government funding and commercial financing. Delays in resolving the lawsuit led to construction delays and the project's termination. The NRG Energy/Petra Nova project successfully expended its funding and is progressing, with engineering activities over 60% complete as of September 2015. Three other CCPI projects did not use all their funding by the September 30, 2015 deadline, leading to evaluations of their future. The future of the Hydrogen Energy California Project is uncertain as DOE lists it as suspended on its CCPI website. Funding was suspended in July 2015 due to not meeting benchmarks, but the private company partner continues to fund project development independently. The AEP Mountaineer project was terminated in July 2011 by AEP, the private-sector partner. The AEP Mountaineer project received and expended Recovery Act funding, with DOE spending about $17 million. The total project cost was estimated to be $668 million, with $129 million of unspent Recovery Act funding and $187 million of non-Recovery Act funding that was rescinded in 2012. Southern Company Plant Barry and Basin Electric Power also withdrew from CCPI early after receiving Recovery Act funding. DOE Secretary Steven Chu announced $295 million in funding for the $665 million Plant Barry project to capture 1 million tons of CO2 annually. Southern Company withdrew from the CCPI program due to financial concerns. The Antelope Valley Project received $100 million in funding to capture CO2 from an electric-equivalent gas stream. In December 2010, Basin Electric Power Cooperative withdrew from the CCPI program due to lack of long-term energy strategy, regulatory uncertainty on CO2 capture, high project costs, and environmental legislation. AEP also halted plans for a carbon capture plant at its Mountaineer power plant in West Virginia in July 2011, despite receiving a $334 million award in 2009. The decision was made because of uncertainty in recovering additional costs through rate increases. The Southern Company canceled the CCS project due to economic and policy conditions, including congressional inaction on GHG emissions limits and a weak economy. $140 million of Recovery Act funds were redistributed to other projects, with additional funding provided by DOE. The remaining funds were allocated to the NRG Energy/Petra Nova project. The DOE allocated funds to the NRG Energy/Petra Nova project, while funds for the Basin Electric Power project were rescinded by Congress in 2012. Only one ICCS project, Leucadia Energy, LLC, left Recovery Act funding unspent, with DOE disbursing only 5% of the total award for the project. The ICCS program spent 83% of its total Recovery Act funds disbursed by DOE. The ICCS program spent 83% of its total Recovery Act funds disbursed by DOE, with projects receiving between $141 million and $284 million in funding. Large demonstration projects in the ICCS category received the bulk of Recovery Act funds, totaling $856 million. When comparing spending percentages, ICCS projects outperformed CCPI projects, with a 83% expenditure rate versus 55%. The ratio of amount spent to amount allocated drops to 71%, closer to large CCPI demonstration projects. Five out of nine projects left Recovery Act funds unspent, indicating larger projects were more susceptible to delays. Stakeholders emphasize the importance of large-scale demonstration projects for future CCS deployment. DOE allocated $2.65 billion of $3.4 billion in Recovery Act funds to nine projects. DOE allocated $2.65 billion of the $3.4 billion in Recovery Act funds to nine large-scale demonstration projects for CCS. The decision aligns with the costly nature of the demonstration phase for new environmental technologies. Initial cost estimates can be low but typically increase during the demonstration phase before decreasing post-commercialization. The DOE allocated $3.4 billion in Recovery Act funds for CCS projects, but many funds were returned due to canceled projects. Stakeholders argue that DOE incentive programs for CCS deployment are ineffective, hindering successful commercialization of CCS technology. The DOE allocated $3.4 billion in Recovery Act funds for CCS projects, but many funds were returned due to canceled projects. Stakeholders argue that DOE incentive programs for CCS deployment are ineffective, hindering successful commercialization of CCS technology. Large-scale CCS projects require significant capital investment and long planning and construction schedules. However, simply increasing federal funding may not be enough to support CCS technology development. Several projects, such as FutureGen and AEP Mountaineer, faced challenges beyond funding, leading to delays and withdrawal of Recovery Act funding. The complexity and risks involved in these projects have impacted their progress. FutureGen, a high-profile CCS project in the United States, faced various challenges leading to its cancellation despite receiving nearly $1 billion in Recovery Act funds. Delays in obtaining necessary permits, court challenges, and a lawsuit from an environmental group hindered the project's progress. The complexity and risks involved in large-scale CCS projects, along with financial considerations, have impacted their ability to attract private financing and move forward at a sufficient pace. FutureGen, despite having over $990 million in Recovery Act funds, only spent 20% of its award in five years. Three out of four CCPI large-scale CCS demonstration projects are still viable, but two had to return $226 million of awarded funds, straining private-sector financing. Overall, the five electricity-generating CCS projects expended 55% of Recovery Act funds, leaving 45% unspent. Only NRG Energy/Petra Nova fully expended its funds. NRG Energy/Petra Nova was the only project to fully expend its Recovery Act funds, with construction underway and close to operational status. The Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., project has been operational since late 2012, capturing and storing over 2 million metric tons of CO2. The Archer Daniels Midland project is set to begin operations in 2016. Other ICCS projects also expended their funds by the September 30, 2015 deadline. The Kemper project, a gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant owned by Mississippi Power Company, received a $270 million award from DOE for developing gasification technology called Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG TM). The project has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, with a projected start date in the third quarter of 2016 and overall costs increasing from less than $3 billion to over $6.6 billion. The Kemper project's cost has increased from less than $3 billion to over $6.6 billion, with technical challenges contributing to escalating cost estimates. The project did not have a spending deadline like other Recovery Act-funded projects, and DOE does not view the relinquishment of unspent funds as project failure. The DOE's CCS program has made progress in reducing costs and storing CO2, but stakeholders believe it has not reached critical mass for commercialization. More pilot and demonstration projects are needed to deploy the technology commercially. Congress faces a perennial issue with funding for CCS projects, as a substantial amount of Recovery Act funding went unspent due to projects not meeting spending deadlines. Despite unspent funding for CCS demonstration projects under the Recovery Act, Congress may investigate the challenges that hindered these projects."
