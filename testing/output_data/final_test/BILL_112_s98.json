    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Creating American Jobs through Exports Act of 2011\". The National Export Initiative was launched by President Obama to double exports within 5 years, boosting the US economy and creating jobs. In 2009, US exports totaled nearly $1.6 trillion, supporting over 10 million jobs. By 2010, US exports exceeded 12% of the GDP. Exports from the United States face barriers compared to other countries, making US goods and services more expensive. Imports from Colombia and Panama enter the US duty-free, benefiting small- and medium-sized businesses. The Office of the United States Trade Representative estimates that the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement will boost exports by up to $11 billion annually, create 70,000 jobs, and allow US service providers to compete in South Korea's $500 billion services market. The European Union has finalized free trade deals with Colombia, South Korea, and Panama, which could put US companies at a disadvantage if their own agreements are delayed. The United States risks losing competitiveness in export markets when other countries finalize trade agreements with the European Union. Congress believes the President should continue the National Export Initiative to boost global export opportunities and should approve trade agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama to create jobs and stimulate the economy. To stimulate the economy, the United States aims to eliminate trade barriers for exports to prevent job losses. SEC. 3. RENEWAL OF TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY.
