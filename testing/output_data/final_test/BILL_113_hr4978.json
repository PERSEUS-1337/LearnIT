The \"Bottled Water Quality Information Act\" requires bottled water manufacturers to annually prepare quality reports as per regulations set by the Secretary of the FDA. The manufacturer or distributor must provide a bottled water quality report annually upon request, including contact information, water source type, and definitions of 'Standard of Identity' and 'Standard of Quality' as per regulations. The bottled water quality report must include a brief description of processing methods used, test results for quality, and labeling requirements mandated by regulations. The Secretary must issue proposed and final regulations within 18 months, requiring bottled water labels to include manufacturer/distributor information, how to obtain quality reports, and water source type. The regulations require bottled water labels to include manufacturer/distributor information, how to obtain quality reports, and water source type. States cannot impose additional requirements on bottled water quality reports or labeling beyond what is specified in the regulations. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include requirements for bottled water manufacturers and distributors to maintain annual quality reports and include specific information on labels to prevent misbranding."
