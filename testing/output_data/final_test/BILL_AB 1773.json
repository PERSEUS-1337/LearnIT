    "title": "AB 1773",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2830 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to define \"Benefiting account\" as an electricity account located within the geographical boundaries of a local government or campus, mutually agreed upon by the parties involved. The amended Section 2830 of the Public Utilities Code defines a \"Benefiting account\" as an electricity account within the geographical boundaries of a joint powers authority, located in a single county where electric service is provided by a single electrical corporation, and mutually agreed upon by the parties involved. The \"bill credit\" is an amount credited to a benefiting account based on time-of-use electricity generation from an eligible renewable facility. A \"campus\" refers to a specific college or university campus. An \"eligible renewable generating facility\" has a generating capacity of up to five megawatts. An eligible renewable generating facility must have a generating capacity of up to five megawatts, be located within the local government or campus boundaries, and owned or operated by the local government or campus. It should be sized to offset the electrical load of the benefiting account. The generating account is the time-of-use electric service account where the facility is located. (6) \"Local government\" refers to various public agencies within the same county and electrical corporation service territory, excluding state entities or joint powers authorities with members from different counties or service territories. A local government can choose to receive electric service under specific conditions, including designating benefiting accounts, using time-of-use rates, and owning the property where the renewable generating facility is located. The facility's output must be metered for time of use, with all associated costs being the responsibility of the local government. The local government is responsible for all costs related to interconnection of renewable generating facilities. They are not allowed to sell exported electricity to third parties. The local government is responsible for interconnection costs of renewable generating facilities. Electricity exported to the grid becomes property of the electrical corporation, not counted towards their retail sales. Ownership of renewable energy credits follows net metering rules. An electrical corporation is not required to compensate a local government for excess electricity generated from a renewable facility. Local government facilities participating in this program cannot participate in other purchase programs while in this self-generation program. The benefiting account is billed for electricity usage at the applicable rate schedule, including any surcharges, to reimburse the Department of Water Resources. The bill then subtracts the credit for the benefiting account, ensuring the local government receives the full credit. The commission ensures that bill credits are transferred to benefiting accounts without shifting costs to bundled service subscribers. All billing-related expenses are included in the transfer of bill credits. The local government can change a benefiting account once a year with a 60-day notice. Any unused credits prior to the change will be applied to the new benefiting account. The local government must give a 60-day notice before an eligible renewable generating facility becomes operational. The electrical corporation must propose a rate tariff within 30 days of receiving the notice, and the commission must approve it within 30 days of filing. The local government can terminate its election with a 60-day notice. If they sell their interest in the renewable facility or the electricity generated by it, no further bill credit can be earned. Only credits earned before the sale date will be applied. An electrical corporation is not required to provide a bill credit to a benefiting account until the statewide cumulative rated generating capacity of eligible renewable facilities reaches 250 megawatts. The chapter does not apply to electrical corporations with 60,000 or fewer customer accounts. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution because any costs incurred by a local agency or school district will be due to the creation, elimination, or change in penalties for crimes or infractions."
