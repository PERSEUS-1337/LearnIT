    "content": "The Act titled \"Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act\" establishes a program. The President, with the Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping and coastal states, will establish a Federal ocean and coastal mapping plan for the Great Lakes and coastal state waters. The plan will focus on enhancing ecosystem approaches, setting research priorities, supporting research platforms, and advancing ocean and coastal science. The Committee will include representatives from various government departments. The President, through the Interagency Committee on Ocean and Coastal Mapping, will establish a Federal program involving various agencies for shoreline delineation and ocean mapping. This program aims to identify existing federal programs, promote cost-effective mapping efforts, and enhance data sharing among agencies and non-governmental entities. The Federal program aims to enhance coastal mapping by increasing data sharing, developing standards for data acquisition and metadata, fostering expertise in new mapping technologies, and facilitating technology transfer between government and non-governmental entities. It also includes archiving, managing, and distributing data sets through a national registry. The Federal program aims to enhance coastal mapping by developing data standards and protocols for mapping federally permitted activities, marine ecosystems, sensitive habitats, and other resources. It also includes coordinating procedures for data sharing and technology transfer. The Federal program aims to enhance coastal mapping by developing data standards and protocols for mapping federally permitted activities, marine ecosystems, and sensitive habitats. It includes coordinating procedures for data sharing and technology transfer, as well as establishing a plan for the acquisition and collection of ocean and coastal mapping data with a timetable for completion and implementation.

SEC. 3. INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON OCEAN AND COASTAL MAPPING. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will convene an interagency committee on ocean and coastal mapping within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The committee will consist of senior representatives from Federal agencies with mapping responsibilities, including NOAA, the Chief of Naval Operations, USGS, and others. The interagency committee on ocean and coastal mapping, convened by the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, includes representatives from various Federal agencies such as the Science Foundation, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Army Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard, EPA, FEMA, NASA, and others. The committee is co-chaired by representatives from the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior, with a subcommittee established for day-to-day work chaired by NOAA. Additional subcommittees and working groups may be created as needed. The Committee may establish additional subcommittees and working groups as necessary. Meetings will be held quarterly for the committee, while subcommittees and working groups will meet as needed. The committee will coordinate with other Federal efforts, international mapping activities, coastal states, user groups, and nongovernmental entities. An ocean and coastal mapping advisory panel may be convened by the Administrator to provide input from nongovernmental entities. The committee will coordinate with other Federal efforts, international mapping activities, coastal states, user groups, and nongovernmental entities to provide input regarding activities of the committee. SEC. 4. BIENNIAL REPORTS. The co-chairmen of the Committee are required to submit a report every 18 months detailing progress in implementing the Act, including an inventory of ocean and coastal mapping data, identification of priority areas for survey coverage, and a resource plan for conducting modern mapping surveys. The report every 18 months details progress in implementing the Act, including inventory of mapping data, priority areas for survey coverage, resource plan for surveys, and standards for data acquisition and metadata. It also includes the status of federal efforts to leverage mapping technologies, resource requirements for organizations, and efforts to declassify data. The curr_chunk discusses efforts to declassify data from various agencies for public access, a resource plan for a digital mapping project in the Gulf of Mexico, and coordination of Federal programs. The curr_chunk provides an update on the coordination of Federal programs with state and local government programs, efforts to increase contracting with nongovernmental entities, and new Federal programs for shoreline delineation and coastal mapping. The curr_chunk states \"SEC. 5. PLAN.\" The Administrator, in consultation with the Committee, must develop and submit a plan for an integrated ocean and coastal mapping initiative within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The plan must identify all mapping programs, establish priority programs, and update priorities for geographic areas periodically. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must periodically update priorities for geographic areas in surveying and mapping, encourage innovative technologies, document best practices, and identify resource requirements. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must establish a centralized office for coordinating ocean and coastal mapping programs, designate a repository for archiving data, and create a timetable for implementation and reporting to Congress. The Administrator may maintain up to 3 joint ocean and coastal mapping centers, conducting research, development, and mapping activities to advance technologies and data processing for ocean and coastal mapping. The Administrator is advancing the use of remote sensing technologies for mapping essential fish habitat and coral resources, ocean observations, and exploration. They are also providing education and training in ocean and coastal mapping sciences. Additionally, the Administrator is developing a strategy for contracting with nongovernmental entities to enhance mapping and charting responsibilities. A report on this strategy is due within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. The Administrator will transmit a report on the strategy developed for contracting with nongovernmental entities to enhance mapping and charting responsibilities to specific Senate and House committees. SEC. 6. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. This Act does not override existing authorities of Federal agencies regarding ocean and coastal mapping. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act authorizes specific amounts to be appropriated for carrying out the Act, including funding for Joint Ocean and Coastal Mapping Centers. For fiscal years 2009-2011, amounts range from $26,000,000 to $38,000,000, with $45,000,000 allocated for fiscal years 2012-2015. Additionally, funds for Joint Ocean and Coastal Mapping Centers range from $11,000,000 to $13,000,000 for fiscal years 2009-2011, and $15,000,000 for fiscal years 2012-2015. To facilitate interagency activities under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act, departments or agencies can enter into cooperative agreements with the Administrator. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include the Administrator as the head of NOAA, coastal state defined by the Coastal Zone Management Act, Committee as the Interagency Ocean and Coastal Mapping Committee, exclusive economic zone as designated by Presidential Proclamation, and ocean and coastal mapping encompassing various data acquisition and management activities. The management of ocean and coastal areas involves using various technologies like acoustics, satellites, and direct sampling. The term \"territorial sea\" refers to the sea belt measured from the US baseline according to international law. Nongovernmental entities include organizations and private sector groups involved in mapping and surveying activities. The term \"Outer Continental Shelf\" refers to submerged lands seaward of navigable waters, with subsoil and seabed under US jurisdiction. It involves preparing maps, charts, surveys, and other graphical presentations depicting Earth's features and legal boundaries."
