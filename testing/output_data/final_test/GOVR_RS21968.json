    "content": "The report provides background and analysis on the politics of Iraq, including its communities, governing personalities, factions, security forces, militias, and government's human rights record. Iraq was under Ottoman Empire rule in the 16th Century, divided into Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra Provinces. After World War I, Britain took over Iraq under a League of Nations mandate, ruling through Faysal I of the Hashemite family. Iraq gained independence in 1932 under King Faysal I. In 1958, Arab nationalist military leaders overthrew the monarchy, proclaiming a republic. Kurdish leader Mullah Mustafa Barzani led forces for autonomy from Baghdad starting in 1961. The Ba'th Party briefly took power in a 1963 coup, but nationalist military leaders ousted them. Saddam Hussein assumed the presidency in 1979. Saddam Hussein rose to power in Iraq following the Islamic revolution in Iran. He initiated a war with Iran in 1980, leading to a ceasefire in 1988. In 1990, Saddam invaded Kuwait, prompting a U.S.-led coalition to expel Iraqi forces by 1991. Iraq then agreed to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs under U.N. inspection. In the late 1990s, Iraq's WMD programs faced scrutiny and inspections broke down over objections. However, by late 2002, investigations revealed that Iraq's WMD program had not been significantly revived. In 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein's regime and eliminate suspected WMD programs. After the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq transitioned to a plural political system with various sects and factions competing in elections. Disputes over power and economic resources resurfaced in mid-2012, leading to major conflict. After the fall of Saddam Hussein, U.S. economic sanctions against Iraq were lifted, allowing for U.S. business dealings. Iraq was removed from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism and sanctions were terminated. U.N. Security Council resolutions removed most remaining sanctions, allowing Iraq to receive arms. Iraq is still required to comply with international proliferation regimes and compensate victims of the 1990 Kuwait invasion. The Iraq WMD inspections mandate was terminated in 2007. After the fall of Saddam's regime, the United States established an occupation structure in Iraq led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer. He formed the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and the Iraq Governing Council (IGC), disbanded the Iraqi military, and barred mid to high ranking Ba'thists from government positions. These actions are believed to have contributed to Sunni alienation and the rise of a new political landscape in Iraq. After the fall of Saddam's regime, the United States established an occupation structure in Iraq led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer. He formed the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and the Iraq Governing Council (IGC), disbanded the Iraqi military, and barred mid to high ranking Ba'thists from government positions. This contributed to Sunni alienation and the rise of a Sunni-led insurgency by late 2003. A Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) was drafted and became effective on March 4, 2004, leading to the appointment of an Iraqi interim government on June 28, 2004. The interim government, headed by Prime Minister Iyad al-Allawi and President Ghazi al-Yawar, oversaw the 2005 elections process which produced a 275-seat transitional parliament and government. The 2005 elections in Iraq produced a 275-seat transitional parliament and government that oversaw the writing of a new constitution, a public referendum, and elections for a full-term government. The election used a proportional representation/closed list system with 111 political entities. Sunni Arabs boycotted and only won 17 seats. The government included PUK leader Jalal Talabani as president and Da'wa Party leader Ibrahim al-Jafari as prime minister, with Sunni Arabs holding other key positions. The 2005 elections in Iraq led to the formation of a transitional government with key positions held by various political leaders. A draft constitution was produced by a 55-member committee and adopted in a public referendum on October 15, 2005. The constitution does not specify ethnic or sectarian-based distribution of positions and recognizes Kurdish-controlled provinces as a legal \"region\" administered by the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Iraqi constitution includes provisions for the formation of regions, a referendum on Kirkuk's status, a Federation Council, and gender representation in elected bodies. It designates Islam as a main source of legislation and allows families to choose courts for family issues. The Iraqi constitution mandates education and includes provisions for the federal supreme court, distribution of oil and gas revenues, and approval subject to a veto by three provinces. Disputes remain over the balance of power between central government and regional authorities. Sunni provinces voted against the constitution, but it was adopted due to Nineveh Province's vote. The December 15, 2005 elections in Iraq resulted in the formation of a Council of Representatives with a dominant presence of Shiites and Kurds. Nuri Kamal al-Maliki replaced Jafari as Prime Minister, while Talabani continued as president with deputies from ISCI and the Sunni Iraqi Islamic Party. The 2005 elections in Iraq led to a Cabinet with a majority of Shiites and Kurds, with Sunni grievances remaining unresolved. The bombing of Al Askari Mosque in Samarra in February 2006 sparked Sunni-Shiite violence, leading to concerns about the U.S. mission failing. In August 2006, the U.S. and Iraq agreed on \"benchmarks\" for political reconciliation. In 2007, the US required progress on 18 benchmarks for providing $1.5 billion in Economic Support Funds to Iraq. A surge of 30,000 additional US forces was deployed to counter insurgent momentum. By 2008, the Bush Administration claimed political reconciliation progress due to achieved benchmarks and reduced violence. In 2008, Iraqi laws crucial to reconciliation, reductions in violence from the U.S. surge, and Sunni militants turning away from violence led to political stabilization. Maliki's offensive in Basra pacified the city, improving perceptions of his willingness to confront armed groups. Sunni ministers ended their boycott of the Cabinet in July 2008. U.S. officials urged power devolution from Baghdad to give Sunnis more control over their regions. In 2008, a \"provincial powers law\" was adopted in Iraq to devolve power from the central government to provincial governing councils, granting them substantial powers such as enacting legislation, choosing governors, and managing budgets. This move aimed to address U.S. advice and give provinces more autonomy and control over Iraqi financial resources. Law 21 has been amended multiple times to accommodate restive areas in Iraq. Law 21 in Iraq has been amended several times to address restive areas. Amendments in June 2013 gave more power to provincial governments to satisfy Sunnis. In December 2013, Halabja was announced to become a separate province, significant to Kurds due to Saddam's chemical weapons use there. Other districts like Fallujah, Tuz Khurmato, Tal Afar, and Nineveh Plains were also planned for conversion but not implemented. Provincial elections were delayed in 2009 due to disputes over Kirkuk between the KRG and central government. In 2009, provincial elections in Iraq were postponed due to disputes over Kirkuk between the KRG and the central government. Maliki's State of Law Coalition won 126 out of 440 seats, ISCI lost seats due to ties to Iran, and other factions also gained or lost seats. Turnout was lower than expected at 51%. In the 2009 provincial elections in Iraq, Maliki's State of Law Coalition won 126 seats, Sunni tribal leaders participated, and a strong rival Shiite slate emerged. Maliki's image was tarnished by high-profile attacks, leading to the rise of the Iraqi National Alliance and the Iraq National Movement. The election law passed in November 2009 expanded the size of the Council of Representatives (COR) to 325 seats, with 310 allocated by province. The remaining 15 seats were minority reserved seats and compensatory seats. The Justice and Accountability Commission (JAC) invalidated the candidacies of 499 individuals, causing concerns about Sunni Arab representation. The final candidate list for the 2010 Iraqi election contained 6,170 candidates from 85 coalitions. Iraqiyya won two more seats than State of Law, leading to a deadlock in forming a government. Maliki eventually received support from the Sadr faction, securing a second term. The Obama Administration initially supported Allawi but later accepted Maliki's re-election. An agreement was reached in November 2010 for Maliki and Talabani to serve another term. An agreement was reached in November 2010 for Maliki and Talabani to serve another term, with Iraqiyya extensively represented in government. Allawi formed an oversight body called the \"National Council for Strategic Policies\" and de-Baathification laws were eased. Maliki was elected as prime minister-designate and held multiple ministerial positions in the Cabinet. The United States began implementing its military withdrawal from Iraq as the second full-term government took shape. President Obama announced a decline in troop levels to 50,000 by September 2010, shifting the mission to training the Iraqi Security Forces. The U.S. combat mission formally ended on August 31, 2010, with the final troop withdrawal completed by December 18, 2011. Fears of Iranian influence, ISF deficiencies, and sectarian rifts prompted U.S. officials to seek revisions to the Security Agreement. The United States sought to revise the Security Agreement to keep some troops in Iraq after 2011 due to concerns about ISF capabilities and sectarian tensions. Discussions with the Iraqi government and ratification by the Iraqi COR were necessary for a continued U.S. troop presence. Negotiations ranged from 3,000 to 15,000 troops, with Iraqi leaders indicating support for a consensus among political blocs for an extended U.S. presence. On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would be out of Iraq by the end of 2011, following Iraqi resistance to extending legal protections for U.S. soldiers. The Obama Administration's efforts to overcome this resistance remain a topic of debate in the United States. President Obama announced the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of 2011 due to Iraqi resistance. The U.S. would continue to assist Iraq through various programs to strengthen its institutions and ensure stability, democracy, and economic growth. Despite not retaining forces in Iraq, the U.S. believed it could defend Iraq through its significant force in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. military presence in the Gulf was analyzed in detail in a report by [author name scrubbed]. The Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) aimed to orient Iraq towards the West, reduce reliance on Iran, and establish a framework for U.S.-Iraq meetings. The SFA emphasized mutual respect, prohibited the use of Iraqi facilities for attacks on third countries, and ruled out seeking permanent bases. The U.S. military presence in the Gulf aims to orient Iraq towards the West, reduce reliance on Iran, and establish a framework for U.S.-Iraq meetings. The Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) emphasizes mutual respect, prohibits attacks on third countries, and rules out seeking permanent bases. U.S. support for Iraqi democracy, economic development, and cultural cooperation, including aid programs and exchange programs. Since 2011, U.S. economic aid in Iraq has focused on promoting democracy, human rights, rule of law, and conflict resolution. Funding has shifted towards addressing the impact of the war against the Islamic State and falling oil prices. The State Department leads aid programs in Iraq, emphasizing mutual respect and prohibiting attacks on third countries. The United States closed its \"Office of the Iraq Transition Coordinator\" in March 2012 and opened consulates in Basra, Irbil, and Kirkuk as part of the transition to State leadership in Iraq. The Kirkuk consulate closed in July 2012 to save costs, and plans were made to replace the U.S. consulate in Irbil with a New Consulate Compound. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, built at a cost of about $750 million, controlled over 16,000 personnel at the time of the 2011 U.S. withdrawal. At the time of the 2011 U.S. withdrawal, there were about 5,500 contractors in Iraq, mainly tasked with protecting U.S. Embassy and personnel. The Iraqi Security Forces consisted of approximately 800,000 well-trained personnel, with a significant portion belonging to the Iraqi Army and the rest to the Iraqi Police Service. The Counter-Terrorism Service, including 4,100 Iraqi Special Operations Forces, was highly capable but reported directly to Maliki's \"Office of the Commander-in-Chief.\" The ISF ground forces were well armed with heavy armor supplied by the United States. After the U.S. withdrawal, many Iraqi commanders were replaced by Maliki loyalists, leading to corruption within the Iraqi Security Forces. Investigations in 2014 revealed that around 50,000 ISF personnel were \"ghost\" or \"no-show\" forces. Prime Minister Haydar al-Abbadi did not dispute claims that the Iraqi military was predominantly Shiite Muslim, causing tensions with Iraqi Sunnis who saw the ISF as an \"occupation force\" or \"Iranian force.\" The collapse of the ISF in northern Iraq in 2014 left the Iraqi Army with as few as 50,000 personnel and low morale. The Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I) had over 3,500 personnel, mostly security contractors, with about 175 U.S. military personnel and 45 Defense Department civilians. It operated under the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, overseeing foreign military sales programs and working out of various locations in Iraq before the 2014 ISIL-led challenge. The Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I) had over 3,500 personnel, mostly security contractors, with about 175 U.S. military personnel and 45 Defense Department civilians. Some personnel were seconded to anti-Islamic State missions, while others remained as OSC-I personnel since 2012. Around 50 staff members administered the FMS program and other security assistance programs. The U.S. continued to supply Iraq with arms post-2011, delivering tanks and support ships in 2012. Iraq paid $800 million for tanks out of $860 million cost. The U.S. also sold equipment to Iraq to combat insurgent and terrorist groups. The U.S. continued to supply Iraq with arms post-2011, including the sale of 36 F-16 combat aircraft for up to $6.5 billion. Deliveries began in 2014 due to security concerns, with deployment to Iraq starting in mid-2015 for air strikes against Islamic State positions. Iraq also requested to purchase security equipment from the United States. Iraq requested to purchase Apache attack helicopters and military equipment from the United States, including Stinger anti-aircraft weapons. A $2.4 billion sale of Stinger units and other equipment was notified to Congress in 2013. The provision of Apaches was delayed until December 2013 due to Islamic State gains in Anbar Province. However, Iraq allowed the deal to lapse due to a lack of trained manpower. In October 2012, Iraq signed deals with Russia for arms worth $4.2 billion, including attack helicopters and combat aircraft. They also agreed to buy military aircraft from the Czech Republic and fighter jets from South Korea. The United States, along with other suppliers, provided training and assistance programs for the Iraq military, focusing on counterterrorism and air capabilities. The programs in Iraq focused on counterterrorism and defense, with contractors embedded with Iraqi forces for tactical and institutional support. In 2012, as Sunni unrest grew, Iraq sought increased U.S. security assistance, leading to joint exercises and training for Iraqi Security Forces. A unit of Army Special Operations forces was deployed to advise on counterterrorism and intelligence against AQ-I/ISIL. A Memorandum of Understanding in 2012 between Iraq and the United States outlined military exchanges, education cooperation, counterterrorism efforts, defense intelligence development, and joint exercises. During a meeting with President Obama in November 2013, Maliki discussed enhanced security cooperation, including expanded access to U.S. intelligence. The joint statement did not specify U.S. commitments but mentioned a shared assessment of al Qaeda affiliated groups threatening Iraq. The United States increased training for the ISF and arranged Iraq's participation in military exercises in Jordan and Bahrain. Strategic dialogues were held with Iraq, Jordan, the UAE, and Egypt, along with a Police Development Program to maintain Iraq's police proficiency. The Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq, funded by the State Department using INCLE funds, saw a decline in interest from Iraqi authorities and was phased out in 2013. Only 36 advisers were involved, a small fraction of the envisioned number. Despite U.S. efforts, armed groups and political factors post-Saddam contributed to ongoing instability, leading to the rise of the Islamic State in 2014 and challenges for Iraqi forces in combating them. After the U.S. military withdrawal in 2011, Sunni antigovernment armed groups increased their opposition to the Maliki government, fueled by Sunni resentment of Shiite political dominance. The former Al Qaeda affiliate in Iraq, known as Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQ-I), led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi until his death in 2006, became a major threat to Iraqi stability and a terrorism threat to Western countries. In October 2012, Jordanian authorities disrupted an alleged plot by AQ-I to bomb multiple targets. In October 2012, Jordanian authorities thwarted an alleged plot by AQ-I to bomb targets in Amman, including the U.S. Embassy. The Islamic State of Iraq, formed by Sunni Iraqis radicalized during Saddam's rule or U.S.-led incarceration, later became ISIL or ISIS. In June 2014, it rebranded as the Islamic State (IS) under leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, declaring a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Attacks escalated after assaulting Sunni protesters in Hawija in April 2013. The Islamic State increased its violent activity after assaulting Sunni protesters in Hawija in April 2013, with about 40 mass casualty attacks per month. By 2013, the group began asserting control of territory near the Syria border. The head of the National Counterterrorism Center stated that ISIL was the strongest it had been since 2006. Some insurgent groups are linked to the Saddam-era regime or Iraqi military. The JRTN, a group linked to the Saddam-era regime, has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US. They were involved in attacks on US facilities in northern Iraq and praised protests against the Iraqi government. Iraqi officials claim to have killed their leader, Izzat Ibrahim al Duri, but this has not been confirmed. The JRTN and other ex-Ba'thist groups oppose the Islamic State. The JRTN and related ex-Ba'thist groups support the Islamic State as a Sunni organization against the Iraqi government. Ex-military officers provide military planning. Some operate under the \"General Military Council for Iraqi Revolutionaries.\" Iraqi Sunnis fighters known as \"Sons of Iraq\" cooperated with US and Iraqi forces but not all integrated into ISF or government jobs by 2011. By 2011, only about two-thirds of the Sons of Iraq had received benefits for cooperating with US and Iraqi forces. The remaining fighters were paid by the government but not formally integrated into ISF. Some disillusioned fighters joined the Islamic State in 2014. Many Sons of Iraq belong to Anbar Province tribes seeking more Sunni influence in the government and opposing the Islamic State. Key tribal leaders include Ahmad Abu Risha, Ali Hatem Suleiman al-Dulaymi, and Majid al-Ali al-Sulayman al-Dulaymi. The involvement of Shiite militiamen in Iraqi efforts to recapture Sunni-inhabited territory from the Islamic State has led to a shift towards recruiting Sunni tribal fighters for government offensives. Some Sunni leaders visited Washington, DC in 2015 to request direct transfer of U.S. weaponry to Sunnis opposing the Islamic State. The Sons of Iraq and their tribal recruiters have supported the less violent Sunni Islamist organization, the Muslim Scholars Association, led by Harith al-Dari. His son, Muthana, is reportedly active against the government, possibly in cooperation with the Islamic State. During the 2006-2008 sectarian conflict in Iraq, Shiite militias, including those led by Moqtada Al Sadr, played a significant role. Sadr, an Iraqi nationalist with a large following among lower class Shiites, tried to reach out to Sunni leaders to oppose sectarianism. Iran armed some militias with advanced munitions, leading to attacks on U.S. military personnel. Rocket attacks on the U.S. consulate in Basra continued until the U.S. withdrawal in 2011. Some Shiite militias later went to Syria to protect shrines and fight. After the 2012 conflict in Syria, Shiite militia forces from Iraq went to protect shrines and support the Assad government. Many returned to Iraq after ISIS captured Mosul in 2014 to defend Baghdad. There are around 110,000-120,000 Shiite militiamen in Iraq, including Iran-backed groups. These militias, known as Popular Mobilization Forces, are not part of the formal ISF command structure but report to a committee led by National Security Adviser Falih Al Fayyad. They received about $1 billion from the government. The Popular Mobilization Forces (PMFs) in Iraq, led by Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis of Kata'ib Hezbollah, received significant funding from the government budget, with an increase from $1 billion in 2015 to $2 billion in 2016. They may also receive funds from Iran and Iranian organizations. The PMFs include around 17,000 Sunni fighters focused on liberating Sunni areas from Islamic State control. The United States has provided air strike support to PMFs under ISF command. The militias, particularly influential commanders like Qais Khazali of Asa'ib Ahl Al Haq, have gained political power as they combat the Islamic State. The powerful militias in Iraq, including Asa'ib Ahl Al Haq's Qais Khazali, the Badr Organization's Hadi al-Amiri, and Kata'ib Hezbollah's Muhandis, are increasing their influence and pressuring Prime Minister Abbadi to align more closely with Iran. They are urging for more government funding and the creation of a separate ministry to oversee the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMFs). Sadr's opposition to the United States dates back to 2003-2011 when he formed the \"Mahdi Army\" to combat US presence in Iraq. Sadr's Mahdi Army, along with other Shiite militias, battled with various offshoots from 2004 to 2008. The Mahdi Army transitioned into a charity and employment network called Mumahidoon. In response to the Islamic State's capture of Mosul in 2014, former Mahdi Army members formed the Salaam Brigade with an estimated 15,000 fighters. Other Shiite militias, influenced by Iran's IRGC-QF and Major General Qasem Soleimani, also pressured US forces during 2003-2011. The IRGC-QF advised and armed militias like Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, Kata'ib Hezbollah, and the Promised Day Brigade. Kata'ib Hezbollah was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2009. Abu Mahdi Al Muhandis, its commander, was labeled a threat to Iraqi stability. Muhandis, a Da'wa party operative, was convicted for terrorist activities in Kuwait in the 1980s. Amir Jabir Al Ahmad Al Sabah was involved in the 1983 Da'wa bombings in Kuwait City. He later led the Badr Corps but broke with SCIRI after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. He formed Kata'ib Hezbollah with an estimated 20,000 fighters. Qais al-Khazali, leader of AAH, was captured by U.S. forces for his alleged role in a 2005 raid. After his release in 2010, Khazali took command of AAH. The Badr Organization, a Shiite militia with 15,000 fighters, was the armed wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. It received support from the IRGC-QF during Saddam's rule and the failed Shiite uprising in 1991. The Badr Organization, a Shiite militia with 20,000 fighters, largely disarmed after Saddam's fall and integrated into the political process. Led by Hadi al-Amiri, it aims to solidify Shiite rule in Diyala province and gain influence in the Interior Ministry. Some Shiite militias formed after the U.S. withdrawal, with some supporting Assad in Syria. Some Shiite militias formed after the U.S. withdrawal, with some supporting Assad in Syria. The Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba or \"Nujaba Movement\" and the \"Mukhtar Army\" are examples of these militias, receiving backing from the IRGC-QF. The numbers of these militias are unknown. Shiite men respond to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's call to join PMF organization and fight alongside ISF against Islamic State, receiving U.S. air strike support. U.S. supports Iraqi Kurds due to historical bond and atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein. U.S. ensures Kurdish autonomy but opposes outright independence. Iraq's Kurds have seized Kirkuk and its oilfields after the collapse of ISF in northern Iraq. They share a tense border with Islamic State forces and have their own peshmerga and Zeravani ground forces. KRG President Barzani mentioned a possible referendum on independence in 2016. The KRG in Iraq fields its own force of peshmerga and Zeravani ground forces, totaling about 150,000 fighters with tanks and helicopters. The Kurdish militias are under the KRG's Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs and led by dominant factions like the PUK and KDP. Masoud Barzani, head of the KDP, is also the President of the KRG. Masoud Barzani is the President of the KRG, directly elected in July 2009. The KRG has an elected Kurdistan National Assembly (KNA) and an appointed Prime Minister. Since January 2012, the KRG Prime Minister has been Nechirvan Barzani. Disputes between the KDP and PUK have sometimes clashed over territorial control and resources, with a serious armed conflict in 1996. The two parties have generally abided by a power-sharing arrangement since the fall of Saddam, but their dynamic has been altered since 2005 with the emergence of the Gorran party. Since 2005, the power dynamic between the KDP and PUK in the KRG has been altered with the emergence of the Gorran party. Gorran, a PUK breakaway, has gained political strength, winning 24 seats in the latest KNA elections. This has led to disagreements among the Kurds, delaying the formation of a new government until June 2014. The KRG region agreed on a new government until June 2014, with Nechirvan Barzani remaining as prime minister and Jalal Talabani's son, Qubad, becoming deputy prime minister. Provincial elections were held alongside Iraq-wide parliamentary elections in April 2014. The issue of Barzani's presidency caused rifts within the KRG structure, with no consensus on choosing a replacement. The KDP argues for extending Barzani's term for stability, while the PUK and Gorran want the KNA to choose a successor. In September 2015, the KDP expelled Gorran. The KDP expelled Gorran party members from KRG ministerial positions in September 2015 due to disagreements over Barzani's presidency. Unity could be restored if Barzani agrees to political reforms. The Kurdish insistence on Kirkuk as \"Kurdish land\" remains unresolved, despite the common threat from the Islamic State. Control over Kirkuk would give the KRG economic leverage, but the dispute has been temporarily set aside since the Kurds seized Kirkuk in 2014. The Kurds seized Kirkuk in 2014, giving them economic leverage. The Kurds are hesitant to yield back their positions to the central government. There have been delays in holding a census and referendum on the province's affiliation. The KRG and Baghdad are at odds over the Kurds' ability to export oil. The KRG region in Iraq has been involved in disputes with Baghdad over oil exports and energy development deals with international firms. Baghdad considers these deals illegal and insists that all oil exports go through the national grid. The Obama Administration has supported Baghdad's stance on central government control of energy projects. Payments from Baghdad to the KRG were suspended in 2014 due to disagreements over oil revenues. The KRG began exporting oil through a pipeline to Turkey to compensate for the loss of revenue from Baghdad. The pipeline can carry 300,000 barrels per day. A temporary resolution was reached in December 2014, with the KRG providing oil to SOMO in exchange for a share of national revenues. In 2015, Baghdad agreed to provide the KRG with $100 million per month for peshmerga salaries and weapons. However, payments were only partial, leading to the breakdown of the agreement. The KRG started exporting oil independently, including from Kirkuk fields, and directly paying international firms. In 2016, an agreement was reached for SOMO to market all of Iraq's oil, with KRG fields expected to eventually export up to 1 million barrels per day. In 2016, some international energy firms found that KRG fields have less oil than previously thought. The KDP and PUK were placed in a Tier Three category by U.S. immigration officials in 2001, making it hard for their members to get U.S. visas. The FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act allowed the Administration to revoke the Tier 3 designation without judicial review. The fragile power-sharing arrangement among Iraqi factions fell apart in 2011-2012, raising doubts about Iraq's stability after the U.S. withdrawal. President Obama declared Iraq sovereign, stable, and self-reliant upon the final U.S. withdrawal. Shortly after, an arrest warrant was issued for Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, a Sunni leader, leading to concerns about Prime Minister Maliki's consolidation of power. U.S. officials intervened to restore Sunni trust by securing the release of some Baathist prisoners and granting provinces more autonomy. In March 2012, factions agreed to hold a \"national conference\" for a political solution, but it never happened. Maliki faced a no-confidence vote, but it was halted due to insufficient signatures. Tensions rose after President Talabani's stroke, leading to the arrest of Finance Minister Rafi al-Issawi's bodyguards by Maliki. Al-Issawi sought refuge in Anbar Province, sparking anti-Maliki sentiments. In Anbar Province, Al Issawi sought refuge with Sunni tribal leaders, leading to anti-Maliki demonstrations in Sunni cities. Protesters demanded prisoner releases, repeal of antiterrorism laws, and improved services in Sunni areas. The use of force against demonstrators escalated tensions, with ISF killing nine protesters. Extremist Sunni groups like ISIL increased attacks on ISF, culminating in the ISF storming a Sunni protest camp in Hawijah and killing about 40 civilians. In response to escalating tensions, Maliki implemented measures of conciliation, including amending the provincial powers law to give more authority to provinces and easing de-Baathification laws. The April 2013 provincial elections were affected by unrest, leading to postponements in Anbar and Nineveh provinces. The April 2013 provincial elections in Iraq saw 50 coalitions registering with a total of 8,150 candidates. Maliki's State of Law coalition, ISCI's Citizen Coalition, and Sadr's Coalition of Liberals were among the key players. Maliki's coalition won 112 seats, ISCI won 75 seats, and Sadr's coalition won 59 seats. Allawi's Iraqiyya ran as part of the Iraqi National United Coalition. In the April 2013 provincial elections in Iraq, Maliki's State of Law coalition, ISCI's Citizen Coalition, and Sadr's Coalition of Liberals were key players. Allawi's Iraqiyya ran as part of the Iraqi National United Coalition. The June 20, 2013 election in Anbar and Nineveh was primarily a contest among different blocs, with the Nujaifi brothers winning in Anbar and Kurds winning in Nineveh. Atheel Nujaifi was re-elected as Nineveh governor, indicating a desire to avoid sectarian conflict among Sunnis. Unrest in Sunni areas escalated sharply at the end of 2013, following an arrest order by Maliki against Sunni leader Ahmad al-Alwani. This led to a gun battle with security forces, resulting in the takeover of Ramadi, Fallujah, and other Anbar cities by ISIL fighters. Maliki then armed and funded loyal Sunni tribal leaders and Sons of Iraq fighters to combat ISIL. By early January 2014, government loyalists had regained control of most of Ramadi, but Fallujah remained in insurgent hands. In April 2014, ISIL-led insurgents established a presence in Abu Ghraib, prompting the government to close the prison. ISF efforts to recapture Fallujah and other areas were disorganized and ineffective. Islamic State fighters captured Mosul in June 2014, with support from Iraqi Sunni residents, and later advanced towards Baghdad. The Islamic State offensive advanced towards Baghdad and threatened KRG-controlled territory, prompting Kurdish forces to withdraw from towns inhabited by minorities. PMF and Shiite militias mobilized to support the ISF, lessening the threat to Baghdad. U.S. advisers, airstrikes, and Iran's military support aided in the defense of Baghdad and Irbil. The outcome of the April 30, 2014, national elections in Iraq was crucial in reversing Islamic State gains. The law regulating the vote expanded the Council of Representatives to 328 seats, with a total of 39 coalitions and 275 political entities participating. Prime Minister Maliki appeared poised for a third term as his State of Law bloc remained intact. On June 17, 2014, certified election results showed Maliki's party winning 92 seats. The Iraqi High Electoral Commission certified election results showing Maliki's State of Law winning 92 seats, positioning him for a third term. Sunni and Kurdish slates won fewer seats compared to previous elections. Maliki's strong support in Baghdad Province was seen as a path to retaining his post, but his chances were jeopardized by the IS offensive. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani called for an inclusive government, leading to discussions on key positions before consensus was reached. The factions in Iraq agreed to fill key positions before deciding on a Prime Minister. Salim al-Jabburi was named speaker, Fouad Masoum became President, and Haydar al-Abbadi was designated as Prime Minister. Masoum gave Abbadi a 30-day period to achieve government confirmation. After factions in Iraq agreed on key positions, Haydar al-Abbadi was designated as Prime Minister, satisfying U.S. and Iraqi demands for inclusiveness. Abbadi's cabinet was confirmed on September 8, 2014, with key Defense and Interior ministers selected later. Mohammad Salem al-Ghabban and Khalid al-Ubaydi were confirmed as Interior and Defense Ministers, respectively, with Ghabban's appointment drawing criticism for his ties to Shiite militias. Ubaydi, a Sunni, was an aircraft engineer during Saddam's rule. Haydar al-Abbadi's government incorporated senior faction leaders, giving them enhanced security and influence. Maliki, al-Allawi, and al-Nujaifi became Vice Presidents, with Maliki using his position to exert authority independently. Hoshyar Zebari, a KDP leader ousted by Maliki in 2014, became deputy prime minister. Zebari, a KDP leader ousted by Maliki in 2014, became deputy prime minister and Finance Minister. Other key government positions include Saleh al-Mutlaq and Baha al-Araji as deputy prime ministers, Ibrahim al-Jafari as Foreign Minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi as Minister of Oil, and Hussein Shahristani as Minister of Higher Education. Abbadi's efforts to reconcile Iraqi society are hindered by hardliners and vested interests. President Obama praised Abbadi during their meeting in April 2015. In 2015, Prime Minister Abbadi made efforts to include Sunni and Kurdish leaders in governance in Baghdad, abolished the \"Office of the Commander-in-Chief,\" and amended de-Baathification laws to reintegrate former Baath Party members. He also addressed corruption by identifying non-performing military personnel. In early 2016, several officials faced corruption allegations. Prime Minister Abbadi proposed a \"National Guard\" force to combat the Islamic State, aiming to engage Sunnis and Shiites in protecting their provinces. However, the initiative has been stalled in the COR due to Shiite factions' reluctance to arm Sunni fighters extensively. Sunnis remain distrustful of the Abbadi government, especially after his visits to Iran. Abbadi's visits to Iran have raised Sunni suspicions of his willingness to compromise with Sunni factions. He is politically and militarily dependent on Shiite militias, whose commanders are becoming increasingly influential and assertive, potentially undermining Abbadi's authority. Former Prime Minister Maliki is also seeking to exert influence through the State of Law parliamentary bloc and the PMF. The militia commanders want Abbadi to align more closely with Iran and Russia. Abbadi's standing improved with the ISF recapture of Ramadi. Since mid-2015, economic strains from fighting the Islamic State led to popular unrest in government-controlled areas. Despite a reduced threat to Baghdad, protests erupted in 2015 over service delivery failures, prompting Abbadi to propose reforms that included abolishing three vice presidential posts. The controversial part of the reforms proposed by Abbadi in 2015 was the abolition of three vice presidential posts, which would remove Maliki and others from formal positions. Despite initial support from Grand Ayatollah Sistani and the public, the reforms faced opposition from vested interests. The three vice presidents refused to vacate their positions, claiming Abbadi acted unconstitutionally. Ultimately, the reform program was shut down by the COR in November 2015. Abbadi's reform program faced resistance in 2015 when he proposed eliminating redundant ministerial posts and reshuffling the cabinet with technocrats. Despite attempts to push through reforms, Abbadi's efforts were largely stymied, allowing other leaders like Moqtada Al Sadr to criticize government failures. Proposed reforms also included salary and subsidy cuts to address budgetary difficulties caused by falling oil prices. Experts predict potential anti-government demonstrations if benefits are reduced. Ayatollah Sistani's increased involvement in politics has drawn comparisons to Ayatollah Khomeini. Sistani expressed disappointment with reform progress and stopped giving weekly sermons on political affairs in 2016. The Islamic State's gains in Iraq in 2014 threatened the country's integrity. In mid-2014, the Islamic State's threat to Iraq led to the Obama Administration's decision to actively engage militarily. President Obama aimed to \"degrade and defeat\" the Islamic State, escalating the U.S. response. Actions included supplying weaponry like HELLFIRE missiles and increasing training for Iraqi counterterrorism units. U.S. Special Operations Forces conducted training sessions for Iraqi forces by June 2014. In 2014, U.S. Special Operations Forces trained Iraqi CT forces in Jordan. The U.S. response to the Islamic State's capture of Mosul broadened into a strategy called \"Operation Inherent Resolve.\" This strategy includes training and advising ISF, peshmerga forces, and Sunni tribal fighters, conducting airstrikes, and delivering weapons like HELLFIRE missiles and F-16s to Iraq. The Administration has provided weaponry and ammunition to the peshmerga of the KRG via the Iraqi government. Legislation allows direct arms supply to the peshmerga and Sunni security tribal forces if Iraq fails to increase inclusiveness. KRG complaints about slow weapon delivery from Baghdad have improved since late 2015. The Administration has provided substantial military aid to help the Iraqi government counter the Islamic State threat, including $1.6 billion in FY2015 and $715 million in FY2016 for the Iraq Train and Equip Fund. For FY2017, there is a request for $620 million in Train and Equip funds and $150 million in Foreign Military Financing. Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq has shown progress towards its goals, with momentum gained in late 2015. The campaign in Iraq gained momentum in late 2015 with the recapture of Sinjar and Ramadi by peshmerga and ISF forces. Iraqi and peshmerga forces are closing off Islamic State supply routes around Mosul. The State Department's 2014 human rights report criticized Iraq's human rights record, highlighting violations by Iraqi government and KRG security institutions. Iraq faces numerous human rights issues including limits on freedoms of speech, assembly, and association, sectarianism, governmental corruption, human trafficking, and labor rights abuses. Reports by outside groups like Human Rights Watch also highlight these problems. The reemergence of Shiite militias has led to further abuses, with reports of executions of Sunnis and prevention of their return to recaptured towns. Iraq has been placed in Tier 2 in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons report for several years, indicating ongoing concerns. The 2015 report blamed human trafficking in Iraq on the Islamic State, particularly in areas outside government control. Some human rights issues in Iraq are independent of security concerns, such as restrictions on free expression. Critics denounced the Journalist Rights Law for retaining Saddam-era defamation laws. The State Department reports instances of harassment and intimidation of journalists in Iraq, with private media often controlled by powerful individuals. The Information Crimes Law was criticized for violating international standards and was revoked in 2013. Political interference and tribal relationships regularly hinder freedom of speech and association. The Commission on Integrity (COI) faces interference and obstacles from tribal and family relationships in combating widespread corruption among government officials in Iraq. Various anti-corruption institutions, including the COI, Supreme Board of Audits, Central Bank's Money Laundering Reporting Office, and Joint Anti-Corruption Council, are involved in investigating and prosecuting corruption cases. The government's Anti-Corruption Strategy is implemented by the Joint Anti-Corruption Council, reporting to the Cabinet. The Abbadi government has intensified efforts to prosecute corrupt officials, while the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) also plays a role in anti-corruption measures. The KRG has its own anti-corruption institutions, including an Office of Governance and Integrity. The Iraqi constitution allows religious freedom, but sectarian tensions limit it. Shiite and Sunni clerics enforce Islamic law, sometimes conflicting with secular traditions. The Cabinet adopted a Shiite \"personal status law\" allowing underage marriages. The safety and security of Iraq's Christian and other religious minority populations, including Yazidis, Shabaks, Sabeans, Baha'i's, and Kakai's, is a major concern. Conditions for these communities have deteriorated since the Islamic State-led offensives in 2014. The law reserves eight seats in the Council of Representatives for minority groups. The Christian population in Iraq has significantly decreased due to Islamic State-led offensives, with estimates ranging from 400,000 to 850,000. After the capture of Mosul in 2014, remaining Christians were expelled, and their churches were destroyed. There were discussions about creating a self-administering region in Nineveh Plains for Assyrian Christians. The Iraqi government adopted a plan to convert the Nineveh Plains into a new province, but concerns arise over the inclusion of a separate Christian security force. The US did not always protect Christian sites in Iraq, and funding was earmarked for Iraq's religious and ethnic minority groups in FY2008 and FY2009. The US provided funding for Iraq's religious and ethnic minority groups, including Nineveh Plain Christians, with over $73 million allocated for projects from 2003 to 2012. Iraq has a tradition of secularism and liberalism, with women's rights being less of a concern compared to other countries in the region. Women are well integrated into various levels of government and the workforce. Iraqi women are well integrated into the workforce, with many adopting Western dress. The economy has seen growth fueled by the energy sector, with oil exports driving rapid expansion. Despite setbacks in governance and human rights, GDP exceeds $150 billion per year. However, violence and falling oil prices have stalled the economy in recent years, with a smaller budget adopted in response to declining oil prices. The Iraqi government adopted a smaller budget for 2016 due to falling oil prices, projecting a $20 billion deficit based on an oil price of $45 per barrel. Experts predict the deficit could exceed $40 billion for the year. The KRG region faces similar budget challenges, worsened by hosting displaced persons, lower oil production, and delays in salary payments. The government aims to increase domestic revenue without depleting its $60 billion foreign exchange reserves. Iraq is facing budgetary challenges due to falling oil prices, leading to a projected deficit of $20 billion in 2016. The government is exploring various revenue-raising measures, including user fees and increased charges for services. International financial assistance, such as a $1.25 billion loan from the IMF and loans from countries like Germany, are being utilized to address the deficit. Discussions are ongoing for additional funding, including a $500 million loan for purchasing Boeing aircraft. The energy sector accounts for 90% of Iraq's budget, contributing to its financial struggles. Iraq's energy sector provides 90% of the country's budget, with proven oil reserves of 143 billion barrels. Oil exports have recovered to pre-Saddam levels, reaching 3.6 million barrels per day in mid-2014. Iraqi leaders aim to increase production to over 10 million barrels per day by 2017, with foreign firms like BP and Exxon-Mobil involved in the industry. The International Energy Agency predicts Iraq could reach 6 million barrels per day by 2020 and potentially 8 million by 2035 with sufficient investment. The involvement of foreign firms like BP, Exxon-Mobil, Occidental, and Chinese firms in Iraq's oil sector has grown significantly. National oil laws are seen as crucial for transparency and rule of law. In August 2011, the COR and Cabinet drafted oil laws to regulate the energy sector and attract foreign investors. However, differences arose between their versions, with the KRG opposing the Cabinet's version for favoring centralization. A 2012 agreement between KRG and Baghdad included setting up a committee to review the different versions of the oil laws. The KRG-Baghdad interim deal on oil sales increased potential for agreement, but the breakdown in 2015 stalled progress. Iraq's neighbors have interest in stability and defeating ISIS, but Sunni-run governments are hesitant to work with Baghdad. Iraq's instability has hindered reintegration into the Arab fold after years of isolation. Iraq's reintegration into the Arab fold has been progressing, with the Arab League summit in Baghdad in 2012 and nuclear talks with Iran. Iran's support for Iraq has increased since the fall of Saddam Hussein, especially in the fight against the Islamic State. Iran has provided military support to Iraq, including advisers from the IRGC-QF, combat aircraft, drone surveillance flights, and airstrikes against Islamic State forces near its border. KRG leaders have also received military equipment from Iran for the peshmerga during the Islamic State's offensive in northern Iraq. Iran's military assistance to Iraq during the Islamic State's offensive in 2014 aligns with U.S. objectives, but there is no formal coordination with Iran. Iran cooperated with U.S. efforts to replace Prime Minister Maliki. The U.S. supports anti-Islamic State operations by Shiite PMF associated with the ISF, not those directed by Iran. Iran used Iraq to mitigate international sanctions, with sanctions on Elaf Islamic Bank lifted in 2013. The Iraqi government's close ties to Iran were evident when sanctions on Elaf Islamic Bank were lifted in 2013. The treatment of Iranian oppositionists in Camp Liberty by the Iraqi government and Shiite militias has raised concerns, with periodic attacks on the camp, including one in October 2015 that killed 23 residents. Iran has also targeted other Iranian opposition groups in Iraq, such as the Free Life Party (PJAK). The Workers' Party in Turkey is opposed to the government, and Iran has targeted their camps. Iran is pressuring Kurdish parties in Iraq. The Iran-Iraq relationship contrasts with the past war, and Iraq's Shiite clerics resist Iranian interference. There is a disagreement between the US and Iraq on Syria, with Iraq viewing President Assad as an ally. Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Russia formed an intelligence fusion cell in 2015. Iraq, along with Iran, Syria, and Russia, formed an intelligence fusion cell in 2015 to cooperate against the Islamic State. The US Administration expressed concerns that this arrangement could assist Assad and give Russia a military role in Iraq, jeopardizing US support. Iraq publicly supported a 2015 multilateral agreement on a transition of power in Syria, but the issue of Iranian arms supplies passing through Iraq to Syria has caused tensions with the US. Following high-level U.S. requests, Iran's aircraft were allowed to proceed after no arms were found aboard, as they had already dropped off cargo in Syria. After Secretary of State Kerry's visit in 2013, the U.S. provided Iraq with information on Iranian flights, leading to a decrease in overflights. The KRG trained Syrian Kurdish militia forces for autonomy if Assad loses control and sent peshmerga to assist in defending Kobane. Turkey's focus on Iraqi Kurdish autonomy and independence has been a longstanding concern. Turkey has concerns about Iraqi Kurdish independence due to potential impact on Kurdish oppositionists in Turkey. Despite periodic military operations against PKK camps in Iraq, Turkey has a positive relationship with the KRG and is a major investor in northern Iraq. Turkey's support for the KRG complicates its relations with the Iraqi government. Turkey's support for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) complicates its relations with the Iraqi government. Minister Ahmet Davotoglu's visit to Kirkuk was criticized by Iraq's Foreign Ministry as interference. Despite efforts to improve relations, tensions remain over oil sales and military presence near Mosul. Sunni-led Arab states in the Gulf criticize Iraq's Shiite-dominated government and discrimination against Sunnis. Iraq-GCC relations deteriorated from 2012-2014 due to the Maliki government's marginalization of key Sunni leaders. The GCC states have joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS but have limited their airstrikes to Syria, not Iraq. Saudi Arabia faced criticism for delaying the opening of an embassy in Baghdad, eventually announcing its opening in September 2014. Iraq-GCC relations improved with Saudi Arabia appointing a resident Ambassador to Iraq during Prime Minister Abbadi's visit to Washington, DC in April 2015. Abbadi criticized Saudi intervention in Yemen, aligning with Iran's stance. Saudi Arabia opened its embassy in Baghdad in December 2015, causing diplomatic friction with comments by Ambassador al-Sabhan. Iraq supported Iran's criticism of Saudi Arabia's execution of a Shiite cleric in January 2016. Iraq's relationship with Kuwait remains sensitive. Iraq and Kuwait have a sensitive relationship due to the 1990 invasion, but Kuwait has been supportive of Iraq's government. Kuwait's Amir Sabah was the only Gulf leader to attend the 2012 Arab League summit in Baghdad. These issues are detailed in the CRS Report RS21513, Kuwait: Governance, Security, and U.S. Policy."
