    "content": "Shortly after the 107th Congress convened, Speaker Hastert established a Working Group on Terrorism and Homeland Security under the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. After the 9/11 attacks, the working group was elevated to a subcommittee by Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt. This subcommittee was tasked with coordinating efforts of various House committees on terrorism-related issues and serving as a clearinghouse for legislative proposals. The complexity of homeland security jurisdiction was evident when the House bill to create DHS, H.R. 5005, was referred to 12 committees. A Select Committee on Homeland Security was then formed in the 107th Congress to consolidate recommendations and draft a bill. The Homeland Security Act included a provision for Congress to review its committee structure in light of the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. The House responded by creating a Select Committee on Homeland Security for the 108th Congress with legislative jurisdiction. The Select Committee on Homeland Security has legislative jurisdiction to develop recommendations related to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and oversight functions to review laws and programs. Speaker Hastert emphasized the committee's role in overseeing the creation of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure compliance with Congress's directives. The House established a select committee to assist in the transition of the executive branch reorganization. This committee focuses on homeland security legislation and oversight without changing the jurisdictions of standing committees. In the 108th Congress, measures related to homeland security were referred to the Select Committee on Homeland Security and other committees, with the select committee designated as the primary committee by the Speaker. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized in response to the creation of DHS. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized its subcommittees in response to the creation of DHS, including the establishment of the Homeland Security Subcommittee. Other House authorizing committees also created homeland security or terrorism subcommittees to align with the new Department of Homeland Security. The House Appropriations Committee reorganized subcommittees in response to the creation of DHS, including the Homeland Security Subcommittee. Other House authorizing committees also established homeland security or terrorism subcommittees. The Select Committee on Homeland Security was given the task of studying House rules related to homeland security. The Select Committee on Homeland Security reorganized subcommittees to study House rules related to homeland security, including the Subcommittee on Rules chaired by Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Witnesses endorsed the existence of a House committee with jurisdiction over DHS and homeland security policy areas during hearings in 2003. Witnesses endorsed the need for a separate legislative committee with jurisdiction over DHS and homeland security policy areas, including academic experts, former Speakers, and former Secretaries testifying on the importance and uniqueness of homeland security. The House parliamentarian also provided context on previous committee reorganizations. The Members suggested creating a House committee on homeland security with legislative and oversight jurisdiction, considering the impact on existing committees. Testimony from witnesses at Rules Subcommittee hearings highlighted key considerations for the potential committee. Committee chairs and ranking members emphasized similar points during the hearings. Former Speaker Gingrich and former Secretary Schlesinger emphasized the seriousness of the terrorist threat to American society and democracy during Rules Subcommittee hearings. Witnesses like Donald Wolfensberger highlighted the need for a concentrated effort to address the duration and severity of the threat. Former Speaker Gingrich and former Secretary Schlesinger emphasized the seriousness of the terrorist threat as a reason for a concentrated effort by both the executive and Congress. Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Mica explained that the missing ingredient was a national consensus on prioritizing terrorism. Witnesses testified on the importance of the new Department of Homeland Security developing organizationally to carry out its mission effectively. The need for a single House homeland security committee was also discussed. Former Secretary Schlesinger emphasized the importance of a permanent House homeland security committee to unify the mission, prevent agencies from focusing solely on their historic functions, and avoid preserving existing agency cultures. Failure to integrate agencies effectively could be exploited by those wishing harm to the country. Dr. Ornstein and Government Reform Committee Chairman Tom Davis testified on the negative impact of fragmented committee jurisdiction on homeland security development. Ornstein highlighted the risk of other committees prioritizing their own interests over Homeland Security, while Davis emphasized the importance of Congress's work for the success of the Department in economic recovery and counterterrorism efforts. Congress must provide the Department with proper resources and maintain oversight for the success of the massive reorganization. The number of committees with jurisdiction over DHS poses a challenge to developing a coherent homeland security policy. Former Secretary Schlesinger highlighted duplication issues among House committees. Former Speaker Foley, Former Representative Lee Hamilton, and Former Representative Robert Walker highlighted issues with duplication and blurred priorities in House committees' oversight. Ranking Member Dingell of the Energy and Commerce Committee expressed positive experiences with committees sharing oversight and concerns over a single committee's jurisdiction. Former Speaker Foley, Former Representative Lee Hamilton, and Former Representative Robert Walker highlighted issues with duplication and blurred priorities in House committees' oversight. Judiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Waxman of the Government Reform Committee expressed the effectiveness of oversight by multiple committees with different perspectives. Public witnesses also expressed concerns about the amount of time DHS officials spend responding to hearings and requests from numerous committees and subcommittees. Former Secretary Schlesinger reported spending half of his time as secretary of energy on Capitol Hill. Former Secretary Schlesinger reported spending half of his time as secretary of energy on Capitol Hill, dealing with various problems. Congressional scholars and former Representatives highlighted the burden of multiple committees and subcommittees on the Department of Homeland Security, suggesting simplification to improve effectiveness. Representative Dingell drew on past experiences to emphasize the need for streamlining overlapping committee structures. During the 1970s, various committees provided valuable insights on energy and regulatory matters. Testimonies highlighted the need for a standing homeland security committee in Congress to effectively oversee the reorganized executive branch. Congressional scholar David King emphasized the imbalance between the executive and legislative branches due to the creation of DHS. The imbalance between the executive and legislative branches is a concern, with the need for a single standing committee of jurisdiction to oversee the Department of Homeland Security. Congress must step up to address the fragmentation and ensure equal footing with the executive branch. Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Barton and other committee chairs support a different perspective on committee organization. Several committee chairs and ranking members express concerns about the multiple committees that Cabinet agencies like Health and Human Services, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy have to report to, leading to fragmentation and imbalance in oversight. Former Speaker Foley and public witnesses support the creation of a new homeland security committee to address the issue of oversight fragmentation caused by multiple congressional committees that Cabinet agencies report to. The need for focus and scope in oversight functions is emphasized to prevent distractions for members of the new Department. Former Speaker Foley and public witnesses advocate for a new homeland security committee to address oversight fragmentation caused by multiple congressional committees. The focus is on preventing distractions for members of the new Department by streamlining testimony requests and reducing duplication in oversight. Agriculture Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Stenholm question how one committee can effectively oversee the diverse portfolio of Homeland Security. The Agriculture Committee and Aviation Subcommittee emphasized the importance of their expertise in overseeing U.S. agriculture and aviation security. They highlighted the need for specialized knowledge to address threats and create effective legislation in their respective fields. The world's safest aviation industry is maintained through expertise gained from years of working on security issues. Recommendations for a homeland security committee emphasize the need for congressional leadership to establish a culture of homeland security within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS was created to align 22 federal agencies towards the mission of protecting the homeland and fostering a common mission and culture. Former Secretary Schlesinger also supports the idea of cultural change within the department. The need for a homeland security committee is emphasized to address cultural challenges within the Department of Homeland Security and align agencies towards the mission of protecting the homeland. Concerns are raised about existing jurisdiction and the impact on law enforcement and civil liberties within the committee system. Chairman Sensenbrenner and Chairman Bill Thomas expressed concerns about the jurisdiction and focus of the committee, highlighting the need to balance security with civil liberties and commerce in law enforcement and immigration matters. Bill Thomas discussed the conflict between security and commerce at the border, emphasizing the need to balance public security with freedom in decision-making processes. Several committee chairs and ranking members also shared their perspectives on the matter. Several committee chairs and ranking members discussed their committees' work related to homeland security, with examples such as the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction over security at nuclear power plants. The conference report on H.R. 6 includes strong new security requirements developed on a bipartisan basis. Representative Mica highlighted the importance of securing transportation infrastructure. Subcommittee received a statement from Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Young listing the committee's counterterrorism and homeland security legislation since 1989. Representative Mica highlighted various security measures implemented in aviation and transportation, including background checks for aviation personnel, bomb detection devices at airports, creation of TSA, fortified cockpit doors, armed pilots, and port security grants. Government Reform Committee Chairman Davis emphasized the committee's oversight of DHS. The committee oversaw topics related to FEMA, TSA, first responders, critical infrastructure, visa policy, preparedness standards, DHS financial accountability, border management, port security, and product litigation management. They also discussed homeland security legislation that seemed stalled and observed little overlap in the work of different committees. Several witnesses provided definitions of homeland security. Former Secretary Schlesinger outlined the mission of the Department of Homeland Security as anticipating and responding to possible attacks on the United States, mitigating the consequences, and providing assistance to overwhelmed local governments in the event of a nuclear detonation. The Department of Homeland Security's mission includes anticipating and responding to attacks, mitigating consequences, and providing assistance to overwhelmed local governments in the event of a nuclear detonation. Former Speaker Gingrich emphasized the importance of intelligence, prevention, response, recovery, and coordination of capabilities within the Federal Government. The Department of Homeland Security, along with other agencies like Health and Human Services, CDC, and USDA, play significant roles in homeland security. Speaker Gingrich emphasized the need for mission-driven jurisdiction in committees related to homeland security. The Department of Homeland Security, along with other agencies, plays a significant role in homeland security. Chairman Cox emphasized the importance of keeping DHS focused on its mission of protecting, preventing, and responding to threats. Witnesses suggested options for a new homeland security committee, with some opposing certain jurisdictional arrangements. Congressional scholars recommended a gradual approach to building the Homeland Security Committee. Scholars Ornstein and Thomas Mann advised a gradual and strategic approach to creating a permanent standing committee for homeland security. They emphasized the need for shared jurisdiction and coordination due to the diverse functions of DHS. They proposed creative use of the referral process and involvement of the Speaker in prioritizing requests for executive officials' testimony. Dr. Ornstein also warned against potential institutional problems if Members were to retain assignments in addition to serving on the new committee. Former Secretary Schlesinger recommended consolidating committee jurisdiction over DHS by creating a standing committee with oversight and legislative authority. Dr. Mann highlighted the House's ability to manage jurisdictional sprawl through joint and sequential referral strategies, suggesting that not having a homeland security committee may have benefits in leveraging expertise from various committees for coherent legislation. Transfer Jurisdiction over DHS to Homeland Security Committee. Dr. Thurber recommended creating a permanent standing committee on homeland security in House Rule X, with jurisdiction related to DHS agencies and the mission of reducing threats to homeland security. Coordination with other committees would be necessary to develop comprehensive policies. Dr. Thurber and Mr. Wolfensberger recommended creating a permanent standing committee on homeland security with shared jurisdiction over DHS agencies and functions not related to homeland security. They suggested transferring jurisdiction from other committees to the new committee and including members from those committees for expertise and institutional knowledge. They also proposed transition rules to facilitate this service. The suggestion is to create a new homeland security committee that would work closely with other committees, overseen by bipartisan leadership. It is proposed to increase committee chairs' term limits to four consecutive terms to incentivize change and expertise building. Former Representatives Walker and Hamilton also support the idea of a permanent standing committee on homeland security to eliminate \"silos\" and promote informed congressional oversight. Several committee leaders expressed reservations about transferring jurisdiction to a new committee overseeing homeland security, citing the value of their committees' expertise in various areas such as agriculture and energy. They highlighted the challenges of consolidating expertise and the potential overlap in jurisdiction between existing committees and a new homeland security committee. Several committee leaders expressed reservations about transferring jurisdiction to a new homeland security committee, citing the expertise and experience within their standing committees. Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Mica and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking Member Oberstar emphasized the need for expertise in legislating on homeland security within complex systems like aviation. Judiciary Committee Chairman Sensenbrenner discussed the balance between security and civil liberties in law enforcement and immigration, advocating for the Judiciary Committee to retain jurisdiction due to its experience and balanced approach. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Thomas highlighted his committee's jurisdiction over customs functions. Means Committee Chairman Thomas emphasized the importance of his committee's jurisdiction over customs functions for U.S. international trade, ensuring smooth and efficient operations amidst security concerns. A proposal was made to create a new committee by splitting the existing Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, with a portion of members assigned to the new committee focused on homeland security. Additionally, Homeland Security was suggested to be assigned to the Government Reform Committee. The Government Reform Committee proposed overseeing homeland security administration and White House coordination, while existing committees would continue overseeing legacy agencies transferred to DHS. The committee cited its jurisdiction over agency reorganization, IT security, and government organization efficiency. The Government Reform Committee proposed overseeing homeland security administration and White House coordination, while existing committees would continue overseeing legacy agencies transferred to DHS. Science Committee Chairman Boehlert suggested giving primary legislative jurisdiction over each directorate of DHS to the appropriate standing Committee. Congressional scholar David King recommended a permanent select committee on homeland security with primary jurisdiction over DHS. Dr. King recommended creating a permanent select committee on homeland security with primary jurisdiction over DHS, suggesting specific guidelines for membership and seniority. Intelligence Committee Chairman Goss highlighted the benefits of such a committee. Committee Chairman Goss and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Thomas discussed the advantages of a permanent select committee on homeland security, with Thomas suggesting a model similar to the former Select Committee on Aging. They emphasized the importance of coordination, observation, and assistance without interfering with existing committee structures. Witnesses also mentioned the past use of ad hoc committees, including the creation of the Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 107th Congress. The 108th Congress discussed legislation for establishing DHS, emphasizing the need for coordination among committees and limiting Members to two committee assignments. Witnesses highlighted the challenges of multiple committees with jurisdiction over DHS and the inefficiency of scheduling conflicting hearings. Former Representative Hamilton emphasized Congress's potential contribution to DHS. Former Representative Hamilton and Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Barton discussed the need for coordination among committees overseeing DHS. Suggestions included appointing a liaison staff member in the Speaker's office and extending the Select Committee on Homeland Security. Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Dingell proposed coordination among existing committees with House leadership assistance. Intelligence Ranking Member Harman emphasized the value of a permanent standing committee on homeland security. Ranking Member Harman and Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Mica highlighted the importance of a permanent standing committee on homeland security for coordinated oversight of DHS and coordination of homeland-security activities. Speaker Gingrich recommended the creation of a homeland security subcommittee within the Budget Committee to ensure adequate resources for homeland security. Speaker Gingrich recommended the creation of a resolution at the beginning of each Congress to instruct the executive branch on reporting requirements and to monitor House interactions with DHS. Six standing committees reorganized to create subcommittees with jurisdiction over homeland security. Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Barton suggested changing House rules to allow standing committees to establish additional subcommittees for homeland security oversight. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended establishing a permanent Committee on Homeland Security with a new clause in House Rule X. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended the addition of a new clause 12 to House Rule X, creating a standing committee with jurisdiction over \"homeland security generally\" and DHS, with exclusive authorizing and oversight jurisdiction related to terrorism prevention within the United States. The committee would consist of up to 29 members, with no more than 16 from one party, and the Speaker and minority leader would serve ex officio without voting privileges. Legislation and matters referred to the Select Committee in the 108th Congress would not set a precedent for the new committee. The proposed standing committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress would have jurisdiction over homeland security, the Department of Homeland Security, and specific components such as information sharing, terrorism threat warnings, research and development, and border security. The proposed standing committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress would have jurisdiction over security responsibility for United States borders and ports of entry, enforcement of Federal immigration laws, transportation systems security, customs enforcement, and preparation to respond to acts of terrorism as outlined in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The recommendations for the proposed standing committee on Homeland Security in the 108th Congress included changes to reduce overlap with other committees' jurisdictional statements. Committees affected by the proposed changes were Energy and Commerce, Financial Services, and International Relations. The committee's jurisdiction does not include responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security. The Committee on the Judiciary amended its jurisdiction over immigration and naturalization with exceptions related to border security and immigration enforcement. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure amended its jurisdiction to exclude homeland security-related missions of the Coast Guard and federal management of natural disasters. The committee's jurisdiction includes federal management of natural disasters, with exceptions related to the Department of Homeland Security. Transportation regulatory agencies have exceptions for Homeland Security responsibilities. Civil aviation is now listed separately with a focus on safety and commercial impact. The Committee on Ways and Means added \"Revenue from\" to its jurisdictional statement. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence proposed including at least one member from the new Committee on Homeland Security. Chairman Cox emphasized the need for the new committee to have meaningful jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security. Representative Slaughter highlighted the importance of giving the committee sufficient authority to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence recommended creating a permanent standing committee to oversee the Department of Homeland Security. This would address the current diffused congressional jurisdiction and help guide the Department's activities in a consistent and focused way. Chairman Linder of the Rules Committee supported this recommendation. The House passed H.R. 10, the 9/11 Recommendations Implementation Act, urging the Committee on Rules to consider recommendations from the Select Committee on Homeland Security and other relevant committees regarding jurisdiction over homeland security matters. Chairman Linder of the Rules Committee solicited Members' opinions on homeland security and House rule changes for the 109th Congress. Speaker Hastert addressed the House Republican Conference on November 16, 2004, expressing his intention to make the Select Committee on Homeland Security permanent. This report summarizes actions in the 107th and 108th Congresses related to committee organization and homeland security issues. Key actions in the 107th Congress included the creation of the Working Group on Terrorism and Homeland Security within the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the elevation of the group to a subcommittee. In the 108th Congress, key actions included the creation of the Select Committee on Homeland Security, hearings on committee organization, recommendations for a standing committee on homeland security, and support for a permanent homeland security committee in the 109th Congress. The next sections of the report summarize the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and recommendations from national commissions and think tanks relevant to House. The curr_chunk discusses the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and recommendations from national commissions and think tanks related to House committee organization and homeland security. It highlights the definitions of homeland security in the act, specific recommendations for committee organization, and a brief history of committee reorganization. The Select Committee on Homeland Security emphasized the act as a guide for jurisdictional reform. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defined homeland security as a national effort to prevent terrorist attacks, reduce vulnerability, and recover from attacks. The act contained three definitions for different purposes, including the mission of the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defined homeland security as efforts to prevent terrorist attacks, reduce vulnerability, and recover from attacks. It established the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency for research on homeland security threats, particularly terrorism. Congress also directed the President to include an analysis of homeland security spending in the annual budget submission. The term 'homeland security' refers to activities that detect, deter, protect against, and respond to terrorist attacks within the United States and its territories. Recommendations were made for the creation of homeland security committees in Congress, but details like jurisdiction were not specified. The commissions and think tanks provided recommendations for House and Senate committee reorganization in the context of combating terrorism and securing the homeland. Former Governor Thomas Kean and Representative Lee Hamilton chaired the 9/11 Commission. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, chaired by Representative Lee Hamilton, reported its findings to the President and Congress on July 22, 2004. The commission emphasized the need for a comprehensive political-military strategy to combat Islamist terrorism, including attacking terrorists, preventing their growth, and preparing for attacks. It made numerous recommendations in its final chapters, urging the U.S. to consider both the objectives and organization of a new strategy. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States recommended reorganizing the government to effectively combat Islamist terrorism. This includes unifying strategic intelligence and operational planning, creating a National Counterterrorism Center, appointing a National Intelligence Director, and implementing a network-based information-sharing system. The 9/11 Commission recommended reorganizing congressional oversight for intelligence, counterterrorism, and homeland security to improve coordination and efficiency. It suggested creating a joint committee or single committee in each chamber with authorizing and appropriating authority. The commission also highlighted the need to streamline the Department of Homeland Security's interactions with Congress, as appearing before 88 committees and subcommittees hinders its development. The 9/11 Commission recommended reorganizing congressional oversight for intelligence, counterterrorism, and homeland security to improve coordination and efficiency. It suggested creating a joint committee or single committee in each chamber with authorizing and appropriating authority. The commission also highlighted the need to streamline the Department of Homeland Security's interactions with Congress, as appearing before 88 committees and subcommittees hinders its development. Congress needs to establish clear authority and responsibility for the Department of Homeland Security to effectively deal with major terrorist threats within the United States. Recommendation: Congress should create a single, principal point of oversight and review for homeland security. The Bremer Commission, named after its chair L. Paul Bremer III, recommended the establishment of a permanent standing committee in Congress for oversight of homeland security. It focused on intelligence and international aspects of counterterrorism, warning of an evolving terrorist threat. The commission's report was submitted to the President and Congress on June 7, 2000. International terrorism poses a dangerous threat to America, requiring increased efforts to prevent attacks. Intelligence and law enforcement must collect information on terrorist plans, target states supporting terrorists, and cut off financial support. Preparation for potential attacks involving biological, chemical, or nuclear materials is crucial. The government, President, and Congress should reform the system for counterterrorism and homeland protection. The Bremer Commission recommended reforms in reviewing and funding counterterrorism programs to create a comprehensive plan. The report outlined specific actions to prevent terrorist acts, reduce their likelihood, and prepare for their possibility. Congress was advised to develop mechanisms for coordinated review of the President's counterterrorism policy and budget. The Gilmore Commission, chaired by then-Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore III, made five annual reports from 1999 to 2003 recommending a national strategy to combat terrorism. The commission emphasized the inevitability of a terrorist attack on US soil and the need for readiness. Congress was urged to address the national strategy for counterterrorism and homeland security. The Gilmore Commission recommended a national strategy for counterterrorism and homeland security, emphasizing the need for readiness and a cohesive approach. Their strategic vision, \"America's New Normalcy,\" aimed to balance reducing the terrorist threat with lessening vulnerabilities to attacks by 2009. The New Normalcy in January of 2009 should focus on sustaining and empowering individual freedoms while enhancing security measures to prevent and respond to terrorist threats effectively. This includes improving information sharing, enhancing preparedness at all levels of government and the private sector, and establishing clear roles and responsibilities. The New Normalcy in January of 2009 should focus on sustaining individual freedoms while enhancing security measures to prevent and respond to terrorist threats effectively. This involves improving information sharing, preparedness at all levels of government and the private sector, and establishing clear roles and responsibilities. Additionally, there should be clear processes for engaging academia, business, government, and others in developing and implementing research, development, and standards to secure the homeland. This includes defining roles, responsibilities, and acceptable uses of the military domestically to strengthen the National Guard and Federal Reserve Components for any domestic mission. The Gilmore Commission emphasized the need for a unified approach to managing risks in critical infrastructures of government and the private sector. They highlighted the importance of being able to handle a wide variety of threats, including SARS, West Nile Virus, and the recent fires in California. The commission also addressed topics such as protecting civil liberties and empowering state and local government in the context of homeland security. The commission's report emphasized the importance of recognizing security and civil liberties as mutually reinforcing values. Counterterrorism initiatives should preserve unalienable rights such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While these rights are fundamental, privileges may be imposed upon to protect national security, but should not be taken lightly as they are essential to our quality of life. The commission emphasized the need for a national strategy empowering states and local governments in preparedness. Federal officials should lead in intelligence sharing, risk assessments, and coordination with other sectors for sustainable preparedness. The Gilmore Commission recommended creating committees in each chamber or a joint committee of the House and Senate for counterterrorism and homeland security. These committees would review and support implementation plans for combating terrorism developed by the National Office for Combating Terrorism. The second annual report suggests the establishment of separate authorizing committees and appropriation subcommittees in each House of Congress for Combating Terrorism/Homeland Security. These committees would develop a consolidated legislative plan and serve as a clearinghouse for all legislative proposals related to combating terrorism. The Hart-Rudman Commission, co-chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman, issued three reports between September 1999 and February 2001. The reports assessed the global security environment, proposed a strategy for national security/homeland security, and recommended institutional changes to support the strategy. The commission envisioned a future of rapid technological change and proposed that the United States lead in creating a world balanced between freedom and stability. The Hart-Rudman Commission recommended extensive changes in institutional arrangements and policies in the executive and legislative branches to address the challenges in U.S. national security policymaking. The commission proposed a strategy that aims to balance the benefits of a more integrated world with the need to dampen global instability, outlining six key objectives to defend the United States and ensure freedom, security, and prosperity. The Hart-Rudman Commission proposed a strategy with six objectives to defend the United States, maintain social cohesion, assist major powers' integration, promote the global economy, adapt alliances to a new era, and tame disintegrative forces. The Hart-Rudman Commission outlined six objectives for defending the United States and promoting global peace through democracy. They also recommended organizational changes in various areas to enhance national security. The Hart-Rudman Commission recommended organizational changes in congressional structure to better serve national security objectives, including merging authorizing committees with relevant appropriations subcommittees and forming permanent consultative groups of Congressional leaders. Congress and the Executive Branch should prioritize sustained focus on foreign policy and national security consultation. The Congressional leadership should conduct a thorough review of the Legislative Branch's relationship to national security and foreign policy. Brookings Institution scholars prepared a report in 2002 and updated it in 2003 with a focus on homeland security strategy and unmet agenda. The report highlighted the need for resources to address homeland security needs. The Brookings scholars emphasized the need for increased funding and resources for homeland security in 2003. They highlighted vulnerabilities in information technology, public-private cooperation, and existing capabilities that require immediate attention and strengthening. This includes areas such as airport security, Coast Guard, Customs Service, and state and local capacities. The challenge of creating a new federal Department of Homeland Security is highlighted, with a focus on reorganization priorities such as border security and information analysis. Strong organizational and managerial abilities are required for undersecretary candidates. The government needs stronger organizational and managerial abilities in infrastructure protection and counterterrorism efforts. A new domestic counterterrorism agency independent from the FBI is necessary to monitor and prevent terrorist attacks. Additionally, a proactive approach using \"red teams\" to prepare for potential unknown threats is recommended. Scholars recommended Congress create homeland security authorizing committees in each chamber to maximize efficacy of oversight. CSIS scholars issued white papers in 2002 and 2004 with recommendations for restructuring legislative oversight in line with executive branch reorganization. Scholars at CSIS recommended a national strategy for homeland security, emphasizing that creating a Department of Homeland Security is just one part of the solution. They outlined six key considerations for decision makers, including articulating a strategy, conducting threat assessments, strengthening coordination, crafting an implementation strategy, balancing concerns, and seizing the opportunity to reform government. Scholars at CSIS recommended creating select committees on homeland security in Congress to improve oversight and accountability for the Department of Homeland Security. They emphasized the need for comprehensive reforms rather than piecemeal efforts to address national security risks. The scholars at CSIS recommended establishing strong standing committees in both the House and Senate for homeland security, aligned with core mission areas outlined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security. These committees should have a subcommittee structure and a small, expert cadre of members to oversee and legislate on all aspects of homeland security, not just terrorism. The House responded differently to the creation of new departments since World War II by reorganizing its committees. The Armed Services Committee was created by merging Military Affairs and Naval Affairs Committees, preceding the establishment of the Department of Defense. The committee's jurisdiction was updated in 1953 to align with the new department. When Congress approved President Eisenhower's reorganization plan in 1953 to create the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the House did not adjust its committee organization to align with the new department. The House Committees on Banking, Public Works, Education and Labor, and Veterans' Affairs were established or reorganized before the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, and Veterans Affairs were created. The House later redesigned the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee as the Energy and Commerce Committee in 1980 to reflect the creation of the Department of Energy in 1977. The House committees had jurisdiction over various aspects of energy policy, with the Science Committee's jurisdiction expanded by H.Res. 549. The Ways and Means Committee oversaw tax and trade laws related to energy policy, while the Transportation Committee handled pollution of navigable waters. The Resources Committee had jurisdiction over mineral resources on public lands. Energy Department appropriations were included in energy and water appropriations bills. Other committees also had energy-related jurisdiction due to energy programs being retained in other departments after the creation of the Department of Energy. After the creation of the Department of Energy, the House established the Energy and Commerce Committee as the lead energy policy committee, maintaining a jurisdictional structure that involved other committees in energy policymaking. The merger of the Military Affairs Committee and the Naval Affairs Committee into the Armed Services Committee was an exception to the House's usual committee organization. The 9/11 Commission and other entities define homeland security as a range of international and domestic initiatives aimed at reducing the likelihood and impact of terrorist attacks on the United States. The initiatives and activities for homeland security aim to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States by disabling terrorists overseas, building relationships in Islamic and other countries, sharing intelligence, and maintaining a national strategy. This includes organizing the federal government, defining the military's role, involving Congress, and developing the Department of Homeland Security to prevent, respond to, and recover from attacks. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended the creation of a permanent Homeland Security Committee with wide-ranging jurisdiction over domestic components of homeland security, including intelligence analysis, public health, border control, transportation security, first responders, information technology, critical infrastructure protection, and homeland security-related research. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended creating a permanent committee with jurisdiction over various policy areas, including intelligence, FBI, armed forces, foreign relations, and financial services. This proposed committee's jurisdiction may overlap with other committees on issues like information technology and public health. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended creating a permanent committee with jurisdiction over various policy areas, including intelligence, FBI, armed forces, foreign relations, and financial services. This proposed committee's jurisdiction may overlap with other committees on issues like information technology and public health. The Homeland Security Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee, and other committees may have jurisdiction over information technology or public health. Overlaps with the Agriculture Committee on border issues and the Science Committee on research and development were not addressed in the select committee's recommendations. Non-homeland-security missions of DHS agencies would remain under the jurisdiction of standing committees already having jurisdiction. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended creating a permanent committee with jurisdiction over various policy areas, including intelligence, FBI, armed forces, foreign relations, and financial services. The select committee's recommendations would also leave jurisdiction over appropriations in the Appropriations Committee. Funding decisions for other homeland security-related programs and agencies would be under the jurisdiction of other appropriations subcommittees. The 9/11 Commission recommended consolidating jurisdiction in Congress to achieve a \"unity of effort\" in homeland security policymaking. The goal was to have clear lines of authority through one authorizing committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each house to ensure adequate resources for security against terrorist acts in the United States. The 9/11 Commission recommended consolidating congressional jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security to improve oversight and coordination in implementing a national homeland security strategy. This would streamline decision-making and resource allocation to enhance security against terrorist acts within the United States. The Hart-Rudman Commission and select committees emphasized the need for Congress to hold the executive branch accountable for homeland security management. They stressed the importance of Congress actively participating in developing security programs, providing oversight, and ensuring efficient resource allocation. Congress must reorganize its committees to effectively address homeland security issues, as global terrorism poses a significant threat. The Executive branch has adapted to this reality, but Congress has not, leading to uncoordinated oversight and conflicting guidance. Without reform, Congress risks becoming irrelevant in homeland security matters. Witnesses have highlighted the benefits of committee reorganization in enhancing Congress's role in policymaking. Witnesses emphasized the importance of committee reorganization for Congress to gain expertise in homeland security, enabling better policymaking. They argued that a permanent committee would allow members to focus on the task at hand, develop expertise, and improve oversight. The importance of committee reorganization for Congress to gain expertise in homeland security was emphasized by witnesses. A separate committee is needed to set a new course, exercise tough oversight, and pressure the department to prioritize and pursue rigorously. Congressional scholar Wolfensberger highlighted the obstacle of traditional committee alignments hindering the development of new expertise. The House has made different decisions regarding the organization of its committees to oversee policy areas or Cabinet departments. If a permanent homeland security committee is organized, it could allow more committee and Member participation in policy formulation. The House may choose an alternative to recommendations from commissions and think tanks, consistent with past decisions on committee jurisdiction. The House tends not to follow executive branch reorganization with committee reorganization. The creation of the Armed Services Committee from the merger of two committees preceded the reorganization of the Department of Defense. The committee's jurisdiction was distinct from other committees organized under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. The House renamed the Interstate and Foreign Committee to the Energy and Commerce Committee three years after the creation of the Department of Energy. The House reorganized committee jurisdictions three years after the creation of the Department of Energy. Different policy perspectives were maintained by not concentrating all aspects of a policy area in a single committee. For example, education of veterans is under the Veterans' Affairs Committee, mining schools under the Resources Committee, and international education under the International Relations Committee. The House has jurisdiction over various policy areas through different committees, such as education of veterans under the Veterans' Affairs Committee, international education under the International Relations Committee, and agricultural colleges under the Agriculture Committee. The Government Reform Committee oversees the federal civil service, while the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee handles transportation labor. The House tends to disperse components of a policy area among multiple committees, with exceptions like Appropriations and Ways and Means. The House has redistributed committee jurisdiction to overcome bias or concentrated power. In the 1970s, dissatisfaction led to the creation of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the abolishment of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Public health and environmental concerns influenced the redistribution of committee jurisdiction. The House has redistributed committee jurisdiction to address issues of bias or concentrated power. In the 104th Congress, specific parts of the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction were redistributed to three other standing committees. This was done to better distribute the workload among House committees and avoid duplication or narrow jurisdiction. Additionally, over four Congresses, jurisdiction over financial services policy areas was transferred to the Financial Services Committee from the Energy Committee. The House has redistributed committee jurisdiction to address bias or concentrated power. In the 104th Congress, parts of the Energy and Commerce Committee's jurisdiction were redistributed to three other standing committees to distribute workload and avoid duplication. Financial services policy areas were transferred to the Financial Services Committee from the Energy Committee over four Congresses. The House has not implemented recommendations to create a new committee for homeland security jurisdiction. If a permanent homeland security committee is created, considerations beyond homeland security importance could impact its design and implementation. Curtailing existing standing committees' jurisdictions could result in loss of expertise among Members and staff, while shared jurisdiction may allow for a broader range of expertise among committees. The House may consider shared jurisdiction among committees to enhance integration of homeland security initiatives into broader policy areas like immigration, transportation, R&D, and international commerce. While a lead committee on homeland security could be designated, having multiple committees oversee the new department could bring diverse perspectives to policymaking. This approach, similar to how energy policy is handled with multiple committees involved, could make legislating in a specific policy area more challenging. The arrangement of shared jurisdiction among committees in homeland security policy-making can incentivize more Members to become knowledgeable in the area, providing a broader role in policymaking. This dispersed jurisdiction could also offer additional access for whistleblowers and alternative forums for critical reviews, contributing to more robust policymaking. Despite the House's preference for multiple perspectives, the policy area of homeland security remains a challenge. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 anticipated policy problems and the role of the federal government in setting policy and funding. The House made adjustments to committee jurisdiction over the years to accommodate changes. The creation of the Department of Energy in the 1970s led to jurisdictional changes in House committees, similar to the perception of homeland security as a new policy problem. The House made adjustments to committee jurisdiction over the years to accommodate changes, including the creation of the Department of Energy in the 1970s. A select committee recommended the creation of an energy committee, but the House affirmed the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee's lead role in energy policy. Former Speaker Gingrich distinguished the House's decision to reduce standing committees in 1994 from the need for a new permanent homeland security committee. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of having a centralized authority monitoring the Department of Homeland Security to prevent tragic losses like September 11. Former Secretary Schlesinger highlights the unique challenge of terrorism as a crisis different from past threats. The curr_chunk discusses the ongoing threat of terrorism and the need to reduce terrorists' capacity to inflict damage to prevent societal changes. It emphasizes the importance of the Department of Homeland Security in addressing this threat. Former Secretary Schlesinger highlighted the challenges in creating the Department of Homeland Security, emphasizing the need to support newly formed agencies like the Transportation Security Administration. Former Secretary Schlesinger emphasized the importance of supporting newly formed agencies like the Transportation Security Administration and expressed concerns about the impact of fragmentation among congressional committees on the Department of Homeland Security's future. The importance of unity on Capitol Hill and within the executive branch for the success of the Department of Homeland Security is emphasized. Fragmentation among congressional committees is seen as debilitating to DHS, with a need to reconcile national security goals with existing programs and policies. The Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas expressed concerns about the need for smooth functioning in areas such as agriculture, nuclear plants, transportation, ports, and public health to maintain efficient international trade. The Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas expressed concerns about the need for smooth functioning in various areas to maintain efficient international trade. There is a discussion about restructuring the Treasury with consultation and adjustments for security concerns. However, creating a permanent committee on homeland security could pose challenges for existing functions like Customs fees and duty collection. Other committee leaders also raised similar issues, such as nuclear plant safety provisions. Commerce Committee Chairman Barton highlighted nuclear plant safety provisions in the energy bill during his testimony, questioning the balance between protecting against terrorism and sabotage. Various committee leaders discussed their accomplishments in homeland security, including aviation security and legislative oversight efforts. Sensenbrenner, Davis, and Waxman detailed their committees' work on homeland security. Dingell emphasized the cooperation between standing committees and the select committee. Goodlatte and Stenholm questioned how one committee could oversee DHS effectively. Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Oberstar expressed concerns about the oversight of the Department of Homeland Security due to its size and complexity. They questioned the effectiveness of a single standing committee in overseeing such a diverse department and emphasized the need for expertise from various committees to ensure proper review and analysis of federal programs. Secretary Mineta emphasizes the importance of achieving world-class security with world-class service. The committee has dedicated significant time to deliberating on these issues and strives to reach consensus on legislation implementation. It is crucial to consider the expertise of various committees in shaping legislation that supports security while also addressing the interrelationship with other agency functions. Chairman Cox emphasized shaping future missions of agencies like Coast Guard, aviation, FEMA, and maritime system to support security while respecting historic functions. He distinguished the homeland security mission of DHS from other committees' jurisdiction, focusing on prevention, protection, and response without regulating every aspect of American life. The Department of Homeland Security should focus on protecting Americans and national security without becoming a regulator of every aspect of American commerce. Congressional oversight is crucial to prevent the department from expanding into unnecessary areas and losing focus on competitiveness and job creation in various industries. The Department of Homeland Security should prioritize protecting Americans and national security without overregulating industries. Congressional oversight is essential to prevent mission drift and maintain focus on competitiveness and job creation. Former Speaker Gingrich emphasized the importance of mission-driven jurisdiction for effective governance. The committee should have sole or lead jurisdiction over activities related to homeland security, protection, response, recovery, and rehabilitation. The Gilmore Commission emphasized a strategic vision for homeland security that aligns with an all-hazards approach. It is crucial to be able to handle a wide variety of threats, as demonstrated by past events such as SARS, West Nile Virus, and the recent fires in California. Walter Kravitz described the legislative process in Congress as a procedural obstacle. The legislative process in Congress, described by Walter Kravitz as a \"procedural obstacle course,\" requires agreement between both houses and the President on legislation. Leaders must gather support and majorities at each stage\u2014subcommittee, committee, floor\u2014to advance or prevent derailment. Referral of a measure to one or multiple committees affects control and support. Majority assembly is still necessary regardless of the number of committees involved. The legislative process in Congress requires agreement between both houses and the President on legislation. Majority assembly is necessary regardless of the number of committees involved in reporting a measure. The rules and practices of the House and Senate, along with constitutional requirements, make passing and enacting a measure into law challenging. The involvement of existing standing committees with expertise and experience in policy issues related to security raises questions about the potential impact of creating a new homeland security committee. The involvement of existing standing committees with expertise in security raises questions about the impact of creating a new homeland security committee. Witnesses suggested various options for the House to consider in the legislative process, including tools at the Speaker's disposal to facilitate committee processing of homeland security legislation. Congressional scholars Ornstein and Mann also provided recommendations. Congressional scholars and former Speaker Gingrich discussed the gradual expansion of a new committee's jurisdiction, using committee assignments to build support. Witnesses highlighted the concept of concurrent jurisdiction for future security issues. Oversight jurisdiction was also mentioned, allowing committees broader authority under House rules. The select committee's recommendations on jurisdiction cover various domestic components of homeland security within DHS, emphasizing the need for coordination among congressional committees. Witnesses and reports highlighted the importance of counterterrorism and homeland security, suggesting changes to limit the number of committees with jurisdiction over DHS functions. The need for coordinating or reducing DHS hearings appearances and requests from congressional committees was highlighted in the 9/11 Commission report and select committee's recommendations. Suggestions were made for the House to establish guidelines for executive branch reporting and monitor DHS interactions to prevent leadership diversion. Calls were made for coordination of requests to DHS by the leadership or a successor to the select committee. The oversight agendas of congressional committees should be supervised by bipartisan leadership for security coordination. Suggestions include reviewing the budget for counterterrorism and homeland security, reorganizing Appropriations Committees' subcommittees, creating a homeland security subcommittee of the Budget Committee, and establishing a permanent homeland security committee for policy coordination in Congress. The select committee recommended reorganizing Congress to create authorizing committees for homeland security, but this may not ensure policy coordination. Fragmentation would still exist due to bicameralism and the authorization and appropriations process. Coordination with intelligence agencies, the FBI, and the Pentagon would still be necessary. Creating dedicated homeland security committees to complement the homeland security appropriations subcommittees could enhance congressional oversight. Congressional scholar Thurber emphasized the need for jurisdiction to include agencies outside the DHS, such as the Northern Command, National Guard, FBI, CIA, NSA, NIMA, and CDC. The need for coordination and oversight in homeland security extends beyond the Department of Homeland Security to agencies like NRC, DEA, and Department of Energy. The new committee should collaborate with other committees like Armed Services and Judiciary to develop a comprehensive policy approach. Coordination is crucial for addressing critical homeland security issues, as highlighted by the Hart-Rudman Commission. The Hart-Rudman Commission emphasized the importance of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in U.S. national security policy. Suggestions were made for increasing coordination in homeland security within the United States and combating terrorism overseas, including the possibility of a permanent homeland security committee with members from other relevant committees. The Select Committee on Homeland Security in the 107th Congress and the Budget Committee have coordinating roles that could be examined. Suggestions include ad hoc committees of chairs and ranking members to oversee homeland security policy components. A new use of committee oversight plans and enhancing the Government Reform Committee's role in overseeing homeland security plans are also proposed. The House could create a permanent homeland security committee. A permanent homeland security committee in the 109th Congress could guide the development of the Department of Homeland Security, hold officials accountable, and keep focus on its mission. It would help Congress play a stronger role in setting homeland security policy by concentrating jurisdiction over the issue. Experience will inform whether this concentrated approach is preferable to a more dispersed structure. The challenge for a new homeland security committee, existing standing committees, and House leadership lies in integrating homeland security policy with non-homeland security policy. Questions arise about how to address homeland security concerns alongside existing policies and programs in various sectors like air transportation and agencies like the Coast Guard or FEMA. The role of a homeland security committee in policymaking and ensuring the achievement of both homeland security and non-homeland-security missions needs to be clarified. The House created a standing Committee on Homeland Security on January 4, 2005, with jurisdiction over overall homeland security policy, organization and administration of the Department of Homeland Security, and functions related to border and port security. This new committee aims to reduce fragmentation and improve coordination in homeland security efforts. The House established the Committee on Homeland Security in 2005 to oversee various aspects of homeland security, including border and port security, customs, information integration, domestic preparedness for terrorism, research and development, and transportation security. The committee also has special oversight functions to review all government activities related to homeland security and the interaction of departments and agencies with the Department of Homeland Security. Additionally, the jurisdiction of three standing committees was amended to differentiate their roles from the new committee. The Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction was amended to include \"criminal law enforcement\" and \"immigration policy and non-border enforcement.\" The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's jurisdiction was amended to exclude the Transportation Security Administration. The Ways and Means Committee's jurisdiction was also affected. The Ways and Means Committee's jurisdiction was amended to include \"customs revenue, collection districts, and ports of entry and delivery.\" Rules Committee Chair David Dreier inserted a \"legislative history\" in the Congressional Record explaining the changes to Rule X, stating that the Committee on Homeland Security's jurisdiction over \"overall homeland security policy\" should be interpreted on a government-wide basis. The legislative history clarified that the Committee on Homeland Security's jurisdiction does not extend to programmatic efforts within the Department of Homeland Security under the jurisdiction of other committees. It also outlined the new committee's oversight jurisdiction over the homeland security community of the United States, without limiting the oversight authority of other committees. The legislative history clarified the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security, emphasizing its oversight authority over homeland security activities that directly affect its jurisdiction. It also detailed the relationships between the new committee and other standing committees, including the Ways and Means Committee. The 109th Congress established the Committee on Homeland Security, with Chairman Dreier providing a summary of the jurisdiction granted to the committee. This change in House rule X creates a primary committee while recognizing other legitimate committees. The 109th Congress established the Committee on Homeland Security with a crafted architecture, creating a primary committee while recognizing other oversight roles. The system aims for purposeful redundancy and encourages competition of ideas. Funding for the committee was agreed upon in January 2005. The Committee on Homeland Security was established in the 109th Congress with funding agreed upon in January 2005. Representative Christopher Cox was elected as committee chair and Representative Bennie G. Thompson as ranking minority member. Several new members were elected to the committee in January 2005. The Committee on Homeland Security was established in the 109th Congress with funding agreed upon in January 2005. Republican and Democratic Members were elected to the committee in February 2005. Chairman Cox appointed Representative Curt Weldon as vice chair. The committee had 19 Republican and 15 Democratic members. Subcommittee were created for Economic Security and Infrastructure Protection. The Committee on Homeland Security in the 109th Congress established subcommittees for Economic Security, Infrastructure Protection, Cybersecurity, Emergency Preparedness, Science, Technology, Intelligence, Information Sharing, Terrorism Risk Assessment, Management, Integration, Oversight, Prevention of Nuclear and Biological Attack. Subcommittee rosters were released on March 3, 2005, with rules allowing the committee chair and ranking minority member to be ex officio members of all subcommittees. The committee also adopted its oversight plan for the 109th Congress. In the 109th Congress, the Committee on Homeland Security established new subcommittees and adopted its oversight plan. Chairman Cox resigned to join the Securities and Exchange Commission, with Representative Peter L. King elected as the new chair. Representative David G. Reichert was named chair of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Science and Technology. A new Subcommittee on Investigations was created by Chairman King in response to Hurricane Katrina, with Representative Michael T. McCaul as chair. In the 110th Congress, Representative Michael T. McCaul was named chair and Representative Bob Etheridge was named ranking minority member of the Committee on Homeland Security. Democrats won a majority in the 2006 general election and organized the committee with a ratio of 20 Democrats to 15 Republicans. The committee adopted its oversight plan on January 23, 2007, and established six subcommittees with respective chairs and ranking members. In the 110th Congress, the Homeland Security Committee and Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairs reached a memorandum of understanding, clarifying the legislative history and its authoritative source. In the 110th Congress, a memorandum of understanding clarified the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee over emergency preparedness and collective response related to terrorism. The memorandum also outlined that a bill amending FEMA's all-hazards emergency preparedness programs would be referred to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, with the Homeland Security Committee having a jurisdictional interest. The memorandum of understanding clarified jurisdiction over port security, stating that the Homeland Security Committee had jurisdiction and that the Coast Guard responsibilities overlapped. A bill related to Coast Guard activities would be referred to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, with the Homeland Security Committee also having an interest. The memorandum clarified jurisdiction over port security, stating that the Homeland Security Committee had jurisdiction. Recommendations of the Select Committee on Homeland Security on Changes to the Rules of the House of Representatives with Respect to Homeland Security Issues were outlined in the report. The House Select Committee on Homeland Security recommended changes to the Rules of the House of Representatives regarding homeland security issues. The 9/11 attacks exposed gaps in America's security systems, leading to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other initiatives aimed at closing security gaps post-9/11 have led to significant Executive Branch reorganization. However, Congressional structures have remained largely unchanged, with multiple committees claiming jurisdiction over DHS functions, causing chaos for the Department. Senior officials have had to testify at numerous Congressional hearings since 2004. Creating a permanent standing Committee on Homeland Security in the 109th Congress is necessary for effective legislative oversight of DHS programs. Current diffused congressional jurisdiction imposes burdens on DHS and hinders consistent guidance, integration, and elimination of redundancies within the Department. Fragmentation within DHS will persist without changes to current legislative structures. The 9/11 Commission and other experts recommend congressional reorganization to create a single standing committee in each chamber focused on homeland security. This is crucial for effective legislation and oversight to prevent, prepare for, and respond to terrorism in the United States. A select committee would not provide the necessary accountability and responsibility required for the complex nature of homeland security programs within a single Department. The success of creating a new standing committee for homeland security hinges on its broad legislative and oversight jurisdiction to take a holistic approach. The burden on the Department of Homeland Security from interacting with numerous committees must be reduced. The consolidation should find the right balance with existing committees, following the guidelines of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 for jurisdictional reform. The House needs to reorganize its committee structure to give sustained attention to the new homeland security mission. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommends changes to Rule X for reorganizing jurisdiction within the House regarding homeland security matters. This includes establishing standing committees with specific legislative jurisdictions. The Select Committee on Homeland Security recommends changes to Rule X for reorganizing jurisdiction within the House regarding homeland security matters, including establishing standing committees with specific legislative jurisdictions. The jurisdiction of various committees will not include responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security. The curr_chunk discusses the specific legislative jurisdictions of various House committees, excluding responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security. This includes topics such as immigration, naturalization, subversive activities, and non-homeland security missions of the Coast Guard. The curr_chunk discusses federal management of natural disasters, transportation regulations, civil aviation, and oversight responsibilities of specific House committees. The curr_chunk establishes the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Homeland Security, outlining their composition and responsibilities. The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Homeland Security shall be composed of not more than 29 Members, Delegates, or the Resident Commissioner, with limitations on party representation. The Speaker and Minority Leader are ex officio members without voting rights. They may designate staff to assist them, with access to committee activities and materials. The committee is responsible for matters related to homeland security and the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for security, integration, analysis, and sharing of homeland security information related to terrorism within the United States, dissemination of terrorism threat warnings, advisories, and communications, research and development in support of homeland security, and security of U.S. borders and ports of entry. The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for various tasks related to homeland security, including enforcing immigration laws, securing transportation systems, customs functions, and preparing for acts of terrorism at federal, state, and local levels. The committee overseeing these responsibilities also reviews laws and programs related to homeland security on an ongoing basis. The committee has jurisdiction over activities related to preventing, preparing for, and responding to terrorism within the United States. Funds for the Department of Homeland Security must be authorized by the House before being appropriated for such activities. The 108th Congress actions regarding the Select Committee on Homeland Security are not considered precedents for referrals of homeland security-related measures in the current Congress. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations on congressional organization are included in this appendix. Recommendation: To enhance unity of effort in the intelligence community, the overall amounts of money appropriated for national intelligence should no longer be kept secret. A separate appropriations act for intelligence should be passed by Congress to provide transparency on how funds are allocated. While the specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, disclosing the top-line figure would not compromise intelligence sources and methods. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of transparency in disclosing information about military spending and intelligence to ensure accountability. It emphasizes the need for strong congressional oversight to provide support and leadership to national intelligence agencies. The curr_chunk highlights the challenges facing America's intelligence agencies in developing advanced technologies for national security. Congressional oversight dissatisfaction is widespread, and changes in committee jurisdiction may be necessary. The House and Senate intelligence committees lack the power, influence, and sustained capability to effectively oversee intelligence activities. Congress needs to consider creating a joint committee for intelligence or separate committees with combined authorizing and appropriations powers to address this challenge. Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism is dysfunctional and needs to be addressed. Various alternatives, such as a joint committee or a single committee in each house of Congress, should be considered to improve oversight and accountability. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and a single committee in each house of Congress are suggested alternatives to improve oversight of intelligence agencies. Recommendations include making intelligence funding levels public, appropriating to the National Intelligence Director, creating a dedicated oversight subcommittee, and granting subpoena authority to the committee. The new committee for oversight of intelligence agencies should have a balanced representation of majority and minority parties, with members also serving on key additional committees. Members should serve indefinitely to accumulate expertise, and the committee should be smaller for greater accountability. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security leaders appear before too many congressional committees, hindering efficiency. Congress needs to establish clear authority and responsibility for the Department of Homeland Security to ensure effective development. This can be achieved by creating a single authorizing committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each house to hold the secretary accountable for the department's performance. Recommendation: Congress should establish a single, principal point of oversight and review for homeland security to improve transitions between administrations. This committee should be a permanent standing committee with a nonpartisan staff. Recommendation: Accelerate the process for national security appointments to minimize disruption during administration transitions. Candidates should submit transition team members' names to the FBI before the election for immediate security clearances. President-elects should provide lists of potential national security candidates for pre-election security clearances to ensure smooth transitions. To streamline national security appointments during administration transitions, a single federal agency should handle security clearances with uniform standards. The president-elect should nominate the entire new national security team by January 20, and the Senate should confirm or reject nominees within 30 days. Confirmation should not be required for appointees below Executive Level 3. The outgoing administration should provide classified information to the president-elect promptly after the election. The Bremer Commission recommends providing the president-elect with a classified list of specific threats to national security, military operations, and decisions on the use of force soon after election day. This document would serve as a notice and checklist for the incoming president to inquire and learn more. The Bremer Commission recommends improving executive and legislative branch review of counterterrorism activities by suggesting joint hearings of multiple committees on counterterrorism matters to facilitate coordinated review of the President's counterterrorism policy and budget. Congress should develop mechanisms for this purpose to ensure a comprehensive approach rather than fragmented efforts. The Gilmore Commission recommends that Congress develop a mechanism for reviewing the President's counterterrorism policy and budget as a whole. They also suggest that the executive branch commit to full consultation with Congress on counterterrorism issues. Additionally, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees should assign senior staff to review counterterrorism budgets. The Gilmore Commission recommends that Congress establish a mechanism to review the President's counterterrorism policy and budget. They also suggest full consultation between the executive branch and Congress on counterterrorism issues, with senior staff from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees assigned to review counterterrorism budgets. The Advisory Panel recommends that Congress consider forming a Joint Special Committee to address domestic preparedness and response issues more coherently at the Federal level. The Congress has been criticized for lack of coordination in addressing domestic preparedness and response issues. Recent legislative proposals aim to improve interagency coordination, including creating the 'Office of Terrorism Preparedness' and a 'Deputy Attorney General for Combating Domestic Terrorism.' The Congress has taken steps to address domestic terrorism by creating a new 'Deputy Attorney General for Combating Domestic Terrorism' and commissioning reports on the subject. The General Accounting Office has been directed to provide an updated report on federal strategy, policy, and programs to combat domestic terrorism within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Congress directs the Comptroller General to report on combating domestic terrorism, focusing on lead agency responsibility, adequacy of plans, threat assessments, command structures, exercises like Top Official Exercise 2000, cyberterrorism, and research efforts. Lack of coordination and detail in funding programs is noted, with appropriations committees sometimes creating programs without normal authorization processes. The lack of detail and clarity in funding programs is highlighted, with appropriations committees creating programs without proper authorization processes. Major programs for combating terrorism lack continuity and sustainability due to yearly funding, such as equipment grant programs and training programs totaling millions of dollars. The absence of a comprehensive national strategy for combating terrorism may be hindering Congress's efforts in this area. The Special Committee for Combating Terrorism is recommended to be established by Congress, either as a joint committee or separate committees in each House. This committee would address authority, funding, and oversight for Federal programs combating terrorism. The proposal acknowledges the difficulty of implementing such a change but emphasizes its importance. A joint or separate panel with representation from relevant committees is proposed to review and develop legislative plans in response to the national strategy for combating terrorism. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a committee to oversee budget and appropriations related to combating terrorism, as well as an advisory panel to assess domestic response capabilities for terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. This is in line with the national strategy for combating terrorism. The curr_chunk suggests creating a National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) to improve oversight of domestic intelligence activities, shifting responsibility to specific Congressional committees for better efficiency. The panel recommends concentrating oversight of the NCTC in the intelligence committees of Congress to enhance civil liberties protection. The current lack of organization in addressing homeland security issues in Congress necessitates a more cohesive and permanent structure. The panel recommends establishing separate authorizing and appropriation committees in Congress for Combating Terrorism/Homeland Security to improve oversight and organization. The commission recommended creating the Terrorist Threat Integration Center to address domestic intelligence collection abuses. The Hart-Rudman Commission also made recommendations on congressional organization, including establishing separate committees for Combating Terrorism/Homeland Security in Congress. The Phase III Report of the United States Commission on National Security/21st Century emphasizes the importance of Executive-Legislative Cooperation in solving homeland security challenges. Congress should actively participate in developing homeland security programs, develop expertise in policy implementation, provide oversight, and ensure sufficient resources for government agencies. Congress has already taken steps towards this, including a bipartisan initiative to address domestic intelligence collection abuses. A bipartisan Congressional initiative addressed the threat of weapons of mass destruction leaking from the Soviet Union. The Domestic Preparedness Program was established to enhance the capabilities of first responders in WMD emergencies. Congress has pushed for more effective management of homeland security issues and funding for studies. A sound homeland security strategy requires an overhaul of legislative frameworks designed for the Cold War era. The curr_chunk discusses the need for Congress to update the legal foundation for homeland security in response to new threats such as biological, terrorist, and cyber attacks. Recommendations include amending key legislative authorities and promoting data sharing between public and private sectors. Congress should also support efforts to update the international legal framework for communications security. The curr_chunk highlights the challenges Congress faces in addressing homeland security issues due to the involvement of multiple federal agencies and fragmented budget allocations. It emphasizes the need for a stronger working relationship between the Executive and Legislative Branches to effectively address the growing urgency and complexity of homeland security. Congress should find ways to bridge jurisdictional boundaries and enhance oversight to address these issues. The curr_chunk suggests creating a body to enhance cooperation between the Executive and Legislative Branches on homeland security issues. This body would exchange information, develop legislative responses, and hold closed meetings to access classified assessments. It would not have legislative or oversight authority but would aim to improve oversight mechanisms and address jurisdictional boundaries. The curr_chunk proposes restructuring Congress's committee system by creating single select committees in each house for homeland security activities. These committees would replace the oversight body described in a previous recommendation. The curr_chunk recommends consolidating the State Department's budget under the Foreign Operations subcommittee to better align resources with the President's strategic goals and integrate assistance programs. The curr_chunk discusses the primary causes of inefficiencies and cost overruns in DoD programs, including budgetary instability and problems within the acquisition system. This instability is attributed to the resource allocation process and underfunding of approved programs, as well as Congress reallocating funds from large programs to other priorities. The curr_chunk highlights the challenges of reallocating funds in DoD programs and the recommendation for two-year budgeting to limit program turbulence. Congress's lack of confidence in DoD's ability to execute such a budget and their influence on policies through yearly appropriations are also discussed. The Commission recommends implementing two-year budgeting in the Department of Defense to increase stability in weapons development programs and save billions of dollars. The Secretary of Defense must enforce discipline in decision-making to ensure military requirements are well understood and technology, concepts, and funding are in place. It is suggested to eliminate programs early rather than extending them at high costs. Congress's cooperation is essential for these changes to be effective. The United States Commission on National Security/21st Century recommends implementing two-year budgeting in the Department of Defense to increase stability in weapons development programs and save costs. Congress's support for DoD budgeting and procurement reforms is crucial for program stability and long-term industry investments. The Legislative Branch must undergo reform to address American national security needs in the 21st century. Despite past efforts to modernize, Congress has lagged behind the Executive Branch. Reforms are necessary to adapt to the evolving global landscape and ensure effective governance. The Legislative Branch needs reform to align with American national security needs in the 21st century. The Executive and Legislature must collaborate for coherent foreign policy, but there have been challenges in communication and consultation. Congress must improve its understanding of foreign policy issues and be more receptive to working with the Executive Branch to fulfill its Constitutional obligations. Measures to address these shortcomings are necessary. Several measures are needed to address the shortcomings in Executive-legislative relations in the national security realm. A bipartisan, bicameral working group comprising key Congressional leaders and select staff should be formed to review and propose reforms within a year for implementation in the next Congress. The President, Vice President, National Security Advisor, and senior cabinet officers should collaborate with this panel to rethink the structure of Executive-Legislative relations. Reforms are needed in three crucial areas to improve Executive-Legislative relations in national security and foreign policy: enhancing Congress members' expertise, making organizational changes, and fostering effective dialogue. Many current members lack foreign policy knowledge, focusing more on domestic issues. Building a well-informed Congress on foreign policy is essential. To improve Executive-Legislative relations in national security and foreign policy, reforms are needed in three crucial areas: enhancing Congress members' expertise, making organizational changes, and fostering effective dialogue. Building a well-informed Congress on foreign policy is essential, including educating members beyond the freshman orientation and encouraging overseas travel for serious purposes. This will lead to a more knowledgeable debate, better partnership with the Executive Branch, and effective education of constituencies on national security concerns. A concerted effort should be made to distinguish between junkets and serious work for members of Congress to undertake trips in the national interest. New members should take at least one serious trip in their first term and participate in trips each year from the second term onwards. Legislature-to-legislature exchanges and visits should be encouraged and expanded to strengthen democracy and improve understanding among elected officials. More funding and staffing should be provided for foreign legislators visiting the United States and for American legislators to visit foreign legislatures. The wargaming center at the National Defense University should be expanded so that every member of Congress can participate in war games to improve their understanding of American power limits and foreign interactions. This will lead to a more sophisticated Legislative Branch. Useful games should result in meetings between Congress members and key Executive Branch officials. The report recommends structural reforms for Congress to improve its handling of national security issues, including creating a special body for homeland security, consolidating State Department appropriations, and transitioning to a two-year budget cycle for defense programs. Additional steps are suggested to address the complexity and overlaps in the current committee structure. The Congressional leadership should review its structure to address security challenges and national priorities, minimize duplication of effort, and reduce the burden on the Executive Branch. Keeping a public record of briefings and promoting joint panels could streamline testimony processes. Strong consultation with the Legislative Branch is emphasized for better coordination. The need for strong consultation with the Legislative Branch is emphasized for better coordination. Action must be taken to streamline the budgeting and appropriations processes by merging appropriations subcommittees with their respective authorizing committees. The budget process has become a bureaucratic undertaking, and there is no longer a compelling rationale for separate authorization and appropriations bills. The proposal suggests merging appropriations subcommittees with their respective authorizing committees to streamline the budgeting process. This would consolidate all appropriations within one committee, enhancing oversight and rationalizing committee jurisdiction. The proposal suggests merging appropriations subcommittees with authorizing committees to streamline the budgeting process and enhance oversight. This new structure could also facilitate adoption of two-year budgeting. The budget committees in Congress would consist of the Chairman and ranking member of each new combined committee, distributing macro-allocations in the budget resolution. Ongoing Executive-Legislative consultation and coordination are essential. Efforts to ensure ongoing Executive-Legislative consultation and coordination are beneficial for fulfilling Constitutional obligations and improving U.S. policy quality. Considering a range of Congressional views can increase public support for Executive Branch policy. Differing Congressional opinions can refine policy by addressing previously unconsidered concerns. Congress can also compel the President to clarify administration policy for better public and global understanding. Efforts to improve Executive-Legislative consultation are crucial for effective foreign policy. A bipartisan panel recommended ongoing consultation based on trust and mutual understanding. Congress should respect the Executive Branch's role in policy formulation while allowing flexibility in implementation. In return, the Executive Branch should consider Congress' criticisms seriously. This approach will lead to better policy outcomes and public support. The bipartisan panel recommends ongoing, bipartisan consultation between the Executive Branch and Congress for effective foreign policy. Specific mechanisms, such as creating a permanent consultative group composed of Congressional leadership and committee members, can facilitate better consultation. Regular meetings with Executive Branch representatives at the Under Secretary level are essential for improved communication and understanding. The bipartisan panel recommends creating a permanent consultative group composed of Congressional leadership and committee members for ongoing, bipartisan consultation with the Executive Branch on foreign policy. Regular meetings with Executive Branch representatives at the Under Secretary level will allow for a regular dialogue and the development of preventive strategies. Emergency meetings will be held whenever the President considers military action abroad or deals with a foreign policy crisis. The administration should also increase the number of representatives consulting with Congress and send mid-level officials to Capitol Hill to track foreign policy views closely. To enhance Congress's effectiveness in partnering with the Executive Branch on foreign policy, it is recommended to establish a consultative group with leaders in various fields like science, international economics, defense, and intelligence. This group should provide regular and direct dialogue with experts to bring valuable insights into consultations. Members of Congress need to engage with experts without the filter of their staff to benefit from their superior knowledge. To improve Congressional fluency in key policy areas, it is essential to connect members with experts from the National Academies of Science and other policy institutions. This will help build expertise in defense, foreign policy, and other critical areas. Collaboration between the Executive and Legislative Branches is crucial for effective national security policy in the 21st century. The curr_chunk focuses on the need for reform within Congress, suggesting efforts in foreign policy education, restructuring Congressional committees, and enhancing Executive-Legislative consultative efforts to address future challenges. The recommendations from The Brookings Institution emphasize the importance of Congressional organization for effective governance. The curr_chunk discusses the need for Congressional reform to consolidate oversight of homeland security activities within the executive branch. Congressional oversight is currently scattered across Capitol Hill, with numerous committees sharing responsibility. This reform is crucial for effective governance and national security. The Department of Homeland Security Act prompted Congress to review its committee structure to improve coordination and oversight of homeland security activities. Congress has taken steps to realign subcommittee jurisdictions, creating new homeland security subcommittees to reduce fragmentation and increase budgetary supervision within the executive branch. Congress has made efforts to consolidate the authorization process for homeland security spending, with the House creating a Select Homeland Security Committee. The Senate has not made changes to its committee structure, but the goal is to establish a permanent Homeland Security Committee in the future. The question of jurisdiction for the new committee remains unanswered. The House's Select Homeland Security Committee aims to coordinate actions and resolve disagreements among other committees, rather than claiming primary oversight of homeland security. Both the House and Senate approaches are deemed insufficient for effective congressional oversight, leading to potential delays, internal conflicts, and conflicting directives to DHS. Streamlining the appropriations process may not fully address these issues, as appropriators focus on budgetary and management oversight. The House's Select Homeland Security Committee aims to coordinate actions and resolve disagreements among other committees, rather than claiming primary oversight of homeland security. Appropriators focus on budgetary and management oversight, potentially leading to broader policy issues being overlooked. Bringing committee heads together can help in the short term, but long-term oversight may be inadequate due to competing demands on committee chairs' time. \"Congress should reorganize its jurisdictions to create authorizing committees for homeland security, alongside appropriations subcommittees, to maximize efficacy in oversight. Fragmentation would still exist due to bicameralism and the authorization process, but dedicated committees could enhance coordination among relevant agencies.\" The executive branch's work will engage the legislative branch on homeland security issues. Congress should establish appropriations subcommittees and a joint committee for oversight. Strengthening the congressional role includes making the Homeland Security Council a statutory entity with Senate confirmation for its director. Tom Ridge's unified homeland security budget needs to be distributed among multiple components on Capital Hill. The executive branch's unified homeland security budget must be distributed among multiple appropriations subcommittees on Capital Hill. Congress should establish new appropriations subcommittees on homeland security to address the issue effectively. Alternatively, the appropriations committees could take up and pass the homeland security budget as a second-best option. A recommendation from the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggests creating a new body similar to the Joint Economic Committee to enhance congressional capacity for analysis and oversight, specifically for homeland security. This new committee would not have legislative authority but could serve as a focal point for holding hearings, issuing reports, and holding executive officials accountable. Revamp Congressional Oversight of Homeland Security by creating new select committees in the House and Senate to streamline the report process and ensure efficient oversight of the new Homeland Security Department. Relinquish responsibility in committees with duplicative oversight of agencies being folded into the Department of Homeland Defense. To ensure effective oversight of homeland security, Congress must reduce the number of committees and subcommittees overseeing the new department. The House Government Reform Committee's jurisdiction should be narrowed to avoid duplicate oversight, and the Senate Government Affairs Committee should divest itself of certain functions to streamline oversight. Membership of Select Committees should consist of relevant chairpersons and ranking members. Membership of Select Committees overseeing the new Department of Homeland Security should include chairpersons and ranking members from relevant House and Senate committees and subcommittees to ensure comprehensive oversight. Relevant Senate committees include Agriculture, Appropriations, Armed Services, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Energy and Natural Resources, Judiciary, and Intelligence. Relevant House committees and subcommittees include Agriculture, Appropriations, Armed Services, and Energy. The Select Committees overseeing various government departments cover a wide range of topics such as military readiness, environment, health, telecommunications, financial institutions, courts, crime, energy, transportation, and intelligence. Membership terms should be governed by the same criteria as chairmanship or ranking member status on other committees, with term limits to ensure fresh perspectives. Each Select Committee should have its own separate staff. The new Select Committees should have separate staff to ensure independence and focused expertise. Within the Appropriations Committee, create new oversight subcommittees and dissolve current oversight responsibilities to prevent conflicting demands and authority."
