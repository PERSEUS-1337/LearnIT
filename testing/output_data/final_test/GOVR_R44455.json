    "content": "The 2014 National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) released by Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper highlights the pervasive and emerging threats facing the United States, including challenges from key nation states like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Global power is becoming more diffuse with new alignments and informal networks impacting global affairs. Competition for scarce resources such as food, water, and energy is increasing. Competition for scarce resources like food, water, and energy is a growing intelligence issue, exacerbating instability. DNI James Clapper highlighted challenges in global affairs, describing unpredictable instability as the 'new normal'. The Intelligence Community faces issues in countering threats, resource allocation, and strategic use. Topics include CIA's Mission Centers, Directorate for Digital Innovation, management reforms for covert operations, and NSA's role. The curr_chunk discusses various issues within the Intelligence Community, including NSA's reorganization, encryption concerns, business worries over IC contracts, social media use for identifying terrorist activity, and the establishment of the National Background Investigations Bureau. These issues impact the IC's ability to integrate horizontally and operate effectively as one team. The curr_chunk discusses key issues affecting the Intelligence Community's leadership and management, such as the budget process, analysis, big data, diversity, global coverage, continuous evaluation, polygraphs, and transparency. It also highlights important aspects of the IC, including its elements, key leadership positions, agency overseers, budget programs, and the National Intelligence Strategy. The IC is led by the Director of National Intelligence on a daily basis. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) leads the Intelligence Community (IC) on a daily basis and is the principal intelligence advisor to the President. The DNI has authority over the national intelligence program budget and was created by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The core mission of the DNI and the Office of the DNI (ODNI) is to integrate intelligence efforts, coordinating collection, analysis, and counterintelligence. The DNI position focuses on intelligence integration across the 17 Intelligence Community elements to address tough community problems. This includes horizontal integration across agencies and vertical integration from federal to local levels. The ODNI works towards vertical integration from federal to local levels, collaborating with various government agencies and industry partners. It consists of offices focusing on acquisition, budget, human capital, policy, and oversight. The USD(I) in the Department of Defense is another key figure in IC leadership with authority over intelligence agencies within the DOD. The USD(I) is the principal intelligence advisor to the Secretary of Defense and represents the DOD on intelligence operations at the National Security Council. In 2007, the position was \"dual-hatted\" to improve integration of national and military intelligence. Managing the IC's confederation of separately managed parts can hamper efforts to address cross-cutting issues. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) oversees the intelligence community's various agencies, each with its own mission. While the ODNI reports directly to the DNI, agency heads are selected by their parent department. The DNI has limited control over programmatic activities in these agencies, with Inspectors General playing a crucial role in reporting issues to Congress and the establishment. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established independent oversight IGs in various government departments and agencies. IGs conduct audits and investigations to promote efficiency and prevent fraud. Concerns have been raised about the potential threat of overzealous IGs to agency operations. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established independent oversight IGs in government departments. The CIA had an IG since 1952, but in 1989, Congress mandated an \"independent\" IG appointed by the President. The IAA for FY2010 established an independent IG of the IC, reporting directly to the DNI. The IG can only be removed by the President, who must inform congressional intelligence committees. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established independent oversight IGs in government departments, including the IC. The heads of DIA and NGA appoint their affiliated IGs, while the DOD created the IG for Intelligence position in 1976 for oversight of defense foreign intelligence activities. The ATSD(IO) is responsible for independent oversight of all intelligence within the DOD. Directive 5148.11 assigns the ATSD(IO) the role of overseeing intelligence activities in the Department of Defense to ensure compliance with relevant laws and directives. The confusion around the Intelligence Community budget stems from the distinction between the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP). The National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Military Intelligence Program (MIP) are two separate funding programs overseen by the DNI and USD(I) respectively. The combined funding for NIP and MIP is approximately $70 billion, with NIP being three times larger than MIP. Efforts are made to integrate NIP and MIP intelligence activities seamlessly, with some programs receiving resources from both programs. Table 1 provides an overview of NIP and MIP spending over the past decade. The DNI is only required to disclose the NIP aggregate figure by statute. The Secretary of Defense began disclosing MIP appropriations figures in 2010, providing public access to previously classified budget numbers. The National Intelligence Strategy shapes priorities for IC agencies and focuses resources on current and future decisions. The National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) 2014 outlines enterprise objectives (EOs) that focus on mission management, enterprise management, information sharing, innovation, people, and partnerships to support the IC's mission of providing timely and relevant intelligence for national security decisions. These objectives are crucial for improving integration, collaboration, workforce diversity, and intelligence partnerships. The cross-cutting issues discussed impact and are impacted by these EOs, highlighting the interconnectedness of various areas within the intelligence community. The National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) 2014 outlines enterprise objectives (EOs) crucial for improving integration, collaboration, workforce diversity, and intelligence partnerships. Efforts to improve diversity may conflict with initiatives for information safeguarding. The IC budget is a significant issue affecting every IC agency in an era of limited resources and diverse threats. DNI James Clapper highlighted national security issues such as violent extremists, cyber threats, and state-sponsored terrorism in his briefing to Congress. The DNI, with the assistance of the ADNI/SRA, balances strategic priorities in the National Intelligence Program (NIP) by making proactive resource decisions based on national priorities outlined in the NIS and NIPF. The NIPF ranks strategic priorities and is managed through IC Directive 204. The NIPF reflects customers' priorities for national intelligence support, ensuring that enduring and emerging national intelligence issues are addressed. The MIP is managed separately by the USD(I) within the DOD's budgeting system. CAPE assists the USD(I) in achieving similar goals for the MIP in alignment with key defense strategies. The Consolidated Intelligence Guidance provides direction for managing NIP and MIP resources. The NIP and MIP are managed separately within the executive branch and justified to Congress separately. Congressional committees have oversight over both programs. Questions arise on harmonizing budgets, addressing strategic priorities, and balancing resources within the IC. The NIP and MIP budgets are managed separately within the executive branch and justified to Congress separately. Questions arise on harmonizing budgets, addressing strategic priorities, and balancing resources within the IC. Analysis is a key issue as it is the primary function of the IC, with every component responsible for supporting its organization's mission and national security. Intelligence \"failures\" are often attributed to surprises, prompting a focus on improving analysis. Efforts to improve intelligence analysis have been driven by concerns raised after the 9/11 attacks and the flawed analysis in the IC's 2002 NIE on Iraq's WMD program. The WMD Commission identified serious shortcomings in the IC's analytic effort, including inadequate collaboration, analysts lacking understanding of collection, and a shortage of scientific and technical expertise. The Intelligence Community faces challenges with analysts not clearly stating assumptions, explaining logic, and identifying unknowns. Basic processes for producing accurate intelligence are broken or underutilized, leading to doubts about the quality of analysis. Policymakers and consumers are calling for more rigorous analysis and greater scrutiny of assumptions and methodology. The Intelligence Community has been working on reforms to improve the credibility of its analytical products. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires the DNI to ensure accurate analysis of intelligence and employ proper analytic tradecraft standards. One significant effort to enhance critical thinking and writing skills is the publication of Intelligence Community Directive Number 203, \"Analytic Standards.\" The Intelligence Community has implemented various initiatives to improve intelligence analysis, including the promulgation of Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) Number 203 in 2007. Assessments on the effectiveness of these standards are mixed. Experts suggest that current reforms may have reached their peak in improving analysis, and policymakers should adjust their expectations accordingly. Some experts suggest that policymakers should adjust expectations and accept occasional intelligence errors. They recommend a robust \"lessons learned\" capability within the Intelligence Community for serious analytic lapses, emphasizing the need for an intellectual inquiry into what went wrong. Dr. John Gentry highlights personnel shortcomings in critical thinking and writing skills among newly hired analysts, which hinders efforts to raise analytic standards. Some IC agencies hire analysts with poor cognitive and communication skills, lacking leadership to address the issue. Gentry suggests reforming hiring practices to focus on older individuals with strong education and judgment. He also points out flaws in hiring processes that hinder acquiring talented and well-educated individuals. Additionally, he emphasizes the need for managers of analysts to play a more significant role in reform strategies. Gentry emphasizes the importance of managers in reform strategies, stating that reforms will only be effective if managers are willing to change their ways. He highlights the shared responsibility of analysts and managers for agency performance, with managers shaping the demographics, training, and ethics of analysts. Gentry raises questions about the recruitment and retention of skilled analysts in the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Community (IC) is focusing on big data solutions to address large-scale data accumulation, aiming for integration, interoperability, collaboration, and information sharing. This effort is a cross-cutting issue affecting every IC agency, with agencies across the federal government developing systems to collect and store unstructured data for analysis. The IC is also exploring lessons learned and best practices mechanisms to improve intelligence analysis, considering the role of intelligence analyst managers in reform planning and execution. Additionally, there is a question of whether other countries' intelligence services face similar challenges and if the IC looks beyond U.S. borders for best practices. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) report from the 95th Congress highlights the challenges posed by the \"information explosion\" and the need for new technology and analytical approaches to handle the vast amount of available knowledge. While military analysis is well-established, there is a need for further work on political-social analysis and applying social, cultural, and economic behavior analyses to foreign policy and defense issues. Some efforts to address big data challenges are agency-centric, such as those seen in the CIA. Some government agencies, like the CIA and NSA, have specific initiatives to deal with big data challenges in foreign policy and defense. Other government-wide efforts involve large-scale data collection and analysis projects conducted by various research activities. The IC Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE) is an ongoing initiative focused on addressing big data challenges by providing common collaboration tools and secure cloud architectures at the top secret level. The IC ITE initiative aims to enhance collaboration and security in the intelligence community by pooling IT resources, cutting costs, increasing data storage capabilities, and improving mission agility and efficiency. The IC's Chief Information Officer oversees this transition to a common platform for sharing technology and resources securely. This shift from agency-centric IT architecture to a unified enterprise will enable more efficient operations and innovative technology delivery across the intelligence community. The IC ITE initiative aims to enhance collaboration and security in the intelligence community by pooling IT resources, cutting costs, and improving mission efficiency. The Intelligence and National Security Alliance suggests ways to foster successful implementation, including transparency in funding and acquisition, metrics-driven governance, and workforce skill development. The DOD version of IC ITE is the Joint Information Environment (JIE), focusing on a common architecture for secret and unclassified information. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) leads the JIE Technical Synchronization Office (JTSO) for the Joint Information Environment (JIE), which stores and shares data related to military operations. The IC is exploring partnerships with industry and other agencies for developing big data systems like IC ITE. Ownership of information in the cloud under IC ITE is a key consideration. Ownership of information in the cloud under IC ITE is a key consideration, along with establishing a metrics-driven governance process and implementing human resources/training initiatives to increase diversity in the workforce. In June 2015, CIA Director John Brennan emphasized the importance of diversity in the workforce for mission success. The Intelligence Community (IC) has implemented policies and programs to improve diversity, as directed by the IRTPA of 2004. IC Directive 110 guides efforts to promote Equal Employment and Opportunity (EEO) and diversity through recruitment and retention of minorities, women, and other underrepresented groups. The Intelligence Community (IC) aims to enhance workforce diversity by recruiting, developing, and retaining individuals from various backgrounds. The IC Strategic Human Capital Plan focuses on building an agile workforce with a mix of military and civilian employees, contractors, and partners for maximum agility. The DNI's management team includes an Assistant Director for Human Capital responsible for human capital legislative issues. The Intelligence Community (IC) conducts virtual career fairs to recruit diverse candidates proficient in critical languages and cultural expertise. Other initiatives include targeted minority recruiting outreach efforts at national conferences and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to meet critical skills and diversity goals. The Intelligence Authorization Acts have provisions to increase diversity in the IC through reporting, outreach, hiring, and grants to academic institutions. The success of these efforts is unclear. Legislative efforts include annual reports on hiring and retention of minority employees, EEO outreach projects, and the creation of IC Centers of Academic Excellence. The IC CAE Program aims to increase diversity in the Intelligence Community by targeting women and racial/ethnic minorities with varied backgrounds and skills through a grant program for accredited colleges and universities in the US. Legislative efforts require IC elements to report on plans to increase diversity, including hiring, retention, and diversity awareness training. The Intelligence Community aims to increase diversity through the IC CAE Program, targeting women and minorities with varied backgrounds. Legislative efforts require IC elements to report on diversity plans, including hiring, retention, and education programs for senior officials. The IG Report on minority employment in professional positions is classified, and grants are provided to minority-serving institutions for educational programs. The Intelligence Community offers programs in foreign languages and study abroad, with a focus on diversity in hiring. Challenges in the hiring process include fragmented governance, complicated rules, and disconnects between hiring managers and HR specialists. Despite recognition of these issues, well-qualified candidates are often lost due to the lengthy hiring process. The hiring process in the Intelligence Community faces challenges such as lengthy wait times and lack of feedback. Potential applicants may wait up to 28 weeks for a job, with security and testing taking up to 15 weeks. Progress is being made towards a more user-friendly portal for all IC agencies to streamline the application process. The intelligence.careers.gov website provides information on how to apply to the 17 components of the Intelligence Community, with DIA, NGA, NSA, and ODNI being the participating agencies. There may be a common application form and streamlined screening processes in development. Retention programs are crucial for diversity in the IC, similar to the DOD's efforts in developing, mentoring, and retaining top talent. The Intelligence Community (IC) may need retention programs similar to the Department of Defense (DOD). The IC's Strategic Human Capital Plan focuses on workforce composition, diversity, and agility. Progress towards workforce diversity goals is measured, and the effectiveness of diversity-related legislative provisions is assessed. Efforts are being made to improve the hiring process efficiency. The Intelligence Community (IC) is focusing on workforce goals, hiring process efficiency, and global coverage of threats. Efforts are being made to improve hiring programs and consider industry best practices. Retention efforts are also being evaluated for uniformity and effectiveness. The Intelligence Community is facing challenges in providing global coverage for threats due to expanding threats and reduced budgets. DNI Clapper highlighted the increasing crises and threats globally, including terrorism, the Syrian war, and radical extremism, leading to less capacity for protection. The Intelligence Community is facing challenges in providing global coverage for threats due to expanding threats and reduced budgets. DNI Clapper highlighted the increasing crises and threats globally, including terrorism, the Syrian war, and radical extremism, leading to less capacity for protection. The IC is forced to accept more risk and allocate fewer resources to lower priority challenges, using the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) to rank-order national intelligence priorities. The Intelligence Community faces challenges in providing global coverage for threats due to expanding threats and reduced budgets. NIPF reflects the IC's pressing problems and resource distribution based on priorities. Solutions include enhancing open-source intelligence capabilities, developing tools for improved warning through social media, expanding expertise with outreach programs, and facilitating surge capability. Former CIA Director of Intelligence, John Kringen, agrees with DNI Clapper's assessment that the IC lacks necessary resources for global coverage and believes the current approach is \"necessary but insufficient.\" Kringen emphasizes the need for better communication on what the IC can and cannot do with its resources. John Kringen suggests that the Intelligence Community needs to develop more robust risk assessments, learn from past crises, and improve outreach efforts. He proposes engaging with outside experts, utilizing government capabilities like the military and law enforcement, and establishing knowledge broker units to collaborate with private sector experts. The Intelligence Community (IC) faces challenges in covering global threats with limited resources. Questions arise about monitoring every corner of the world and the need for partnerships with other countries. Managing expectations, enhancing cooperation with outside experts, and addressing security clearance issues are key priorities for the IC. The Intelligence Community (IC) is focused on managing security clearance issues, including the backlog of periodic reinvestigations and improving information technology management. An issue from a privacy perspective is the expanded use of publicly available data in background checks for security clearance holders. Security clearance levels range from Confidential to Top Secret, indicating the sensitivity of the information accessible. Holders undergo initial background checks and periodic reinvestigations to maintain clearance. Continuous Evaluation (CE) is an ongoing process that may occur at any time during an individual's security clearance eligibility. Factors such as new technologies and high-profile security incidents like the Washington Navy Yard shooting and Edward Snowden disclosures have highlighted the need for CE. Recommendations for CE have been made based on the finding that valuable security-related information can be missed during long periods between reinvestigations. Alexis displayed psychotic behavior before the Navy Yard shooting to various authorities and coworkers. His past incidents affecting his security clearance eligibility were not properly investigated. Continuous Evaluation (CE) is now required for all IC employees, officers, and contractors to monitor their background continually. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 to enhance security measures. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, requiring enhanced security clearance checks for employees and contractors in national security positions. Agencies must use various sources, including social media, for background checks, raising privacy concerns. The DNI is required to develop guidelines for the use of Continuous Evaluation (CE) and recommended the use of the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPP) framework for privacy protection. The CE framework should include transparency, individual consent, data minimization, limited data use, and safeguards for data accuracy and security. Agency Inspectors General are required to conduct audits to assess the effectiveness and fairness of these measures. The audit of the enhanced personnel security program, based on guidelines from the Director of National Intelligence, is set to begin two years after implementation. Key questions include the framework of the IC's continuous evaluation, compliance with DNI standards, sharing of best practices, and the controversial topic of polygraph examinations. The polygraph examination process raises concerns about privacy violations, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies. Defenders claim it is effective in detecting lies and deterring security violations. The machine measures physiological responses to yes-or-no questions but does not detect lies. The polygraph examination process involves determining physiological reactions to yes-or-no questions to detect deception. The ongoing debate surrounds the validity of polygraph testing, with the test aiming to capture accurate indicators of deception. The pros of polygraphing are believed to outweigh the cons, leading to its requirement in the Intelligence Community. Examinations are required throughout the Intelligence Community (IC) to obtain and retain security clearance. IC Policy Guidance (ICPG) 704.6 outlines the three types of polygraph examinations: Counterintelligence Scope Polygraph (CSP), Expanded Scope Polygraph (ESP), and Specific Issue Polygraph (SIP). CSP examinations cover topics like espionage and terrorism, while ESP examinations include criminal conduct and drug involvement. The ESP examination, also known as Full Scope Polygraph (FSP) or Expanded Scope Screening (ESS), covers criminal conduct, drug involvement, and falsification of security questionnaires. It may be used in conjunction with CSP or SIP examinations for CI investigations. Certain IC agencies like the CIA, FBI, NSA, U.S. Secret Service, and Naval Criminal Investigative Service may require the ESP examination for sensitive information from human sources. Polygraphs are required randomly and periodically. Polygraphs are required randomly and periodically by certain IC agencies for sensitive information from human sources. However, their reliability has been questioned by the scientific community, with doubts and uncertainties surrounding their accuracy. The accuracy of polygraph testing for screening employees has been a topic of debate despite reform efforts. A study commissioned by the DOD found the polygraph to be valuable, while a report from the NRO IG highlighted significant shortcomings in their program. The need for frequent, independent assessments of the polygraph program across the IC is highlighted due to contradictory findings on the effectiveness of polygraph examinations. Questions arise on the necessity of polygraph exams, especially with the use of continuous evaluation to monitor employees. Considerations include the sharing of \"best practices\" with foreign intelligence services, exploring emerging technologies for more objective measures, and directing resources towards such advancements. This issue is crucial in restoring trust through transparency. The trust in the Intelligence Community was shattered in the mid- to late-1970s due to allegations of spying and illegal operations. This led to the establishment of investigative committees and the Senate and House intelligence committees in 1976 and 1977 to increase transparency and oversight. The establishment of intelligence committees in the 1970s aimed to increase oversight and transparency in response to abuse by certain intelligence agencies. Efforts within the Intelligence Community to provide greater transparency are driven by the need to restore public trust, especially after high-profile leaks by Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning. The Intelligence Community struggles with implementing transparency due to a culture of secrecy. Calls for increased transparency come from various reasons such as fighting corruption and enforcing democratic principles. Powerful forces like entrenched habits and fear of disclosure hinder progress towards greater transparency. The challenges of implementing transparency in the Intelligence Community are hindered by powerful forces such as entrenched habits, protection of privilege, and fear of disclosure. General Michael Hayden highlights the dangers of absolute transparency and the expectations of access to government documents among the 'millennial generation'. The challenges of implementing transparency in the Intelligence Community are hindered by powerful forces such as entrenched habits, protection of privilege, and fear of disclosure. General Michael Hayden highlights the dangers of absolute transparency and the expectations of access to government documents among the 'millennial generation'. President Obama announced a commitment to unprecedented openness in government in response to demands for greater transparency from the millennial generation and others. The Federal Government promotes accountability by disclosing information rapidly in accessible forms. Executive departments and agencies are encouraged to use new technologies to make information about their operations available to the public. Gregory Treverton emphasizes the importance of transparency in government and the need for a balance between secrecy and open government. The importance of transparency in government is highlighted, emphasizing the need for a balance between secrecy and open government. The public does not need to know all the details of intelligence activities, but it is crucial that independent oversight is in place. The process before and after intelligence operations is critical, with the goal of enhancing public understanding while protecting national security. The IC has a tradition of resisting GAO access, citing exemption from audit laws. Congressional oversight is mainly left to independent IC entities like agency IGs. The first DCIA argued that the CIA was exempt from GAO audit due to the DCIA's authority over agency funds. Despite past resistance, IC attitudes towards GAO evaluations are changing, with some intelligence-related programs being evaluated. A policy directive in FY2010 directed IC agencies to cooperate with GAO audits on a case-by-case basis. The policy directive prohibits GAO access to sensitive information related to core national intelligence capabilities and activities, including intelligence collection operations, analyses, counterintelligence, and funding. DNI Clapper believes that congressional oversight staff should handle the most sensitive investigations in the intelligence community. The congressional intelligence committees should conduct reviews, audits, and oversight of intelligence activities, programs, and operations. Most intelligence funding is within the defense budget, with detailed budget numbers classified. There is ongoing debate about disclosing intelligence budget details, with concerns about national security implications. The Church and Pike Committees, along with Senate and House intelligence committees, have discussed increasing transparency in intelligence operations. The Church and Pike Committees, along with Senate and House intelligence committees, have held hearings on greater transparency in the intelligence community budget. Congressional documents from the 1970s contain arguments for and against disclosing the intelligence budget, focusing on whether to reveal one top-line number or all agency top-line numbers. The 9/11 Commission recommended releasing the amount spent on national intelligence, leading to the disclosure of the NIP top-line number by the DNI. The DNI is directed to disclose the NIP topline number, with the first disclosure made in 2007. The IAA for FY2010 further amended Section 601 to require the President to publicly disclose the amount requested for the NIP for the next fiscal year. Currently, only the NIP topline figure must be disclosed. In 2010, the Secretary of Defense began disclosing MIP appropriations figures, providing public access to previously classified budget numbers for national and military intelligence activities. Legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress to address this issue. Legislation in the 114th Congress aims to improve transparency in intelligence budgets by requiring disclosure of proposed budget amounts for intelligence activities. Questions arise on how to enhance the relationship between the Intelligence Community (IC) and Government Accountability Office (GAO) for better oversight. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) currently holds final authority over GAO access to IC activities. The current authority of the DNI in denying GAO access to IC activities raises questions about the need to reexamine the GAO-IC appeals process and transparency in intelligence spending. The report highlights the importance of promoting transparency across the IC and addresses various cross-cutting issues in IC leadership and management. The curr_chunk discusses challenges faced by businesses in pursuing IC contracts, negative consequences of intelligence integration centers, IC-law enforcement sharing impacting public trust, organizational change issues, lack of integration in research and development efforts, and the need for balance, best practices, integration, privacy, and transparency in addressing cross-cutting issues within the IC. The Intelligence Community aims to enhance public understanding through transparency about its mission, activities, laws, and compliance framework. It will provide timely information with clarity and context to maintain trust between individuals, agencies, and the government. The Intelligence Community aims to enhance public understanding through transparency by providing clear and accessible information, engaging with stakeholders, and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure. The Intelligence Community aims to enhance public understanding through transparency, protect sensitive information, and align roles and resources to support robust implementation of classification principles."
