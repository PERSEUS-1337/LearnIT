    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Act of 2014\" or the \"SWEET Act.\" The Congress finds that obesity rates in the United States have dramatically increased over the past 30 years, with over one-third of adults and 17% of youth classified as obese in 2012. Low-income individuals and communities of color are disproportionately affected, with nearly half of African-American adults and over 42% of Hispanic adults being obese. The percentage of overweight children has also significantly risen in recent decades. The prevalence of overweight children has significantly increased in recent decades, with rates tripling among children aged 6-11 and quadrupling among those aged 12-19. Despite efforts to address childhood obesity, rates remain high, affecting 17% of young people aged 2-19, totaling 12.5 million children and adolescents. Racial and age disparities exist, with higher obesity rates among Hispanics and non-Hispanic black youth compared to non-Hispanic white youth. The prevalence of obesity varies among different racial groups, with Hispanic white youth having the highest rates. Overweight and obesity contribute to significant healthcare costs, with obese individuals incurring much higher expenses. Obesity increases the risk of various health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, asthma, and breathing problems. Overweight and obesity are linked to various health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and obesity contribute to a significant portion of cancer cases and deaths. Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is also associated with health risks. Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages like soft drinks, energy drinks, sweet teas, and sports drinks is linked to obesity and diabetes. Adults who have one or more sugary drinks daily are 27% more likely to be overweight or obese. Daily intake of one liter of these beverages can increase fat deposits in the liver by 150%, leading to diabetes and heart disease. These drinks offer little nutritional value but contain high amounts of added sugars, with a 20-ounce soda having about 16 teaspoons of sugar. The American Heart Association recommends limiting daily sugar intake to six to nine teaspoons. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines highlighted that almost half of added sugars consumed by Americans come from sugar-sweetened beverages. Despite a slight decline in consumption due to increased awareness of health risks, Americans still consume twice as much as in the 1970s. Five percent of Americans intake at least 567 kcal from sugar drinks daily, equivalent to over four 12-ounce cans of soda. One-third of added sugars consumed in the United States come from beverages. In the United States, a significant portion of added sugars, especially in children and adolescents, comes from beverages. Studies have shown a strong association between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and weight gain in both adults and children. For example, women who increased their intake of sugary drinks gained an average of 10 pounds over four years. Similarly, children who consumed one 8-ounce serving of sugar-sweetened beverage daily gained more weight and body fat compared to those who did not. Sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to excess caloric consumption and do not satisfy hunger like solid food or protein-containing beverages. Overweight children are at a higher risk of obesity as adults, and the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is increasing among children. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is increasing among children, with almost a quarter of teens having either diabetes or prediabetes. If current trends continue, it is predicted that one in three children and nearly half of Latino and African-American children born in 2000 will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. Consuming added sugar equivalent to one 20-ounce soda per day increases the risk of dying from a heart attack by 30%, while consuming the equivalent of 2-3 sodas per day increases the risk by 2.75 times. Tooth decay is the most common chronic childhood disease, affecting over a quarter of US children aged 2-5 years and half of those aged. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry states that children who consume sugary beverages are at risk for dental caries, which can lead to pain, infection, tooth loss, and even death. The SWEET Act aims to reduce the human and economic costs of diabetes, obesity, and dental issues. The SWEET Act aims to reduce the human and economic costs of diabetes, obesity, and dental caries by increasing the price of sugar-sweetened beverages and funding programs for priority populations. The SWEET Act proposes an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, with manufacturers, producers, or importers being liable for the tax. The tax rate is one cent per 4.2 grams of caloric sweetener in the beverage product. The SWEET Act proposes an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, with manufacturers, producers, or importers being liable for the tax. The tax rate is one cent per 4.2 grams of caloric sweetener in the beverage product. The term 'specified sugar-sweetened beverage product' is defined as any liquid intended for human consumption containing a caloric sweetener, or any liquid/solid mixture with a caloric sweetener intended for use as an ingredient in such a liquid. Exceptions include liquids primarily made of milk, soy, rice, or similar plant-based milk substitutes.

Exceptions include liquids primarily made of milk, soy, rice, or similar plant-based milk substitutes. The bill also exempts certain liquids like those composed of fruit or vegetable juice, infant formula, and oral nutritional therapy products. The term 'caloric sweetener' in the SWEET Act refers to monosaccharides, disaccharides, and high-fructose corn syrup. Exceptions to the excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages include liquids primarily made of milk, soy, rice, or plant-based milk substitutes, as well as fruit or vegetable juice, infant formula, and oral nutritional therapy products. Liquid products subject to other alcohol-related taxes are also exempt. SEC. 4173. SPECIAL RULES. The text discusses the taxation of caloric sweeteners in sugar-sweetened beverage products and the inflation adjustment for sales after December 31, 2015. The text discusses the inflation adjustment for sales after December 31, 2015, in relation to the taxation of caloric sweeteners in sugar-sweetened beverage products. Amendments are made to section 4221(a) and the table of parts for subchapter D of chapter 32 of the Code. Amendments are made to section 4221(a) and the table of parts for subchapter D of chapter 32 of the Code regarding the taxation of caloric sweeteners in sugar-sweetened beverage products. Revenues from taxes on caloric sweeteners in sugar-sweetened beverages are appropriated to the Prevention and Public Health Fund for prevention, treatment, and research of diet-related health conditions in priority populations. Rules similar to the Internal Revenue Code apply to these funds. The Prevention and Public Health Fund can transfer funds to the Department of Health and Human Services for programs and research targeting diabetes, obesity, dental caries, and other diet-related health conditions in priority populations. The effective date for amendments is upon enactment of the Act, with excise tax amendments applying to sales after enactment."
