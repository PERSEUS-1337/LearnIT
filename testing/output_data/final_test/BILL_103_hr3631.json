Nonrecognition treatment for transfers of assets from common trust funds to regulated investment companies in exchange for stock, with basis rules for assets received by the companies and participants receiving stock in the exchange. The basis for stock received in exchange for assets from a common trust fund to regulated investment companies is allocated based on fair market values. Assumptions of liability by the companies and liabilities on transferred property are disregarded in determining the exchange solely for stock in the companies. In transfers where assumed liabilities exceed asset bases, gain is recognized by the common trust fund. The basis of assets received by regulated investment companies is adjusted accordingly. In transfers to regulated investment companies, any recognized gain increases the basis of the assets transferred. If the transfer is to multiple companies, the basis increase is allocated based on fair market values. The basis of assets received by companies is determined by fair market values. Assumed liabilities include those taken on by a regulated investment company from a common trust fund transfer. Common trust funds must adhere to diversification rules. The subsection does not apply to common trust funds that do not meet certain requirements. Government securities are not considered securities of an issuer for the 25-percent and 50-percent test. The effective date of the amendment is after the enactment of the Act."
