    "content": "The 110th Congress introduced new financial services regulatory relief measures to reduce the burden on financial service providers. This initiative aims to enhance services provided by depository institutions and lower regulatory compliance costs. The provisions are in line with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires regulators to review regulations every 10 years to eliminate outdated or unnecessary requirements. H.R. 6312, known as the Credit Union, Bank and Thrift Regulatory Relief Act of 2008, is a compromise bill aimed at reducing regulatory requirements on banks, thrifts, and credit unions. It combines changes sought by advocates for both industries and passed the House in June 2008. The legislation is now with the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for consideration. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is reviewing H.R. 6312, which includes provisions for Credit Unions, Savings Associations, Notice Provisions, and Business Checking. One key provision, Sec. 101, would expand federal credit unions' investment activities in securities, allowing them to purchase certain investment-grade securities for their own account. This would give credit unions similar powers to banks in the securities business, with limitations on the total investment in any one obligor or maker not exceeding 10% of the credit union's net worth. The provision in H.R. 6312 would increase the investment limit for credit union service organizations (CUSOs) from 1% to 3%. Additionally, federal credit unions can now make loans to non-profit religious organizations. The legislation aims to increase credit unions' ability to lend to businesses by excluding loans to nonprofit religious organizations from the member business loan limit. It also grants the NCUA flexibility to establish longer maturity terms for specific types of loans in response to market conditions. The legislation aims to increase credit unions' lending flexibility by allowing interest rates on loans to exceed 15% under certain conditions. It also addresses conversions of common bond credit unions to community charters, requiring NCUA to establish criteria for membership outside the community base. The legislation allows credit unions to participate in loan programs secured by government insurance, guarantees, or commitments. It also permits credit unions to expand services to underserved areas with high unemployment and below median incomes. This proposal allows federal credit unions to expand services to underserved communities, including \"investment areas\" and \"low income areas.\" Credit unions must establish an office in the underserved area within 24 months of approval and report to the NCUA on their work. Sec. 110. Credit Union Governance allows federal credit unions to limit board service length for broader representation. It also permits expulsion of members for cause. Sec. 111. Encouraging Small Business Development in Underserved Urban and Rural Communities enables credit unions to make more business loans in underserved areas by excluding them from member business loan caps. Under the proposal, federal savings associations could increase their investment in Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) from 1% to 5% of capital and surplus. Additionally, savings associations would be allowed to invest in auto and other vehicle loans without a percentage of assets limit. Sec.203. Repeal of Qualified Thrift Lending Requirements with Respect to Out-of-State Branches. This provision eliminates the requirement for multi-state federal savings associations to meet the QTL test on a state-by-state basis. Sec. 204. Small Business and Other Commercial Loans. This section eliminates the small business lending limit for federal savings associations and increases the lending limit for other types of business loans from 10 to 20%. Sec. 205 would increase the lending limit for commercial real estate loans for savings associations from 400% to 500% of capital. Sec. 206 allows unitary thrift holding companies to charter credit card savings associations without losing exempt status. Sec. 301 provides an exception to annual privacy notice requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to issue annual privacy notices to customers, outlining privacy policies and information sharing practices. The proposal exempts institutions that meet specific criteria, including not sharing information with affiliates under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and maintaining consistent disclosure practices. State licensed institutions prohibited from disclosing personal information without consumer consent are also exempt. The \"Business Checking Fairness Act of 2008\" would allow depository institutions to offer customers the ability to make up to 24 transfers per month from interest-bearing accounts. It would also repeal the prohibition against the payment of interest on demand deposits, including personal accounts. The proposal aims to repeal the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits and escrow accounts, as outlined in the Home Owners Loan Act and the Deposit Insurance Act. It specifies rules for escrow accounts in real estate transactions, clarifying expenses and fees without mandating interest payments by financial institutions. Additionally, it addresses consumer banking costs assessment under the Federal Reserve Act. The proposal would amend the Federal Reserve Act to require a biennial survey of retail banking fees and services. It also includes a biennial report to Congress and repeals certain reporting requirements from previous acts. The proposed Credit Union, Bank and Thrift Regulatory Relief Act of 2008 is seen as a compromise between credit unions and the banking industry. The Regulatory Relief Act and Credit Union Regulatory Improvement Act aimed to expand credit unions' field of membership, increase member business lending cap, and implement a risk-based system of Prompt Corrective Action. This was seen as making credit unions more competitive with banks. A compromise was reached after modifications were made to the definition of underserved areas. H.R. 6312 would lift the cap on member business loans less than previous legislation and drop the risk-based system. The compromise legislation, H.R. 6312, includes provisions from the Bank Regulatory Relief Act of 2008 and has support from various banking associations. One controversial provision is the requirement to pay interest on business checking accounts, which smaller institutions oppose due to potential profitability issues."
