    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Wind Engineering Research Program Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of hurricanes and tornadoes on American lives and property, emphasizing the need for increased funding in wind engineering research to develop more effective methods for constructing wind-resistant buildings and structures. Federal funding for this research has declined over the past two decades, hindering progress due to a lack of data. Establishment of a Federal Wind Engineering Research Program is crucial due to the lack of data on near-surface wind speed during severe storms. Existing wind-resistant construction methods are often not utilized due to lack of awareness. Improved interagency cooperation would lead to new technologies for wind-resistant construction, reducing loss of life and property from extreme winds. The Act aims to establish a Wind Engineering Research Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to conduct wind engineering research, share information, and enhance collaboration among various federal agencies. The Wind Engineering Research Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology conducts research on mitigating wind damage from hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe storms. It collaborates with the private sector and academia, coordinates research with other federal agencies, and disseminates information on reducing wind damage to various types of buildings. The Wind Engineering Research Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology aims to transfer wind engineering technology to the private sector for application in building codes and design practices. It conducts post-disaster research with NOAA to assess building vulnerability to extreme winds and collaborates with various agencies to disseminate research information and develop education programs on reducing wind damage. The Federal Aviation Administration and other Federal agencies collaborate on meteorology programs to collect data on extreme wind events. They also work with the National Science Foundation to support research on wind engineering. The Wind Engineering Research Advisory Committee is established. The Wind Engineering Research Advisory Committee, established by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, provides advice on wind engineering research and development plans, including the involvement of other Federal agencies. Members are appointed based on their expertise and cannot be Department of Commerce employees. The Wind Engineering Research Advisory Committee, established by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, consists of members with expertise in wind engineering research and development. The committee will terminate within 60 days after the development of the plan referred to in section 6. The Wind Engineering Research Advisory Committee, established by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, consists of members with expertise in wind engineering research and development. The committee will terminate within 60 days after the development of the plan referred to in section 6, which focuses on wind engineering research and development. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will develop an integrated plan for a national wind engineering research and development program within one year of establishing the advisory committee. The plan will include details of current programs, funding levels, and integration of programs by consulting with the National Science Foundation. The integrated plan for a national wind engineering research and development program will include funding levels, milestones, cost estimates, work scopes, personnel requirements, goals for the next 5 years, and the role of other Federal agencies. It will also outline the transfer of technology to the private sector and how the program can be conducted in cooperation with industry. Authorization for National Institute of Standards and Technology includes $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1996. At least 50 percent of the funds will be used for cooperative agreements with other agencies for wind engineering research and data collection."
