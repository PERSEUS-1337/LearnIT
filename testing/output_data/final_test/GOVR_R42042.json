    "content": "The development of super PACs is a recent aspect of the money and speech debate in elections. Some view them positively as a result of deregulatory court decisions, while others see them as a way for unlimited money to influence politics. This report provides context on super PACs and their relevance to federal campaign finance policy through a question-and-answer format. PACs have become significant players in American elections, with a focus on background and policy matters relevant for legislative and oversight concerns. The report discusses selected litigation that has impacted campaign finance and policy issues facing Congress. Terminology note: independent expenditures (IEs) refer to purchases, often for political advertising, explicitly calling for the election or defeat of a federal candidate. Various entities, including parties, traditional PACs, individuals, and super PACs, may make IEs. Super PACs, also known as independent-expenditure-only committees (IEOCs), emerged in 2010 after key court rulings like Citizens United and SpeechNow. These groups solely focus on making independent expenditures, such as political advertising or voter-canvassing services, to support or oppose federal candidates. Independent expenditures (IEs) are not considered campaign contributions and must be made independently of parties and candidates, meaning they cannot be coordinated with them. Super PACs, also known as independent-expenditure-only committees (IEOCs), emerged in 2010 after key court rulings like Citizens United and SpeechNow. These groups solely focus on making independent expenditures, such as political advertising or voter-canvassing services, to support or oppose federal candidates. Independent expenditures (IEs) are not considered campaign contributions and must be made independently of parties and candidates, meaning they cannot be coordinated with them. Determining whether an expenditure is coordinated can be complex, but the goal is to ensure that IEs are truly independent and do not circumvent contribution limits. Super PACs are similar to traditional PACs in reporting requirements but differ in their focus on independent expenditures. Super PACs, unlike traditional PACs, cannot contribute to candidate campaigns and can accept unlimited contributions, similar to 527s and some 501(c) organizations. While 527s are governed by the Internal Revenue Code, super PACs are primarily regulated by the FEC. The 2010 Citizens United decision indirectly influenced the development of super PACs by allowing corporations and unions to use treasury funds for political activities. Following the Citizens United decision, corporations and unions can use treasury funds for political expenditures, including independent expenditures and electioneering communications. This led to the development of super PACs, which can accept unlimited contributions and make only independent expenditures. Super PACs, also known as independent-expenditure-only committees, emerged after the Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions. They can accept unlimited contributions and make independent expenditures, becoming a significant force in federal elections. The FEC amended its rules in 2014 to recognize super PACs, but concerns remain about their role in elections. Super PACs, also known as independent-expenditure-only committees, have raised concerns about their impact on federal elections. Advocates argue for their freedom to contribute unlimited funds for independent expenditures, while opponents see them as a threat. Policy issues surrounding super PACs include regulations, transparency, and their influence on the campaign environment. Super PACs, also known as independent-expenditure-only committees, have raised concerns about their impact on federal elections. Advocates argue for their freedom to contribute unlimited funds for independent expenditures, while opponents see them as a threat to campaign contribution limits. Congress has not passed specific legislation addressing super PACs, but existing regulations and laws governing traditional PACs apply to them. The FEC issued rules in 2014 recognizing super PACs and reflecting advisory opinions issued after Citizens United and SpeechNow. The FEC is responsible for enforcing federal election law, but a stalemate over the scope of the agency's response to the ruling has persisted. In October 2014, the FEC approved rules to remove invalidated spending prohibitions on corporate and union treasury funds, recognizing super PACs. The rules did not create new prohibitions but provided guidance through advisory opinions. The FEC approved advisory opinions in response to questions from the Club for Growth and Commonsense Ten regarding forming super PACs after the Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions. Organizations were allowed to solicit unlimited contributions for independent expenditures, with the option to supplement their FEC forms with letters indicating their super PAC status. These AOs permitted the creation of super PACs based on the new rules post-Citizens United. The FEC approved advisory opinions allowing super PACs to raise unlimited contributions for independent expenditures post-Citizens United and SpeechNow. Federal candidates and party officials could solicit contributions for super PACs within limits set by FECA. Federal candidates could attend fundraising events where unlimited amounts were solicited by others. AO 2011-11 addressed questions from comedian Stephen Colbert. The FEC responded to questions from comedian Stephen Colbert regarding whether discussing his super PAC on his show would constitute in-kind contributions from Viacom. The commission determined that coverage of the super PAC on The Colbert Report would fall under the press exemption and need not be reported. The FEC determined that coverage of the super PAC on The Colbert Report would not need to be reported as in-kind contributions, but if Viacom provided services referencing the super PAC for air in other settings, those communications would be reportable. The guidance from this decision could be relevant for other super PACs working with media organizations in the future. The FEC considered a request from Crossroads, a super PAC, regarding funding and airing advertisements ahead of the 2012 elections without violating coordination restrictions. The FEC was divided on how regulations should apply, resulting in a 3-3 deadlocked vote. The FEC deadlocked on how regulations should apply to super PAC sponsorship of \"issue ads\" featuring candidates, leaving the question unsettled. If the FEC cannot agree on approving or prohibiting conduct, enforcement actions against super PACs may also be affected. Additionally, the FEC considered a request from the Constitutional Conservatives Fund PAC (CCF) regarding raising unlimited funds for use in campaigns. The FEC ruled that the Constitutional Conservatives Fund PAC (CCF) could not solicit unlimited contributions due to its affiliation with a federal candidate. This decision implies that leadership PACs affiliated with candidates may not act as super PACs. Super PACs must adhere to the same reporting requirements as traditional PACs, filing financial reports with the FEC for public inspection. Super PACs and political committees must file reports with the FEC summarizing total receipts and disbursements, contributor information, recipient details, and purpose of disbursements. Reporting timetables for PACs, including super PACs, vary based on election year or non-election year activity. During election years, PACs can choose between monthly or quarterly reports, along with pre- and post-general election reports and year-end reports. In non-election years, PACs file FEC reports monthly or semi-annually to cover two six-month periods. Super PACs must report their independent expenditures separately from regular financial reports to the FEC. Independent expenditures over $10,000 must be reported within 48 hours, with additional 24-hour reports for expenditures over $1,000 before elections. Donor information for contributions over $200 is included in regular financial reports but not in independent expenditure reports. Since their inception in the middle of the 2010 election cycle, super PACs have raised and spent over $2 billion, with almost $1.4 billion going towards supporting or opposing federal candidates. Super PACs must report their independent expenditures separately to the FEC, with donor information for contributions over $200 included in regular financial reports but not in independent expenditure reports. Super PACs have proliferated rapidly since their emergence in 2010, with a significant increase in the number of organizations and financial activity. By 2014, there were almost 700 super PACs active in federal elections, representing an 800% increase in just four years. The first super PACs spent around $93 million during the 2010 cycle, with a large portion going towards independent expenditures advocating for or against candidates. Super PAC fundraising and spending increased rapidly in subsequent election cycles, peaking at almost $800 million during the 2012 presidential election. By March 2016, super PACs had already raised more than in the entire 2014 cycle and spent over $529 million, including $275.6 million on independent expenditures. By June 2016, super PACs had spent $772.7 million, including $367.8 million on independent expenditures. Super PAC fundraising and spending increased rapidly in subsequent election cycles, peaking at almost $800 million during the 2012 presidential election. A Center for Responsive Politics analysis found that more than 2,300 super PACs had raised almost $1 billion and spent almost $500 million in independent expenditures. Just 10 super PACs accounted for almost 75% of all super PAC spending in 2010. In 2012, two Republican super PACs alone\u2014Restore Our Future and American Crossroads\u2014each spent more than $100 million, while the most financially active Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA Action, spent approximately $75 million. In 2014, the five highest-spending super PACs disbursed over $236 million, about 35% of the total for all super PACs that election cycle. Despite predictions, for-profit corporations generally did not make large contributions to super PACs after Citizens United. Instead, they are believed to support super PACs through politically active tax-exempt organizations. Some super PACs have played \"ephemeral\" roles by engaging in specific races and then shifting focus or ceasing operations. During the 2016 election cycle, a small number of super PACs were responsible for most spending, with relatively few donors providing funding. Media reports highlighted that 41% of super PAC funds came from just 50 mega-donors and their relatives. Some super PACs with few donors played significant roles in promoting specific candidates. Super PACs, including those funded by a small number of mega-donors, have played significant roles in promoting specific candidates in presidential races. They accounted for about half of all independent expenditures (IEs) in the 2012 cycle and almost 84.7% of IEs in the 2016 cycle. Congress may need to consider oversight or legislation to clarify the role of super PACs in federal campaigns, which could also be relevant for congressional oversight of the FEC. Super PACs play a significant role in campaign finance policy, particularly in their financial influence on elections. Despite the rise of super PACs, federal election law has not been amended to regulate these groups. Questions about super PAC relationships with other organizations, transparency, coordination, contribution limits, and their impact on future elections are of interest for congressional oversight of the FEC. Congress has not amended federal election law to regulate super PACs, leaving the matter to the FEC's discretion. If Congress deems it necessary to address super PACs in election law, it could amend FECA or direct the FEC to draft rules. Legislation could provide clarity and specify requirements but may not fully meet sponsors' preferences. The 114th Congress introduced relevant legislation on super PACs, but Congress could also defer rulemaking to agencies like the FEC, IRS, or SEC. Delegating to agencies may be advantageous due to their expertise but could lead to results Congress disagrees with if the FEC deadlocks. In recent years, Congress has considered rulemaking for super PACs to ensure regulations align with congressional intent and increase consensus during implementation. Despite ongoing activity, much remains unknown about super PACs. The FEC views super PACs as political committees subject to regulations, prohibiting coordination with campaigns or other committees. Observers question the independence of super PACs and whether their activities comply with contribution limits. Concerns about super PAC independence arise from candidate campaign staff moving to support super PACs, some of which have close ties to the candidates they support. Additionally, the presence of separate organizations like 501(c) tax-exempt political groups operating alongside super PACs raises further concerns about coordination and compliance with regulations. Some question the independence of super PACs and their ties to candidate campaigns. Donors can contribute unlimited amounts to super PACs, raising concerns about transparency in funding sources. Contributions to trade associations or other organizations may indirectly fund super PACs without full disclosure. Trade Association B used unrestricted funds from Company A to contribute to a super PAC, allowing donors to avoid disclosure by funneling money through intermediary organizations. This raises concerns about transparency in funding sources for super PACs. Super PACs are required to disclose the identity of any corporation, union, or individual that contributes directly or makes independent expenditures. There is debate over the independence of super PACs and concerns about potential coordination with candidates. Some argue that more coordination would benefit both parties, while others believe that prohibiting coordination is necessary to maintain independence. Some argue that increasing coordination between outside groups and campaigns could be beneficial, while others warn that it may lead to circumventing limits on campaign contributions. Congress could amend FECA to limit coordination between super PACs and candidates or parties, superseding the existing complex and controversial coordination standard. Traditional PACs have adopted super PAC characteristics over time. In October 2011, the FEC allowed nonconnected PACs to accept unlimited contributions for independent expenditures, requiring them to keep the funds separate from candidate contributions. This decision raised concerns about transparency and the prevention of corruption, prompting Congress to consider the availability of information on super PACs. In the absence of additional reporting requirements or amendments clarifying FEC's coordination rules, determining the professional networks behind super PACs may be left to the media or self-reporting. Establishing relationships between super PACs and related entities like 527 and 501(c) organizations is challenging due to current reporting limitations. Assessing super PAC financial activities requires multiple FEC reports, making it difficult to summarize all spending on federal elections. Data can change frequently due to amended filings, and reconciling IE reports with post-election reports can be challenging. Streamlining reporting for super PACs could benefit regulators and researchers by making data more accessible. Some argue that super PACs should have less reporting obligations compared to political committees due to their independent activities. However, delays in filing detailed disclosure reports can result in significant fundraising or spending activities going unreported for up to six months. For example, some super PACs did not disclose their late off-year activities until early election-year primaries were held. The need for greater clarity in financial reporting requirements for super PACs, especially in relation to delays in disclosing fundraising and spending activities, raises a policy question for Congress on whether current reporting loopholes should be closed. The decision to revisit reporting requirements will depend on the level of detail needed to prevent corruption. While super PACs receive significant media attention, their actual influence in federal elections may be overstated. Super PACs, along with other groups in American politics, are legally separate from candidates but are seen as extensions of campaigns. Congress may address super PAC issues based on whether their activities are seen as free speech or as campaign extensions."
