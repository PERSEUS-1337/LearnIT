    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Climate Adaptation Act\". Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic Nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader area within the Arctic isotherm. The Arctic region is home to an indigenous population that has subsisted on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife unique to the region. It has also produced over 16,000,000,000 barrels of oil. The United States Arctic region holds significant oil and gas reserves, with temperatures warming at a faster rate than the global average. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing, and the region may be ice-free during summer months in 30 years, impacting indigenous communities and ecosystems. The United States Arctic region is experiencing significant environmental changes, impacting indigenous communities, marine life, and wildlife. These changes are opening up new areas for possible development in offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and tourism. Unprecedented storms and thawing permafrost are causing erosion, infrastructure damage, and the risk of entire Alaskan Arctic villages being washed into the sea. Up to 4 coastal villages in Alaska are at immediate risk and face high relocation costs. The lack of winter ice pack from 2009 to 2014 has increased wave energy, causing erosion of beachfronts in Alaskan villages. The Government Accountability Office estimates relocation costs for 4 villages at $450 million, with 30 more villages facing similar threats by 2019. A 2009 study recommends creating a lead Federal entity to coordinate village relocation efforts. The 2009 study by the University of Alaska's Institute for Social and Economic Research predicts that Alaska's public infrastructure will face adaptation costs of up to $6 billion by 2030 due to climate change impacts. Coastal erosion and thawing permafrost threaten infrastructure, including airports and roadways, with estimated adaptation costs in the tens of billions of dollars for Alaska's communities. Additionally, rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification are changing fish habitats. Ocean acidification is causing changes in fish habitats and the spread of invasive fish species, posing a threat to Alaska's commercial fisheries and the subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering activities that provide protein for economically disadvantaged Alaskan Native villages. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Denali Commission\" refers to the Denali Commission established under the Denali Commission Act of 1998. The term \"Program\" refers to the American Arctic Adaptation Grant Program. The American Arctic Adaptation Grant Program, established in the Department of Commerce, awards grants to eligible entities for projects. The Denali Commission serves as the Alaska Project Coordinator, selecting and coordinating projects in consultation with various stakeholders. The Denali Commission establishes an Adaptation Advisory Committee to advise on climate adaptation needs and investments, composed of public and private members representing various organizations. The Denali Commission collaborates with various organizations such as the University of Alaska, Alaska Associated General Contractors Association, Alaska Department of Transportation, and others for infrastructure projects. They meet with the Adaptation Advisory Commission every 6 months. The Commission can also combine funds from the Program with other federal or state grants for infrastructure projects. The Denali Commission collaborates with organizations like the University of Alaska and Alaska Department of Transportation for infrastructure projects. They can combine funds from the Program with other grants for eligible projects in coastal or remote Alaskan villages affected by climate change. Eligible projects include repairing public infrastructure damaged by flooding, erosion, permafrost melting, and land subsidence. The Denali Commission works with partners for infrastructure projects in Alaska, combining funds for eligible projects in villages affected by climate change. Eligible projects include repairing damage to public infrastructure, negative impacts on human health, disruption of habitats, and economic activities. Applicants must submit a detailed description of the proposed project for grant consideration. The Denali Commission selects eligible projects for grants based on the project proposal and the impact of climate change. They provide technical assistance and limit administrative expenses to 25% of the grant funds. The Denali Commission selects eligible projects for grants based on project proposals and climate change impact. Grants can be used for administrative expenses and give preference to projects using non-Federal funds. The Commission publishes an annual work plan with project descriptions, updates, and guidance for eligible entities. SEC. 5. ARCTIC RESEARCH. During fiscal year 2010, the Denali Commission, in collaboration with various entities, will research climate adaptation practices used by other polar nations for potential use in Arctic communities in Alaska. The focus will be on environmentally sensitive design, clean energy alternatives, and innovative infrastructure solutions. A report on the research findings is due by December 31, 2010 to Congress and relevant government officials. The Denali Commission will provide a report on climate adaptation research to Congress and the Governor of Alaska. Authorization of appropriations for the American Arctic Adaptation Grant Program and research in the amount of $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2010."
