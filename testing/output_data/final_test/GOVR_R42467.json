    "content": "This report examines legislative options to finance water infrastructure for building and upgrading wastewater and drinking water treatment systems to meet federal requirements. Congress is debating whether the federal government should provide assistance for water projects, with funding needs estimated at $655 billion over 20 years. Some stakeholders argue that the estimates are too low. The estimated funding needs for water infrastructure projects may not fully reflect all types of projects currently ineligible for federal assistance, such as repair and replacement of aging systems, security-related projects, on-site treatment systems in small communities, and mixed element projects. Various groups have estimated larger investment needs, with the American Water Works Association estimating over $1 trillion for buried drinking water infrastructure over the next 25 years. Defining \"need\" in this context is complex due to differences in purpose, criteria, and timing, leading to disagreements on what constitutes a funding need. In the infrastructure context, funding needs estimates aim to identify the required investment level for quality services. Disagreements arise between engineers and economists on determining the optimal public capital stock. Communities face challenges in providing reliable water infrastructure services, with Congress exploring solutions. Capital investments are essential for maintaining high-quality water and wastewater services, protecting public health and the environment. Capital facilities for water and wastewater utilities are primarily debt-financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds. In 2014, $34 billion in bonds were issued for water, sewer, and sanitation projects. Federal assistance and public-private partnerships provide limited capital financing options. This report discusses financing options for water infrastructure, including public-private partnerships (P3s) that involve private-sector investment. Various policy options are analyzed to address funding gaps and encourage private participation in water projects. This report analyzes policy options for financing water infrastructure, including increasing funding for State Revolving Fund programs, creating a Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Program, and establishing a federal water infrastructure trust fund. Establish a federal water infrastructure trust fund to provide dedicated funding. Create a national infrastructure bank for low-interest loans and credit assistance. Remove restrictions on private activity bonds for water projects and reinstate Build America Bonds for lower borrowing costs. The 112th Congress examined various financing options for capital projects with lower borrowing costs. The WIFIA pilot program was enacted during the 113th Congress. Interest in alternative financing options persists due to concerns about repairing aging infrastructure and recent events like the water crisis in Flint, MI. The SRF programs are a key federal source of financial assistance for municipal water projects. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) program, established in 1987, provides seed money to states for wastewater and drinking water treatment projects. SRFs are supported in all 50 states, offering low-interest loans and other financial assistance for infrastructure improvements. States have flexibility in project selection, with familiar operations and procedures. The program is well-established and widely supported. The State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs offer low-interest loans for various projects, including wastewater and drinking water treatment. Administered by the EPA at the federal level, states implement the programs, allowing for leveraging of limited funds. This leveraging can result in the construction of more projects over a 20-year period compared to one-time grants. By using leveraging techniques, states can secure bonds and increase loan funding beyond federal grants. The State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs provide funding that exceeds federal capitalization grants, with leveraged bonds and state contributions making up 52% of total investment. While federal appropriations are fully scored against the budget, SRFs are considered loans repaid to states for water infrastructure projects. Despite their success in addressing water quality issues, concerns have been raised about the preference for grants over loans in some communities. Congress has responded to the cost burden per customer of capital projects in small, rural, and disadvantaged communities by providing earmarked grants and authorizing a separate grant program for \"wet weather\" projects under the Clean Water Act. Recent appropriations acts specify that states must use a portion of capitalization grants to provide subsidy through principal forgiveness, negative interest loans, or grants. Critics argue that this diminishes the state's loan fund corpus. The state's loan fund is partially subsidized and not fully repaid, leading to a diminished capacity for future loans. Some stakeholders argue that the SRF programs favor small and medium communities over large cities, as assistance to individual projects is often limited to $20 million. States establish their own criteria for selecting projects, with some potentially adopting dollar limits to extend aid to more communities. The Clean Water Act restricts SRF assistance to public entities, but there are proposals to allow private utilities to receive federal aid. In 2014, amendments were made to allow privately owned projects to be eligible for SRF assistance for certain types of projects. Some argue that this could provide windfalls to private companies. Some criticize Congress for imposing restrictions on states' use of SRF capitalization grants for projects beyond clean and safe water, such as Buy America or Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements. Concerns also arise due to federal capitalization grants being subject to appropriations, which have been flat or declining for over a decade. The President's budget requests for SRF programs have been decreasing in recent years due to deficit reduction pressures and spending caps imposed by various legislative acts. This has made securing SRF appropriations more challenging. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented spending caps starting in FY2012, aiming to reduce the deficit by $2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. These caps limit annual spending through appropriations and trigger automatic spending cuts (sequestration) if breached. The BCA also requires enforcement if spending levels exceed the caps. The Budget Control Act (BCA) implemented spending caps to reduce the deficit by $2 trillion over FY2012-FY2021. If the cap levels are breached, sequestration follows, triggering automatic spending cuts. The BCA established an enforcement process in case a special joint committee failed to reach an agreement on spending reductions. The failure of the \"Super Committee\" in 2011 led to a $1.2 trillion automatic spending reduction process starting in January 2013 through FY2021. Subsequent legislation modified the process, easing required reductions in defense and nondefense spending but extending mandatory sequestration through FY2025. Some discretionary programs are exempt, but the SRF programs are not. Some discretionary programs are exempt from sequester, but the SRF programs are not. Congress debates maintaining spending cuts and increasing or reducing discretionary spending caps. Despite support for more SRF spending, Congress faces competing needs and difficult choices. Authorization for clean water SRF grants expired in FY1994 and for drinking water SRF grants in FY2003. Congress has addressed water infrastructure funding issues. In 2014, Congress enacted amendments to Title VI of the CWA, expanding eligible projects for SRF assistance and imposing \"Buy America\" requirements. However, appropriations for clean water and drinking water SRF capitalization grants have not been reauthorized. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to reauthorize capitalization grants for both programs, with proposed funding of $34.9 billion over five years for the CWA program. The legislation aimed to provide $34.9 billion over five years for the CWA program and $21.2 billion over five years for the SDWA program. Bills introduced in the House proposed funding increases for the SRF programs. Congressional committees typically score legislation for its financial impact. Enacting legislation that authorizes future discretionary appropriations does not directly impact federal deficits or surpluses. Any subsequent appropriations would be subject to spending limits. This type of legislation would not increase the federal deficit projection or trigger pay-as-you-go rules. Authorizing legislation affecting direct spending or federal revenues is subject to budgetary rules. Direct spending provided in authorizing laws continues without annual legislative action and includes programs like Medicare. CBO's report on H.R. 1262 in the 111th Congress provides insight on how reauthorizing SRF capitalization grants would be scored. Certain provisions in the bill would impact direct spending and revenues. H.R. 1262 would increase funds for clean water SRF, leading to states issuing more tax-exempt bonds for water projects. This would reduce federal revenue by $700 million over 10 years. To offset this, the bill included increased duties on vessels from foreign ports. If states increase leveraging, more offsetting receipts may be needed in future legislation. The 113th Congress enacted legislation to create a pilot Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program, modeled after the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Program. TIFIA provides federal credit assistance for transportation projects, while WIFIA aims to support investment in water infrastructure. The TIFIA program offers up to 49% of project costs in secured loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit for transportation projects costing at least $50 million. Funding for TIFIA increased under MAP-21 but was reduced under the FAST Act, with annual amounts ranging from $275 million to $300 million. Assistance is provided based on project eligibility criteria. The TIFIA program provides assistance based on project eligibility criteria, including creditworthiness and meeting planning and environmental requirements. Projects must have investment-grade ratings for senior debt obligations and federal credit instruments. TIFIA assistance aims to foster public-private partnerships, expedite project timelines, and reduce reliance on federal grant funding. Since 1998, TIFIA has supported 65 projects with direct loans ranging from $42 million to $1.9 billion, totaling $25.7 billion in credit assistance. The TIFIA program provides credit assistance totaling $25.7 billion for 65 projects since 1998. TIFIA typically fills a gap in larger financial packages, sometimes involving private equity and debt. The 113th Congress included a WIFIA pilot program in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. EPA was authorized to provide credit assistance under the five-year WIFIA pilot program. The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers were authorized to provide credit assistance for water projects under a five-year WIFIA pilot program. Each agency had a total of $175 million over five years to provide assistance for projects costing $20 million or more, with exceptions for rural areas. Eligible activities included project development, planning, construction, real property acquisition, and carrying costs during construction. EPA's assistance covered wastewater projects. The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provide credit assistance for water projects under a WIFIA pilot program. Eligible projects include wastewater treatment, community drinking water facilities, energy efficiency enhancements, repair of aging systems, desalination, and water recycling. Eligibility is based on creditworthiness and dedicated revenue sources. Selection criteria consider project significance, financing sources, innovation, budget authority, and service to energy development regions. The TIFIA program provides credit assistance for transportation projects, with the subsidy cost determining the amount of money available to project sponsors. Proponents of WIFIA argue that water projects may have lower subsidy costs and higher credit assistance due to established repayment mechanisms like water rates. The Office of Management and Budget will establish subsidy rates for the WIFIA program, with individual rates determined for each approved project. Repayment of WIFIA loans is not guaranteed, similar to recent issues with borrowing and bond repayments in some communities. TIFIA program offers low-cost capital with flexible repayment terms, and WIFIA legislation aims to provide similar benefits. The WIFIA legislation aims to provide benefits similar to the TIFIA program by offering low-cost capital with flexible repayment terms. There is debate over potential adverse impacts on funds for the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act SRF programs, with concerns that WIFIA could result in reduced spending on these programs. States are worried that WIFIA funding could come at the expense of SRF programs, which are currently capitalized by federal appropriations. The WIFIA program is debated for its potential impact on SRF programs, with concerns about reduced funding. P.L. 113-121 gives state authorities the right to provide SRF funds before WIFIA assistance. Supporters believe WIFIA offers benefits similar to TIFIA, limiting federal exposure to default. The Congressional Budget Office argues that the federal government underestimates the cost of credit assistance programs like TIFIA by excluding the cost of market risk. This is due to the FCRA requiring present value calculations using risk-free Treasury securities interest rates, unlike private institutions that use risk-adjusted rates. The WIFIA program raised budgetary concerns with an estimated cost of $260 million over five years and potential revenue loss to the U.S. Treasury. Pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the bill. The CBO estimated that the bill would reduce revenues by $135 million over 10 years due to states issuing tax-exempt bonds for additional funds not covered by WIFIA assistance. To address this, a provision was added to prohibit recipients from using tax-exempt bonds for non-WIFIA project costs. This change would make the WIFIA program less attractive, resulting in a $200 million cost reduction over five years without impacting revenues. The 2015 surface transportation legislation, the FAST Act (P.L. 114-94), repealed the tax-exempt bond financing restriction on WIFIA assistance, which was widely criticized for making it difficult to finance projects. This change addressed concerns about potential revenue loss and allowed for the implementation of WIFIA project loans after a two-year delay. The enactment of the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 114-254) in December 2016 allowed for the first appropriation of funds to cover the subsidy cost of the WIFIA program, enabling the EPA to begin making project loans. The legislation appropriated $20 million to EPA for loans, with $3 million allocated for administrative purposes. EPA can now subsidize up to $2.1 billion in WIFIA assistance, with the first loans expected in 2017. Congress has not yet provided funds for the Army Corps to start WIFIA loans under the 2014 statute. Despite the delay in implementation, interest in using WIFIA as a model for other infrastructure financing programs is evident. Interest in using WIFIA as a model for other infrastructure financing programs is evident, with legislative proposals in the 114th Congress for water reclamation and reuse projects. These proposals, known as \"Reclamation for WIFIA\" (RIFIA), were included in various bills but none were enacted. Proposals to create a federal water infrastructure trust fund, similar to existing mechanisms for other infrastructure types, have been suggested to address criticisms of SRF programs. A trust fund supported by dedicated revenues is proposed to provide long-term financing for water infrastructure projects without impacting the federal deficit. Legislation in 1993 aimed to create a fund generating $6 billion annually through user fees and excise taxes. The critical issue is establishing a dedicated revenue stream for infrastructure financing. In 1996, EPA and GAO reports assessed alternative financing options for water infrastructure, including a trust fund. Legislation like H.R. 4468, H.R. 5313, and S. 2848 in the 114th Congress have been introduced to create a dedicated revenue source for water projects. Proponents argue that these proposals would be deficit-neutral. Proposals for a clean water trust fund aim to provide deficit-neutral funding for water infrastructure projects. Key issues include administration, funding sources, types of financial assistance, and eligible activities. Generating revenue for the fund is a challenging aspect due to the lack of a clear basis for charging users. Proposals for a clean water trust fund face challenges in defining funding sources, such as excise taxes on various products or activities. Previous revenue options include taxes on beverages, pharmaceuticals, and industrial discharge, as well as fees on pollutants. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 4468 and S. 2848 suggested funding through voluntary product labeling, with businesses contributing $0.03 per labeled unit to the trust fund. In the 114th Congress, proposals were made for a clean water trust fund, with funding sources including excise taxes on products or activities. H.R. 5313 aimed to establish a water infrastructure trust fund for CWA and SDWA SRF programs, with funding from ending deferral on income taxes on offshore corporate profits. This change to the Internal Revenue Code was projected to generate over $60 billion per year, with a significant portion dedicated to public water and sewer infrastructure systems. Creating a clean water trust fund involves resolving policy issues on revenue collection, ensuring dedicated funds are spent on water infrastructure, and navigating budget rules to prevent spending reductions by Congress. Accomplishing the fund's objectives requires complex steps to classify revenue in the budget, prevent unauthorized spending, and comply with congressional budget rules. To ensure funding for infrastructure trust funds, Congress has implemented mechanisms to prevent spending reductions and comply with budget rules like PAYGO and discretionary spending caps. Legislation since 2000 has included provisions guaranteeing the use of trust fund receipts, with restrictions on the amount available each fiscal year. House rules have also created funding guarantees for transportation activities within specific categories. The House rules have been amended to prevent spending reductions in highway and mass transit categories, ensuring that trust fund revenues are spent fully. However, broader budget policy goals or spending priorities can still override these guarantees. Creating a separate budget category may be a solution to protect spending. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 created a separate budget category for water infrastructure programs to prevent offsetting increased spending elsewhere. Another idea is the creation of a national infrastructure bank to improve the nation's investment in infrastructure. A national infrastructure bank could help finance infrastructure projects in various sectors like energy, water, telecommunications, and transportation. It would offer favorable financing terms to encourage investment in large projects with regional or national benefits. The Congressional Budget Office has noted that a national infrastructure bank may not be the most cost-effective option for financing projects. There is uncertainty about whether favorable financing terms from a national infrastructure bank would increase overall infrastructure investment. Infrastructure banks could attract private capital from sources like pension funds and international investors who may not be interested in traditional project finance methods. A national infrastructure bank could potentially improve project selection by focusing on economic analyses of costs and benefits, rather than factors like geographic equity and political favoritism. However, there are concerns that additional investment in infrastructure through a national infrastructure bank may draw funds away from existing investments. Some possible disadvantages of an infrastructure bank include directing financing to financially viable projects over those with greater social benefits, excluding small urban and rural areas, and shifting decision-making from state and local levels to the federal level. A national infrastructure bank could help accelerate large projects by taking on more financial risk, especially for those too big for state funding sources. Even with grants, bonds, and private equity, mega-projects often require additional funding. The bank could bridge the gap between construction and revenue generation, but it may take years to become fully operational. One advantage is the potential to attract significant nonfederal investment with a relatively small federal budget. An infrastructure bank could provide $100 billion of credit assistance with a $10 billion appropriation, supporting large projects that current mechanisms cannot finance. It may compete with energy, transportation, and telecommunications projects, similar to the existing TIFIA program. The creation of a national infrastructure bank or bank-like entity has been proposed in recent Congresses, with bills including water and wastewater facilities as eligible projects. Examples include the Partnership to Build America Act, Infrastructure 2.0 Act, BRIDGE Act, National Infrastructure Development Bank Act, and Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! Act. The Obama Administration also included an infrastructure bank proposal in its FY2017 budget, with some bills aiming to establish a government corporation called the American Infrastructure Fund. A government corporation called the American Infrastructure Fund (AIF) would provide bond guarantees, loans, and equity investments for infrastructure projects. It would be capitalized with $50 billion in American Infrastructure Bonds and leverage funds at a 15:1 ratio to provide up to $750 billion in assistance. The proposed BRIDGE Act, S. 1589, aimed to establish the AIF. The BRIDGE Act, S. 1589, proposed the establishment of a government-owned Infrastructure Financing Authority (IFA) to facilitate investments in transportation, water, and energy infrastructure projects. The authority would provide loans and loan guarantees, with initial seed funding of up to $10 billion to incentivize private-sector investment. Projects funded by IFA would be at least $50 million in size, or $10 million in rural areas, with funding limited to 49% of project costs. A similar bill, H.R. 3555, proposed the creation of the American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA) as a wholly owned government corporation. The American Infrastructure Financing Authority (AIFA) would be governed by seven presidentially appointed board members and authorized to provide loans and loan guarantees for transportation, water, and energy infrastructure projects costing at least $100 million or $25 million in rural areas. The bank would be capitalized with a $10 billion appropriation. H.R. 3337 and S. 268 proposed the creation of a National Infrastructure Development Bank (NIDB) with similar functions, funded by Congress with $5 billion annually for five years. The National Infrastructure Bank (NIB) would be capitalized by Congress with $5 billion annually for five years. Projects would be evaluated based on maximizing private investment while providing public benefit. The NIB would provide direct and guaranteed loans for transportation, water, and energy infrastructure projects, with interest rates indexed to U.S. Treasury rates and maturity up to 35 years. It would finance up to 50% of project costs, requiring $167 million initially to cover subsidy costs and administrative expenses. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed a new federal credit program within the Treasury Department to provide direct loans to infrastructure projects developed through public-private partnerships (P3). Eligible projects included water, transportation, energy, and broadband sectors, as well as certain social infrastructure. The program aimed to provide $15 billion in direct loans over 10 years with no cost to taxpayers, reducing the financing cost gap between P3s and traditional project procurement. Water infrastructure can be owned and operated by the private sector, a governmental entity, or through a partnership between the two. This partnership could involve private entities investing in water infrastructure and receiving a market rate of return. One option for greater federal involvement includes expanding tax-exempt financing to private entities, such as through private activity bonds (PABs). Expanding tax-exempt financing to private entities, like through PABs, allows privately owned water facilities to issue qualified tax-exempt bonds if operated by a governmental unit or approved by a political subdivision. Most qualified PABs are subject to a state volume limit, with the total volume cap for all states in 2016 set at $32.5 billion. This helps lower borrowing costs for state and local governments. Tax-exempt bonds provide lower borrowing costs for state and local governments through a federal tax exemption on interest income for investors. The federal tax expenditure for water, sewage, and hazardous waste disposal facilities was estimated to be $3.1 billion over the 2016 to 2020 budget window and $7.7 billion between 2016 and 2025. The private activity bond volume limit was established in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 to address concerns about tax-exempt bonds financing private activities. The limit and qualified activities were later modified under the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 modified tax-exempt bonds for private activities due to concerns about inefficient capital allocation, increased financing costs for governmental activities, tax avoidance by higher-income individuals, and federal revenue losses. This inefficiency arises from diverting investment from public projects to tax-favored private activities. The greater volume of tax-exempt private activity bonds leads to higher financing costs for traditional government activities. Issuers must raise interest rates to attract investors, making borrowing more expensive. Tax-exempt interest benefits higher-income taxpayers, raising questions about the efficacy of using tax-exempt bonds for federal subsidies. The tax benefit from tax-exempt bonds primarily benefits higher-income taxpayers, leading to a less progressive income tax system and expanding the deficit. This deficit can result in higher interest rates as the government competes for investment dollars, increasing the cost of debt-financed projects. Proposals suggest relaxing restrictions on private entities' access to tax-exempt bond financing for water infrastructure projects, but the impact on new investments remains uncertain due to unclear demand for such projects. Estimates show low demand for using PAB capacity for water infrastructure projects. In 2011, only 1% of new money long-term, tax-exempt PABs were issued for water facilities. California and Texas accounted for a significant portion of new money issuance in 2010. In 2010, $792 million of the $2.7 billion in new money issuance was for water, sewer, and solid waste projects. The average PAB new money amount for these projects was $57.8 million, higher than the average for all eligible bond purposes. Private entities like American Water also invest in water infrastructure, with American Water investing $1 billion in 2014. American Water invested $1 billion in water infrastructure capital in 2014 and plans to invest $6.0 billion through 2019. Private entities like American Water use a mix of revenue and debt, including PABs, to finance capital spending. The President's FY2017 budget proposed eliminating the volume cap for PABs for water infrastructure, creating a new category of tax-exempt bonds called QPIBs. Treasury estimated this proposal would increase the federal deficit by $4.9 billion between 2017 and 2026. The proposal to exclude water infrastructure from the volume cap may increase investment in water infrastructure, but it is unclear if it would lead to substantially new projects or just a shift in financing tools. The expanded use of PABs could potentially not achieve the intended policy objective of increasing investment in water infrastructure. In 2011, $2.2 billion in tax-exempt PAB issuance was used for water, sewage, and waste disposal facilities, while $28 billion in governmental bonds were issued for similar projects. Government provision of water infrastructure may be preferred due to market conditions or public preference. BABs, created in 2009, could be expanded for federal assistance in water infrastructure investment. BABs, unlike Private Activity Bonds, could have been issued for any purpose eligible for traditional tax-exempt bond financing except private activity bonds. The authority to issue BABs expired in 2010, and they were modeled after the taxable bond option proposed in the late 1960s. The purpose of BABs was to improve financial market efficiency and reduce inequity in the income tax system resulting from tax-exempt municipal bonds. The Build America Bonds (BAB) program aimed to reduce interest costs on municipal borrowings by offering a credit equal to 35% of the interest rate. It tapped into a broader market for investors and allowed state and local governments to save an estimated $20 billion in borrowing costs. The program expired in 2010. The Build America Bonds (BAB) program offered savings compared to traditional tax-exempt bonds by providing a credit equal to 35% of the interest rate. Extending BABs to privately owned water infrastructure could avoid disadvantages of PABs. The President's FY2017 budget proposed a streamlined tax compliance framework for BABs. H.R. 2676 in the 114th Congress aimed to extend and expand a modified version of BABs. H.R. 2676 introduced America Fast Forward Bonds as an alternative to tax-exempt bonds with a 28% credit rate. The proposal aimed to increase federal deficit by $71 billion over 10 years but was intended to be revenue neutral. CBO noted that BABs' interest subsidy would be recorded as outlays in the federal budget. The program to increase taxable interest income through bonds would raise federal outlays by $70 billion over 10 years and increase revenues by $63 billion, resulting in a net deficit increase of $7 billion. Stakeholders agree on the need for more investment in water infrastructure, with various options proposed to expand financing tools for projects. There is no consensus on a preferred option, but a combination of approaches is advocated. The need for increased investment in water infrastructure is acknowledged, with various financing options proposed. While no single method can fully address the financing gap, tools like WIFIA and SRF programs are seen as beneficial in different community settings. The Obama Administration supported SRF programs, the new WIFIA program, and advocated for excluding water infrastructure PABs from state volume caps."
