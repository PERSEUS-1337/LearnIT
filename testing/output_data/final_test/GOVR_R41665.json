    "content": "In 2009, 16.7% of the U.S. population, or 50.7 million people, had no health insurance, the highest rate in the past decade. Uninsured individuals are more likely to forgo needed healthcare and have worse health outcomes than the insured. Adults between 19 and 25, Hispanics, those with low incomes, and those with weak labor force attachments were among the most likely to be uninsured. This report analyzes the health insurance status of individuals in 2009 using data from the 2010 Current Population Survey. It examines the relationship between types of health insurance and individual characteristics, compares different analyses of uninsurance data, and discusses trends in uninsurance since 1999. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the CPS collects employment data, health insurance status, income, and poverty information. It is also known as the March Supplement and surveys about 100,000 addresses in March to represent all households in the nation. The key variable is whether each person was uninsured in 2009, measuring lack of health insurance on any one day that year. The March Supplement is a popular source for estimating levels of uninsurance in the United States. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the CPS collects data on employment, health insurance status, income, and poverty. It is a key source for estimating levels of uninsurance in the United States. Other data sources include the American Community Survey (ACS), the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The data from ACS and CPS show similar results. The relationship between health insurance and demographic characteristics is analyzed, with age being a key factor. In 2009, individuals under age five had the highest rates of coverage in Medicaid, CHIP, or other public programs, while young adults aged 19 to 25 had lower coverage rates. In 2009, young adults aged 19 to 25 had the highest rate of being uninsured at 32.7%, with half covered under employment-based plans. Among those aged 65 and older, 93.5% were covered by Medicare, and less than 2% were uninsured. Whites had the lowest uninsured rate at 14.0%, while Hispanics had the highest at 33.9%. The focus is on the nonelderly population due to high insurance rates among the elderly. In 2009, young adults aged 19 to 25 had the highest uninsured rate at 32.7%, with half covered by employment-based plans. Whites had the lowest uninsured rate at 14.0%, while Hispanics had the highest at 33.9%. Employment-based health coverage was highest among whites and Asians, while public coverage was highest among blacks. Family types also influenced insurance patterns, with two-parent families having the highest employment-based coverage and lowest uninsured rate. Among individuals under 65, those in the Northeast or Midwest were less likely to be uninsured (14.2% and 15.1%) compared to those in the South or West (22.3% and 20.3%). Income level strongly predicted insurance status, with 12.1% of those with family incomes at least two times the poverty threshold being uninsured, compared to 34.0% of the poor. Family type also played a role, with single mothers most likely to have public coverage (43.9%) and single fathers or single men living alone most likely to be uninsured. In 2009, health insurance coverage for individuals under 65 varied based on employment characteristics. Those with family incomes below the poverty threshold had low employment-based coverage (15.6%) and higher public coverage (49.5%). Noncitizens had higher uninsured rates (48.0%) and lower employment-based coverage rates (34.5%) than native-born U.S. citizens. Family members were less likely to be uninsured as the primary worker's firm size increased. In 2009, family members were less likely to be uninsured as the primary worker's firm size increased. Larger firms had lower costs for health insurance benefits, spreading risks and reducing administration costs. Family members with a primary worker employed full-time for a full year were half as likely to be uninsured compared to those employed part-time. In 2009, family members were less likely to be uninsured as the primary worker's firm size increased. Larger firms had lower costs for health insurance benefits. Those who worked part-time in 2009 were even more likely to be uninsured. It is important to choose an appropriate comparison group when evaluating groups of uninsured individuals. Different representations of the same data can lead to different conclusions. Figure 1 shows the percentage of uninsured individuals by citizenship status, with native-born citizens making up the majority. In 2009, family members were less likely to be uninsured as the primary worker's firm size increased. Larger firms had lower costs for health insurance benefits. Those who worked part-time in 2009 were even more likely to be uninsured. Different representations of the same data can lead to different conclusions. About 20% of the uninsured are not citizens, with the remaining 5% being naturalized citizens. Comparisons of uninsured individuals by citizenship status are illustrated in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4. Figure 2 shows that about 84% of native-born citizens are insured, while 16% are uninsured. Figure 1 shows noncitizens as the smallest citizenship group of the uninsured, while Figure 3 reveals that almost half of noncitizens are uninsured. Uninsured naturalized citizens make up 5.8% of the uninsured but 16.1% of all naturalized citizens, creating a paradox where the group least likely to be uninsured comprises the largest portion of the uninsured. This discrepancy arises from the fact that native-born citizens, who represent the largest share of the population, do not necessarily have the highest uninsurance rate compared to noncitizens. The difference between uninsured citizens and non-citizens raises policy challenges. Proposals targeting the majority of uninsured citizens may not impact the majority of uninsured non-citizens. Probability of being uninsured varies among demographic groups, with blacks more likely to be uninsured than whites. Race is a key factor in measuring the probability of uninsurance. The comparison across groups measures the probability of uninsurance based on race and age. Representative individuals, identical in most variables but differing in race, were compared for likelihood of being uninsured. Figure 5 shows the differences in uninsurance probabilities across races for individuals with similar characteristics. For example, a 40-year-old, native-born citizen in the Northeast with a spouse and children faced a 10.8% probability of being uninsured. The likelihood of uninsurance based on race and age was compared, showing that blacks are more likely to be uninsured than whites. When comparing individuals with similar characteristics, blacks are 2.7 percentage points more likely to be uninsured than whites. Figure 6 illustrates the likelihood of white, black, and Hispanic individuals being uninsured at different ages. The likelihood of being uninsured based on race and age was compared, showing that blacks are more likely to be uninsured than whites. Black, Hispanic individuals uninsured in 2009 at every age between birth and age 64. Uninsurance profiles have the same shape, with the likelihood of being uninsured increasing from age 12 through the twenties, then decreasing in the thirties. Uninsurance rate approaches zero after age 65 due to Medicare coverage. The percentage of people without health insurance fluctuates over time, as shown in Figure 7 using data from published CPS documents. Economic recessions can impact the uninsured rate, with job losses leading to an increase in uninsurance. However, eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP during downturns can decrease the uninsured rate if individuals enroll in these programs. During economic recessions, job losses can increase the uninsured rate. However, enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP by newly eligible individuals may decrease the uninsurance rate. Data shows that the uninsurance rate rose during the early 2000s and late 2000s recessions, peaking at 16.7% in 2009."
