    "content": "Since the 1990s, Congress has played a significant role in U.S. policymaking towards the Palestinians, supporting a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and providing assistance to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Over $5 billion in bilateral aid has been committed to the Palestinians since the signing of the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles in 1993. Palestinians seek to establish an independent state in historic Palestine. The Palestinian national goal is to establish an independent state in historic Palestine. Fatah and Hamas are the largest Palestinian political movements, with differing views on achieving this goal - Fatah seeks nonviolent means through negotiations and diplomacy, while Hamas maintains violence as an option. Additionally, there is a divide between those favoring a secular model of governance (Fatah) and those calling for a society with Islamic principles (Hamas). The differences between Fatah and Hamas are reflected in Palestinian governance, with Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in control of Gaza. International diplomacy to resolve Israeli-Palestinian disputes has stalled, with many Palestinians criticizing U.S. policy for favoring Israel and lacking sensitivity to internal political rivalries. Arab states, preoccupied with domestic and regional concerns since 2011, have shifted focus away from championing the Palestinian cause. Arab states have shifted focus from the Palestinian cause to build ties with Israel due to shared concerns about Iran. Abbas seeks international support for Palestinian aspirations as negotiations with Israel stall. Some advocate for a one-state solution, but a majority of Palestinians support a two-state solution. The Palestinian issue is significant globally, involving various countries and nonstate actors. The Trump Administration's tense relations with the PLO have led to funding reductions and the closure of the PLO office. This issue has been provocative internationally for over 70 years. In September 2018, the Trump Administration announced the closure of the PLO's representative office in Washington, DC. The PLO filed a case with the ICJ to have the US remove its embassy from Jerusalem based on the Vienna Convention. The US consulate general in Jerusalem merged into the embassy, impacting ties with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. President Trump expressed support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Trump Administration aims for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and plans to release a peace plan in the next few months. They are confident that Palestinians will eventually engage in negotiations based on US proposals, discarding past diplomatic frameworks. Jared Kushner emphasizes dealing with current realities without fear. The Trump Administration is confident in achieving peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by dealing with current realities without fear. However, President Abbas and other PLO/PA officials have not shown willingness to resume contacts with the Administration, focusing instead on rallying support for Palestinians internationally. 62% of Palestinians oppose resuming dialogue with the Trump Administration. In 2018, the Trump Administration decided to close the PLO's office in Washington, DC, which had served as a focal point for U.S.-Palestinian relations since the 1990s. Despite previous waivers, the PLO did not take steps to advance peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The PLO office in Washington will close due to lack of progress in peace negotiations with Israel and refusal to engage with the U.S. government. This decision aligns with concerns about Palestinian actions at the International Criminal Court. The U.S. emphasizes the importance of direct negotiations for achieving peace and is committed to ongoing efforts for a comprehensive peace agreement. The U.S. is not retreating from peace efforts, suggesting the PLO office could reopen if Palestinians advance peace. Secretary Pompeo announced the merger of the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem and the U.S. embassy, driven by efficiency, without changing U.S. policy on Jerusalem, the West Bank, or Gaza. The U.S. maintains no position on final status issues, including boundaries, subject to negotiations between parties. The United States announced the merger of the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem with the U.S. embassy, maintaining no change in policy on Jerusalem, the West Bank, or Gaza. The new Palestinian Affairs Unit will operate from the former consulate general building, with no specific timeline for the merger yet. Many view the merger of the U.S. consulate general in Jerusalem with the embassy as a downgrade in U.S. relations with Palestinians. Critics argue it goes against Palestinian aspirations for a capital in East Jerusalem and will hinder diplomatic reporting. Congressional actions, like the Taylor Force Act, have also impacted U.S. relations with Palestinians. The Taylor Force Act, passed in March 2018, placed conditions on U.S. funding for Palestinians. Congress may consider various issues related to U.S.-Palestinian relations, Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, humanitarian concerns in Gaza, countering terrorism from Hamas, regional effects on the West Bank and Gaza, and Palestinian leadership. Approximately 4.82 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Approximately 4.82 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem\u20142.94 million in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and 1.88 million in Gaza. Over 2 million are registered as refugees or descendants from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Additionally, around 593,000 Jewish Israeli citizens reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians in the West Bank are wealthier, better educated, and more secular compared to those in Gaza. The population is predominantly Sunni Muslim, with a 1% Christian minority. Abbas is considered the leader of the Palestinian national movement, despite Hamas's control over Gaza. He played a key role in the peace process and succeeded Arafat as chairman of the PLO and PA president. His presidency has been marked by significant events such as Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Hamas's electoral victory and takeover of Gaza. Abbas's leadership in the Palestinian national movement has faced challenges, including the Hamas takeover of Gaza in June 2007. His rule has been criticized for becoming more authoritarian and corrupt, leading to calls for his resignation. Hamas, a rival to Fatah, is a focus for Israel and the United States in countering its influence. Hamas, a Palestinian nationalist group with Islamic fundamentalist ideology, aims for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in historic Palestine. Updated in 2017, Hamas expressed willingness to accept a Palestinian state within 1948-1967 armistice lines. It has strong influence in Gaza, presence in the West Bank and Arab countries, with an opaque leadership structure. Hamas's leadership structure is opaque, with overall policy guidance from a Shura Council. Ismail Haniyeh leads the political bureau, Yahya Sinwar leads in Gaza, and Muhammad Deif leads the military wing. They have been designated as Global Terrorists by the Treasury Department. Yahya Sinwar, leader of Hamas in Gaza, has gained prominence in 2018. He has expressed a desire for a cease-fire with Israel in exchange for lifting the access restrictions on Gaza. Hamas may prefer a long-term cease-fire over losing control of Gaza through conflict or unity agreements. Reports of B. Abbas's declining health have sparked speculation about his successor in the PLO and PA leadership. Potential successors include Marwan Barghouti, Muhammad Dahlan, Majid Faraj, Saeb Erekat, and Salam Fayyad, each with their own strengths and connections. If Abbas were to leave office, the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council (currently Aziz Dweik, a member of Hamas) would take over duties as president for a period not to exceed 60 days, by which time elections for a more permanent successor are supposed to take place. Hamas could potentially increase its influence during a succession process if power is not concentrated around non-Hamas figures. Hamas members may run in future presidential elections. The Palestinian Legislative Council has not been in session since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. Abbas's term was supposed to be four years, with elections planned for 2009. However, the split between Abbas-led PA and Hamas has postponed elections indefinitely. The PLO's Central Council voted to extend Abbas's term until elections can be held, potentially leading to PLO action in selecting a successor if elections are not held promptly. The Palestinian National Authority (PA) was granted limited rule under Israeli occupational authority in the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank in the mid-1990s, pursuant to the Oslo agreements. The PA is organized like a state with executive, legislative, and judicial organs of governance, as well as security forces. Ramallah is its de facto seat, but Jerusalem is considered the PA capital by Palestinian political consensus. A successor to Abbas as PA president may be selected if elections are not held promptly after he leaves office. The Palestinian National Authority (PA) is organized like a state with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The PA administers Palestinian areas in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem. The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) is the PA's legislature, while the judicial branch includes high courts and security courts. The PA's electoral base consists of Palestinians from these areas. The PLO may restructure or dissolve the PA, claiming it is a constitutional creation of PLO agreements with Israel. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers conduct arrest operations in the West Bank to apprehend wanted Palestinians and protect Jewish settlers. They sometimes expropriate land and dispossess Palestinians. Coordination with Palestinian Authority (PA) is discreet due to political sensitivity. In 2002, during the second intifada, Israel reoccupied PA-controlled areas in Operation Defensive Shield, demolishing official PA buildings. Since 2007, there have been signs of progress in PA security capabilities and West Bank economic development. However, without a broader political solution with Israel, the sustainability of this progress is uncertain. Hamas's control of Gaza poses a challenge for the Abbas-led PA, Israel, and the international community in establishing lasting political-security stability. The international community struggles to establish a political-security framework for Gaza that benefits the population without empowering Hamas. Potential solutions include political reunification with the West Bank, easing access restrictions, and a Hamas-Israel cease-fire. The future of West Bank-Gaza unity hinges on Hamas relinquishing security control to the PA, but tensions persist following a bombing targeting the PA Prime Minister in Gaza. Since Hamas's 2007 takeover of Gaza, Israeli and Egyptian authorities have maintained strict control over Gaza's border crossings, justifying restrictions to deny Hamas materials for military capabilities. These restrictions also impact commerce, the economy, and humanitarian assistance. Since Hamas's 2007 takeover of Gaza, Israeli and Egyptian authorities have imposed strict control over Gaza's border crossings, affecting commerce, the economy, and humanitarian assistance. Despite efforts to smuggle goods through tunnels from Egypt, disruptions have occurred since Egypt's military regained control in 2013. Concerns persist about the living conditions in Gaza leading to radicalization and potential violence against Israel. Israel disputes its legal responsibility for Gaza's residents, citing its control over borders, airspace, and maritime access. UNRWA and other organizations provide aid within limited parameters. The economy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip faces structural difficulties, with Gaza's situation being significantly worse. Palestinians heavily rely on ties to Israel's economy, which accounts for a large portion of their trade. The Palestinian Authority struggles to be self-sufficient and depends on foreign aid due to annual budget deficits. Israel enforces strict controls that limit Palestinians' ability to develop external ties. The Palestinian Authority heavily relies on foreign assistance to cover its annual budget deficit of over $1 billion. The PA's bloated payroll, domestic corruption, and lack of private sector employment opportunities contribute to its financial challenges. The second intifada in 2000 further limited Palestinians' access to jobs and goods in Israel. Israel controls security at crossing points and unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. Palestinians seek alternatives to dependence on Israel's economy, such as attracting investment, economic integration with Egypt and Jordan, or relying on external assistance. To become self-sufficient, the West Bank and Gaza need to reduce political and security uncertainties and Israeli restrictions on movement of goods, people, and capital. The movement of goods, people, and capital between Israel and Palestine needs to be reduced, with donors occasionally providing emergency funding. Palestinian existence is closely connected to Israel, which controls the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israelis and Palestinians compete for advantages within regional and international foreign policy frameworks. Gaza presents complex challenges. Gaza's challenges stem from the involvement of Hamas, Israel, the PA, and external actors, impacting security, politics, and humanitarian issues. Conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza has persisted, with efforts to improve conditions and prevent rearmament falling short. The threat to Israel from Gaza-based militants has evolved over time. The threat to Israel from Gaza-based militants has evolved over time, with the Iron Dome defense system decreasing the projectile threat. Efforts to neutralize tunnels used by Palestinian militants have been somewhat successful, with Hamas investing fewer resources in tunnels crossing into Israel but strengthening those within Gaza. Palestinian protests and violence along security fences have garnered international attention in 2018. In 2018, Gazans have engaged in \"popular resistance\" near fences, using rudimentary weapons and incendiary devices to provoke Israeli responses. Hamas has become more directly involved in organizing protests and riots. Israel has used force to contain the violence, resulting in the deaths of over 120 Palestinians in Gaza. In 2018, Israeli actions against Palestinian civilians and firing of rockets from Gaza led to U.N. condemnation. Israel-Gaza altercations continued, raising concerns about a potential fourth major conflict. Israeli personnel had killed over 200 Gazans and injured thousands. Israel and Hamas narrowly averted all-out conflict in mid-November. The precarious security situation in Gaza is linked to humanitarian conditions, with recent reductions in funding affecting the already difficult situation. Gazans face chronic economic difficulties, shortages of electricity, and safe drinking water. Large transfers of aid and PA money historically kept Gaza's economy afloat, but these transfers have significantly declined since 2017. The USD30 million per month reduction in PA payments in 2018 has further exacerbated the situation. The reduction in PA payments and cuts in economic aid are impacting Gaza's economy and unemployment. Efforts are being made by U.S., Israeli, and Arab leaders to improve living conditions and prevent a humanitarian crisis. Israel has allowed shipments of Qatari fuel and cash to alleviate electricity shortages. Differences in opinion exist on how humanitarian assistance should be linked to political considerations. The U.S. decision to reprogram economic aid away from the West Bank and Gaza was defended due to challenges in providing assistance in Gaza under Hamas control. President Trump halted payments to Palestinians until a diplomatic deal is reached. Senators and Representatives urged the reversal of funding reductions to avoid undermining prospects for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas and seven other Palestinian groups designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the State Department have engaged in violence against Israelis since the 1990s. Palestinian militants in Gaza periodically fire rockets. Palestinian militants in Gaza periodically fire rockets and mortars into Israel targeting civilians. Attacks also occur within Israel and the West Bank, some by unaffiliated Palestinians using small arms or vehicles. Antipathy between Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents in the West Bank leads to occasional violence. The PLO pursues international initiatives for Palestinian statehood, opposed by the US and Israel. The PLO has pursued international initiatives for Palestinian statehood, with some U.N. member states recognizing Palestine. The application for Palestinian membership in the United Nations remains pending, with potential U.S. veto. In 2011, Palestinians gained membership in UNESCO, leading to the withholding of U.S. financial contributions. In 2011, Palestinians gained membership in UNESCO, leading to the withholding of U.S. financial contributions. If Palestinians join other U.N. entities, U.S. laws may trigger withholdings of financial contributions, affecting budgets and complicating U.S. foreign policy. The PLO's international initiatives include upgrading its U.N. observer status to a \"non-member state\" in 2012 and acceding to the UNFCCC in 2016. Some Members of Congress have called for cutting off U.S. funding to UNFCCC under the 1994 law. In response to Palestinian actions, the U.S. considered cutting off funding to UNFCCC under a 1994 law. Palestinians obtained membership in Interpol in 2017 and applied to join UNCTAD and deposited an instrument of accession to the CWC in 2018. The U.S. Administration stated it would review legislative restrictions on Palestinian membership in certain UN agencies. In late 2014, Palestinian leaders accepted ICC jurisdiction over crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory since June 13, 2014. The Rome Statute entered into force for the \"State of Palestine\" on April 1, 2015. The ICC Prosecutor opened a preliminary examination into the \"situation in Palestine\" to determine if there is a basis for an investigation. Palestinian leaders provided information to the ICC on alleged crimes. Palestinian leaders referred the \"situation in Palestine\" to the ICC in May 2018, providing information on alleged Israeli crimes during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict and settlement activity in the West Bank. The State Department linked Palestinian actions to the closure of the PLO office in Washington, DC in 2018. U.S. and Israeli officials have criticized Palestinian efforts that could lead to ICC investigation or prosecution for crimes such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. ICC jurisdiction can be exercised over these crimes on the territory of a State Party, during a period of acceptance by a nonparty State, or under a U.N. Security Council resolution. Palestinian leaders referred the \"situation in Palestine\" to the ICC in May 2018, providing information on alleged Israeli crimes during the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict and settlement activity in the West Bank. Palestinian accession and acceptance of jurisdiction grant the ICC Prosecutor authority to investigate alleged crimes committed after June 13, 2014, on \"occupied Palestinian territory.\" However, Palestinian actions do not guarantee formal ICC investigation or prosecution. The Prosecutor decides whether to bring charges and prosecute individuals. ICC jurisdiction can be exercised over crimes on the territory of a State Party, during a period of acceptance by a nonparty State, or under a U.N. Security Council resolution. The ICC Prosecutor notifies states with jurisdiction over a case and they can challenge ICC jurisdiction. The PLO filed a suit at the ICJ to have the US remove its embassy from Jerusalem based on the Vienna Convention. The Trump Administration withdrew from the Convention's optional protocol, but the suit will continue. The ICJ suit filed by the PLO questions whether \"Palestine\" is a state with standing and if Israeli consent is needed due to claims on Jerusalem. Palestinian political identity emerged during the British Mandate, strengthened after Israel's occupation in 1967. The failure to establish an Arab state alongside Israel in 1947 is attributed to various factors. In 1947-1948, Israel gained independence, leading to the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians, known as the nakba. Palestinians ended up in neighboring states or became Israeli citizens. Those in the West Bank and Gaza were under Jordanian and Egyptian administration. In 1967, Israel defeated Arab states, seizing East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza. After the 1967 war, Israel gained control over East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, leaving the West Bank and Gaza under military occupation. Israel settled thousands of Jewish civilians in these territories, establishing buffer zones between Jewish population centers and Arab states. Settlement of the West Bank increased significantly after the Likud Party took power in 1977, leading to economic and cultural opportunities for Palestinians but also challenges to their identity and civil rights. The PLO emerged as the representative of Palestinian national aspirations after the Arab states' defeat in 1967 and Israeli rule over the West Bank and Gaza. After the Six-Day War, the PLO led guerrilla raids against Israel from Jordan. Yasser Arafat and Fatah gained leadership of the PLO in 1969, advocating for Palestinian rights. Despite relocations forced by Jordan and Israel, the PLO's influence persisted. The first intifada in 1987 brought international attention to the Palestinian cause. Arafat renounced violence in dialogue with the United States in 1988. Arafat initiated dialogue with the United States by renouncing violence, promising to recognize Israel's right to exist, and accepting the \"land-for-peace\" principle. Concerns about losing legitimacy to local leaders of the intifada led to diplomacy with Israel, resulting in limited self-rule for Palestinians in Gaza and parts of the West Bank through the Oslo agreements in 1993. The Oslo agreements in the 1990s aimed for a final-status peace agreement but were not fully realized. The second Palestinian intifada from 2000 to 2005 led to increased violence in Israel, causing Israel to take actions for security. Efforts to restart peace negotiations during this time were unsuccessful. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but still controls its borders, airspace, and maritime access. Israel maintains control over Gaza's borders, airspace, and maritime access, as well as buffer zones within the territory. The Palestinian Authority's self-rule was weakened by Hamas's election victory in 2006 and takeover of Gaza in 2007. The division of Palestinian leadership between the West Bank and Gaza has complicated representation of the Palestinian people. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is recognized as the legitimate representative of Palestinians, excluding Hamas and other Islamist groups. The PLO, dominated by Fatah since 1969, declared Palestinian independence in 1988 under Yasser Arafat's leadership. They accepted the \"land-for-peace\" principle in 1993 and recognized Israel's right to exist. The Palestinian Authority has self-rule in parts of the West Bank. The PLO maintains self-rule in the West Bank and claims self-rule in Gaza. It represents Palestinians to Israel and internationally, with observer missions at the UN and in other countries. Fatah, the dominant faction in the PLO, has led the PA since 1994, except for a period of Hamas rule in 2006-2007. Popular disillusionment has arisen from the failure to establish a Palestinian state, internecine violence, corruption, and poor governance. Arafat's death in 2004 weakened Fatah's support under Mahmoud Abbas. Fatah's charter still contains clauses calling for the destruction of Israel. Abbas supports nonviolent resistance and negotiations, but other Fatah members advocate for armed struggle. Other factions within the PLO include groups like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and Palestinian People's Party are minor factions compared to Fatah and Hamas. Some Palestinian leaders like Salam Fayyad and Hanan Ashrawi, not formally affiliated with the PLO, advocate for a two-state solution and oppose violence. Hamas, rooted in the Muslim Brotherhood, emerged as a religious and political entity. Hamas, a major political and military group, emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928. It gained prominence during the first Palestinian intifada in 1987, using violence against Israeli targets. Hamas became more involved in politics after Arafat's death in 2004 and defeated Fatah in the 2006 elections. Hamas, formed in 1928 from the Muslim Brotherhood, gained power through violence against Israel. After defeating Fatah in the 2006 elections, Hamas faced opposition from Israel, the US, and others. It receives support from various sources, including Iran and Qatar, with a revived relationship with Iran in 2017. In 2014, a Treasury Department official publicly stated that Qatar has openly financed Hamas, although Qatari officials deny this claim. Hamas raises funds in Gulf countries and receives donations from Palestinian expatriates and charity organizations. Other Palestinian groups in the West Bank and Gaza reject the PLO's recognition of Israel and continue to carry out terrorist attacks. Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is a U.S.-designated FTO that emerged in the 1980s in Gaza as a rival to Hamas. PIJ conducts attacks against Israeli targets and receives support from Iran. PIJ militants sometimes lead rocket attacks into Israel to pressure Hamas or demonstrate their resistance credentials. The Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) is a U.S.-designated FTO that emerged in the 1980s as a rival to Hamas. PIJ combines Palestinian nationalism, Sunni Islamic fundamentalism, and Shiite revolutionary thought. Unlike Hamas, PIJ has not established a social services network or participated in elections. PIJ has around 1,000 members and some leaders reside in Syria, Lebanon, or other Arab states. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) is a smaller Iran-sponsored militant group designated as an FTO. It is a splinter group from the PFLP, led by Ahmed Jibril, with bases in southern Lebanon, Damascus, and a presence in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria. PFLP-GC also has a small presence in Gaza. Additionally, there are small Palestinian Salafist-Jihadist militant groups in Gaza with affinities towards Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, some including former Hamas militia commanders who were disaffected by Hamas' perceived moderation. Palestinian refugees, totaling 5.4 million, are scattered across the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. Jordan granted citizenship to some refugees, but others remain stateless and reliant on UNRWA for basic needs. Many Palestinian refugees rely on UNRWA for food, healthcare, and education. Arab host governments have not actively supported their assimilation. The refugees hope to return to their homes or a future Palestinian state, feeling a sense of dispossession and betrayal. Some factions have organized followings and militias in refugee areas. They seek to influence their host governments and the PLO/PA for a solution to their claims in any final status deal with Israel. For information on Palestinian refugees and UNRWA, including recent developments on U.S. contributions, refer to CRS Report RS22967, U.S. Foreign Aid to the Palestinians by Jim Zanotti."
