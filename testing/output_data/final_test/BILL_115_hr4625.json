Congress acknowledges the importance of understanding the usability and evolution of artificial intelligence. The \"FUTURE of Artificial Intelligence Act of 2017\" emphasizes the critical importance of understanding and preparing for the ongoing development of artificial intelligence for the economic prosperity and social stability of the United States. It highlights the potential benefits of AI in powering the information economy, fostering better decisions, and unlocking answers to previously unanswerable questions. The Act aims to better understand and maximize the benefits of artificial intelligence for society, with a focus on developing guidance and recommendations through an advisory committee. The curr_chunk provides guidance to promote investment and innovation, optimize AI development for workforce changes, support unbiased AI development, and protect privacy rights. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the guidance provided for promoting investment and innovation, optimizing AI development for workforce changes, supporting unbiased AI development, and protecting privacy rights. The curr_chunk defines artificial intelligence as systems that can perform tasks without human oversight, learn from experience, and improve performance in various contexts. These systems may exhibit human-like perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical action. Artificial intelligence encompasses systems that mimic human-like thinking, acting, and rational behavior through techniques like machine learning. Artificial general intelligence refers to a theoretical future AI system. The term \"general intelligence\" refers to a future artificial intelligence system that displays advanced cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors similar to a person. \"Narrow artificial intelligence\" pertains to AI systems focused on specific applications like strategic games, language translation, self-driving vehicles, and image recognition. The Federal Advisory Committee on the Development and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence can modify these definitions as needed. Establishment of Federal Advisory Committee on the Development and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence. The Secretary of Commerce establishes a Federal advisory committee named the \"Federal Advisory Committee on the Development and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence\" to provide advice on artificial general intelligence and narrow artificial intelligence development, focusing on the competitiveness of the United States. The Federal Advisory Committee on the Development and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence focuses on promoting investment and innovation in AI, workforce retraining, STEM education, ethics training for technologists, and open data sharing. The Federal Advisory Committee on the Development and Implementation of Artificial Intelligence addresses various key issues such as open data sharing, international cooperation, accountability for AI system violations, machine learning bias, and AI's potential impact on rural communities. The Advisory Committee will study how to promote investment and innovation in artificial intelligence, the potential economic impact of AI development, and the effects on jobs due to networked AI applications and robotic devices. The Advisory Committee will study the economic impact of AI development, job displacement or creation by devices, maximizing job gains from AI, identifying and eliminating bias in AI development, incorporating ethical standards in AI implementation. The Federal Government can encourage technological progress in artificial intelligence to benefit all social and economic classes, address privacy rights, ensure legal and regulatory regimes keep pace with advancements, modernize laws for data access and privacy, and utilize AI effectively. The Federal Government can utilize artificial intelligence for handling large data sets, maximize AI potential through dialogues with multi-stakeholder groups, streamline operations in various government areas, and address other relevant matters as deemed appropriate by the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee will submit a report with recommendations on artificial intelligence to the Secretary and Congress within 540 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will review the report and provide recommendations to Congress within 90 days. Membership of the committee includes voting members. The Advisory Committee, composed of 19 voting members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, will include individuals with expertise in workforce development, ethics, privacy, artificial intelligence, or computer science.
