    "content": "The Act titled \"Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings and purposes of the Act. Congress finds that Civil War battlefields are crucial for understanding a tragic period in US history. The Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields highlights that a significant percentage of these battlefields are lost, fragmented, or in poor condition, with many at risk of being lost due to development. The purposes of the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002 are outlined. The Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act aims to protect significant battlefields through conservation easements and purchases from willing sellers. It also seeks to establish partnerships to enhance these historic sites. The Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program is established under the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act to protect significant battlefields through conservation easements and purchases from willing sellers. The American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 is amended to include a Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program, defined by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission's 'Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields' from July 1993. The American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 is amended to establish a battlefield acquisition grant program for eligible entities, defined as State or local governments, to acquire eligible sites identified in the Battlefield Report outside of National Park System boundaries. The Secretary of the Interior, through the American Battlefield Protection Program, will administer the grant program. The American Battlefield Protection Act of 1996 is amended to establish a grant program for eligible entities to acquire interests in eligible sites for preservation and protection. Nonprofit partners can be involved, with a non-Federal share of at least 50% required. Acquired sites are subject to land use limitations, and reports are required within 5 years. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on activities under the subsection within 5 years. Additionally, an update on battlefield preservation activities, changes in battlefield conditions, and other relevant developments must be submitted within 2 years. Authorization of appropriations is provided for grants under this subsection from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008. Additionally, $500,000 is authorized for updating battlefield reports. In September 2008, authorization is provided for grants from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. $10,000,000 is authorized annually from 2004 to 2008, with an additional $500,000 for updating battlefield reports.
