    "content": "At their March 2007 summit, EU member states boosted European coordination to secure and diversify energy supplies, increase renewable energy use, and reduce energy consumption. Member states retain control over decisions on energy policy, including oil and gas purchases, infrastructure development, and fuel choices. EU-wide targets for renewable energy and biofuels have been set, despite reluctance to cede national sovereignty over energy security aspects of foreign policies. EU member states have set EU-wide targets for renewable energies and biofuels, along with non-binding energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction targets for 2020. Reforms to liberalize energy markets are being considered, but national control is expected to remain significant. Energy security concerns have been influenced by rising energy prices, declining European energy production, and a fragmented internal energy market. Global demand pressures from emerging economies like China and India are also contributing to these anxieties. Europe is concerned about external influences on future energy requirements, including global demand strain from emerging economies, energy instability, terrorism threats, and Russia's political use of energy power. Recent calls for EU-wide energy coordination focus on promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Energy security issues may become more important in the upcoming session of the 110th Congress. In the second session of the 110th Congress, energy independence, security, and carbon emissions reduction are key priorities. Legislation has been introduced by both parties for carbon trading schemes similar to Europe's. Concerns have been raised about Europe's reliance on Russian energy resources, leading to discussions on NATO's role in ensuring energy security. EU member states currently import half of their energy needs, with this figure expected to rise to 65% by 2030. Oil, natural gas, and coal account for 80% of energy consumed in the EU, with imports primarily coming from Russia. Europe's energy imports come mainly from Russia and the Middle East, where 70% of global oil and gas supplies originate. The Middle East is unstable due to war and terrorism, impacting oil production. Russia's political and economic behavior raises concerns about energy reliability. High demand raises questions about future oil and gas reserves availability. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that $16 trillion in new investments may be needed over the next 30 years to meet global energy demand. European concerns about energy security were prompted by the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, leading to the creation of the International Energy Agency in 1974 to address issues of collaboration, coordination, and strategies to prevent energy being used as a political or economic weapon. The creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 1974 was a response to the Arab oil embargo, aimed at monitoring world energy markets and preventing energy from being used as a political or economic weapon. European countries began diversifying energy supply post-embargo, identifying Russia and other Eurasian countries as potential energy suppliers. Energy cooperation with the Soviet Union became a key aspect of European relations, leading to the Energy Charter Declaration in 1991 and the Energy Charter Treaty in 1994. The 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, signed by 51 countries and the EU, promotes international energy cooperation through rules on foreign energy investments, free trade in energy, energy transit, efficiency, and dispute resolution. The European Commission has used its authority to shape energy policy by promoting internal markets, alternative energy sources, and cooperation with the High Representative for Common. The 2005 German-Russian gas pipeline agreement and recent Russian manipulation of gas and oil flows to Europe have heightened European leaders' urgency for a coordinated energy strategy. Concern is also growing among the public and political classes about the link between energy production, consumption, and climate change. Germany and Russia agreed to build the North European Gas Pipeline (NEGP) under the Baltic Sea to enhance energy supply and security, but some EU member states, like Poland and Lithuania, have reservations. The German-Russian agreement to build the North European Gas Pipeline under the Baltic Sea has sparked protests from EU member states like Poland and Lithuania. Concerns have been raised about the pipeline bypassing countries and potentially threatening European energy security. Swedish officials also worry about increased Russian military presence in the Baltic Sea. This has reignited calls for a more coordinated European energy strategy amidst disputes between Russia and Ukraine and Russia and Belarus. In late December 2005, Russia's Gazprom suspended gas flows to Ukraine, causing drops in pipeline pressure in European countries like Austria, Italy, Poland, and Germany. A similar dispute in January 2007 between Russia and Belarus led to the shutdown of the Druzhba oil pipeline, affecting Germany's oil imports. After negotiations, gas and oil deliveries resumed, but European observers remain concerned about the consequences of European dependence on Russian energy resources. The Russia-Ukraine and Russia-Belarus gas and oil crises have raised concerns about Europe's energy security vulnerability. European leaders are advocating for coordinated decisions on energy supply to present a unified front to producer nations like Russia. Despite calls for unity, some European countries and energy companies continue to pursue bilateral energy deals with Russia, which could threaten collective European energy security. Europe's energy consumption heavily relies on fossil fuels, with the EU importing about 50% of its total energy supply. The dependence on imported energy, especially natural gas, is expected to increase significantly in the future. Russia, Norway, the Middle East, and North Africa are the main suppliers of EU energy, with Russia being a significant provider of natural gas and oil. Forecasts indicate that natural gas consumption in the EU will double in the coming years. European natural gas consumption in the EU is expected to double in the next 25 years, with gas becoming the preferred fuel for power generation. Currently, European gas imports make up 18% of world consumption and are projected to reach over 80% by 2030. Russia and Algeria are major suppliers of natural gas to the EU, with some member states heavily reliant on Russian gas. Concerns over this dependency have led to calls for EU-wide action on climate change and efforts to establish a more cohesive European energy policy. The EU is responding to concerns over natural gas dependency by adopting measures to establish a more cohesive European energy policy focused on energy security, sustainability, and competition in the internal energy market. Commission proposals emphasize the links between energy security, efficiency, and reducing carbon emissions. The EU's proposed energy policy focuses on enhancing sustainability, increasing energy efficiency, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting renewable energy. Member states have committed to reducing carbon emissions by 20% compared to 1990 levels by 2020 and seeking international agreement on a 30% reduction target. Additionally, the EU aims for a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020. The EU aims for a 20% increase in Europe-wide energy efficiency by 2020, with 20% of energy consumption from renewable sources and 10% of transport fuel from biofuels. European Commission president estimates the cost at $87.7 billion, arguing it is a small price to pay compared to inaction. EU member states need to invest $1.5 trillion in new technologies to achieve these targets. The European Investment Bank plans to allocate $1 billion for renewable energy projects from 2007-2010. The EU aims to increase spending on carbon technology by 50% over the next seven years. Calls for increased foreign policy coordination to secure energy supply have been sparked by oil and gas crises in Russia-Ukraine and Russia-Belarus. EU member states are cooperating to form an external policy focused on expanding political influence. European states are cooperating to form an external policy focused on expanding political partnerships and energy infrastructure investment in producer and transit countries, with a focus on Central Asia, the Caspian, and Black Sea regions. The EU is also looking to establish an energy dialogue with strategically important African countries. The flagship project in Central Asia and the Caspian region is the Nabucco gas pipeline, backed by $7 billion in European Commission funding. However, the project's construction start-date has been delayed, raising concerns about its viability. Some member states are seeking to formalize relations with Russia. The European Commission is working to strengthen multilateral mechanisms, including the Energy Charter, to coordinate global energy policy. There are disagreements within the EU on how to deal with Russia, with some member states forming bilateral energy agreements. The Commission is pushing for increased competition in traditionally protected European energy markets by reducing the power of state-owned energy companies. The European Commission is proposing to reduce the power of state-owned energy companies by splitting up ownership of generation and distribution businesses. Despite opposition from countries like Germany, France, and Spain, a compromise may allow national energy industries to operate both facilities under oversight from an independent European regulatory body. European leaders aim to reach a solution in the first half of 2008, focusing on enhancing energy cooperation and addressing challenges in partnerships with energy regions and utilizing alternative energy sources. Europe faces challenges in diversifying energy sources and ensuring secure energy supplies. The growing demand for energy in EU member states is also seen globally, with China, India, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East contributing to increased demand. The EU must compete for energy sources and transit routes, with projections showing the need to diversify imports. The region's ability to use indigenous and alternative energy sources while curbing consumption is crucial for energy security in the next 20 years. Europe's energy resources are located in Russia, the Caspian Sea region, the Middle East, and North Africa, all within reach of the European Union. Calls for a more cohesive EU-wide strategy to diversify supply have been spurred by Europe's growing dependence on Russia. Strengthening political relations with these regions' governments opens up additional options for the EU's external energy strategy. The EU acknowledges it can never achieve complete energy independence, unlike the aim of many U.S. politicians and Administration officials. Europe's energy resources are located in Russia, the Caspian Sea region, the Middle East, and North Africa, all within reach of the European Union. EU member states endorse developing a collective international energy policy but also value their individual rights to secure energy supplies. Tension arises in Europe's energy relations with Russia, especially among newer member states in Central and Eastern Europe skeptical of Russia's reliability as an energy partner. Russia is a major player in world energy markets, with the largest natural gas reserves and being the world's largest gas producer and exporter. EU member states imported 29% of their natural gas and 26% of their oil from Russia in 2004. Some experts predict Europe could rely on Russia for more than 40% of its gas consumption in the future. Some experts predict that Europe could rely on Russia for over 40% of its natural gas by 2020. Russia's energy resources and proximity to Europe make collaboration necessary, but concerns arise over Russia using its energy wealth for controversial foreign policy goals. Russian President Vladimir Putin sees energy as a tool to enhance Russia's global influence, aiming to control Europe's energy infrastructure in exchange for reliable supplies. If the EU successfully creates a single market for electricity and gas, Russia could join the world's largest energy market on its border. Putin views energy security as crucial for Russia to control the energy industry. Gazprom and Rosneft, major Russian energy companies, have close ties to the Kremlin and Putin. Gazprom, led by Putin allies, dominates the Russian gas sector and supplies 100% of Russian gas to the EU. Medvedev, Putin's chosen successor, is expected to win the March 2008 election. Russia's Gazprom controls 100% of Russian gas flowing to the EU. Analysts predict Medvedev will win the 2008 presidential elections. The International Energy Agency estimates $10 billion in annual investment is needed for the Russian gas sector. Despite EU urging, Russia refuses to allow European energy companies to invest in the energy sector. Gazprom CEO warns the EU not to interfere with their plans to invest in Europe's energy sector. Russia's Gazprom aims to expand its market reach, particularly in China, amidst growing competition for energy resources. Russia's strategy involves leveraging its near monopoly on gas from Central Asia to impede European and U.S. efforts to develop alternative pipelines. Critics like analyst Vladimir Socor believe Gazprom's activities are aimed at maintaining control over energy transportation routes and political leverage in the region. Critics like analyst Vladimir Socor believe Gazprom's strategy is to establish control over markets in Hungary and the Balkans before Caspian gas can reach them through the proposed Nabucco pipeline. Gazprom's South Stream gas pipeline, deals with Italian, Bulgarian, and Serbian energy companies, and efforts to acquire stakes in North African gas concerns are seen as part of this strategy to impede European diversification. The EU has established mechanisms to address energy relations with Russia, including the Energy Charter Treaty and the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue. Some analysts suggest making Russian implementation of the Treaty a requirement for any future EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, causing delays in negotiations. EU leadership is working on a common external energy strategy, but there are doubts about how far individual member states will push Russia to comply. Some EU member states are increasing their dependence on Russian energy through bilateral deals, despite efforts to push Russia to adopt EU principles of competition. Germany and Italy have secured long-term gas deals with Russia, while Slovenia, Belgium, and Hungary are also engaging in negotiations with Gazprom for energy projects. Hungary's oil and gas company, Mol, has partnered with Gazprom to extend the Blue Stream pipeline across the Black Sea into Hungary. Bilateral energy deals between individual EU member states and Russia have sparked criticism from countries like Poland and the Baltic states, warning against giving Russia excessive political influence. Despite efforts to diversify energy sources, Europe's dependence on Russian energy is expected to continue, raising concerns about security implications. The growing presence of Gazprom in the European energy market has raised concerns about the EU's ability to develop an independent energy policy. Despite efforts to diversify energy sources, several European nations continue to enable increased Russian influence in their energy sectors. Romania's President warned about Europe's dependence on Russian gas monopoly, highlighting potential security threats. Initial efforts to establish an EU-Russia energy dialogue have had mixed results. Negotiations for a renewed Russia-EU partnership agreement in 2006 were hindered by concerns over Russian intransigence in energy cooperation. The EU aims to focus on sustainability in achieving its energy goals, while Russia shows little deviation from its current policies. Despite internal discord, Russia will remain Europe's primary energy supplier in the long term, emphasizing the importance of healthy Russian-European relations. To enhance energy security, Europe may need to reduce dependence on Russian energy by diversifying to other regions without jeopardizing Russia's market security in Europe. Europe may need to regulate Gazprom's behavior as it becomes a dominant energy player in the region to prevent interference in internal political decision-making. The EU will likely pressure Gazprom to abide by competition rules and change its corporate mentality by allowing European firms to invest in Russia's gas industry. However, there is internal discord on how to approach Russia. The EU faces internal discord on how to pressure Russia regarding its gas industry. Critics suggest using existing competition laws and Russia's WTO membership as leverage. Some countries, like Germany, are hesitant to antagonize Russia due to mutual dependencies and cooperation on global issues. European energy diversification focuses on Central Asia, the Caspian, and Black Sea regions. EU's energy policy paper from January 2007 emphasizes strengthening diversification strategies. The Caspian Sea region, bordered by Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan, holds significant oil and gas reserves. It is a potential alternative energy source for Europe to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Proven oil reserves in the region range between 40 and 50 billion barrels, with production levels estimated at around 2 million barrels per day in 2005. The Caspian Sea region has significant oil and gas reserves, with proven oil reserves estimated between 40 and 50 billion barrels. Natural gas reserves are around 232 trillion cubic feet, with production levels at 2 million barrels per day in 2005. Europe has shown interest in the region's energy resources since 1995, with initiatives like Inogate and the Baku Initiative aiming to promote the transport of oil and gas to Europe. Inogate was established to facilitate the transportation of Caspian oil and gas resources to the EU market, reducing Russia's dominance in the region. Most oil and gas from landlocked countries had to be transported through pipelines, with Russia controlling the main transportation routes. This gave Russia market power to influence prices and transit fees for Caspian energy shipments. The Caspian region nations aim to develop alternative routes to reach European markets and reduce dependence on Russia for energy transportation. Projects like the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) connect Kazakhstan's oil deposits to Novorossiysk, reducing reliance on Russian pipelines. This shift in energy flow towards Europe could be crucial for Europe's energy strategy. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline (BTC) and the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline (SCGP) provide alternative routes for oil and gas exports from the Caspian region to European markets, bypassing Russian pipelines. Additional projects in Europe may also be considered, such as upgrading the existing oil pipeline from Baku to Supsa in Georgia. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline (BTC) and the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline (SCGP) offer alternative routes for oil and gas exports from the Caspian region to Europe. The possibility of extending the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline to northern Poland and the Baltic states is being considered. The Nabucco gas pipeline and the Trans-Caspian pipeline are important projects for Europe, aiming to transport gas from Central Asia and the Caspian region to various European countries. The construction of the Nabucco pipeline has faced delays. The Nabucco gas pipeline project, aimed at transporting gas from Central Asia and the Caspian region to Europe, has faced repeated delays. Recent advances by Gazprom on its South Stream pipeline have raised doubts about Nabucco's viability. Despite optimism from EU officials, construction is now targeted to begin in 2009. Gazprom's acquisition of a 50% stake in the planned terminus of the Nabucco pipeline in Austria in 2008 has been seen as an attempt to undermine the project. The unresolved legal status of the Caspian Sea region continues to raise questions about regional stability. The EU could offer legal assistance to resolve the unresolved legal status of the Caspian Sea. Political instability in the region, including conflicts between Azerbaijan and Armenia, internal strife in Georgia, and uncertainty in Ukraine, could impact future pipeline projects. Romania and Bulgaria's entry into the EU, along with the EU's relationship with Turkey, may help maintain stability. The EU's special relationship with Turkey and the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the EU could help maintain stability in the Black Sea region. The EU's willingness to compete with Russia for influence in the region and prevent Gazprom from controlling gas supply from Central Asia is crucial. Gazprom's efforts to secure gas supply and transit arrangements in the Black and Caspian Sea regions may impact the flow of lower-cost Central Asian gas to Russian customers. Gazprom aims to channel lower-cost Central Asian gas to Russian customers and protect its European market. The Caspian region's oil and gas reserves make it a significant energy source for the future, with potential for exports to Asian markets. China sees Kazakhstan as a key long-term oil source, highlighting the region's importance in global energy production. The Caspian region's gas reserves can help diversify Europe's energy supplies, enhancing energy security. The EU needs a strong commitment to encourage private sector involvement in securing a share of the Caspian energy market. Efforts to decrease dependence on Russia have led to calls for increased engagement in the Middle East and North Africa, despite political instability in the region. Europe's efforts to secure energy resources face challenges due to political instability in the Middle East and North Africa. The region holds a significant portion of the world's oil and natural gas reserves, with the Persian Gulf countries alone holding over half of the world's oil reserves. Europe currently depends on the Middle East/North Africa region for a substantial portion of its oil imports and piped gas. Europe heavily relies on the Middle East and North Africa region for oil and natural gas imports. Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Iran are major oil suppliers, while Algeria is the primary source of natural gas through pipelines to Italy and Spain. The availability of liquefied natural gas (LNG) has been crucial for Europe, with Spain leading in LNG imports from suppliers like Algeria, Egypt, Oman, and Qatar. Algeria, a significant LNG exporter, sends most of its gas to Europe. Europe heavily relies on the Middle East and North Africa for oil and natural gas imports. Algeria is the largest exporter of LNG, with most of its gas going to Europe. The Persian Gulf states, such as Qatar and Oman, have also become major players in the LNG market, attracting interest from European energy companies. European relations with North Africa and the Gulf states have improved over the years, with formal partnerships established to ensure energy supply stability. The EU has established dialogues with the GCC and OPEC nations in the Middle East. European energy companies are increasingly involved in the region, but face challenges such as Algeria's reluctance to agree to European terms. Despite the potential for growth in Europe's energy diversification strategy in the Middle East and North Africa, competition with Asia and North America, as well as political instability, may limit Europe's reliance on the region. Europe's interest in energy resources in North Africa is noted by Russia and Gazprom, who are also trying to influence Europe's energy plans. Russia is looking to position itself to influence Algeria's role as a major energy supplier to Europe, especially with its LNG exports from the Shtockman gas field. Norway, a significant gas exporter to the EU, is behind Russia in gas exports to Europe. Norway is a major gas exporter to the EU, with 17% of European gas consumption in 2004. It has 73.6 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, mainly in the North Sea. Norway is the eighth-largest natural gas producer globally, with significant reserves in the Norwegian and Barents Seas. The Arctic region holds nearly 25% of undiscovered global resources. Norway also has 8.5 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the largest in Western Europe. The Snohvit gas field, along with Russia's Shtockman field, will establish the Barents Sea as a new European energy region. Norway's oil production in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea averaged 2.95 million bl/d in 2005. As North Sea fields mature, production may decline, but new developments in the Barents Sea could offset this. The UK is the largest recipient of Norway's oil exports, followed by the Netherlands and Germany. Statoil plans to build a large-scale LNG export terminal in Europe, offering new energy security opportunities for the EU. Europe is recognizing Norway's growing importance in energy security, particularly in the Barents Sea. The EU and individual nations are interested in facilitating Norway's energy development efforts. Poland and the Baltic states are discussing the construction of an LNG terminal to receive LNG from Norway for transport across Europe. Diversifying energy suppliers is a key challenge for Europe. Europe faces varying levels of risk from energy-producing nations, requiring a strategic approach to ensure stability. The EU utilizes its Common Foreign and Security Policy to promote security in energy-supplying countries. However, there are differing perspectives on energy security policy among member states and the European Commission. Long-term bilateral energy agreements, such as the Baltic pipeline agreement and LNG contracts, play a crucial role in Europe's energy landscape. The EU's energy security is primarily seen as a national policy issue, with bilateral agreements between member states and energy suppliers like Gazprom and Algeria. The European Commission calls for a common European energy policy to prevent reliance on single suppliers. However, greater coordination is needed for a common external energy security strategy tied to the EU's CFSP. The EU is focusing on increasing energy independence by investing in alternative and renewable energy sources, as well as clean coal technology. Efforts are aimed at reducing carbon emissions from power generation and transport, which are major contributors to the EU's total emissions. Energy consumption in the transport sector is heavily reliant on imported oil, while power generation is split between coal and nuclear plants. The energy mix in EU member states is determined by national governments or energy companies, with varying reliance on different fuel sources. France heavily relies on nuclear power, while Germany and Spain are phasing out nuclear energy. Coal is dominant in Poland and the Czech Republic. Decisions on energy mix are influenced by EU and international agreements to reduce carbon emissions. The EU aims to reduce carbon emissions by 8% of 1990 levels by 2012 through National Action Plans. Member states with heavy coal reliance have less strict targets. Efforts will focus on promoting renewable energy, cleaner fuels, 'clean coal' tech, and energy efficiency. Nuclear power, emitting no carbon, is advocated by some experts and officials. Some experts and officials advocate increasing nuclear power generation in Europe due to its lack of carbon emissions. However, others raise concerns about safety and proliferation. Coal-fired electricity generation accounts for over one-third of Europe's total electricity, with varying levels among member states. Despite coal's high carbon dioxide emissions, its abundance in Europe's proven reserves suggests it will continue to play a significant role in the region's energy mix. Coal will continue to play a significant role in Europe's energy mix, with efforts to invest in clean coal technologies like carbon capture and sequestration. EU member states support advancements in clean coal burning to lower carbon emissions and aim to bring 12 sustainable fossil-fuel power plants online by 2015. The long-term viability of coal will depend on meeting emission reduction commitments, renewable energy usage, natural gas prices, and the cost of clean coal technology installation. The cost of installing clean coal technologies will determine coal's viability as an energy source in Europe. Nuclear power accounts for one-third of Europe's electricity, but differences in national policies hinder a common EU nuclear energy policy. Some countries like France and the UK heavily rely on nuclear power, while others like Germany and Spain are phasing out nuclear reactors in favor of gas-powered facilities. Pressure to reconsider these decisions is growing in some countries. Advocates of nuclear power in Europe are gaining favor due to its low greenhouse gas emissions. The cost of new nuclear reactors and the controversial issue of nuclear waste make it unlikely for a resurgence of nuclear power in countries without existing nuclear programs. Some countries are considering replacing or upgrading existing reactors, while others are exploring alternatives like the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) program for nuclear fusion power generation. The European Union is making efforts to produce electrical power from nuclear fusion, aiming to reduce dangerous waste. The first facility will be in France, with initial results expected in 15-20 years. Currently, hydro, wind, solar, and bio-mass energy make up 7% of Europe's energy consumption and 15% of electricity generation. EU member states have set a target for 20% of energy consumption to come from renewable sources by 2020, with individual national targets proposed by the European Commission. Advanced countries like Austria, Sweden, and Denmark are expected to achieve more ambitious targets than newer member states in Central and Eastern Europe. The EU aims to increase renewable energy usage, with member states having varying portfolios such as hydro power, solar energy, and wind farms. Biofuel programs are also gaining traction to reduce carbon emissions from the transport sector. The EU has mandated a 10% share of biofuels in all European transport fuel by 2020, with the success of meeting renewable energy targets dependent on production costs and member states' commitment. The EU member states need to invest $1.5 trillion in new technologies over the next 14 years to achieve carbon emissions and renewable energy targets. Some countries are offering subsidies and low-interest loans for research and development in renewable energies. Germany aims to create industrial capacity for the growing global market in renewables. German officials believe the global market for renewable energy will be lucrative. The European Commission argues for integrating national gas and electricity markets into the EU's single market to increase energy supply security and efficiency. Despite some market reforms, national energy markets are still largely under state control. Debate over energy market liberalization has intensified as energy security concerns grow. Some advocate for market integration to enhance energy security through network connectivity and diversification of supply sources, while others argue for continued national protection to ensure stable supply and protect consumers from price fluctuations. The European Commission aims to create a competitive EU-wide gas and electricity market to promote competition, lower prices, and enhance energy security. Member states are hesitant to take action before mid-2008 due to the importance of energy policy to their economic development. Energy market liberalization has been a topic of debate, with some advocating for integration to increase security and efficiency, while others prefer national controls to protect consumers from price fluctuations. The European Commission is pushing for a competitive EU-wide energy market, but some member states, like Germany, France, and Spain, oppose measures that would reduce the power of state-owned energy companies. They argue that national controls are necessary for economic development and stability in the energy market. The Commission's proposal to split ownership of generation and distribution networks is controversial, as it aims to promote competition and prevent price manipulation. The European Commission is facing opposition from Germany, France, and Spain regarding unbundling measures in the energy market. These countries are expected to propose alternatives in early 2008. The focus is on the ability of the internal market to deliver energy supplies through interconnected pipelines and grids, ensure infrastructure security, and provide emergency supply. The European power transmission grid is divided into seven regional \"pools\" with weak connections, leading to increased cross-border energy exchanges. For example, in July 2006, France purchased additional power from Germany to meet demand during a heat wave. However, in 2005, only 10% of Europe's installed electrical generation capacity could be delivered. The EU is increasing efforts to encourage investment in cross-border electricity grid connections and extending this to gas, oil, and LNG distribution systems. European countries are re-thinking energy as part of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EU is focusing on promoting cleaner and more efficient indigenous energy supply as part of its Common Foreign and Security Policy. There are challenges in reaching agreements on energy-related issues, particularly in managing external relations and creating an internal market. Disagreements persist on dealing with Russia and diversification strategies for foreign supply sources. Decisions on foreign energy supply sources and contracts will likely remain with individual EU member states. While open and competitive energy markets are desired, protection of national energy industries still prevails in key nations like Germany, France, and Spain. Some countries are hesitant to hand over regulatory decisions to the EU in Brussels. The EU is increasing its role in coordinating and financing renewable energy development and emergency energy supplies. Member states will likely retain authority in determining their energy mix, but the EU has set binding EU-wide targets in some areas and may continue to do so. The EU is expanding its role in coordinating energy infrastructure investments and foreign policy dialogues with energy-producing regions. Despite efforts to advance energy dialogues, foreign policy remains primarily under national governments' control. Relations between the US and EU have deepened over the past 55 years, particularly in the economic sphere. The U.S-EU economic partnership is crucial for global economic growth and trade. Energy security is a top priority for both the United States and the EU, as they together represent the world's largest energy market. Cooperation on energy security, climate change, and sustainable development has been agreed upon in U.S.-EU Summits. At U.S.-EU Summits, agreements were made for cooperation on energy security, climate change, and sustainable development. However, there have been challenges in convening forums such as the U.S.-EU High Level Dialogue on Climate Change and the U.S.-EU Energy CEO Forum. European officials have urged the U.S. to commit to pursuing binding international emissions and energy efficiency targets post-2012. Despite some progress in acknowledging climate change, differences remain on international treaty regulations and carbon emissions trading systems. The United States and EU have challenges in agreeing on binding international emissions targets. The U.S. advocates for technological innovation in clean energy over global regulation to address climate change. Initiatives launched at the 2007 Summit focus on clean coal, biofuels, energy efficiency, and methane recovery. The U.S. Administration argues that regulations may hinder economic growth and technological advances, citing that carbon dioxide emissions in the EU increased faster than in the U.S. from 2000-2004. Concerns are raised about European dependence on Russian energy and Gazprom's influence in Europe's energy infrastructure, leading the U.S. to support efforts for alternative energy transportation routes. The EU should strengthen its resolve in requiring Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and accept standard business practices in its energy sector. Some Europeans, particularly Germans, are hesitant to take action that may antagonize Russia, seen as a strategic partner. NATO involvement in energy security, including securing supply sources and distribution routes, has been proposed. In 2006, Poland proposed an \"Energy NATO\" for NATO to protect member state energy supplies. Senator Lugar suggested extending NATO's defense clause to cover energy security threats. Some EU states prefer EU involvement in energy security, while others see NATO's role as complementary in protecting pipelines and sea lanes during conflicts. NATO Partnership for Peace countries like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are involved in these discussions. NATO Partnership for Peace countries like Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are seeking closer ties with NATO to reduce Russian influence and secure energy infrastructure in an unstable region."
