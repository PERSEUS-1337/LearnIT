The limitation amounts for contributions by individuals and multicandidate political committees are being decreased. The effective date for these changes is after December 31, 1990. SEC. 24. CONTRIBUTIONS TO CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. This section introduces an income tax credit for contributions to candidates for public office. The tax code allows individuals to claim a credit for 50% of political contributions made during the taxable year, with a maximum credit of $125 ($250 for joint returns). Contributions must be verified according to regulations set by the Secretary. The definition of 'contribution' includes gifts of money to individuals or organizations for the purpose of influencing elections at various levels of government. The definition of a 'candidate' refers to an individual seeking nomination or election to a public office at the federal, state, or local level, as specified by national political party committees. The term 'candidate' refers to an individual who publicly announces their candidacy for office and meets the qualifications to hold the position. A 'national political party' is defined as a party presenting candidates in 10 or more states during a presidential election year. The term 'State' refers to various states and the District of Columbia, while 'local' refers to political subdivisions within a state. Section 642(j) disallows credits for estates and trusts, while section 7871 treats Indian tribal governments as States. Amendments include a new subsection for political contribution credit for estates or trusts and redesignation of subparagraphs for Indian tribal governments in the Code. The amendment includes adding a new subparagraph for defining the State for political contribution credits and updating the table of sections in the Code. The amendments made by this section regarding contributions to candidates for public office apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992."
