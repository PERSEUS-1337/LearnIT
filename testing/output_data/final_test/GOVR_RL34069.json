    "content": "Technical assistance is a basic service that provides conservation knowledge to producers and landowners, offering information, technical expertise, and a delivery system for conserving natural resources. It involves outreach, education, and training in practices and technological advances to create compatibility between production and the land. Perceptions of technical assistance vary by region, land use type, accessibility, and individual stewardship. Some see it as science-based and continuously evolving, while others view it as limited to preparing a conservation plan with scientific underpinnings for stability. The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical assistance for agriculture conservation, derived from the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1935. NRCS offers expertise and knowledge to landowners to conserve and improve natural resources through a network of federal staff across the United States. The USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical assistance for agriculture conservation, defined by the 2008 farm bill. Technical assistance includes expertise, information, and tools for conservation on agricultural land, as well as direct services to farmers and ranchers for conservation planning and implementation. Technical assistance for agriculture conservation is provided by the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through various programs. Funding for technical assistance comes from discretionary conservation programs, with mandatory funding primarily authorized under the 2008 farm bill. The technical infrastructure supports the delivery of services such as standards, inventories, training, data, and monitoring. Funding for mandatory conservation programs is provided at the level authorized in law, unless limited during the appropriations process. Mandatory funding for conservation technical assistance is determined by the Administration, not through appropriation or authorization. Conservation Operations (CO) is the largest discretionary account that provides technical assistance through the Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program. CTA offers support, planning, and implementation assistance through local field offices across the United States and territories. It also funds collaborative research and data collection projects like the Natural Resources Inventory (NRI). The Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) program, funded at close to $756 million in FY2010, tracks natural resource conditions and trends on non-federal land in the United States. The Soil Survey program maintains an inventory of soil resources on all U.S. land, utilized by various industries and scientists for studying climate change and evaluating environmental impacts. Other discretionary programs include watershed programs for planning and rehabilitation. The watershed programs, established in the 1940s and 1950s for flood control and water quantity concerns, provide technical assistance and financial support through contracts with local partners. Despite reduced appropriations and congressional earmarks, Congress continues to fund these programs annually. The Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) Program aims to improve coordination systems in rural areas for natural resource development. Funding for the RC&D program mainly supports staff for local RC&D councils. The RC&D program receives funding for staff support for local councils in the United States. Unlike discretionary programs, mandatory programs have funding specified by legislation, with the Administration determining technical assistance funding. Conservation advocates prefer mandatory funding for easier protection of funding levels. The 2008 farm bill increased mandatory conservation funding, shifting NRCS staff from discretionary to mandatory programs. Despite this shift, discretionary funding remains the primary source of technical assistance funding. Technical assistance activities in mandatory programs support financial assistance delivery through designs and specifications for conservation practices. All technical assistance before a producer signs a financial assistance contract is considered part of CTA. After a producer signs a contract for financial assistance, technical assistance is funded from the individual mandatory program rather than CTA. Once the contract is completed, mandatory program funds are no longer available to support ongoing assistance in maintaining conservation plans. Mandatory program funding may still be used for easement follow-ups. The 2002 farm bill stated that technical assistance can be provided directly through NRCS or approved third party providers. In late 2002, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) limited technical assistance funding for mandatory programs due to a cap established in the CCC Charter Act. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) used CCC funding for costly computer purchases in the mid-1990s, leading to criticism. The 1996 farm bill amended the CCC Charter Act to restrict fund transfers for administrative expenses, known as the \"Section 11 cap.\" In late 2002, OMB limited technical assistance funding for mandatory programs due to a cap established in the CCC Charter Act. This affected NRCS as FSA had been reimbursing NRCS for technical assistance in support of CRP and WRP. OMB used the Section 11 cap to limit technical assistance funding within mandatory conservation programs, leading to disagreement with Congress. Congress disagreed with OMB's decision to limit technical assistance funding for mandatory farm bill programs, citing language in the 2002 farm bill that allowed for funding out of program allocations. The Government Accountability Office supported Congress's position, stating that USDA improperly used CO appropriations for technical assistance. Despite proposals to create a separate account for technical assistance, Congress rejected them and prohibited the use of discretionary CO appropriations for this purpose. This led to a \"shifting\" of funds for technical assistance between programs. In FY2003, OMB's opinion on the Section 11 cap led to the shifting of funds for technical assistance between mandatory programs, reducing financial assistance funding available in donor programs. EQIP used $145 million for technical assistance, but shortfalls in other programs led to shifting $107 million from EQIP, reducing its funding to $442 million. FPP, GRP, and WHIP shifted $50 million to other programs. Congress addressed the issue in late 2004 with a new law requiring technical assistance to be paid from funds provided to each program annually. The 2009 Recovery Act allows CCC funds to be used for technical assistance without limitations for FY2009 and FY2010. The provision applies to FY2009 and FY2010, excluding activities under Title I of the 1985 farm bill. Congress may revisit the issue due to funding authority expiring in FY2012. Agriculture appropriations acts since FY2002 have limited funding for certain conservation programs below authorized levels. Despite reductions, overall conservation funding has increased. NRCS determines technical assistance for mandatory programs based on authorized funding levels. The GAO scrutinized a model used by NRCS in 2004 to estimate technical assistance costs for mandatory programs, citing inaccuracies due to delays, external costs, and inaccurate assumptions. In 2006, NRCS updated the model with Activity Based Costing data to more accurately determine workload costs. However, NRCS does not have full control over funding levels, as they are set nationally by OMB apportionment. In FY2009 and FY2010, NRCS allocated technical assistance funding for mandatory programs to states using unique program formulas. From 1935 to 1994, NRCS focused on providing conservation technical assistance, shifting with small watershed programs in the 1940s and 1950s, and conservation compliance in 1985. In the 1990s, NRCS took on more responsibility in USDA's financial assistance programs for conservation. In 1994, USDA reorganized and renamed the Soil Conservation Service to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). NRCS also took on responsibility for various conservation programs from the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. With the 1996 farm bill, NRCS began administering the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and other financial assistance programs. In 2002, the NRCS took on more responsibility for conservation programs, including payment functions, under the conservation title, following the enactment of the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171). FSA retained administration of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), while NRCS continued to provide technical assistance. The Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP) was jointly administered by NRCS and FSA. Following the 2002 farm bill, NRCS and FSA took on expanded responsibilities for conservation programs. NRCS leads technical assistance, while FSA handles participant eligibility. They have agreements dividing responsibilities for joint programs like CRP and GRP. The conservation technical assistance network includes federal, state, and local governments, businesses, nonprofits, universities, and other entities. Locally led conservation districts, authorized by states and administered at the county level, coordinate conservation and natural resource interests among private landowners. These districts work closely with federal employees and local officials to provide assistance. The 2002 farm bill allowed producers to retain third party providers for technical assistance, known as technical service providers (TSPs), to expand technical capacity for agricultural conservation programs. The addition of Technical Service Providers (TSPs) allows USDA to reimburse producers for technical assistance provided by certified third parties. TSPs can be individuals, entities, or public agencies, with the majority being from the private sector. NRCS sets qualifications for approving TSPs, who must register and become certified to provide specific technical services. Recertification with NRCS is required periodically. Technical Service Providers (TSPs) must meet set criteria and undergo training, recertifying every three years with NRCS. They offer various technical services, with nutrient management being the largest area of certification followed by pest management. TSPs provide conservation planning, design, installation, and monitoring of practices. In FY2010, the three most common conservation practices applied were detailed in Table 1. Technical assistance can be provided by TSPs through individual contracts or cooperative agreements with NRCS. Producers must establish TSP use in their conservation program contract with NRCS to be reimbursed for services. TSPs are selected from an approved list and paid by the producer, who is then reimbursed by NRCS. Funding limitations, known as technical service payment rates, vary by county and task. NRCS will not reimburse TSPs more than it would cost NRCS to perform the same tasks. The Technical Service Payment Rates (TSP) can be paid directly to certified TSPs through cooperative agreements with NRCS. TSPs are funded through conservation programs, with EQIP being the primary program utilizing their services. On average, $46 million is obligated annually for TSPs, a small portion of USDA's overall technical assistance budget. Section 2502 of the 2008 farm bill allows NRCS to pay for conservation planning through financial assistance, including comprehensive nutrient management planning (CNMP) and other conservation activity plans (CAPs). The Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs) are completed as part of an EQIP contract, allowing program payments for up to 75% of the practice implementation cost. CAPs must meet NRCS standards and are performed by a certified Technical Service Provider (TSP). EQIP payments are made to the participant who reimburses the TSP for the CAP. NRCS provides technical assistance for EQIP, with CAPs funded through financial assistance increasing EQIP's role for TSP service. In FY2010, forest management plans and CNMPs had the highest participation rates at 41% and 45% respectively. The Agriculture Conservation Experienced Services (ACES) program, authorized by the 2008 farm bill, allows individuals 55 and older to provide technical services to support conservation programs. Approximately $7.6 million was obligated for ACES in FY2009. The discussion revolves around the funding and confusion surrounding technical assistance and administrative support in relation to congressional directives and the Administration's streamlining initiative. There is ongoing debate between USDA and Congress regarding the preference for funding technical assistance over salaries and expenses. The debate between USDA and Congress revolves around funding technical assistance versus salaries and expenses. There is confusion over the definitions of technical assistance and administrative support, with differing interpretations within Congress and USDA. The 2008 farm bill amendment provided some clarity but the debate continues. The debate surrounding technical assistance in agricultural conservation focuses on defining administrative support and determining which agency within USDA should provide it. This debate stemmed from the 2002 farm bill, which increased funding for conservation programs and shifted program administration to NRCS. Congress delegates most farm bill programs to the Secretary, leading to ongoing discussions about funding priorities. The debate over program administration for conservation programs in the farm bill revolves around whether it should be handled by FSA or NRCS. While some argue for FSA due to its experience, others prefer NRCS citing its progress since 2002. Financial issues have been raised for both agencies, with NRCS initiating the Conservation Delivery in response to concerns about its ability to administer programs. The NRCS initiated the Conservation Delivery Streamlining Initiative to address challenges in administering programs. Despite the efficiency gain of centralizing program delivery, field staff were burdened with tools and processes, limiting on-site assistance. The initiative aims to create a more effective and sustainable model for conservation assistance, with three main objectives identified. The NRCS Conservation Delivery Streamlining Initiative aims to simplify conservation delivery, streamline business processes, and ensure science-based assistance. The TSP program, implemented in 2003, saw a decrease in active entities from over 2,100 to below 1,200 by 2009. NRCS identified six primary areas of concern including registration, training, payment rates, quality assurance, and business tools for TSPs. NRCS is working on streamlining the TSP program to address regulatory requirements and simplify business processes. Funding for the program has decreased in recent years, with a peak in FY2006. The decline in funding may be attributed to the absence of earmarks in FY2007 and new transparency procedures established by the House and Senate in 2007. The role of congressionally directed funding in agricultural conservation programs is under scrutiny as demand for technical assistance grows. Congressional directives can dictate specific amounts of funding for projects, potentially straining the capacity to deliver technical assistance. In FY2010, congressional directives allocated funding to specific watershed projects in West Virginia and \"pass-through\" agreements for Conservation Operations program funding. These directives primarily focus on Watershed Operations programs and account for approximately 74% of appropriations funding. In FY2009, congressional directives allocated approximately 74% of appropriations funding for Watershed Operations and Conservation Operations programs. While CO had an increase in directives between FY2001 and FY2006, they have leveled off in recent years. Concerns arise as the reduction in available technical assistance funding may not meet the growing demand. The 2002 farm bill saw a significant increase in conservation funding, leading to questions about the capacity of the technical assistance infrastructure to meet the growing demand. As the 2008 farm bill is implemented and the 2012 farm bill is debated, evaluating this capacity will shape the future of technical assistance. Capacity in this context refers to the ability to serve customers promptly, including private landowners, tribes, and government partners. Factors like human capital, technology, mission goals, and funding influence the capacity to provide technical assistance. Despite data limitations, questions about this capacity aim to guide future discussions on technical assistance. NRCS employs around 11,800 employees, with most located in various offices providing financial and technical assistance services. Partnering organizations and private firms are increasingly involved in offering technical assistance, along with state departments and other entities contributing to the network. The 2002 farm bill expanded conservation technical assistance capacity by authorizing third party providers known as technical service providers (TSPs). The question arises whether there is enough technical assistance capacity available to properly implement fully funded mandatory conservation programs. Certified third party providers have expanded technical assistance capacity for private landowners. The number of certified TSPs decreased from over 2,100 in 2004 to below 1,200 in 2009. Issues include the availability of providers and the cost of certification. The ACES program aims to support technical assistance capacity for farm bill conservation programs by utilizing qualified retired individuals. Many technical assistance organizations are facing high levels of retirement, raising concerns about the adequacy of technical capacity. The loss of technical knowledge due to retirement is affecting the ability to provide assistance, and there is a need for replenishing mechanisms to fill the gap. Organizations are seeking more efficient ways to deliver services by streamlining processes. Local soil conservationists, employed by NRCS, are stationed at county-level conservation district offices to provide technical assistance. The field office technical guide offers guidance on soil, water, air conservation tailored to each county, with specialists available at state or regional levels for specific consultations. This guide serves as the primary source of localized conservation information. The field office technical guide is the main source of localized conservation information, available online for every county. Technology has expanded the ways technical assistance is provided to producers, with a focus on transferring technological advances into practical applications through NRCS and partnering organizations. The Iowa Soybean Association's On-Farm Network program helps farmers conduct research on nutrient use efficiency to reduce nitrogen applications, benefiting the environment and cutting costs. Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) within EQIP fund innovative approaches for environmental enhancement in agriculture. The results of Conservation Innovation Grants are expected to be incorporated into the NRCS toolbox of technical tools. The transfer of technology from these projects into national technical assistance has had mixed success in promoting new technology application. Solutions are sought to increase private sector interest in supporting technology transfer within producer organizations. Over $300 million was allocated to upgrade technology and streamline the Commodity Credit. The Commodity Credit Corporation received over $300 million to upgrade technology and streamline program delivery processes. Questions arise about how this will enhance conservation programs and interact with the NRCS system. The NRCS, formerly SCS, was given responsibility for soil erosion prevention and surveys in 1935. Discussions are ongoing about expanding technical assistance capabilities and potentially reallocating responsibilities. One suggested solution to expanding technical capabilities and meeting the need for additional technical assistance is to reduce or remove administrative support functions associated with conservation programs. This could involve transferring administrative functions, such as distributing financial assistance, to FSA or contracting them out to the private sector. NRCS initiated the Conservation Delivery Streamlining Initiative in January 2009 to create a more effective and efficient business model for delivering conservation assistance, aiming for technical field staff to spend 75% of their time in the field with customers. Field staffs spend 75% of their time with customers, while over 80% of technical staff's time on administrative tasks is eliminated. New resource concerns like nutrient management and climate change are increasing demands on technical assistance. The Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act of 1977 directed USDA to develop a national conservation program. The Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (RCA) guides the department's conservation priorities for natural resources. Congress is discussing the impact of administrative tasks on technical assistance and whether to define the division of labor between agencies. Producers benefit from having one agency control conservation programs, and reducing administrative burden could increase efficiency. Congress is considering authorizing separate reporting measures for technical assistance. NRCS initiated a conservation delivery streamlining initiative in 2009 to improve the efficiency of technical assistance. Congress is debating funding for technical assistance, but increasing it seems unlikely due to budget constraints. Discussions include whether to have separate accounts for technical assistance and administrative support or combine them under a different title. The system's interaction with FSA's program delivery and potential overlap with FSA's modernization project are also being considered. Funding for conservation technical assistance remains primarily discretionary, with farm bill program funding on the rise. Section 2502 of the 2008 farm bill allows certain technical assistance activities to be eligible for EQIP financial assistance. Conservation Activity Plans (CAPs) are now mainly conducted by TSPs, potentially freeing up NRCS staff time. The effectiveness of CAPs in reducing technical assistance backlog and the impact of additional administrative measures on time savings are being evaluated. The debate continues on funding technical assistance for conservation under the Section 11 cap in the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. The FY2011 President's budget proposed legislation to charge a user fee for conservation plans. Producers' willingness to cover technical assistance costs without government compensation is being questioned. The ARRA provision allows technical assistance under title II to be funded through CCC. The provision for technical assistance under title II funded through CCC expired in 2010. The debate continues on extending this authority and its impact on other agencies. Changes to the Section 11 cap could affect conservation technical assistance. Technical assistance has evolved over time, expanding in scope and funding. The Soil Conservation Service was established in the 1930s to control and prevent soil erosion, preserve natural resources, and maintain the navigability of rivers and harbors. This was in response to the Dust Bowl and was funded through public works programs. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) was created in the 1930s to protect public health, public lands, and relieve unemployment. The SCS provided technical assistance, materials, and labor through demonstration projects with landowners. This led to the establishment of soil conservation districts to carry out localized demonstrations. President Franklin D. Roosevelt presented model state legislation for the creation and operation of these districts in 1937. President Franklin D. Roosevelt presented model state legislation for the creation and operation of soil conservation districts in 1937, highlighting significant political support for soil conservation. Twenty-two states passed legislation to create districts, leading to the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) focusing on providing technical assistance to farmers through these local entities. The SCS mission has expanded beyond soil erosion to address various natural resources based on national priorities. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) expanded its scope to include water resources and watershed programs through various legislative acts, providing technical assistance and financial funding for holistic watershed planning projects involving a multidisciplinary team of experts. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) provided technical assistance and federal support for watershed projects involving a multidisciplinary team of experts. Local communities were required to provide land rights and maintenance responsibility upon project completion. Compliance Provisions in the 1985 farm bill transformed technical assistance functions by enforcing conservation regulations like sodbuster and swampbuster. The SCS, and later the NRCS, were responsible for determining highly erodible land and wetlands for conservation programs like Sodbuster and Swampbuster. This focus on certification shifted resources away from whole-farm planning to soil erosion. In the 1990s, the Soil Conservation Service was reorganized by Congress and renamed the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to reflect its expanded responsibilities, including wetlands conservation. Financial incentives were linked to technical assistance in new ways, shifting the focus back to soil erosion. The NRCS took over administration of conservation programs like the Wetlands Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program from the FSA. This increased their responsibilities and funding authority significantly. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is implemented by FSA, with NRCS providing technical assistance. FSA leads program activities such as policy development, application approval, and payments, while NRCS ensures work quality. NRCS provides technical assistance for CRP activities, including program eligibility determination, conservation planning, and practice certification. FSA reimburses NRCS monthly based on program costs. In FY2009, NRCS received $56 million for technical assistance. Changes in the 2008 farm bill are expected to increase technical assistance for the Farmable Wetland Program. The 2008 farm bill changes are expected to increase technical assistance costs for the Farmable Wetland Program. The Grassland Reserve Program differs from CRP in terms of program functions and responsibilities between FSA and NRCS. An MOU outlines these responsibilities in detail. The Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) involves assessing penalties, accepting applications, providing technical assistance, evaluating and ranking applications, ensuring conservation treatment compliance, and establishing quality control procedures. Both FSA and NRCS develop state ranking criteria for selecting eligible projects, with NRCS supplying technical assistance for grazing management plans. The MOU between NRCS and FSA involves reimbursement for administrative costs related to implementing the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), based on workload data and the number of applications and contracts provided by FSA."
