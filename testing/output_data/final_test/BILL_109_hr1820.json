The Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor Act of 1984 is amended to define the term 'Association' and require a memorandum of understanding with the Association for transition of the management entity. The Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor Act of 1984 is amended to define the term 'Association' and require a memorandum of understanding for transition of the management entity to the Association. The Association will serve as the management entity for the corridor upon the termination of the Commission. It is authorized to use Federal funds for various purposes such as making loans, grants, hiring staff, and entering into contracts for goods and services to implement the management plan. The Association is responsible for developing and submitting a management plan for the corridor within 2 years of receiving Federal funds. Priority should be given to preserving the corridor, establishing interpretive exhibits, developing recreational resources, and increasing public awareness of the natural, historical, and architectural resources in the corridor. The management plan for the corridor should focus on preserving architectural resources, facilitating restoration of historic buildings, ensuring economic viability, considering diverse interests, holding quarterly public meetings, submitting substantial changes to the Secretary, and providing annual reports for years with Federal funds. The Association must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing accomplishments, expenses, income, loans, and grants recipients. They must also provide all expenditure records for audit and ensure receiving organizations do the same for funds received. The Association is prohibited from using Federal funds to acquire real property under this title but can use funds from other sources for authorized purposes. Additionally, a management plan must be established. The Association must submit a management plan to the Secretary within 2 years of receiving Federal funds. The plan should consider state and local input, involve residents and organizations, and outline conservation, funding, and development recommendations for the corridor. It should also detail actions by government and private entities, funding sources, and define geographic boundaries. The management plan for the corridor must include identification of geographic boundaries, a description of the corridor's concept, overall goals, key resources, responsible parties, financial plan, and public participation. The management plan must include a public participation process, a mechanism for updating the plan, a bibliography of documents used, and a discussion of relevant issues. Failure to submit the plan within 2 years disqualifies the Association from receiving additional funds. The Secretary must approve or disapprove a proposed management plan within 180 days. If no action is taken within this time frame, the plan is deemed approved. Consultation with various local entities is required before approval, and the Association must hold regular public meetings for review and input. Upon approval of the management plan, it supersedes the conceptual plan in the National Park Service report. If the Secretary disapproves the plan, they must provide reasons and recommendations for revisions. The Secretary must also approve substantial amendments to the plan, including any cost increases over 20%. Funds under this title cannot be used for changes from a substantial amendment without Secretary approval. SEC. 124. TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE; OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. The Secretary may provide technical and financial assistance to the Association for developing and implementing the management plan. This assistance can be reimbursable or nonreimbursable, and cooperative agreements can be made with other entities. Priority is given to actions that conserve natural, historic, cultural, and scenic resources of the corridor and provide educational and recreational opportunities. Federal agencies conducting activities affecting the corridor must consult with the Secretary and the Association. The Secretary must consult and cooperate with the Association in carrying out activities related to the corridor, coordinating efforts and ensuring they do not have adverse effects. SEC. 125 authorizes $10,000,000 for this title with a $1,000,000 limit per fiscal year. The Federal share of costs for activities under this title cannot exceed 50%. SEC. 126 sets a termination date of September 30, 2027 for assistance. SEC. 127 outlines requirements for including private property in the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor. SEC. 127 requires notification and consent of property owners for the preservation, conservation, or promotion of privately owned property within the corridor. Landowners not notified can request removal of their property from the corridor. SEC. 128 focuses on protecting private property. The text states that private property owners are not required to allow public access to their property or modify any laws regarding public access. It also mentions that designating a corridor does not create liability for property owners and does not affect their liability under other laws. Additionally, it clarifies that the authority of governments to regulate land use is not modified, and private property owners are not obligated to participate in the corridor. The establishment of the corridor does not require private property owners to participate or be associated with it. The boundaries of the corridor indicate where Federal funds can be used, without granting additional regulatory authority over land use to the Secretary, National Park Service, or Association. Technical amendments are made to the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor Act of 1984, including the removal of subsection (b) and changes to subsection (a) such as replacing \"Commission\" with \"Association\" and redesignating paragraphs."
