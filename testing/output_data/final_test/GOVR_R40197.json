    "content": "The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides technical and financial assistance to agricultural producers for soil and water conservation practices. EQIP aims to promote agriculture production, forestry management, and environmental quality. It was authorized in the 1996 farm bill to replace four conservation programs. EQIP is the largest agriculture conservation program for working lands, encouraging farmers and ranchers to participate in conservation efforts by helping with the cost of approved practices. Eligible producers can benefit from EQIP. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial assistance to agricultural producers for implementing approved conservation practices. Producers enter into contracts to receive payment for these activities, which are carried out according to an EQIP plan developed with the producer. EQIP was amended and reauthorized in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, with the NRCS administering the program under an interim final rule. National priorities set by NRCS include reducing nonpoint source pollution in impaired watersheds. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) provides financial assistance to agricultural producers for implementing approved conservation practices, such as reducing contamination from agricultural point sources and promoting habitat conservation for at-risk species. Producers with eligible land can submit an EQIP plan describing the conservation and environmental purposes that will be achieved using USDA-approved practices. USDA-approved conservation practices involve structural, vegetative, and land management techniques. Producers can receive technical assistance to develop and implement an EQIP plan, with decisions made at the state level. Applications are accepted and ranked throughout the year, grouped by crop, forestry, and livestock operations for evaluation. The USDA provides payments to help producers offset the cost of implementing conservation practices under an EQIP contract. Participants can receive payments for constructing structures and implementing land management practices. 60% of the total annual EQIP spending is allocated to livestock practices. USDA pays up to 75% of the projected costs for planning, design, materials, equipment, installation, labor, management, maintenance, or training, and up to 100% of the estimated income forgone for certain conservation practices. The USDA provides payments under an EQIP contract to help producers offset the cost of implementing conservation practices. Payments can be higher for certain farmers and ranchers, with initial payments made when the contract is signed. Contracts last one to ten years, with total payments limited to $300,000 over six years, or $450,000 for projects of special environmental significance. Individuals with an average annual non-farm AGI of $1 million or more are ineligible, unless at least two-thirds of their income is from farming, ranching, or forestry. The 2008 farm bill created a case-by-case waiver to the AGI limitation for environmentally sensitive land. EQIP funding levels were increased incrementally from $400 million in FY2002 to $1.3 billion in FY2007. Funding was limited to $1.27 billion in FY2007 by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, with authorization extended through FY2010. The 2008 farm bill further increased annual authorized funding levels incrementally. The 2008 farm bill increased annual authorized funding levels for EQIP from $1.34 billion in FY2009 to $1.75 billion in FY2012. Funding for EQIP is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriations, receiving authorized amounts each year under USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. Congress has consistently limited EQIP funding below authorized levels since FY2005. In FY2011, EQIP was limited to $1.238 billion, a reduction from the authorized level of $1.558 billion. For FY2012, the proposed limit is $1.408 billion, a reduction from the authorized level of $1.75 billion. The EQIP program receives annual funding allocations based on national priorities, natural resource needs, and regional equity. States with the largest EQIP allocations include Texas, California, and Colorado. Funding levels have been consistently below authorized levels, with the most recent allocation at $342 million out of $1.75 billion. The Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) was created under the 2008 farm bill to promote water conservation and improve water quality on agricultural lands. Eligible partners submit project proposals to conserve water or improve water quality, with NRCS selecting projects based on specific requirements. In FY2009, $58 million was approved for 63 projects in 21 states, and in FY2010, $19.8 million was approved for 28 new projects in 10 states, with an additional $40.4 million made available. In FY2011, only $5 million has been allocated for new projects under the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Producers can sign up for AWEP contracts through NRCS directly or through a partner. Funding for AWEP is separate from the general EQIP program, with specific amounts allocated for each fiscal year. Another subprogram under EQIP is the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program, aimed at promoting innovative conservation approaches and technology transfer. The Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program aims to stimulate innovative approaches to conservation, accelerate technology transfer in environmental protection, agricultural production, and forest management. NRCS allocates approximately $15 million annually for a national competition and up to $5 million for a watershed competition. The Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program includes competitions for projects in the Chesapeake Bay and Mississippi River basin (up to $25 million available) and for practices reducing greenhouse gases on agricultural lands (up to $5 million available). 32 states have state-level CIG competitions, awarding over $17 million since FY2005. The 2008 farm bill made changes to the program, removing the requirement for grants not to exceed 50% of project costs and adding an air quality component. The air quality component of the EQIP program is authorized at $37.5 million annually to address concerns from agricultural operations and meet regulatory requirements. EQIP receives widespread support in the farm community and Congress, providing financial and technical assistance for conservation practices. Congressional interest in budgetary pressures, unfunded applications backlog, program reauthorization, and measuring accomplishments may arise during the 112th Congress. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized EQIP through September 30, 2012, with increasing annual funding levels. The authorized funding level for EQIP has increased since the 2002 farm bill, but actual funding has been reduced by nearly $1.8 billion from FY2005 through FY2011. The 112th Congress may consider further reductions in funding for EQIP during the appropriations process or farm bill reauthorization. The next farm bill is expected to be budget-neutral, with no additional money for new programs without corresponding offsets. Congress faces tough decisions on how much support to provide for agricultural conservation programs. The 2002 farm bill saw a significant increase in funding for conservation programs to address a backlog of producer demand. However, despite the increase, there are still more pending applications than available funding, leading to concerns that producers may be deterred from applying. The issue may worsen if funding continues to decrease or is reallocated to other programs. The average contract size has also grown, contributing to the backlog of applications. The average cost of an EQIP contract has more than doubled since the 2002 farm bill, reaching over $16,000 per contract. This increase is attributed to the higher funding cap established in the bill, allowing for larger livestock operations to fund waste management facilities and expensive conservation practices. Despite the 2008 farm bill lowering the payment limitation to $300,000 over six years, the average contract size remains significantly lower at $16,000. This disparity continues to contribute to the backlog of unfunded applications. The 2008 farm bill expanded EQIP to include conservation activity plans (CAPs) for various activities like forestry management and energy management. These plans are developed by third-party technical service providers (TSP) and must meet NRCS standards. EQIP payments are made to participants who then reimburse the TSP. The 2008 farm bill expanded EQIP to include conservation activity plans (CAPs) developed by third-party technical service providers (TSP). EQIP payments are made to participants who then reimburse the TSP. NRCS provides technical assistance for EQIP, but CAPs and third-party services could free up NRCS staff time. However, the administrative measures required for CAP contracts could offset time savings for technical assistance. This issue may be debated in the next farm bill review. NRCS can provide information about EQIP contracts, but until recently, little was known about actual accomplishments. NRCS has compiled data on resource concerns addressed by EQIP contracts, including water quality, plant condition, soil erosion, water quantity, domestic animals, soil condition, wildlife, fish, and air quality. Questions being addressed include evaluating performance, measuring environmental changes, cost-effectiveness, identifying environmental effects, and collecting data for output measurement. The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) was initiated by NRCS in 2003 to evaluate the benefits of conservation practices funded by the 2002 farm bill. Initial results show positive effects from conservation practices, with additional data needed for further analysis. EQIP provides financial assistance for implementing these practices, but the assessment does not directly link the effects to any specific federal program."
