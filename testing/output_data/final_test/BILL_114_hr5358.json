Penn Center on St. Helena Island in South Carolina is a historical and cultural resource for the Reconstruction era. Founded in 1862 by Laura M. Towne and Ellen Murray, Penn School was one of the first schools in the South for formerly enslaved African Americans. With assistance from the Freedman's Aid Society of Pennsylvania, Penn School purchased land and opened in its permanent location in January 1865. Penn School, founded in 1865 as part of the Port Royal Experiment, helped former slaves in the South Carolina Lowcountry become self-sufficient. Lasting through the Civil War and Reconstruction era, it transitioned thousands to freedom. Laura Towne advocated for public funding for African American schools in the Sea Islands post-Civil War. In 1868, Robert Smalls pushed for compulsory education for children in South Carolina, funded by the government. The Compromise of 1877 ended Reconstruction, leading to the removal of Federal protection for African American rights. This resulted in the dismantling of African American communities' power to elect school board members and raise funds for education, effectively ending their public school system. Penn School, funded by Northern charities, became a sanctuary for former slaves and their descendants during the Jim Crow era. It evolved into the Penn Normal, Agricultural and Industrial School in 1901 under new leadership. Beaufort County started operating public schools by 1948. In 1948, Beaufort County began operating public schools on St. Helena and other sea islands. The Penn Normal, Agricultural, and Industrial School transitioned into Penn Community Services, Inc. (Penn Center), focusing on civil rights, Gullah culture preservation, and community services. During the 1950s and 60s, Penn Center served as a gathering place for both Whites and Blacks, hosting social and political organizations for Civil Rights Movement activities. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. utilized Penn Center for Southern Christian Leadership Conference retreats and planning sessions. Penn Center, a National Historic Landmark District, played a significant role in civil rights activities and preserving African-American land ownership. It offered legal services for heirs' property issues and contributed to the Low Country Gullah Culture Special Resource Study. In 2006, Congress authorized the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor to preserve African-American culture in the Southeast coast. The National Park Service recognized Penn Center as a historically significant institution. There is no dedicated unit in the National Park Service for the Reconstruction Era, but establishing one at Penn Center is proposed. Establishing a unit at Penn Center is crucial for ensuring the National Park Service presents a complete version of American history.
