    "content": "The 113th Congress is facing challenges in U.S.-Pakistani relations, balancing Pakistan's importance with budgetary pressures. Efforts post-9/11 aim to stabilize Pakistan, combat terrorism, and address nuclear concerns. Pakistan's dispute with India over Kashmir and its role as a base for terrorist groups pose regional stability threats. Pakistan-based elements are linked to most jihadist terrorist plots globally. Anti-American sentiments and economic challenges in Pakistan pose serious challenges for U.S. decision-makers. Opinion surveys show Pakistanis have unfavorable views of the U.S., while Americans view Pakistan negatively as well. The U.S. provides significant foreign aid to Pakistan for short-term security interests and long-term stability goals. The United States has provided significant aid to Pakistan over the years, but fluctuating levels of aid have led to a perception of unreliability. Some U.S. lawmakers question providing large amounts of aid to Pakistan due to concerns about its role in counterterrorism efforts and support for insurgent groups. Pakistan is also seen as incapable of sustainable development and security for its people, with accountability issues regarding aid results. Pakistan's poor economic situation, with a low GDP per capita of $2,881, poses a challenge for foreign donors. The country's education sector is ineffective, with minimal government spending and a significant portion of children lacking formal education. Pakistan faces numerous challenges including a lack of formal education for a quarter of primary school children, limited access to modern energy services, chronic electricity shortages leading to daily blackouts, widespread potable water shortages, inadequate healthcare services resulting in preventable deaths, and security threats from various militant groups. Reports indicate thousands of deaths from terrorism and insurgency-related violence since 2001. The post-2001 U.S. assistance program for Pakistan has significantly improved various sectors such as energy, health, education, infrastructure, governance, and gender equity. It has also enhanced Pakistan's military and law enforcement capabilities to combat terrorism and support U.S.-led military operations in Afghanistan. U.S. assistance to Pakistan since 2001 has not achieved its central goals, as Islamist extremism and militancy have increased, the civilian government remains unstable, and the national economy continues to suffer. Many assessments criticize the delivery and oversight of aid, stating that it has failed to improve Pakistan's performance against jihadi groups or stabilize its democracy. The focus on security aid post-9/11 has not yielded counterterrorism results but has strengthened the military's control over state institutions, delaying reforms and worsening public perceptions of U.S. intentions. Pakistani public critiques U.S. aid, urging conditions on military assistance and more freedom for USAID. Some fault U.S. for not separating security and development aid. Critics say U.S. overestimated assistance program expansion and implementation capabilities. NDAA for FY2013 includes limitations and conditions for Coalition Support Fund. The FY2013 NDAA includes limitations and conditions for Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan, with a cap of $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Reimbursements are prohibited for the period when Pakistan blocked NATO transit. Payment is contingent on the Secretary of Defense certifying security maintenance. The FY2013 NDAA includes limitations and conditions for Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan, with a cap of $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Reimbursements are contingent on the Secretary of Defense certifying security maintenance along the GLOCs, counterterrorism efforts against al Qaeda and other militant groups, and efforts to counter IEDs. The Secretary may waive certification requirements in the interest of U.S. national security. Section 1228 extends PCF through the current fiscal year, with disbursement requiring certification that Pakistan is countering IEDs, cooperating on counterterrorism, and not detaining citizens for cooperating with the U.S. government. The Secretary may waive certification in the interest of U.S. national security. Section 1211. The pending NDAA for FY2014 would limit CSF reimbursements to Pakistan to $1.5 billion and require certification from the Secretary of Defense on various security and counterterrorism measures. The Secretary may waive certification in the interest of U.S. national security. The bill would allow the Secretary to waive certification requirements for FY2014 CSF payments to Pakistan if it is in the interest of U.S. national security. Pakistan must cooperate with U.S. counterterrorism efforts, not support terrorist activities against U.S. or allied troops, dismantle IED networks, prevent nuclear proliferation, protect judicial independence, and issue visas promptly for U.S. visitors engaged in counterterrorism efforts. The FAULT Act (H.R. 1922) would limit assistance to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Egypt, and Pakistan due to concerns about undermining U.S. security and foreign policy objectives. Enactment would halt foreign aid to these countries, except for a maximum of $50 million in agricultural or medical goods annually, with the possibility of waivers by the President. The FAULT Act (H.R. 1922) would limit assistance to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Egypt, and Pakistan. The bill allows for waivers by the President under certain conditions, such as fundamental changes in governmental policies or for humanitarian aid. The President would also be required to terminate Pakistan's status as a Major Non-NATO Ally. In 2012, the State Department notified Congress of waiving certification requirements for U.S. assistance to Pakistan. The Obama Administration waived aid sanctions on Pakistan in 2009 and 2012, citing national security interests. In 2013, arms transfers to Pakistan resumed with a more limited waiver. License applications for defense equipment are now reviewed case-by-case. No certification or blanket national security waiver has been issued for FY2013. In 2012, Shakil Afridi was convicted of treason in Pakistan. Shakil Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in prison for treason after working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. US Congress reacted strongly, withholding $33 million in aid to Pakistan. Senator Rand Paul pushed to end all foreign assistance until Afridi is released, but his bill was defeated in September 2012. Members of Congress continue to be involved in the issue. In response to Shakil Afridi's imprisonment, US Congress remains involved in the issue. The Senate has pending bills to naturalize Afridi as a US citizen and to halt aid to Pakistan until he is released. A House resolution with 18 cosponsors calls for Afridi's immediate release. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the importance of maintaining aid to Pakistan for various reasons during a House hearing. The US has been providing nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan, as authorized by the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009. However, the funding fell short in subsequent years due to budgetary constraints and lack of appropriation by Congress. Administration officials attribute the shortfall to these factors. The legislation aims to extend provisions for another five years, but the authorization ends in FY2014. The new Pakistani government faces a major challenge in the energy sector, with a $5 billion circular debt causing severe electricity shortages and rolling blackouts. The crisis is impacting the country's GDP and needs urgent attention. The Pakistani government is facing a major energy crisis with severe electricity shortages and rolling blackouts due to a $5 billion circular debt. This crisis is impacting the country's GDP, with a goal to reduce load shedding to just three or four hours per day within six months. The US is providing assistance to Pakistan's energy sector as a top priority, aiming to attract private sector investment, increase cost recovery, decrease losses, and add megawatts to the grid through visible generation projects. US AID plans to add 900 MW to Pakistan's power grid by the end of 2013, with an additional 300 MW planned later. The Pakistani government is addressing an energy crisis with plans to add 300 MW by the end of 2014 through improvements at power stations and the Tarbela Dam. The focus is on enhancing hydropower potential by funding projects at five dams. The US has provided funding for repairs at the Tarbela Dam and released $280 million for energy sector projects at other dams. The Office of the Inspector General issues quarterly reports on the progress of U.S assistance programs in Pakistan, highlighting challenges in aid delivery such as limited local technical capacity and security concerns. The USAID OIG has taken action to protect against waste and theft in U.S. aid programs in Pakistan. Nine major risk factors jeopardize the aid program, including political risks and operating restrictions. Despite challenges like visa denials and security issues, assistance programs continued, with the hope of a peaceful transfer of civilian power in the 2013 parliamentary elections. The USAID OIG has identified several challenges in aid delivery in Pakistan, including political and economic instability, operating restrictions imposed by the Pakistani government, resistance to reform, vulnerability to natural disasters, leadership turnover, adverse environmental impact, and limited institutional capacity. These factors hinder project implementation and monitoring, affecting program planning and coordination. Several challenges in aid delivery in Pakistan have been identified by the USAID OIG, including political and economic instability, operating restrictions imposed by the Pakistani government, resistance to reform, vulnerability to natural disasters, leadership turnover, adverse environmental impact, and limited institutional capacity. Strategies to mitigate these risks include capacity-building programs, NGO training, pre-award assessments by accounting firms, in-country oversight, and cooperation with Pakistan's National Accountability Bureau. Islamabad responded angrily to the inadvertent killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers by NATO forces in late 2011. In response to the accidental killing of 24 Pakistani soldiers by NATO forces in late 2011, Islamabad closed the ground lines of communication used by NATO forces. After negotiations in July 2012, the GLOCs were reopened following an apology from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The US released $1.18 billion in military reimbursements as a gesture of goodwill. In July 2010-May 2011, Pakistan received $1.1 billion in Coalition Support Funds (CSF) from the US. Congress did not block the transfer, and another $688 million was issued for June-November 2011. CSF requests for July 2012 and beyond are under consideration. Pakistan faced major flooding in 2010-2012, causing deaths and displacing over 750,000 people. The Islamabad government pledged $91 million towards relief efforts for flooding in Pakistan. The U.S. provided nearly $135 million in humanitarian assistance in FY2012, totaling over $735 million in aid from FY2010-FY2012. Aid to Pakistan has been inconsistent over the past six decades, fluctuating based on U.S. foreign policy objectives and the bilateral relationship. U.S. aid to Pakistan has fluctuated over the years based on various factors such as nuclear activities and alignment with the West. Aid levels peaked in 1962 when Pakistan joined defense pacts with the U.S., while it was at its lowest in the 1990s due to nuclear concerns. The relationship between the two countries cooled during and after Indo-Pakistani wars. In the mid-1970s, tensions between Pakistan and the U.S. escalated over Pakistan's nuclear ambitions. President Carter suspended aid due to Pakistan's covert nuclear activities. However, in 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a shift in relations, with the Reagan Administration providing a $3.2 billion aid package to Pakistan. This aid made Pakistan a key ally in supporting the Afghan resistance against Soviet expansionism. After the 1990 suspension of aid to Pakistan, U.S. aid to the country remained low due to disengagement from Pakistan and Afghanistan after the defeat of the Soviet Union, as well as an overall reduction in foreign aid to balance the U.S. budget. This had a lasting effect on Pakistani perceptions of the United States. Former Pakistani Army Chief and President Musharraf highlighted Pakistan's involvement in \"waging jihad\" in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which he viewed as ultimately leading to disaster. The United States' abandonment of Afghanistan and Pakistan after the defeat of the Soviets in the 1980s led to a sense of being used and ditched by many Pakistanis. The unpredictability of U.S. aid has made Pakistan view the U.S. as an unreliable partner, influencing their cooperation on national security issues and keeping options open with competitors like China. Pakistan's Prime Minister's visit to Beijing in 2011 was seen as a response to deteriorating U.S.-Pakistan ties. Following a decade of alienation in the 1990s, U.S. relations with Pakistan were transformed after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to increased aid to Pakistan, including a $600 million emergency cash transfer. President George W. Bush pledged a five-year, $3 billion aid package for Pakistan in 2003, with annual installments of $600 million split between military and economic aid starting in FY2005. U.S. aid to Pakistan rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2002. In FY2002, aid to Pakistan increased by nearly 11-fold to $2,000 million. The 2010 U.S. aid to Pakistan of $4.3 billion represented a 2,185% increase compared to pre-9/11 levels. Pakistan ranked second in U.S. aid recipients in FY2010, receiving $2.1 billion. Two-thirds of U.S. aid from FY2002 to FY2012, totaling $15.8 billion, supported security assistance in Pakistan. The United States has provided significant security and economic assistance to Pakistan, totaling over $7.8 billion from FY2002 to FY2012. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) accounted for about 85% of this aid, with disbursements generally tracking appropriation levels. Some funds have been transferred to meet specific needs, such as during natural disasters. The United States provides bilateral economic, development, and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan through various funding accounts, with ESF funds accounting for about 85% of U.S. economic assistance. ESF is used for a wide range of activities, including supporting political parties and elections in Pakistan. ESF funds in Pakistan are used to support political parties, conduct elections, provide services to citizens, deliver health technologies like vaccines, support education by building schools and providing funds for teachers, improve universities, pursue economic reforms such as tax collection and infrastructure development, promote agriculture for job growth, and enhance private-sector competitiveness for economic expansion. Food for Peace aid to Pakistan fluctuates based on needs during humanitarian crises, such as the 2010 floods. Global Health and Child Survival funding for Pakistan has ranged from $14 million to $34 million annually, totaling $249 million from 2002 to 2012. This program supports HIV/AIDS prevention and the national strategy. The U.S. has provided economic aid to Pakistan's western tribal areas to support development initiatives, including education, healthcare, and economic growth. Approximately 6% of U.S. economic aid to Pakistan from FY2001-FY2007 was allocated for projects in the FATA region, with a focus on road-building and infrastructure projects totaling over $280 million. Skepticism surrounds the effectiveness of significantly boosted FATA-specific funding for infrastructure projects in Pakistan's tribal region due to endemic corruption and poor security conditions. Islamabad insists on implementing aid programs solely through Pakistani authorities, with reports of high administrative costs and attacks on aid workers hindering US aid efforts. Governor of KPk expressed concerns in 2009 about limited assistance reaching the tribal belt, highlighting challenges faced by aid programs in the FATA. According to experts, aid efforts in the FATA region have been hindered by limited presence of Pakistani federal ministries and constrained provision of services. Some analysts recommend that international donors should not hand control of development programs to the Pakistani government until political reforms and financial oversight mechanisms are in place. USAID's focus is on building confidence in the Pakistani government through small-scale projects in secure areas, developed in partnership with civilian authorities. The Obama Administration aimed to triple nonmilitary aid to improve Pakistani lives. The Obama Administration aimed to triple annual nonmilitary aid to Pakistan, focusing on conflict-affected regions and counterinsurgency goals. President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Secretary of State Clinton supported legislation for increased aid, urging Congress to pass it. The House and Senate passed acts authorizing the aid increase. The Pakistan Act of 2009 (S. 1707) authorized a tripling of nonmilitary aid to Pakistan for at least five years. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) was signed into law by President Obama in October 2009. The legislation, also known as the \"Kerry-Lugar-Berman\" or \"KLB\" bill, aimed to forge a new long-term relationship between the US and Pakistan. Secretary of State Clinton hailed the passage of the bill as a historic chapter in bilateral relations. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) was signed into law in October 2009, authorizing $1.5 billion annually for economic and development aid to Pakistan from FY2010 to FY2014. The legislation aimed to strengthen democratic institutions, promote economic freedoms, and support public diplomacy in Pakistan. The act also required the Administration to submit a Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report to Congress before funds could be allocated. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) limits aid to $750 million unless certified by the President's Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan or the Secretary of State. The act allows for waivers in national security interests. It aims for continued economic aid to Pakistan from FY2015-FY2019, contingent on improving political and economic conditions. The State Department bundles aid programs under EPPA, meeting the $1.5 billion goal in the first year but not in subsequent years. The State Department officials attribute the decrease in civilian assistance for FY2014 to budgetary and implementation constraints. Despite the reduction, they believe the FY2014 request reflects a continued commitment to robust civilian assistance cooperation in priority sectors like energy, economic growth, stabilization, education, and health. A 2011 State Department report emphasized the need for patience in implementing aid programs with Pakistan. The approach under KLB aid program with Pakistan is innovative in four ways: alignment with Pakistani priorities, focus on visible infrastructure projects, priority sectors vulnerable to extremism, and a whole of government effort. State reduced projects in 2011 for a more streamlined portfolio. EPPA authorizes security assistance from FY2010 to FY2014. Assistance is contingent on Pakistan's cooperation in dismantling nuclear networks and combating terrorist groups. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) authorizes security assistance from FY2010 to FY2014, contingent on Pakistan's cooperation in dismantling nuclear networks and combating terrorist groups. The EPPA also clarifies activities related to the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF). Pakistani officials and society criticized the EPPA for potentially interfering with their foreign policy and national security. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) faced criticism in Pakistan for its conditions on security assistance, with opposition parties and even secular parties within the ruling coalition expressing reservations. The Lahore High Court Bar Association rejected the law, calling its conditions a violation of Pakistani sovereignty. Critics described the law as an imposition of \"cruel conditions\" and a \"treaty of surrender,\" leading to increased national humiliation. The EPPA faced criticism in Pakistan for its conditions on security assistance, with opposition parties and even secular parties within the ruling coalition expressing reservations. President Zardari rejected complaints as misguided. The military establishment expressed serious concern about clauses impacting national security, with Army chief General Kayani complaining to visiting U.S. commander General McChrystal. The negative Pakistani reactions to the EPPA caught U.S. officials by surprise. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a formal rebuttal to dispel myths about the bill, clarifying that no conditions were placed on the nonmilitary aid for Pakistan. Senator Kerry later visited Islamabad to address concerns and reassure Pakistani officials. Secretary of State Clinton expressed shock at the negative reactions in Pakistan to the U.S. legislation, highlighting a failure in effective communication. The strong Pakistani response was believed to be influenced by military elements and opposition political forces aiming to weaken the civilian government. The U.S. legislation caused a rift between the civilian government and military in Pakistan, with Army Chief Kayani vying for control. Despite initial criticism, U.S.-Pakistan security cooperation increased post-9/11, leading to Pakistan being designated as a Major Non-NATO Ally in 2004. Pakistan's role in the U.S.-led anti-terrorism campaign expanded with the U.S. allowing commercial sales for Pakistan to refurbish its F-16 fighter aircraft. The U.S.-Pakistan Defense Consultative Group resumed high-level discussions on military cooperation and anti-terrorism efforts. Pentagon officials expressed frustration with Pakistan's counterinsurgency efforts and its focus on conventional war strategy. The U.S. stands ready to support Pakistan in shifting its military priorities. The United States is ready to assist Pakistan in reorienting its army for counterinsurgency efforts. The Pentagon proposed the creation of the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund to strengthen Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities. Pakistan is subject to conditions on security assistance, including concerns about human rights abuses by the army in the Swat Valley. The Leahy Amendment restricts U.S. security assistance to foreign security forces with credible evidence of human rights violations. The Obama Administration withheld funding for Pakistani army units involved in abuses, citing concerns about mass disappearances of detainees. Congress began appropriating billions to reimburse Pakistan at the Bush Administration's request. Since FY2002, Congress has allocated billions in coalition support funds (CSF) to reimburse Pakistan for their support in U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. CSF payments, totaling nearly $10.7 billion by June 2013, cover a significant portion of Pakistan's military expenses, mainly for army operations. These funds also support Pakistani troops in northwest Pakistan and compensate for coalition usage of Pakistani airfields and seaports. CSF payments to Pakistan cover military expenses, including food and ammunition. Concerns arose about oversight of these funds, leading to increased rejected requests in 2007. Increased oversight and accountability are needed over Pakistan's reimbursement claims for coalition support funds, as a large proportion of funds may have been lost to waste and mismanagement over the years. The Bush Administration suspected that Pakistan diverted funds towards a military buildup focused on India. Senior Pentagon officials have raised concerns about the lack of controls and oversight in the reimbursement process. Senior Pentagon officials have taken steps to overhaul the process of providing military aid to Pakistan, requiring detailed reports on coalition support reimbursements. In 2010, it was noted that about 60%-65% of Pakistan's reimbursement requests under CSF were fulfilled. The Commander of U.S. Central Command mentioned keen oversight of CSF funds in Islamabad. U.S. auditors are now more attentive to Pakistani claims. Major U.S. arms sales to Pakistan include items for counterterrorism and conventional warfare. Total Foreign Military Sales agreements with Pakistan are $5.2 billion for FY2002-FY2011, with F-16 sales accounting for over half. Congress has also appropriated over $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing. Since FY2002, the U.S. has made major arms sales to Pakistan for counterterrorism and conventional warfare, totaling $5.2 billion. Congress has also allocated over $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing, with funds used for purchasing U.S. military equipment for modernization efforts. Notable supplies include P-3C Orion aircraft, TOW anti-armor missiles, military radio sets, surveillance radars, C-130E transport aircraft, and the USS McInerney missile frigate. The U.S. has provided significant military equipment to Pakistan since FY2002, totaling $5.2 billion for counterterrorism and conventional warfare. This includes supplies such as F-16 combat aircraft, self-propelled howitzers, attack helicopters, and various armaments. Notable items paid for with Pakistani national funds include new F-16C/D Block 52 combat aircraft, F-16 armaments, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, and Enhanced Paveway laser-guided bomb kits. Pakistan has received a variety of military equipment from the U.S., including anti-ship missiles, air-to-air missiles, naval guns, combat aircraft, military trainer jets, utility helicopters, surveillance aircraft, vehicles, explosives detection vehicles, and individual soldier equipment. They are eager to receive more counterinsurgency hardware for use in western Pakistan. Pakistan is eager to receive more counterinsurgency hardware for use in western Pakistan, including armored personnel carriers, laser target designators, laser-guided munitions, night-vision goggles, surveillance gear, surveillance and communications equipment, attack and utility helicopters. Some analysts criticize the focus on conventional war-fighting capabilities and insufficient attention to counterinsurgency capacity. Pakistan has received over $2.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing from FY2002-FY2012, with more than half used to purchase weapons like P-3C maritime patrol aircraft, F-16 combat aircraft, and TOW anti-tank missiles. This has been argued to enhance regional stability and security vis-\u00e0-vis India. In late 2009, the US provided significant assistance to Pakistan during fighting in South Waziristan, including transport helicopters, helicopter gunship parts, infantry equipment, and intelligence sharing. The United States provided the Pakistani air force with bombs and kits for making laser-guided bombs for counterinsurgency operations. Concerns have been raised about the compatibility of U.S. military aid to Pakistan with U.S. strategic goals in the region, as well as alleged modifications to U.S.-supplied weapons that could violate the Arms Export Control Act. The Islamabad government denies allegations of diverting U.S. defense assistance towards India. Indian observers are not surprised by the claims, as they believe Pakistan uses the aid for India. Some analysts suspect the U.S. wants to maintain Pakistan as a regional balancer against Indian dominance. Pakistani officials complain about the slow delivery of U.S.-supplied defense equipment, hindering military operations. The U.S. has provided Pakistan with helicopters, including armed Cobra models, since 2006. The George W. Bush Administration aimed to strengthen the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary force overseeing border security in western Pakistan. Pentagon funds were used to train and equip the FC for counterterrorism efforts, with increased involvement from the U.S. Special Operations Command. Americans also trained Pakistan's elite Special Service Group. The U.S. has been training Pakistan's elite Special Service Group commandos to double their size to 5,000 under the Obama Administration. However, Pakistan's reluctance to send troops for urgent operations elsewhere has hindered the training program. The Balochistan Frontier Corps is accused of human rights violations against suspected separatist militants. Other security programs aim to bolster Islamabad's counterterrorism and border security efforts, including U.S.-funded road-building projects in KPk and FATA. The U.S. is also training and equipping new Pakistan Army Air Assault units for targeting terrorists quickly. The U.S. is providing military education and training programs to enhance Pakistan's military professionalism and respect for rule of law, human rights, and democratic values. Security assistance to Pakistan's civilian sector includes strengthening law enforcement capabilities and establishing a Counterterrorism Special Investigation Group. However, Pakistani shortcomings such as poorly trained and equipped personnel, low conviction rates, and rampant corruption may hinder U.S. efforts. The 2008 think-tank report highlighted Pakistan's police forces' incapability in combating crime and protecting citizens due to corruption and politicization. Recommendations were made for sweeping reforms to address these issues. Additionally, Title III of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 allocated $400 million for the Secretary of Defense to bolster Pakistan's civilian security sector. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $400 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) under the Secretary of Defense's authority, with an additional $400 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) under the Secretary of State's authority. The Department of Defense would be responsible for delivering the assistance, with a total of $5.1 billion in aid committed for Pakistan in 2010, mostly from bilateral sources. In 2010, aid committed for Pakistan totaled $5.1 billion, with 24% from multilateral agencies and 76% from bilateral sources. The United States was the largest bilateral donor, providing 56.3% of all commitments. Other significant donors included Japan (11.7%), Germany (5.5%), and the United Arab Emirates (1.7%). The largest multilateral commitments came from the World Bank, European Union, and Asian Development Fund. In April 2009, a group of countries and international institutions pledged $1 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the 2009-2010 period, in addition to the $5 billion already offered by the international community. The aid aimed to combat violent extremism, address economic and social development, stabilize border regions, tackle Pakistan's energy shortfall, and support democratic institutions. In addition to the $11.3 billion IMF package in 2008, Pakistani officials called for a $30 billion \"Marshall Plan\" over five years. The proposed $5.7 billion aid was criticized as small compared to US bailouts. The FODP summit in 2010 reiterated goals, pending detailed development proposals. Donors urged Pakistan to reform its economy at the Third Ministerial Meeting in October 2010. In October 2010, donors pressed Pakistan to reform its economy, focusing on expanding the tax base. China, a key ally of Pakistan, provided some aid and loans, but not as much as the United States and other major donors. China's investments in Pakistan, including extractive projects, aim to gain access to resources and potentially benefit from a planned gas pipeline from Iran. The Obama Administration values a stable, democratic, and prosperous Pakistan for its critical role in counterterrorism, nuclear nonproliferation, and regional stability. The FY2014 U.S. assistance focuses on counterterrorism efforts, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, and economic integration in Pakistan and the region. The Administration is requesting $1,162.57 million, with two-thirds for economic assistance and one-third for security assistance. $281.2 million is for Overseas Contingency Operations. Civilian assistance will target energy, stabilization, and social services. The FY2014 U.S. assistance in Pakistan focuses on energy, stabilization, social services (especially health and education), economic growth (including agriculture), and improving governance. Security assistance aims to build counterinsurgency and counterterrorism capabilities, strengthen military cooperation, and support security along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The Administration's budget request includes $765.7 million for energy, economic growth, education, health, and cross-cutting issues like gender equality and human rights. The FY2014 U.S. assistance in Pakistan focuses on energy, stabilization, social services, economic growth, education, and health. The $137.0 million request for ESF funds would promote international trade, develop manufacturing links, and support the private sector. The $53.0 million request would improve basic education programs and provide scholarships for economically disadvantaged students. The $58.0 million request would support improvements in delivering essential health services. The FY2014 U.S. assistance in Pakistan includes funding for essential family planning, maternal, and child health services, as well as support for gender equity, human rights, civil society, and good governance. Additionally, there is funding for military purposes, such as counterinsurgency and counterterrorism capabilities, military education and training, and nonproliferation efforts. In FY2014, the U.S. allocated $17.87 million for Pakistan under the NADR program to enhance counterterrorism capabilities and border security. Additionally, $45.0 million (plus $29.0 million of OCO funds) was allocated under the INCLE program to improve civilian law enforcement, combat illegal narcotics trafficking, and reduce opium poppy production. The Administration also emphasized community and third-party oversight of aid programs in Pakistan. In August 2011, USAID initiated a $71 million monitoring and evaluation contract to improve audit capabilities in Pakistan. Critics argue that U.S. assistance goals in Pakistan have not been fully achieved, partly due to an overreliance on security-related aid. Many suggest targeting aid programs to directly benefit Pakistani citizens. Concerns in Congress persist about Pakistan being a top recipient of U.S. aid. Issues in Congress regarding U.S. aid to Pakistan include concerns about its reliability as a partner and the idea of conditioning aid based on benchmarks for progress towards a more democratic state. Some suggest that conditionality should involve multiple donor countries and focus on the Pakistani leadership rather than the general public. In the late 2000s, there were calls from some senior Members of Congress to condition further U.S. aid to Pakistan on improvements in political crises and security circumstances. However, many analysts argue that conditioning aid could be counterproductive, leading to political instability in Pakistan. Enhanced cooperation and structured inducements are seen as more effective than pressure and threats. In a May 2011 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Senator Richard Lugar emphasized the need for a more effective approach to U.S. aid to Pakistan, suggesting a focus on identifying appropriate projects and maintaining consistency. A Washington-based analyst recommended a strategy of private admonitions to Islamabad, increased support for counterterrorism efforts, and establishing benchmarks for continued funding. Private admonitions are seen as ineffective without public consequences. Analysts suggest the U.S. increase pressure on Pakistan by imposing aid sanctions to deter support for militant groups. Islamabad is wary of aid conditionality due to past experiences, such as the Pressler Amendment in 1985. Calls for further conditionality from some in Congress led Islamabad to warn that such moves could harm the bilateral relationship and do damage to U.S. interests. The State Department in 2009 reported being \"comfortable\" with congressional conditions and \"confident\" that required certifications could be issued. Expert witnesses at a May 2011 Senate hearing asserted that certification and conditionality should be taken more seriously, but economic assistance to Pakistan should continue. Senator Carl Levin suggested aid sanctions to deter support for militant groups. Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, favored curtailing development over security aid to Pakistan, prioritizing short-term U.S. interests in combating terrorism. Pakistani officials argue against \"onerous\" aid restrictions, emphasizing the need for support. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 impose strict conditions on U.S. assistance to Pakistan. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 impose conditions on security-related assistance and arms transfers to Pakistan. The law requires the Pakistani government to cooperate with the U.S. in efforts to combat terrorism and dismantle supplier networks related to nuclear weapons. Pakistan has made progress in ceasing support to extremist groups, preventing terrorist organizations like al Qaeda and the Taliban from operating within its territory, and strengthening counterterrorism laws. Additionally, Pakistan is ensuring that its security forces are not interfering with political or judicial processes. The law requires the Secretary of State to certify that Pakistan is cooperating with the US in counterterrorist efforts against various terrorist organizations to release assistance funds. This includes ending support for these groups and preventing their activities. The law requires Pakistan to cooperate with the US in counterterrorist efforts, including ending support for terrorist organizations, preventing cross-border attacks, dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear proliferation, issuing visas for US visitors, and providing humanitarian access to civilians affected by conflict. The EPPA law required Pakistan to cooperate with the US in counterterrorist efforts, including a national security waiver. Secretary Clinton's certification in March 2011 was met with skepticism due to concerns about Pakistan's progress in counterterrorism and failure to act against Afghan insurgents. Clinton defended the certification during a House hearing in October 2011. In mid-2012, a second certification under the EPPA for Pakistan seemed difficult due to strained relations after the Salala border incident. Despite reopening supply lines, U.S.-Pakistan relations remained uneasy, leading to a decision on releasing planned FY2012 aid to Pakistan. In mid-August 2012, the State Department notified Congress of its intent to waive certification requirements of the EPPA for Pakistan, citing national security interests. Secretary Clinton later formally notified relevant committees of the waiver on security aid to Pakistan, with the justification delivered in classified form. The Administration waived Pakistan-related certification requirements under national security provisions to resume arms transfers. Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides removed restrictions on export licenses for defense equipment, now considered on a case-by-case basis. Aid effectiveness in Pakistan faces obstacles in governance reform and tax structure. US assistance aims to build governance capacity, improve political party competition, and promote participation. Secretary Clinton has urged Pakistan to implement tax reforms to mobilize its own resources and support its people during crises, emphasizing the need for the economically affluent to contribute. International donors, including the United States, are urging Pakistan to increase its tax revenue, with Secretary Clinton criticizing the country's low tax-to-GDP ratio and emphasizing the need for tax reform. The government has struggled to implement changes, including modest tax increases and reducing price subsidies in the energy sector. Pakistan has faced resistance in implementing economic reforms, including reducing price subsidies on electricity. Despite promises and recommendations from donors, the government has not made meaningful reforms, with corruption being endemic. The status quo remains due to vested interests benefiting from subsidized power, while ordinary consumers feel they are not receiving adequate service. The government's plea for patience from donors has not led to significant progress in policy reform. Corruption remains a persistent problem in Pakistan, hindering economic growth and investment. Transparency International ranked Pakistan 134th out of 183 countries for corruption levels in 2011. Despite efforts to address corruption, including a hotline for reporting misuse of funds, TI workers in Pakistan faced threats and harassment. The Islamabad government planned legal action against Transparency International for alleged bribery. Corruption and lack of transparency hinder U.S. aid programs in Pakistan, drawing attention in Congress. Calls for increased oversight by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction were made to address concerns of fraud and waste in aid to Pakistan and Afghanistan. The U.S. aid community faces challenges in keeping up with the rapid increase in activities in Pakistan. Concerns have been raised about the lack of comprehensive coverage and accountability in aid efforts. Efforts to improve accountability have been promised but evidence of progress is limited. U.S. funds to Pakistan have been mixed with other resources, raising transparency issues. The 2010 U.S. Inspectors General report highlighted challenges in accountability and reporting due to comingled resources. Foreign contractors in Pakistan have caused resentment for allegedly benefiting from aid funds. Concerns about corruption and misuse of aid have led to doubts about the effectiveness of U.S. assistance in Pakistan. Administrative costs are criticized for diverting aid from its intended beneficiaries. Roughly half of U.S. assistance for Pakistan is spent on administrative costs, including highly paid foreign experts. There is a debate on whether aid would be more effective if channeled through Pakistani agencies. The State Department planned to reduce the use of U.S. aid contractors in Pakistan under Ambassador Holbrooke's guidance. However, some analysts warn that Pakistan's civilian bureaucracies may not have the capacity to effectively implement aid programs. The 2011 GAO report highlighted risk mitigation strategies for USAID's increased reliance on local and Pakistani partners for economic assistance. Recommendations included implementing and monitoring efforts to address weaknesses in high-risk organizations and providing assistance through contracts, grants, or agreements to enhance accountability. In late 2010, USAID suspended a U.S.-based nonprofit organization due to serious corporate misconduct. Despite improved oversight, issues with USAID-run programs persist. A February 2011 report highlighted USAID's efforts to enhance accountability through pre-award assessments and oversight entities. During October-December 2010, audited U.S. aid development programs in the FATA showed little progress in achieving their goals. Despite initiatives for better aid management, auditors found a lack of overall progress. A late 2011 audit revealed that USAID's \"Firms Project\" in Pakistan was not on track to achieve its main goal two years after its launch. No measurable increases in sales were reported despite sustained efforts. The USAID's \"Firms Project\" in Pakistan, launched in May 2009, did not show any measurable increases in sales or employment in the five sectors engaged. Auditors found that the project did not meet agency standards, lacked procurement oversight, and failed to complete required evaluations. The project had to curtail activities in all sectors except mango, which also faced challenges. The project was criticized in a U.S. Senator's \"Wastebook\" for wasteful spending. Congressional pressure led to calls for better oversight of Pakistan assistance. The State Department report acknowledged oversight challenges in funding for Pakistani institutions due to an unstable security environment. Steps taken to address these challenges include pre-award assessments for all Pakistani organizations, establishment of oversight offices in Islamabad, fixed amount reimbursements for completed infrastructure work, a Transparency International hotline for reporting suspicious activity, increased personnel for monitoring, and nation-wide initiatives. The report highlighted security concerns in Pakistan, hindering the delivery of American aid and necessitating the involvement of Pakistani institutions. Monitoring and evaluating aid effectiveness is challenging, especially in regions like KPk and FATA due to security risks. Despite efforts to combat fraud and improve oversight, security issues continue to impede foreign assistance programs. The Pakistani army is carrying out U.S. aid projects in South Waziristan, but without USAID logos due to security concerns. Local support for projects is mixed, with some expressing dislike for America. Security issues have led to the halting of operations by organizations like Mercy Corps and the World Food Program in various regions of Pakistan. Militants have targeted vaccination workers in northwest Pakistan. In 2012, militants targeted vaccination workers in Pakistan, leading to 12 attacks. Public perception of NGOs in Pakistan is largely negative, exacerbated by a CIA-run fake vaccination campaign to locate bin Laden. This incident resulted in new restrictions on foreign aid operations and the expulsion of expatriate workers from organizations like Save the Children. The International Committee of the Red Cross closed several offices in Pakistan due to security concerns, including the suspension of operations in Peshawar and Karachi after a British national was beheaded. Anti-American sentiment is strong in the country, with a belief that long-term development aid is crucial for winning hearts and minds. Trust in foreigners can be influenced by foreign disaster assistance, as seen after the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan. Trust in foreigners in Pakistan was found to increase in areas closest to the fault-line after the 2005 earthquake. However, a rebuttal argues that there is little evidence that humanitarian aid promotes stability or improves public perceptions of the United States in Pakistan. The securitization of aid is also criticized for giving the military too much influence in humanitarian and reconstruction efforts. Some evidence suggests that even Pakistanis who benefitted from U.S.-funded aid after the 2010 floods did not change their negative views of the United States, despite over $700 million in assistance. This perception gap may be due to corruption, lack of awareness of aid sources, and security concerns in labeling aid as American. Some U.S. officials are pushing for international aid groups to give more credit to the United States for their assistance efforts, but many groups are hesitant due to security concerns. There are concerns that focusing too much on branding may prioritize short-term public diplomacy gains over long-term development improvements. Anti-American sentiment is also fueled by perceived sovereignty violations. The U.S. government has minimized its aid \"footprint\" in regions bordering Afghanistan due to security concerns following the Abbottabad raid and NATO raids in Pakistan. Aid projects are conducted covertly through Pakistani agencies, sacrificing public diplomacy gains. However, there is pressure for aid groups to openly advertise American assistance, with a previous ban on branding in the FATA being replaced with case-by-case evaluations in 2011. The U.S. Ambassador required the American flag to be added to the AID logo in Pakistan to increase awareness of aid sources, upsetting some aid organizations. Despite concerns, some Pakistanis believe branding is necessary for local awareness. CARE and other groups have rejected U.S. funding due to branding requirements. A coalition of U.S.-based NGOs praised the new approach but recommended greater accountability and effectiveness in civilian aid. In 2011, a working group endorsed the \"KLB approach\" to civilian aid for Pakistan, offering nearly 30 recommendations for changes. The Center for Global Development issued a report with 10 key recommendations to improve the U.S. development strategy in Pakistan. CGD analysts later criticized the government for lacking clear leadership and transparency in its development strategy for Pakistan. In early 2012, the Center for Global Development (CGD) sent recommendations to the State Department to improve U.S. aid to Pakistan, including expanding market access, establishing a new lending facility, and supporting the Diamer-Bhasha dam project. The report highlighted AID's support for Pakistani reformers but criticized the lack of effective metrics and obstacles to Pakistani access to U.S. markets. Major upheavals in U.S.-Pakistan relations in 2011 further strained the bilateral relationship. The Pakistani Parliament completed a review of ties with the U.S., calling for new restrictions on future engagement. Despite concerns about accountability and reforms, analysts emphasize the importance of stable Pakistan for U.S. strategic interests in the region. The newly seated government in Pakistan will pursue needed reforms, with a focus on maintaining close bilateral engagement to encourage democratization. Some in the 113th Congress question the return on large investments in Pakistan, a major recipient of U.S. aid. Lawmakers seek to balance aid expenditures for national security interests with budget cuts and accountability measures to address trust issues between the two governments. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 outlines key principles for U.S. aid to Pakistan, emphasizing mutual goals of combating terrorism, promoting democracy, and supporting social and economic development. The U.S. aims to supplement Pakistan's efforts, provide aid countrywide, support Pakistan's fight against extremism, and build mutual trust for security and prosperity. This includes strengthening democracy, the judicial system, and infrastructure development in all provinces. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 aims to support democracy, rule of law, and sustainable development in all provinces. It includes promoting education, healthcare, water management, and energy programs, encouraging public-private partnerships, and enhancing people-to-people engagement between the United States and Pakistan. Additionally, it focuses on improving counterterrorism financing, strengthening law enforcement and national defense forces, and ensuring full cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation efforts.
