Additionally, a continuing resolution funded most CJS and related agencies at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009, with supplemental funding for EDA, NOAA, and NASA. President Obama extended the CR through March 11, 2009, with funding levels above FY2008 appropriations for certain accounts. The CR required a third of Legal Activities funding to be transferred for the federal observer program under the Voting Rights Act. FY2008 emergency funding wouldn't count towards FY2009 levels for most agencies, except for the FBI. P.L. 110-329 also provided emergency funding for disaster relief for EDA, NOAA, and NASA. In FY2008, emergency funding was provided for various agencies including NOAA and NASA. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-252) was signed into law by President Bush, with funding allocated for DOJ, NASA, Census Bureau, and NSF. The Bush Administration submitted FY2009 budget amendments for DOJ, NASA, and NSF, addressing difficulties with the 2010 Census. Additional funding was requested for the FBI and NOAA. The amended request for CJS departments and agencies in FY2008 totaled $57.050 billion, exceeding the final appropriation by $1.090 billion. Congress also allocated $1.322 billion in emergency funding. The House Appropriations Committee approved a draft bill in June 2008, but it was not filed until December 2008, proposing $59.657 billion for CJS departments and agencies. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported an FY2008 CJS appropriations bill on June 29, 2008, providing departments and agencies with $60.724 billion, including funds for Commerce, Justice, science agencies, and related agencies.

The original FY2009 request included $56.563 billion for funded departments and agencies. The FY2009 budget request included $56.563 billion for departments and agencies funded through the CJS appropriation. This represented a 3.5% increase from the enacted FY2008 appropriation. Commerce saw a 19.8% increase, while Justice had a 2.1% decrease, mainly due to reductions in state and local law enforcement assistance. The FY2009 budget request included significant funding changes for various agencies. There was a proposed decrease in funding for the OVW and related agencies, while new funding was allocated for national security investigations and science agencies. The NSF and National Nanotechnology Initiative received funding, and the LSC would absorb a bulk of the decrease in related agencies. The FY2009 budget request included significant funding changes for various agencies, with a proposed decrease in funding for the LSC.

The Administration addressed equipment problems for the 2010 Decennial Census in a revised budget submission in June 2008. The Department of Commerce's funding increased to address the growing deficit in the U.S. current account. The American Competitiveness Initiative aimed to boost research and education with $50 billion in funding. Efforts were made to combat intellectual property infringement abroad and revise GDP measures for the health sector. The Administration is revising the measure of the health sector in GDP. There are concerns about the efficacy of U.S. trade agency enforcement against unfair foreign competition. There is a proposal to consolidate various programs under a Regional Development Administration. The Technology Innovation Program at NIST is being implemented, but there is no funding included in the Administration's budget. Federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership is being addressed despite the Administration's proposal to terminate support for the program. Aging equipment is also a concern. During consideration of the Administration's FY2009 budget request, issues brought to Congress' attention included oversight of the FBI's transformation towards combating terrorism, rising crime rates in medium-size cities, and funding levels for NOAA's satellite programs and research systems. The Administration's FY2009 budget proposal includes a reduction in federal law enforcement assistance programs and the consolidation of Office on Violence Against Women programs. Additionally, a $100 million Southwest Border Enforcement Initiative is proposed to combat illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and firearms smuggling across the Southwest border. The Administration's FY2009 budget request includes addressing the Southwest border with Mexico, a budget shortfall for the Bureau of Prisons, and the proposed elimination of a prisoner reentry initiative. Key science issues involve funding for the America COMPETES Act, which increases investment in science and engineering research and STEM education programs. The FY2009 budget includes funding for STEM education programs, the American Competitiveness Initiative, NASA budget priorities for space exploration, and funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The National Nanotechnology Initiative, with a budget of $396.8 million in FY2009, focuses on understanding and utilizing nanoscale properties. Congress debated funding the Legal Services Corporation at $311.0 million, a reduction from the previous year. The Department of Commerce, established in 1903, has various missions including promoting U.S. business and foreign trade. The Department of Commerce focuses on promoting U.S. business, increasing foreign trade, improving technological competitiveness, encouraging economic development, fostering environmental stewardship, and analyzing statistical information on the U.S. economy and population. Agencies within the Commerce Department, such as the International Trade Administration, Bureau of Industry and Security, Economic Development Administration, and Minority Business Development Agency, carry out these missions.

The FY2009 requested appropriation for the Department of Commerce was $8.217 billion, a 7.3% increase from FY2008. The Census Bureau saw the largest percentage increase at 118.0%, with funding shifted from other programs to support the 2010 Census. Funding reductions were proposed for various Commerce accounts to reallocate almost $546.0 million for the Census Bureau. The Department of Commerce requested a budget of $8.217 billion for FY2009, with funding reductions proposed for various programs within the department to reallocate funds for the Census Bureau. The House Committee recommended $8.707 billion for the Commerce Department, with reductions in funding for various agencies including the Minority Business Development Administration, Economics and Statistics Administration, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, the Administration requested cancellation of $70.0 million in unobligated balances associated with the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. The House Committee recommended $8.707 billion for the Commerce Department, 27.0% more than FY2008 enacted amount. The Senate Committee recommended $9.402 billion for Commerce, 37.1% more than FY2008 enacted amount. President Obama signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, appropriating $9.268 billion for Commerce, 12.8% more than President Bush's original FY2009 request. In FY2009, NOAA received 47.1% of Department of Commerce funding, followed by the Census Bureau at 33.9%. The National Institute of Standards and Technology received 8.8%, with the remaining entities getting 11.0%. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $7.916 billion for DOC, totaling $17.184 billion for FY2009. $5.350 billion was appropriated for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration for broadband deployment and digital TV conversion.

The ITA provides export promotion services, assures compliance with trade agreements, administers trade remedies, and provides analytical support for trade negotiations to improve U.S. prosperity. ITA has four policy units and an Executive and Administrative Directorate, including the Manufacturing and Services Unit responsible for industry analysis and promoting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, and the Market Access and Compliance Unit. The International Trade Administration (ITA) has five units: Manufacturing and Services, Market Access and Compliance, Import Administration, Trade Promotion/U.S. Foreign Commercial Service, and Executive and Administrative Directorate. The FY2009 enacted amount for ITA was $420.4 million, the same as the President's request and $15.2 million more than the FY2008 funding level. The FY2009 ITA budget included adjustments to base and a China Countervailing Duty Group Initiative, with budget increases and decreases for various programs. The House Appropriations Committee-approved bill proposed $425.4 million, while the Senate-reported bill proposed $420.4 million, both higher than the FY2008 funding level. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers export controls on dual-use goods and technology, cooperates with other nations on export control policy, and provides assistance to U.S. businesses to comply with export controls. BIS also monitors the U.S. defense industrial base. The authorization for BIS activities expired in August 2001, but President Bush invoked the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to continue controls. The FY2009 budget for BIS was $83.7 million, a $10.8 million increase from the previous year. The FY2009 funding request for BIS was $83.7 million, with $41.0 million for licensing activity, $36.8 million for enforcement activity, and $5.9 million for management and policy coordination. $14.8 million was allocated for Chemical Weapons Convention enforcement. The requested increase included $5.8 million for base restoration, $2.6 million for cost-of-living adjustments, and $2.4 million for new programmatic initiatives such as enhancing counter-proliferation efforts and adding export compliance specialists. In FY2009, BIS sought budget authority for 396 positions, with a funding request of $83.7 million. The Administration's budget amendment aimed to reduce the BIS budget by $500,000, but this was rejected in the Omnibus bill. The Senate version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included $20 million for BIS to upgrade its secure information technology systems, which was not approved in the final legislation. The June 9, 2008, amendment affirmed $2.4 million for new programmatic initiatives within the agency's original request of $83.7 million. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) was established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to help distressed communities generate and retain jobs through industrial and commercial growth. The Bush Administration in previous budget requests aimed to replace EDA assistance with lower-funded initiatives. The Bush Administration proposed consolidating EDA assistance programs under a new Regional Development Account (RDA) in FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests. Despite consistent rejection by Congress, the Administration continued to propose reductions in EDA assistance programs for FY2009, with a significant decrease in funding. The Bush Administration proposed consolidating EDA assistance programs under a new Regional Development Account (RDA) in FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests. Despite consistent rejection by Congress, the Administration continued to propose reductions in EDA assistance programs for FY2009, with a significant decrease in funding. The revised budget request sought to offset an increase in funding for decennial census activities by eliminating $7.2 million initially requested for EDA's public works grants and reducing funding for EDA salaries and expenses by $2.0 million, totaling a proposed reduction of $9.2 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $232.8 million in funding for EDA activities and salaries and expenses, $100.0 million more than requested by the Administration but $47.1 million less than appropriated in FY2008. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an appropriation of $282.8 million for EDA, including $250.0 million for economic development assistance. In FY2008, $282.8 million was allocated for EDA, with $250.0 million for economic development assistance and $32.8 million for salaries and expenses. This was $2.9 million more than the previous year's appropriation, $150.0 million more than the Administration's request, and $50.0 million more than the Senate's recommendation. Additionally, $100.0 million in supplemental funding was provided for disaster relief and infrastructure restoration. In FY2008, EDA received $779.9 million for disaster relief and infrastructure restoration related to natural disasters. In FY2009, EDA received a total of $422.8 million, including funding from omnibus legislation and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The MBDA, established in 1971, coordinates federal minority business programs. The MBDA aims to assist minority business owners in becoming suppliers to private corporations and the government. The FY2009 budget request was $28.6 million, a 1.4% increase from FY2008. Programs are delivered through National and Regional Enterprise Centers to support strategic growth firms. The MBDA requested $11.2 million for grants in FY2009, with Senate recommending $29.0 million, House recommending $31.5 million. The FY2009 Omnibus provided $29.8 million, a 4% increase over FY2008. No economic stimulus funds were allocated. The ESA provides economic data and analysis to government agencies and the public. The ESA, which includes the Census Bureau, BEA, and STAT-USA, has a core mission to compile economic data, interpret economic forces, and support the executive branch's information needs. The original FY2009 requested amount for ESA was $90.6 million, with BEA representing 96% of the budget request. The most prominent ESA programs are BEA's four statistical accounts. The ESA's core programs, including the National Income and Product Accounts, Regional Economic Accounts, Industry Input-Output Tables, and International Balance of Payments, support federal budget projections, state budget forecasts, and international agreements on exchange rates. An initiative to revise the measure of the health sector in GDP requested additional funds in FY2009. The Administration argued that health care spending is a crucial long-term issue for the federal budget due to increases in costs or services for an aging population. Improper measurement of productivity in health services could lead to errors in Medicare spending projections and impact compensation for service providers in federal programs. The Senate Committee recommended $90.6 million, 11.8% more than FY2008, while the House Committee recommended $89.1 million, 9.9% more than FY2008. The FY2009 Omnibus provided $90.6 million for ESA, an 11.8% increase. The FY2009 Omnibus (P.L. 111-8) provided $90.6 million for ESA, an 11.8% increase over FY2008. The Bureau of the Census conducts a census every 10 years under Title 13 of the U.S. Code. The Administration initially requested $2.605 billion to fund the Bureau in FY2009. The FY2009 Omnibus provided $1.230 billion for the Bureau, with $202.8 million for salaries and expenses and $1.027 billion for periodic censuses and programs. The large difference between the FY2009 request and FY2008 enacted amount primarily reflected preparations for the 2010 Census. The Bureau planned new initiatives, including reengineering the census for a short-form only enumeration to gather data for reapportionment and redistricting. The long-form questionnaire will be replaced by the American Community Survey. The American Community Survey (ACS) will replace detailed data from a sample of households. The ACS is an ongoing survey of about 250,000 households per month and will provide yearly long-form data by 2010. The Bureau is improving its Master Address File (MAF) and Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing mapping system (TIGER) to ensure accurate mailing of questionnaires. The Bureau is also working on automating pre-census address verification. The Bureau planned to automate pre-census address verification and post-census nonresponse follow-up processes, but due to delays and issues with handheld computers, traditional paper-based NRFU will be used instead. This change may increase the overall cost of the 2010 Census from $11.5 billion to between $13.7 billion and $14.5 billion. Additional funds will be needed for hiring more temporary census workers. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated extra funds for the 2010 Census, with an amended request for almost $546.0 million more. The total amended request for the Bureau was almost $3.140 billion, with an increase in the periodic censuses and programs account. House and Senate appropriators considered the amended request submission untimely. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an amount for the Bureau that exceeded the original FY2009 request by $546.4 million. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 funded the Bureau at $3.109 billion. The CR funded salaries and expenses at the FY2008 level until March 6, 2009, but gave periodic censuses and programs $2.906 billion. Funds could be used for additional promotion, outreach, and marketing activities. The Census Bureau received almost $3.140 billion in the Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2009, which was $1.700 billion more than the previous year. The salaries and expenses account received $233.6 million, while periodic censuses and programs received $2.906 billion. Additionally, a $1.000 billion supplemental appropriation was received through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to address issues with the 2010 Census. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) was established in 1978 within the Department of Commerce to manage federal radio frequencies. It plays a key role in spectrum management, facilitating negotiations among federal agencies. NTIA also serves as the principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information. Up to $250.0 million of funding was allocated for partnership and outreach efforts to minority and hard-to-count groups. The NTIA is the principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications policies. It aims to provide greater access to telecommunications services, open foreign markets, fund research grants for new technologies, and oversee frequency transfers. The NTIA's budget includes funds for salaries and expenses, as well as grant programs. The NTIA manages grants programs and receives appropriated funds for various programs, including the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. The agency also collects management fees from federal agencies to cover its costs. The Television Transition and Public Safety Fund received $2.7 billion from the 2008 auction of spectrum licenses for the transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting. The fund benefited the digital-analog converter box program ($1.5 billion) and public safety interoperable communications grants ($1 billion). The NTIA also manages grants programs for 911 services and new technologies. The NTIA and Department of Transportation were required to develop a National Plan for 911 transition to IP-enabled network. The USPTO examines and approves patents and trademarks, funded by user fees. The FY2009 budget proposed $2.075 billion for USPTO, with fee increases to be continued. The USPTO received budget authority to use fees at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009, and continued fee increases were mandated in the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Appropriations legislation was not enacted by the close of the 110th Congress, but the USPTO was given budget authority to spend fees collected in FY2008 and FY2007, with existing fee increases continued. The USPTO has been given budget authority to use all collected fees, which remains a controversial issue. Opponents argue that agency operations should be financed in the year expenses are incurred, while proponents believe limiting fee usage helps balance the budget. NIST, a Department of Commerce laboratory, aims to support U.S. companies by developing technologies and advancing government-developed innovations. NIST research supports the American economy by providing measurement techniques for U.S. commerce and public safety. In FY2009, the budget for NIST was reduced to $636.0 million, with increased funding for in-house research and development. In FY2009, NIST's budget was reduced to $636.0 million. In the 110th Congress, funding for NIST was proposed to increase to $816.9 million, with increases for the STRS account, TIP, and MEP funding. Construction support would decrease. The Senate proposed $813.5 million for NIST, with increases for the STRS account, TIP, and MEP funding. In FY2009, NIST's budget was reduced to $636.0 million. The final FY2009 appropriations legislation provided funding for NIST at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. In the 111th Congress, NIST was funded at $819.0 million with increases for the STRS account, MEP, and TIP. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided an extra $220.0 million for the STRS account. In 2009, P.L. 111-5 allocated $220.0 million for the STRS account for research and grants. An additional $360.0 million was provided for construction, with $180.0 million designated for research science buildings. $20.0 million was transferred from the Health Information Technology initiative to NIST for health security standards. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008, P.L. 110-161 funded NIST at $755.8 million, with a 1.4% increase for the STRS account. The Technology Innovation Program received $65.2 million in funding, a decrease of 17.6% from FY2007. Support for the MEP program decreased by 14.4% to $89.6 million. Funding for construction nearly tripled to $160.5 million. The Advanced Technology Program continued to receive support, with opponents criticizing it as \"corporate welfare\" while others defended its importance. In FY2006, support for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) was cut by 41.0%, leading to its replacement with the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) in 2007. The TIP focuses on small and medium-sized firms, receiving funding through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program funding has also been debated. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, administered by NIST, faced funding debates since FY2004. Congressional support remained steady, but funding decreased in FY2004. However, funding was restored in FY2005 and remained above 2004 levels in subsequent years. Funding was reduced in FY2008, and the President's FY2009 budget proposed further cuts. The President's FY2007 budget proposed doubling funding for innovation-enabling research at NIST as part of the American Competitiveness Initiative. The FY2008 omnibus appropriations provided a small increase in funding for NIST's core programs, and the President's FY2009 budget proposed an additional 21.5% increase in funding. The FY2009 budget proposed a 21.5% increase in funding for the STRS account and construction. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 also provided significant additional funding for NOAA's initiatives, which focus on understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and managing coastal and marine resources. NOAA conducts scientific research in various fields such as ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and water. The Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) discretionary account, the Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC) discretionary account, and \"Other Accounts\" fund various NOAA programs including the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund and Coastal Zone Management Fund. Budget authority for NOAA can be transferred from other agencies like the Promote and Develop American Fishery Products Fund from the Department of Agriculture. Additional budget authority may also be approved by Congress from unobligated appropriations of previous fiscal years. The Bush Administration's budget priorities for NOAA in FY2009 included using unobligated appropriations, recapitalizing aging facilities, ensuring satellite programs meet requirements, managing environmental data, and implementing the President's Ocean Initiative. The FY2009 budget request recommended $4.104 billion for NOAA, a 2.9% increase from the previous year. The FY2009 budget request for NOAA was $4.104 billion, with $2.840 billion for ORF, $1.233 billion for PAC, and $31.0 million for Other Accounts. The President's revised budget reprogrammed funds for hurricane forecasts without affecting the overall NOAA budget. The House CJS Subcommittee recommended $4.253 billion for NOAA in FY2009, a 6.6% increase from FY2008. The Senate CJS Subcommittee on Appropriations recommended a total of $4.446 billion for NOAA for FY2009, which was 11.5% higher than the FY2008 enacted funding level and 8.3% more than the Administration's request. Funding for NOAA discretionary accounts included ORF $3.055 billion, PAC $1.258 billion, and a net $133.0 million for Other Accounts. The President's request and recommendations for NOAA's Other Accounts included a $50.0 million Disaster Mitigation Fund to aid fishermen affected by fishery disasters. The Senate committee recommended substantial increases in funding for NOAA across the board for FY2009, with cuts proposed by the Administration for ORF funding affecting NOS, OAR, and NESDIS the most. The House committee recommended less funding for PAC due to a transfer of $32.4 million for construction to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Senate committee recommended substantial increases in funding for NOAA across the board for FY2009, with support for major NESDIS programs including funding for observation satellites. No final FY2009 appropriations legislation was enacted by the close of the 110th Congress. Funding for NOAA was provided at FY2008 levels through March 6 by the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-329). The Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-329) funded NOAA at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009, with additional funding for fisheries disaster assistance and hurricane forecasts. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) allocated $4.365 billion for NOAA, a 9.4% increase from FY2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provided $230.0 million for NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $230.0 million for NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account to address various activities. Additionally, $600.0 million was provided for NOAA's Procurement, Acquisitions, and Construction account for various purposes. The Department of Justice, established in 1870, provides legal counsel and representation for citizens in federal cases. The Department of Justice (DOJ) provides legal advice and opinions to the President and executive branch department heads. The DOJ agencies include United States Attorneys who prosecute criminal offenses, United States Marshals Service providing security for the federal judiciary, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigating federal criminal law violations and terrorism. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has jurisdiction over federal drug violations and coordinates with other law enforcement agencies. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces laws related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. The Federal Prison System (Bureau of Prisons) manages federal prison population and facilities. The Office on Violence Against Women coordinates initiatives to prevent violence against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Office of Justice Programs manages various bureaus and offices related to criminal justice. The Community Oriented Policing Services awards grants to law enforcement agencies for community policing initiatives. The federal role in crime control has increased since the Crime Control Act of 1968. Congress has passed five major crime control bills since 1984, allocating funds for new federal crimes and law enforcement programs. The FY2009 DOJ budget requested $23.128 billion, a reduction of $830.3 million from the previous year.

NASA, created in 1958, conducts civilian space and aeronautics activities from its headquarters in Washington, DC and nine major field centers. The agency requested $17.614 billion for FY2009, with the final appropriation totaling $17.782 billion. An additional $1.002 billion was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. There are now seven appropriations accounts, and changes in accounting for overhead expenses complicate comparisons between FY2009. The change in NASA's accounting for overhead expenses in FY2009 complicates comparisons with previous years. Overhead costs are now budgeted in a different account, affecting program budgets but not program content. This makes it challenging to directly compare amounts between the new and previous systems. NASA's budget priorities are driven by the Vision for Space Exploration, endorsed by Congress in 2005 and 2008. The Vision for Space Exploration, endorsed by Congress in 2005 and 2008, included goals such as retiring the space shuttle by 2010, completing the International Space Station by 2017, returning humans to the moon by 2020, and sending humans to Mars. President Bush did not propose increased funding for NASA to achieve these goals, leading to funding constraints on other NASA programs. President Obama's plans to modify the Vision are unclear. The requested $4.442 billion for Science in FY2009 saw a 6% decrease, with increases for Earth Science and Planetary Science offset by decreases for Heliophysics and Astrophysics. The FY2009 budget request for NASA Science saw a 6% decrease, with increases for Earth Science and Planetary Science offset by decreases for Heliophysics and Astrophysics. The decrease for Heliophysics was due to a transfer of networks to the Space Operations account. In Astrophysics, the NASA/Department of Energy Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) and the Space Interferometer mission (SIM) were of congressional interest, with funds included for JDEM but not for SIM. A new exoplanet exploration initiative could include a smaller version of SIM. In FY2008, the Senate report recommended $4.523 billion for NASA, including additional funds for various missions. The final appropriation of $4.503 billion included $150 million for Earth Science decadal survey missions, $10 million for a thermal infrared sensor (TIRS), and $20 million for lower-cost versions of SIM.

The FY2009 request for Space Operations, including the space shuttle, the ISS, and the Space and Flight Support program, was $5.775 billion. A requested decrease of $285.0 million for the space shuttle was largely offset by a requested increase of $247.0 million for the ISS. The gap between the end of shuttle flights in 2010 and the expected availability of Orion and Ares I in 2015 raises concerns about schedule pressure and U.S. dependence on Russia for launching astronauts to the ISS. The United States faces concerns about relying on Russia to launch astronauts to the ISS during the gap period. NASA's workforce retention during the transition from shuttle to Orion is a major issue. The House committee recommended $5.765 billion for Space Operations, with a provision for shuttle retirement costs report. The Senate committee recommended the same amount, and the final appropriation was $5.765 billion. The NSF was established in 1950 to support science and engineering.
