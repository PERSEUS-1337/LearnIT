    "content": "The Bankruptcy Code, found in Title 11 of the United States Code, is the primary source of bankruptcy law in the U.S. It is divided into nine chapters, with the first three containing provisions applicable to most cases. Other sources of U.S. bankruptcy law include the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which govern bankruptcy proceedings. The bankruptcy process in the United States is governed by a set of procedural rules, including local rules, official bankruptcy forms, and federal laws. Various participants play critical roles in bankruptcy proceedings, with certain sections of the Bankruptcy Code incorporating state law. Participants in the bankruptcy process, including the debtor, creditors, and bankruptcy judge, play crucial roles in seeking relief from debts, collecting debts efficiently, and overseeing proceedings. Bankruptcy judges are appointed by the U.S. Courts of Appeals for fourteen-year terms but do not have the same protections as U.S. District Judges under Article III of the Constitution. The U.S. Constitution restricts a bankruptcy judge's authority, with the United States Trustee overseeing cases to prevent fraud. The case trustee's role varies depending on the Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. The case trustee's role in bankruptcy cases varies depending on the Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. A debtor must file a bankruptcy petition and other required documents to declare bankruptcy. These filing requirements are designed to gather necessary information for the proper administration of the case. Filing a bankruptcy petition creates an estate of the debtor's property to satisfy creditors' claims and proceedings costs. Certain property may be excluded from the estate, such as assets acquired after filing. When filing for bankruptcy, certain assets may be exempt from the claims of creditors, allowing the debtor to protect essential property. This exemption is not available to non-individual debtors like corporations. Filing for bankruptcy also halts nonbankruptcy legal proceedings. The automatic stay in bankruptcy prevents creditors from pursuing claims against the debtor or their property, providing protection to the debtor's estate. It is triggered upon filing for bankruptcy and remains in effect until the case is closed, dismissed, or the debtor receives a discharge. The automatic stay in bankruptcy protects the debtor's estate from chaotic and wasteful litigation by providing a breathing spell from creditors. It prevents all collection efforts, harassment, and foreclosure actions, benefiting both debtors and creditors. Violating the stay can result in legal consequences, including potential recovery of damages and punitive damages. The automatic stay in bankruptcy protects the debtor's estate by halting collection efforts and foreclosure actions. Creditors must seek relief from the stay to take action against the debtor, showing cause for hardship outweighing the debtor's, or if the debtor lacks equity in the property. When filing for bankruptcy, the debtor must choose between liquidation, reorganization, or debt adjustment under different chapters of the Bankruptcy Code. Relief from the automatic stay can be granted to creditors in certain situations, such as when the debtor fails to make mortgage payments. The likelihood of obtaining relief varies depending on the circumstances. Bankruptcy proceedings involve different types of relief under various chapters of the Bankruptcy Code. Debtors may be eligible for multiple chapters, each with different procedures and forms of relief. Some debtors may only qualify for one chapter, while others may not be eligible for bankruptcy at all. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a common form of liquidation in the United States, with around half a million debtors filing for it each year. Companies like Bennigan's, IndyMac Bancorp, and Acclaim Entertainment have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The main goal of Chapter 7 is to liquidate the debtor's assets to pay off creditors, overseen by a trustee responsible for distributing the assets. Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves liquidating assets to pay off creditors and closing the estate. Individual and non-individual debtors are treated differently, with a means test determining eligibility for relief. The means test in Chapter 7 bankruptcy determines if a case should be dismissed or converted to Chapter 13. Non-individual debtors may also be eligible for Chapter 7, with the trustee taking control to benefit creditors. Some cases start as Chapter 11 but convert to Chapter 7. Non-individual debtors in Chapter 7 bankruptcy do not receive a discharge of debts to prevent businesses from evading liability. Corporate debt survives Chapter 7 proceedings and is charged against the corporation when it resumes operations. Despite the lack of discharge, some corporations choose Chapter 7 for an efficient asset liquidation process. Corporate debtors are expected to dissolve after filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the corporate debtor is expected to dissolve as its debts are not discharged. The case trustee sells the estate's property to pay off creditors according to a hierarchy of expenses and claims. Secured creditors have priority over unsecured creditors in receiving payment from the proceeds of collateral. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the corporate debtor dissolves as debts are not discharged. The case trustee sells property to pay off creditors based on a hierarchy of expenses and claims. Priority creditors are paid before lower priority creditors. Chapter 11 aims to reorganize the debtor's debt structure to continue operations, based on the concept that the debtor is more valuable as a going concern than in liquidation. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is preferred by debtors and creditors who believe that continuing the business as a going concern will create more value than liquidation. This chapter is primarily used by business debtors like corporations and LLCs, with examples including Kmart, General Motors, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is commonly used by business debtors, but individual debtors not engaged in business may also be eligible. The primary goal of Chapter 11 is to create a reorganization plan that adjusts the rights and obligations among the debtor, its debt, and equity holders to make the reorganized debtor economically viable. The plan becomes a binding contract between the debtor and creditors. Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows the debtor to remain in possession of assets and manage them for the benefit of creditors, unlike Chapter 7 where a trustee administers assets. This approach, known as debtor-in-possession, gives current management control to orchestrate the rehabilitation process, making Chapter 11 preferred over Chapter 7 for many managers. Chapter 11 allows the debtor to retain control of the firm as a debtor-in-possession, giving them flexibility in ordinary transactions without excessive oversight, while actions outside the ordinary course of business require court approval. Chapter 11 aims to reorganize financially distressed debtors through negotiation with stakeholders to create a viable economic entity. The debtor can propose a plan, but non-debtors have limited ability to do so. The process allows for creditor input and court oversight when transactions are not ordinary. The Bankruptcy Code establishes an initial exclusivity period for the debtor to file a plan dividing debt-holders and equity-holders into classes. A class is impaired if there is any alteration of a creditor's rights. The plan must specify how it will alter claims, treat all class members equally unless agreed otherwise, and provide means for implementation. Creditors can vote on proposed plans. Creditors affected by a bankruptcy plan vote on it after receiving a disclosure statement. The plan needs approval from creditors holding at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of allowed claims in a class. The court then decides if the plan becomes effective after a voting deadline. The court must hold a hearing to confirm a proposed Chapter 11 plan, which must satisfy the 'best interests of creditors' test. This test ensures that creditors receive at least what they would in a Chapter 7 liquidation. A Chapter 11 plan must pay creditors the amount they would receive in a Chapter 7 liquidation on the effective date, not over time. The plan must also be feasible to avoid liquidation or further financial reorganization of the debtor. The feasibility requirement in a Chapter 11 plan aims to prevent confirmation of unrealistic plans that promise more than the debtor can achieve. Plans that keep creditors waiting for payments while the debtor tries to sell unsellable assets are considered infeasible. The plan must either have all classes of impaired creditors accept it or meet the \"cramdown\" requirements to be confirmed by the bankruptcy court. The \"cramdown\" requirements of Section 1129(b) allow a plan to be confirmed even if it does not have unanimous acceptance from all impaired classes. The plan must still be fair and equitable, not discriminate unfairly, and satisfy the absolute priority rule for cramdown purposes. The cramdown provisions of the Bankruptcy Code allow a plan to be confirmed without unanimous acceptance from all impaired classes. A confirmed Chapter 11 plan binds the debtor, creditors, and other parties, with senior and junior claim-holders defined based on their hierarchy in the distribution of assets. The confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan vests all estate property in the debtor and discharges pre-confirmation debts. Creditors are prohibited from collecting discharged debts, and violating this injunction can lead to civil contempt proceedings. A confirmed plan creates a new contractual obligation between the debtor and interested parties, replacing pre-petition obligations. If the debtor fails to comply with the confirmed plan, consequences may follow. Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code allows individuals with regular income to reorganize their debts under court supervision. The purpose is to develop a repayment plan that may involve full repayment or a percentage settlement with creditors. A debtor must meet specific criteria to file under Chapter 13, and failure to comply with the plan can result in consequences. Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code allows individuals with regular income to reorganize their debts under court supervision, providing the debtor the advantage of remaining in possession of their property. Unlike Chapter 7, Chapter 13 allows debtors to keep assets like their home and car as long as they comply with their repayment plan. This chapter also enables debtors to save their home from foreclosure by curing mortgage defaults and arrearages. Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows individuals to reorganize debts under court supervision, enabling them to keep assets like their home and car by curing mortgage defaults and arrearages over time. Chapter 13 cases are overseen by a trustee who ensures timely payments to creditors and investigates the debtor's financial affairs. Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows individuals to reorganize debts under court supervision, enabling them to keep assets like their home and car by curing mortgage defaults and arrearages over time. Chapter 13 cases are similar to Chapter 11 cases in that both aim to confirm a plan that alters the debtor's relationships with creditors. In Chapter 13, only the debtor can file a proposed plan, and creditors cannot vote on it. If objections arise, the debtor must pay unsecured creditors in full or all projected disposable income over the next three to five years. Chapter 13 bankruptcy requires the debtor to pay creditors in full or use all projected disposable income over the plan's duration. The court must confirm a compliant plan, binding both the debtor and creditors. Payments are made through the Chapter 13 trustee, who collects and distributes them as outlined in the plan. Creditors cannot harass the debtor during repayment and must only receive payments as per the plan. Upon completion of payments, the debtor is granted a discharge of all debts specified in the plan. Chapter 13 bankruptcy requires the debtor to pay creditors in full or use all projected disposable income over the plan's duration. The court must confirm a compliant plan, binding both the debtor and creditors. Payments are made through the Chapter 13 trustee, who collects and distributes them as outlined in the plan. If the debtor fails to make timely payments, the Chapter 13 trustee may ask the court to dismiss the case or convert it to Chapter 7. Dismissal of a Chapter 13 case provides no relief for the debtor, as it restores the debtor to the status quo ante. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is preferred by debtors for a quicker discharge of obligations, especially if debts outweigh assets. However, Chapter 13 may benefit unsecured creditors more and policymakers prefer it as filers commit to paying as much debt as possible. The \"means test\" in Chapter 7 bankruptcy determines eligibility based on income and expenses. Chapter 12 offers similar relief to family farmers and fishermen to reorganize debts and continue operating their businesses. Chapter 12 debtors, classified as \"family farmers\" or \"family fishermen,\" can operate their businesses during bankruptcy. They must meet specific criteria, including debt limits and a percentage of debts related to farming or fishing. Chapter 12 shares similarities with Chapter 13, allowing debtors to pay creditors from future income. However, there are significant differences between the two chapters, with Chapter 12 being more permissive. Chapter 13 is less permissive than Chapter 12 regarding modifications of secured debt, especially for claims secured by residences. Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code allows municipal debtors to restructure debts to maintain essential services for residents. Municipalities cannot be liquidated, so Chapter 9 permits them to adjust debts to continue operations. The policy goals of municipal debt adjustment in Chapter 9 align with those of Chapter 11 reorganization. Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code allows municipal debtors to restructure debts to maintain essential services for residents while preserving state sovereignty. Unlike Chapter 11, Chapter 9 limits the bankruptcy court's interference with political or governmental powers to protect the petitioner's sovereignty. Municipal bankruptcies may become more common as cities and towns face fiscal distress. Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code was enacted to facilitate international cooperation in cross-border insolvencies. It authorizes ancillary proceedings in US bankruptcy courts to assist foreign insolvency proceedings. This chapter complements filings under Chapter 9, which allows municipal debtors to restructure debts while maintaining essential services. High-profile examples of Chapter 9 filings include Detroit, San Bernardino, and Jefferson County. Chapter 15 filings in the United States are rare, and a bankruptcy court can convert a case from one chapter to another under certain circumstances, such as gross mismanagement of assets. This conversion can maximize distribution to creditors. Most bankruptcy cases aim for a discharge of the debtor's debts, voiding personal liability judgments. The Bankruptcy Code specifies certain categories of debts that are presumptively or categorically nondischargeable in bankruptcy, such as debts for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft. Attempting to collect on a discharged debt may result in punishment by contempt of court. The Bankruptcy Code specifies certain categories of debts that are presumptively or categorically nondischargeable in bankruptcy, such as debts for personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a vehicle while intoxicated. Additionally, a debtor may not discharge domestic support obligations or debts for willful and malicious injury to another entity. Student loans are generally not dischargeable unless it would impose an undue hardship. Liens against the debtor's property continue despite a bankruptcy discharge, which only relieves personal liability on the debt. A bankruptcy court may deny a discharge to debtors who commit misconduct or fail to comply with requirements. Filing for bankruptcy too soon after a previous discharge may also make a debtor ineligible for discharge."
