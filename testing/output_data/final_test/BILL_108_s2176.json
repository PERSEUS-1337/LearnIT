    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004\". Congress finds that high-end computing is crucial for scientific advances, defense capabilities, and commercial competitiveness in the 21st century. The United States is no longer leading in high-end computing globally, and new architectures need to be developed to enhance memory and network bandwidth. Software improvements for high-end systems are also necessary. The Department of Energy and the Office of Science are well-suited to lead research in high-end computing, networking, and information technology. Government support is essential for driving innovation in high-end computing as market forces alone are insufficient. Research efforts should focus on optimal algorithms, programming environments, tools, languages, and operating systems for high-end computing. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"high-end computing system\" refers to a computing system with performance exceeding commonly available systems, including various architectures. \"Institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, acting through the Director of the Office of Science. The term \"ultrascale scientific computing capability\" refers to a computing capability that is at least 100 times the existing capability in the United States, supporting open scientific research. The High-End Computing Systems Program, as defined in SEC. 4, aims to enhance computing capabilities for open scientific research in the United States. The Secretary shall conduct a program of research and development to advance high-end computing systems, supporting individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams. Research will cover multiple architectures and software development for optimal algorithms, programming environments, and operating systems. The Secretary will develop facilities for researchers to work on ultrascale scientific computing capabilities, support technology transfer, and coordinate with relevant industry and federal agencies. The Secretary will develop ultrascale scientific computing capabilities for research and development, support multiple high-end computing system architectures, and conduct research on proposals for advancements in computing technology. The Secretary will establish a High-End Software Development Center to focus on developing, testing, and supporting algorithms, programming environments, and operating systems for high-end computing systems. The center will have a research staff and rotating researchers from other institutions. The Secretary will establish a High-End Software Development Center with a rotating staff of researchers to assist in research coordination and technology transfer. The Center will assess high-end computing system architecture and its location will be determined through a competitive proposal process. All awards will undergo independent peer review, and no funds will support classified research or facilities. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n- $155,000,000 for fiscal year 2006\n- $160,000,000 for fiscal year 2007\n- $165,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- $170,000,000 for fiscal year 2009\n- $100,000,000 for Ultrascale Scientific Computing Capability\n- $10,000,000 for High-End Software Development Center"
