    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" summarizes the title and key findings of a section. The \"Patient Right To Know Act of 1996\" emphasizes the importance of providing patients with all relevant information for making healthcare decisions. It addresses concerns about restrictions on healthcare providers disclosing information and the impact of health plans' policies on patient care quality. The operation of health plans impacts commerce among states and the quality of care for patients. It is necessary to ensure uniform treatment of health care providers and patients across states, covering plans operating within one state and among several states. SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF INTERFERENCE WITH CERTAIN MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS. An entity offering a health plan is prohibited from restricting or interfering with medical communication with a healthcare provider. They cannot take adverse actions such as refusing to contract, terminating contracts, refusing to refer patients, or refusing to compensate the provider. In this section, any refusal to compensate a health care provider for covered services or any other retaliatory action is null and void. Medical communication is defined as any communication made by the provider regarding a patient's health care needs or treatment and the provisions of the health plan. Medical communication includes communications between the provider and a patient, employee of a health plan entity, or a State/Federal authority. It covers tests, consultations, treatment options, and associated risks or benefits. The curr_chunk discusses the variation among healthcare providers and institutions in experience, quality, and outcomes, as well as the decision-making process for authorizing or denying healthcare services. It also mentions financial incentives provided to healthcare providers based on service utilization. Violations of these regulations may result in civil money penalties. The curr_chunk outlines civil money penalties for violations, with fines of up to $25,000 or $100,000 for repeated violations within 5 years. It references procedures under the Social Security Act and defines a health care provider as someone licensed to provide health care services. The term \"provider\" refers to a licensed individual who offers health care services. A \"health plan\" includes any public or private arrangement providing health benefits, and the \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Third party administrators or individuals managing contracts with health care providers are covered under employee welfare benefit plans. The section allows states to enforce requirements for medical communications if they offer more protection than federal regulations. It does not mandate health plans to contract with any provider or restrict them from acting on treatment information or non-compliance with care standards. Effective Dates for the provision of care standards under the Act: Contracts entered into or renewed after enactment, retaliatory actions taken after enactment, and nullification of provisions as of enactment date."
