    "content": "During the early history of the United States, trails were used for commerce and migration. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the first interstate recreational trail, was developed in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1968, the National Trails System Act was enacted, starting with two scenic trails. President Lyndon Johnson called for more trails to be created across the country in 1965. The National Trails System Act, enacted in 1968, designated the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. This system now includes 30 National Historic Trails and National Scenic Trails, covering almost 55,000 miles in total. Additionally, there are over 1,200 National Recreation Trails and 6 connecting or side trails. Congress designates NSTs and NHTs, with the Secretary of the Interior involved in the process. Prior to establishing a trail, Congress directs the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture to study the route for potential inclusion in the system. The studies address suitability and feasibility of adding the trail, with additional criteria for National Historic Trails (NHTs) including historic significance and potential for public recreational use. National Recreation Trails can be designated by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture. Trails can be designated by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture with consent from relevant authorities. They must be accessible to urban areas and meet specific criteria. The Secretaries can also designate connecting and side trails. Limited federal land acquisition is allowed for trail development. The Secretaries may acquire land within their administrative jurisdiction for National Scenic Trails and National Historic Trails. Outside their jurisdiction, they encourage state and local governments to acquire trail land. The Secretaries encourage state and local governments to acquire trail lands or enter agreements with private landowners. Federal land acquisition for NRTs is limited to existing administrative boundaries. Congress includes specific land acquisition provisions when adding trails to the system. Federal land management agencies have the authority to purchase land from willing sellers for trails. The federal land management agencies have the authority to purchase land from willing sellers for national scenic and historic trails. The trails are administered by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, with the NPS, FS, BLM, and joint NPS and BLM administration. The administering agency develops trail management plans, oversees trail development, coordinates marking and mapping, and provides financial assistance for trail purposes. The distinction between trail administration and trail management is emphasized. The National Trails System Act allows for cooperative agreements between administering agencies and various entities for trail development and maintenance. Federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding in 2006 to coordinate federal trail management. National Recreation Trails are typically administered by states, localities, and private organizations, with federal agencies involved on federal lands. The National Park Service coordinates national recreation trails, including nonfederal trails.

National Recreation Trails are typically administered by states, localities, and private organizations, with federal agencies involved on federal lands. The National Park Service coordinates national recreation trails, including nonfederal trails. Nonfederal trail managers have access to federal training and technical assistance, and are eligible for some types of federal funding. The six existing trails are all administered by the Secretary of the Interior. The FY2013 annual report of the Federal Interagency Council on Trails discussed management issues facing the agencies, such as tight federal agency budgets, financial constraints among partner groups, inconsistent mapping, aging volunteers, and challenges from energy projects affecting the trails. Another challenge cited was the lack of awareness among many Americans of the system and its benefits. The administering Secretary may regulate the use of federally. The administering Secretary may regulate the use of federally owned portions of national trails, permitting activities like bicycling, hiking, equestrian activities, and more. Motorized vehicles are typically prohibited on national scenic trails but may be allowed on national historic trails if they do not interfere with the trail's nature and purposes. State and local agencies, along with private-sector trail managers, collaborate on managing national trails. Each agency has its own funding for trail activities. Federal land management agencies coordinate funding for the National Trails System to avoid duplication. The Department of Transportation has provided over $11 billion for bicycle and pedestrian projects since 1992. Other funding sources include challenge cost-share projects and cooperative agreements. In the 114th Congress, funding for trails has come from various sources including challenge cost-share projects, cooperative agreements, charitable foundations, corporations, permits and fees, local excise taxes, and dedicated funds. Proposed bills would designate new trails like the Condor National Recreation Trail in California and the Chief Standing Bear National Historic Trail in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. Additionally, a new type of trail called \"national discovery trails\" is being considered to connect representative examples of America's trails and communities."
