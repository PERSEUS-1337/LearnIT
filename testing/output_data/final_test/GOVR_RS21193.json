    "content": "Established in 1971, the Nasdaq stock market is an all-electronic trading facility that facilitates the trading of OTC stocks through a network of market makers. Originally a subsidiary of the nonprofit NASD, it became independent in 1996 with the establishment of NASD Regulation to separate regulation from operation. The NASDR became the primary regulator of broker-dealers and the Nasdaq, funded by fees and fines from member firms. Nasdaq faced competition from global markets and ECNs like SuperMontage and Brut. The world's major stock markets are reexamining their governance and capital structures to react more effectively to the changing securities marketplace. Demutualization, converting from privately-held to shareholder-owned status, has become a popular strategic response. Exchanges like London, Tokyo, Philadelphia, and the New York Stock Exchange have demutualized to raise capital and align their interests with the market. The Nasdaq announced its intent to demutualize in 1999, raising concerns about for-profit, shareholder-owned SROs regulating entities like broker-dealers with ownership stakes in competitors. The NYSE also considered demutualization but cited other pressing concerns. In April 2000, the NASD membership approved spinning off Nasdaq from the non-profit NASD and converting it into a shareholder-owned market. The process involved issuing privately placed stock, converting to technical exchange status, and issuing public stock. The private placement reduced NASD's ownership interest in Nasdaq from 100% to 60%, and then to 40% in January 2001. Nasdaq acquired 13.5 million shares from NASD in February 2002 and 20.3 million shares in March 2001, leaving 43.2 million shares still owned by NASD in the form of warrants. A new series of preferred voting stock was issued to NASD to maintain majority voting interest. Nasdaq is currently exempt from being classified as an \"exchange\" under SEC rules due to NASD operation. Nasdaq acquired shares from NASD to reduce its control. Nasdaq applied for exchange status with SEC, facing concerns about trade execution protocol. The protocol known as price and time priority is required by exchanges like Nasdaq and NYSE. Limit orders are processed, with better-priced orders receiving priority execution. Nasdaq market makers may ignore well-priced limit orders outside their own order books through internalization. Nasdaq's market allows competing dealers to add liquidity by interacting with their own order flow, but SEC officials have concerns about the absence of price priority. Despite delays in approval, Nasdaq became a registered national securities exchange in 2006, taking on self-regulatory responsibilities. Nasdaq previously had a Regulatory Services Agreement with the NASD for regulatory functions. Nasdaq is now a registered exchange but cannot fully operate independently until certain conditions are met, including joining national market system plans, the NASD relinquishing control, and regulatory plans being approved by the SEC. The Exchange Act of 1934 designates NASD as the regulator for certain activities of common members. Nasdaq's exchange application limits transactions to the Nasdaq Market Center, with rules on intramarket priorities. Orders internalized by NASD broker dealers not following priority rules will be reported through the Trade Reporting Facility (TRF), administered by NASD. Nasdaq will earn revenues from TRF trades, a point of contention for rivals."
