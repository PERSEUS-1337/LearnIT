    "content": "The Act titled \"Public Access to Historical Records Act\" establishes an official dataset on historical temperature records. NASA will establish an official dataset on the historical temperature record using raw data from temperature stations and vessels, reexamining records to quantify statistical uncertainty and identify gaps in the data. The Administrator will fully identify and explain any gaps in temperature station data or temperature reading data. A panel of seven individuals will assist in establishing the required dataset. A panel of seven individuals, appointed by the Administrator from the private sector, will assist in establishing a dataset for global climate research. Panel members must have expertise in meteorology and statistics, no financial interest in the matter, and no recent funding from the Federal Government for climate research activities. Their duties include determining data sources and setting standards for the dataset. The Administrator will establish standards for determining confidence levels in historical global temperature data and conduct independent verification and validation of the dataset every three years through a contract with an external entity. The Administrator will contract an entity with personnel skilled in computer programming, software development, statistics, and meteorology to verify or validate the dataset. The entity will perform activities specified in the contract, including reviewing data interpolation. The Administrator will contract an entity to verify or validate the dataset, including reviewing data interpolation codes to eliminate bias. Algorithms and determinations made in the verification process will be made public. Upon completion of the dataset on historical temperature records, all global climate research funded by the Federal Government must use it as the primary or one of the primary sources for global temperature data. Additionally, any findings on climate change must include the dataset as a primary source. Temperature station data will be publicly released. The Secretary of Commerce is required to release raw temperature station data to the public in digital format. An analysis comparing raw and final temperature datasets must also be released in numerical and graphical form. SEC. 5. ACCURACY OF DATA PROCESSING AND DATA ADJUSTMENT. The applicable Federal official must publish any coding or algorithm used in data processing for compliance with section 2 or 4 on the agency's public website. Requests for correction of coding or algorithms will be processed according to the guidelines of the Information Quality Act. According to the Information Quality Act, federal agencies must adjust data in compliance with guidelines, including making coding and processes used in data adjustment publicly available. The Information Quality Act requires federal agencies to adjust data in accordance with guidelines, including making peer review comments, previous changes, citations, and non-biased data and algorithms publicly available. The Information Quality Act mandates federal agencies to adjust data using non-proprietary algorithms and processes. Agents and contractors involved in data adjustment must comply with the Freedom of Information Act. The certification and method for data adjustment must be made available upon request for independent replication. The Information Quality Act requires federal agencies to adjust data using specific methods and definitions. The term \"applicable Federal official\" is defined for actions under different sections, and the term \"Information Quality Act\" refers to a specific section of an appropriations act."
