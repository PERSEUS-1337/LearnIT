    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Winnemem Wintu Tribe Clarification and Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the tribe. Congress finds that the Winnemem Wintu Indian Tribe was entitled to be included in the 1979 acknowledgement process for federally recognized California tribes. The trust status of the Tribe was reaffirmed by the Act of July 30, 1941, which granted tribal land to the United States. The Secretary created the Shasta Reservoir Indian Cemetery on January 5, 1942, where Winnemem Wintu remains are held in trust. The Winnemem Wintu remains were relocated to a new cemetery on Federal trust land after their traditional cemetery was flooded. The Secretary overlooked the Tribe's trust status, which was reaffirmed through partial restitution for tribal land taken and relocation of remains in 1941. The ongoing trust relationship with the Federal Government should have been recognized. The Tribe's trust status with the Federal Government should have been recognized, and they should have been included in the 1979 listing of federally recognized California tribes. The Tribe has chosen not to conduct gaming as it would harm their traditional tribal culture. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"service area\" includes Shasta and Siskiyou counties in California. The term \"Tribe\" refers to the Winnemem Wintu Tribe of northern California. Federal status is restored to the Winnemem Wintu Tribe of northern California. All applicable laws to Indians and tribes are applicable to the Tribe. Rights and privileges lost under a specific law are restored, and federal services and benefits eligibility are provided without conditions. The Winnemem Wintu Tribe of northern California has federal status restored, making them eligible for all federal services and benefits available to federally recognized Indian tribes or their members. Members residing in the service area are considered to be residing on a reservation for the purposes of receiving these benefits. Receipt of services and benefits by the Tribe or its members will not be considered as income. The Act ensures that benefits received by the Winnemem Wintu Tribe or its members will not affect their eligibility for federal programs. It also clarifies that the Act does not impact the Tribe's hunting, fishing, trapping, gathering, or water rights. The Act does not alter any property, contractual, or tax obligations, except as specified. The Secretary will take a 42.5-acre site into trust for the Tribe as their reservation within 1 year of the Act's enactment.
