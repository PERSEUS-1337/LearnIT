    "content": "The \"United States-Mexico Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Act\" directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to assess priority transboundary aquifers and provide a scientific foundation for addressing water resource challenges in the border region. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as aquifer, Border State, and Indian tribe, with specific criteria outlined for each. The Act provides definitions for terms like aquifer, Border State, and Indian tribe, with specific criteria outlined for each. A priority transboundary aquifer is designated for study under the program, which is the United States-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program. A reservation is land set aside for an Indian tribe, with boundaries defined in various ways. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like transboundary aquifer, Tri-Regional Planning Group, and water resources research institutes. These terms are crucial for understanding the United States-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program. The curr_chunk establishes a program related to the United States-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment. The Secretary will work with various entities to conduct the US-Mexico transboundary aquifer assessment program, aiming to characterize and map groundwater resources along the border. The program's objectives include identifying and prioritizing transboundary aquifers for further analysis. The program aims to prioritize transboundary aquifers based on factors like population density, usage, contamination susceptibility, and other relevant criteria. It involves evaluating data, creating a database, and conducting field studies to develop study plans for each priority aquifer. The program aims to prioritize transboundary aquifers based on factors like population density, usage, contamination susceptibility, and other relevant criteria. It involves field studies to develop additional data for defining aquifer characteristics and creating scientifically sound groundwater flow models to assist with water management. Existing agreements are to be expanded for joint scientific investigations. The program prioritizes transboundary aquifers like the Hueco Bolson and Mesilla aquifers for joint scientific investigations, data sharing, and producing scientific products to assist water managers on both sides of the United States-Mexico border. The Secretary will evaluate and designate priority transboundary aquifers, including the Hueco Bolson and Mesilla aquifers in Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico, and the Santa Cruz River Valley aquifers in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. Cooperation with Mexico is essential for a comprehensive assessment of these aquifers, with grants and agreements available for research institutes and Border State entities. The Secretary will designate priority transboundary aquifers like the Hueco Bolson and Mesilla aquifers in Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico, and the Santa Cruz River Valley aquifers in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. Grants and agreements are available for research institutes and Border State entities to carry out the program. The implementation of the program includes designating priority transboundary aquifers for research and providing grants and agreements for research institutes and Border State entities. The Secretary must coordinate activities with water resource agencies in Border States, affected Indian tribes, and other entities conducting monitoring of priority transboundary aquifers. No new field studies can be initiated without consulting Border State water resource agencies. The Secretary will work with relevant entities to develop study plans and cost estimates. The Secretary must coordinate with water resource agencies, Indian tribes, and other entities to develop study plans, timelines, and cost estimates for priority transboundary aquifers. The study plan should integrate existing data, improve groundwater flow models, and align with State guidelines and goals. SEC. 6. EFFECT.\n\nThis Act does not impact the jurisdiction of Border States over surface or groundwater resources, nor does it affect water rights from transboundary aquifers.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORTS.\n\nWithin 5 years of enactment, the Secretary must submit interim and final reports to Border States' water resource agencies detailing program activities, conclusions on aquifer status, and Mexican entity participation.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$50,000,000 authorized for fiscal years 2005-2014. 50% allocated to water resources research institutes for binational scientific data exchange with Border States and Mexico."
