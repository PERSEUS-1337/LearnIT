    "content": "Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress authorized the President to use force against those involved. This led to the capture of individuals suspected of ties to Al Qaeda or the Taliban, who were then transferred to Guantanamo Bay. Legal questions arose regarding wartime detention and the Executive's authority in such cases. Justice Stevens played a crucial role in Supreme Court decisions regarding Guantanamo detainees' access to habeas review, addressing both statutory and constitutional rights. His opinions in Rasul v. Bush and Hamdan v. Rumsfeld set the legal groundwork for the landmark 2008 decision in Boumediene v. Bush. The Court's approach in these cases shaped its review of military commission procedures and the balance of powers. Justice Stevens played a significant role in Supreme Court decisions on Guantanamo detainees' access to habeas review, shaping the Court's approach to reviewing military commission procedures and the balance of powers during wartime. In cases like Rumsfeld v. Padilla, he advocated for addressing separation-of-powers questions raised by wartime detentions, emphasizing the Court's duty to tackle important national issues. The writ of habeas corpus is of profound importance to the Nation, with its historical roots deep in common law. It serves as the primary means to challenge executive detentions, and federal courts have jurisdiction to grant it to those whose custody violates the law. The U.S. Constitution does not mention the writ, but a federal statute provides for its use in specific circumstances. Justice Stevens emphasized the importance of upholding the ideals symbolized by the flag, even in times of conflict. The writ of habeas corpus is crucial for challenging executive detentions, with Supreme Court justices emphasizing its historical significance. In INS v. St. Cyr, Justice Stevens highlighted the traditional role of the writ in limiting executive detention authority. In INS v. St. Cyr, Justice Stevens emphasized the historical significance of the writ of habeas corpus in challenging executive detentions, highlighting its role in limiting executive detention authority. This view informed his approach in post-9/11 cases, where he supported civilian courts' intervention in military commission proceedings. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justices Stevens and Scalia disagreed on the domestic detention of a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan. They both believed that the Executive's power was exceeded in this case. In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justices Stevens and Scalia disagreed on the Executive's power regarding military exigency and detention without charge for non-citizens. Scalia argued for jurisdiction ending at U.S. sovereign territory, while Stevens interpreted executive authority narrowly for non-citizens in Guantanamo. Justice Scalia advocated for bright-line rules, limiting jurisdiction to U.S. sovereign territory, while Justice Stevens favored a case-specific approach, extending rights and jurisdiction to Guantanamo detainees. This difference led to the Court resolving wartime detention cases on their merits, with numerous Guantanamo detainees filing habeas petitions post-9/11. The Rasul case involved petitions from non-citizens challenging their detentions, questioning whether the federal habeas statute granted jurisdiction for such cases. The federal habeas statute granted jurisdiction to consider petitions brought by non-citizens in Guantanamo, despite the government arguing against extraterritorial application. Supreme Court precedents did not definitively address the issue, with past cases upholding jurisdiction over habeas corpus challenges for persons detained in the U.S. In Johnson v. Eisentrager, the Court ruled against jurisdiction for petitioners serving sentences in Germany after a trial by a U.S. military commission in China. Justice Stevens, in Rasul, relied on case-specific factors to support extending rights and jurisdiction to Guantanamo detainees. In Rasul, Justice Stevens distinguished Guantanamo detainees from Eisentrager petitioners, emphasizing key differences in their status and the jurisdictional control over Guantanamo Naval Station. Justice Stevens relied on a second line of argument to support the Court's holding in an agreement with Cuba. He recalled Ahrens v. Clark, a case decided prior to Eisentrager, interpreting the federal habeas statute as not providing jurisdiction for petitions brought by persons outside a court's territorial jurisdiction. Justice Stevens's historical understanding, particularly given the sparse precedent on extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus rights, may have been persuasive to some justices. Justice Scalia's dissent in Rasul rejected Justice Stevens's distinctions in favor of a bright-line rule, citing Eisentrager. The petitioner in Hamdan, a Yemeni national captured in Afghanistan and detained at Guantanamo, challenged the use of military commissions for his trial. He argued that the Executive lacked authority for this and that the military commission procedures violated the law. The petitioner in Hamdan challenged the use of military commissions for his trial, arguing that they violated the law. The government urged the Court to dismiss the case based on a provision of the Detainee Treatment Act. Justice Stevens wrote the main majority opinion in a complicated set of opinions by the justices. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Justice Stevens led a majority opinion rejecting the argument that the Detainee Treatment Act removed federal courts' jurisdiction over Hamdan's habeas challenge. The Court held that the offense of \"conspiracy \u2026 to commit offenses triable by military commissions\" could not be tried by military commission. The military commissions' procedures were found to violate the Uniform Code of Military Justice and international laws of war. The UCMJ provisions regulate military commissions, and an Executive Order in 2001 governed the detention and trial of non-citizens with Al Qaeda connections. The Court held that the power to create military commissions must come from the Constitution and be a joint power of the President and Congress during wartime. It viewed statutes as acknowledging Presidential authority to convene military commissions under the Constitution and laws of war. The Supreme Court ruled that special military trials must have a constitutional basis of authority and that even alleged Al Qaeda members like Hamdan are protected by the Geneva Conventions. Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito dissented, with Scalia arguing that federal courts lack jurisdiction over Hamdan's habeas petition under the Detainee Treatment Act. Scalia also disagreed with the majority on retroactivity and separation-of-powers concerns, suggesting that the Court should not exercise jurisdiction due to military exigencies. The Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan addressed the constitutionality of special military trials for detainees like Hamdan. Justice Alito's dissent argued for deference to the President's interpretation of treaty language. The unresolved constitutional question was whether the Suspension Clause prevented Congress from stripping federal courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges. Congress enacted a provision in 2006 to remove federal courts' jurisdiction over habeas challenges brought by aliens held as enemy combatants. The pending cases involved aliens held in U.S. custody as enemy combatants, raising a constitutional question. Boumediene v. Bush was a case that addressed this issue. Justice Stevens played important roles in the case, signaling a willingness to review it and assigning the majority opinion to Justice Kennedy. This decision was crucial in maintaining a five-justice majority. Justice Stevens played a crucial role in developing post-9/11 jurisprudence on the limits of executive power during armed conflicts, particularly in cases like Rasul and Hamdan. These cases provided insights into the Court's views on executive authority and separation of powers, with implications for future non-traditional conflicts. The 9/11 attacks marked a shift in how wars are waged, and decisions like Rasul and Hamdan are likely to set important precedents in the future. Justice Stevens's jurisprudential views on executive power in wartime, influenced by his experience as a World War II veteran and clerk for Justice Rutledge, have shaped his case-specific approach. This approach is likely to have both short-term and long-standing effects, especially in upcoming reviews of military commission procedures. The Court will review newly enacted military commission procedures, impacting future decisions on the rights of aliens held outside U.S. territory under the Constitution."
