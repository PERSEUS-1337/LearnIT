    "content": "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has undergone multiple short-term reauthorizations since 2017, with the last long-term reauthorization being the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. The NFIP, managed by FEMA, was last reauthorized by the BW-12 from 2012 to 2017. It had 5.1 million policies with $1.3 trillion coverage and collected $3.6 billion in premiums annually. The program saved $1.87 billion in flood losses annually. The NFIP, managed by FEMA, was last reauthorized by the BW-12 from 2012 to 2017. This report provides introductory information on key components of the NFIP, ranging from floodplain mapping to standard flood insurance forms. It will be updated with significant revisions to the NFIP through legislation or administrative action. Congress stipulated that flood insurance promotes the public interest by providing protection against flood losses and encouraging sound land use. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established to share the risk of flood losses and provide access to primary flood insurance. It aims to transfer financial risk to the federal government and reduce the nation's comprehensive flood risk through floodplain management. The NFIP aims to reduce flood risk through floodplain management standards. Communities voluntarily participate in the program to access primary flood insurance. FEMA can only provide insurance to areas with adequate land use measures consistent with NFIP criteria. The NFIP reduces flood risk by requiring participating communities to adopt minimum floodplain management standards and collaborate with FEMA to develop Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). Premiums collected from insurance sales finance a Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program. FEMA conducts Flood Insurance Studies (FISs) nationwide to identify high-risk areas. FEMA develops Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) to assess flood risk and designate insurance zones in areas with special flood hazards. The Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) process was established in BW-12 to improve flood hazard mapping. The community must adopt the FIRM into local or state law for it to be effective, with a focus on the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to identify high-risk flood zones. The Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) identifies high-risk flood zones with a 1% or greater risk of flooding every year. SFHA zones include A, AE, AH, AO, V, VE, VO, and V1-30 on FIRMs. V zones are prone to coastal flooding. Other designations in the SFHA are Zone AR and Zone A99 for areas with insufficient flood protection or undergoing construction for flood protection. Flood maps vary in age and quality nationwide. Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) across the country vary in age and quality, with most communities having maps adopted within the past 15 to 20 years. FIRMs can be accessed on FEMA's Map Service Center website and digitally viewed via the National Flood Hazard Layer. FEMA uses the Coordinated Needs Management Strategy to prioritize mapping needs. Updates to flood maps are needed for new building developments, changes to flood protection systems, and environmental changes. Changes to flood protection systems and environmental changes in the community can impact the updating of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). FEMA follows statutory guidelines for developing new FIRMs, including extensive communication with the community and data submission on flood hazards, mitigation plans, and economic impacts. FEMA collaborates with local communities to update Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and allows for appeals during the process. The Technical Mapping Advisory Council (TMAC) reviews and recommends improvements to FEMA's flood hazard mapping standards and guidelines. The TMAC estimates that producing a new or revised FIRM under the Risk MAP program can take up to six and a half years. The ideal project timeline is 25 months. After a map is finalized, it can still be revised for accuracy errors. FEMA allows individuals and communities to request amendments or revisions to the flood map for inaccuracies in natural elevation. FEMA has developed floodplain management standards to restrict development in flood-prone areas and guide construction away from flood hazards. Requests for map corrections like LOMA or LOMR must be based on scientific evidence, with costs typically covered by the community or individual. FEMA has set minimum floodplain management standards to reduce flood damage and improve land use in flood-prone areas. Communities must adopt these standards to participate in the NFIP, including requiring permits for development in flood hazard areas, elevating new residential buildings above Base Flood Elevation, restricting development in floodways, and using specific construction materials and methods to minimize risk. The NFIP community is responsible for enforcing floodplain management standards to reduce flood damage. FEMA conducts community assistance visits to monitor compliance, with an estimated nationwide compliance rate of 70% to 85%. Non-compliant communities may face probation or suspension from the NFIP. States and communities can choose to adopt higher standards than the minimum requirements set by FEMA. FEMA incentivizes NFIP communities to adopt higher floodplain management standards through the Community Rating System. The agency also operates the Flood Mitigation Assistance Grant Program, funded by NFIP revenue, for various mitigation activities. In FY2019, $175 million was authorized for the FMA Program, with funding available until expended. The NFIP has considerable discretion in crafting flood insurance policies, with three main policy forms available. Policyholders can elect coverage for building property and contents, with coverage limits set by law. Renters can obtain contents-only coverage. Excess flood insurance can be purchased to cover losses beyond SFIP coverage limits, but it is not sold by the NFIP and must be obtained through the private insurance market. SFIPs have exclusions such as no coverage for alternative living expenses, business interruption expenses, limited coverage of basements or crawlspaces, and no coverage for damage caused by earth movement. Owners in NFIP-participating communities must buy flood insurance for properties in mapped SFHAs. Owners of properties in mapped SFHAs must purchase flood insurance as a condition of receiving a federally backed mortgage from federal agencies, federally regulated lending institutions, and government-sponsored enterprises. This requirement applies to lenders such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, banks covered by the FDIC, and the OCC. Property owners in mapped SFHAs must purchase flood insurance to receive a federally backed mortgage from federal agencies or regulated lending institutions. They can buy insurance through the NFIP or a private company, as long as it meets the same coverage standards. Implementing this requirement has been challenging, with federal regulators issuing two NPRMs to address the issue. The main challenge lies in determining which policies meet the required coverage standards and who will make that judgment. The regulators announced a final rule implementing the BW-12 requirement for regulated lending institutions to accept private flood insurance policies starting July 1, 2019. The rule allows institutions to rely on insurer assurances in private policies and clarifies acceptance under certain conditions. This rule does not apply to other federal agencies or GSEs, affecting only some mortgages in SFHAs. Not all mortgages in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) are affected by the mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance. While federal law may not require flood insurance for certain mortgages, the issuing party may still mandate it for financial security. A study suggested that at least 77% of mortgages in SFHAs in 2003 would be subject to the requirement, but not all covered mortgages comply. Despite the mandatory purchase requirement, not all mortgages carry the necessary insurance. According to studies, compliance with the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement varies across different regions, with rates as low as 43% in the Midwest and as high as 88% in the West. In New York City, the take-up rate for required insurance was estimated to be around 61-65%. Compliance with the requirement in SFHAs with mortgages increased from 61% in 2012 to 73% in 2016. The mandatory flood insurance purchase requirement has shown varying compliance rates across different regions. In SFHAs with mortgages, compliance increased from 61% in 2012 to 73% in 2016. Escrowing insurance premiums may improve compliance, with federal regulations now requiring escrowing for all mortgages except under certain conditions. The broader implementation of the escrowing provision for flood insurance began in January 2016, as per law and regulations. Flood insurance is optional for properties outside the SFHA, but individuals in NFIP participating communities in B, C, or X Zones of a FIRM may voluntarily purchase a lower-cost Preferred Risk Policy. FEMA encourages the purchase of PRPs to reduce financial flood risk and improve the fiscal soundness of the NFIP portfolio. The NFIP requires most SFIP and PRP policyholders to purchase a separate insurance policy for increased cost of compliance coverage, which helps offset expenses for complying with building code standards. This coverage is set by FEMA with a cap of $75 for ICC policy and provides up to $30,000 for eligible expenses. For example, buildings may need to be rebuilt to current floodplain management requirements after being determined substantially damaged following a flood. The NFIP requires policyholders to purchase increased cost of compliance coverage to offset expenses for complying with building code standards. This coverage, set by FEMA with a $75 cap for ICC policy, provides up to $30,000 for eligible expenses such as demolition and elevation of rebuilt buildings to meet new compliance standards. ICC claims can be submitted to offset costs, but not all structures with repetitive loss are eligible for ICC payments. FEMA has not implemented ICC coverage for certain conditions authorized by law. FEMA's decision not to implement provisions for properties with sustained flood damage has drawn criticism. Private companies handle day-to-day operations of the NFIP, including policy management, under FEMA's oversight. FEMA has established arrangements with private industry, such as Direct Servicing Agents, to sell flood insurance policies directly to individuals. The NFIP offers two arrangements for purchasing flood insurance policies: the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) and the Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program. The DSA and WYO Program both involve private companies selling and servicing policies, with the NFIP retaining the financial risk. Currently, 13% of policies are managed through the DSA, while 87% are sold by companies in the WYO Program. The balance between the two programs has shifted over the years, with WYOs covering 50% of policies in 1986 and 97% in 2008. Most NFIP policyholders interact with WYO companies or the DSA rather than FEMA directly. Companies participating in the WYO Program are compensated through various methods, as investigated by the Government Accountability Office and Department of Homeland Security. Congress mandated FEMA to develop a rulemaking on reimbursement for WYO companies within a year of BW-12 enactment. FEMA has yet to publish a rulemaking to revise the compensation structure of the WYOs following Hurricane Sandy. FEMA allowed survivors to resubmit NFIP claims for reevaluation, resulting in $258.6 million in additional claim payments. Approximately 85% of policyholders received extra payments, while the remaining 15% did not. FEMA also settled and litigated lawsuits initiated by claimants. FEMA settled and litigated lawsuits initiated by claimants following Hurricane Sandy, with 1,631 out of 1,633 court cases settled, resulting in approximately $164 million in settlement payments. Flood insurance rates in the NFIP are based on the risk involved and accepted actuarial principles, reflecting the true flood risk to the property. FEMA classifies properties based on flood risks using specific criteria like risk zone on a FIRM, elevation relative to Base Flood Elevation, occupancy type, and other risk determinants. Premium structure includes NFIP expenses servicing policies. The NFIP premium structure includes estimates for expenses, with most rates intended to represent full flood risk. Premium rates for pre-FIRM structures built before being mapped into a flood zone are allowed to have lower premiums by statute. The pre-FIRM subsidy for flood insurance policies allows properties in floodplains to contribute to prefunding their recovery from disasters. As of September 2016, 16.1% of all NFIP policies received this subsidy, but it is being phased out gradually under current law. Under current law, the phaseout of pre-FIRM subsidies for flood insurance policies varies by property type. HFIAA slowed the phaseout for primary residences but maintained the pace for business properties and secondary homes. A minimum and maximum annual increase of 5%-15% was established for primary residences. Congress introduced a new form of subsidy in HFIAA for owners of properties newly mapped into a SFHA, with specific eligibility criteria and rates for the first 12 months following the map revision. The NFIP offers a subsidy for properties newly mapped into a SFHA for the first 12 months, with annual increases limited to 18%. FEMA allows property owners to maintain their old flood insurance rate class through \"grandfathering\" when remapped into a new flood rate class. Property owners can maintain their old flood insurance rate class through \"grandfathering\" when remapped into a new flood rate class. Congress eliminated grandfathering after new maps were issued in BW-12 but reinstated it in HFIAA. FEMA does not have a definitive estimate on the number of properties with a grandfathered rate in the NFIP. Unofficial estimates suggest that at least 10%-20% of properties are grandfathered. Grandfathering allows property owners to maintain old flood insurance rates when remapped into a new flood rate class. FEMA estimates 10%-20% of properties are grandfathered. The discount provided is cross-subsidized by other policyholders in the NFIP. FEMA tries to recoup lost revenue by charging higher rates for other policies in the SFHA. It is unclear if the NFIP is increasing other SFHA policy premiums to offset the discount from grandfathered rates. The Community Rating System (CRS) program incentivizes communities to improve floodplain management standards. FEMA awards points to increase a community's CRS class rating, with points given for various improvements in flood risk communication, regulation, damage reduction, and response to flooding incidents. Starting at Class 9, policyholders in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) within a CRS community benefit from reduced premiums. The Community Rating System (CRS) program offers discounts on SFIP premiums for policyholders in the SFHA within CRS communities, with discounts increasing per class up to 45% at Class 1. Participation in the CRS program requires community application to FEMA and documentation of improvements. Only 5% of eligible NFIP communities participate in the CRS program, but they account for over 69% of all flood policies. The CRS Program's effectiveness can be assessed through the Flood Insurance Manual, with an estimated average 11.4% premium rate reduction in April 2014. The CRS program provides an average 11.4% discount on SFIP premiums across the NFIP, with the discount being cross-subsidized into the program. This results in a cost increase of 13.4% to overall premiums for NFIP communities. Congress has concerns about the affordability of flood insurance premiums and required FEMA to commission a study with the National Academy of Sciences on this issue. The Affordability Study, originally due 270 days after BW-12 enactment, was completed in two parts by the NAS. Congress extended the deadline in HFIAA and required FEMA to develop an Affordability Framework to address flood insurance affordability issues. FEMA published the Framework on April 17, 2018, with enforcement measures for NFIP participating communities. Probation and suspension are conditions for removing a community from the NFIP. A community can be placed on probation if it fails to enforce floodplain management standards. Probation can result in a fee of $50 for policyholders while the community addresses FEMA's concerns. If a community does not address cited deficiencies within specified time periods, it may be suspended from the NFIP by FEMA. Suspension can occur if a community fails to adopt approved floodplain maps or management standards on time, or if they lower their standards below the required minimum. Reinstatement is possible once issues are resolved. Communities facing suspension or not participating in the NFIP may not access primary flood insurance, leading to uninsured property risks. The NFIP allows communities to participate in flood insurance, but some may choose not to due to low flood risk based on geography or climate. If a community is suspended from the NFIP or chooses not to participate, they may have difficulty accessing federal assistance for flood hazards. Property owners in areas with special flood hazards must have flood insurance for federal assistance or mortgages. Leaving the NFIP is allowed, but it may result in uninsured property risks. The NFIP allows communities to participate in flood insurance, but some may choose not to due to low flood risk. Funding for the NFIP is maintained in the National Flood Insurance Fund through premiums, appropriations, and borrowing. As of November 2018, there were approximately 5.1 million policies in force with a written premium of about $3.6 billion. The Federal Policy Fee (FPF) and Reserve Fund assessment are fees mandated by law on flood insurance policies. The FPF helps cover administrative expenses and is set by FEMA, currently at $50 for SFIPs and $25 for PRPs. The Reserve Fund assessment establishes a fund for future claim and debt expenses, with FEMA required to maintain a reserve ratio of 1%. As of January 2019, approximately $13.07 billion was required for the Reserve Fund ratio. FEMA charges NFIP policies a Reserve Fund assessment equal to 15% of the premium, increasing from 5% on SFIPs and 0% on PRPs. In addition, a surcharge is applied based on property type, with a $25 charge for primary residences and $250 for other properties. Starting April 1, 2019, a 5% surcharge for severe repetitive properties will be introduced. Starting April 1, 2019, FEMA will introduce a 5% surcharge for severe repetitive loss properties, with revenues deposited into the Reserve Fund. Premiums from NFIP insurance sales are transferred to FEMA and deposited in the NFIF, with Congress authorizing FEMA to withdraw funds for NFIP operations. Congress also provides annual appropriations for floodplain mapping activities and fluctuating levels of mandatory spending to pay and adjust claims on affected NFIP policies. FEMA is authorized to borrow up to $30.425 billion. \"FEMA borrowed $7.425 billion from the U.S. Treasury to cover claims from various hurricanes, reaching the NFIP's borrowing limit of $30.425 billion. Congress cancelled $16 billion of NFIP debt in October 2017, allowing the program to pay claims for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. This was the first time NFIP debt was cancelled.\" The NFIP borrowed $6.1 billion in 2017 to cover losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, bringing the total debt to $20.525 billion. The program has $9.9 billion in remaining borrowing authority. The debt cannot be tied to a single incident but was heavily borrowed after the 2005 hurricane season and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Congress passed legislation to increase borrowing after Hurricane Sandy. The NFIP's debt increased to $20.525 billion in 2017 due to borrowing after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Following Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Congress passed legislation to raise the borrowing limit to $30.425 billion. The NFIP pays off its debt through premium revenues collected from policyholders. The NFIP's debt of $20.525 billion in 2017 can only be paid off through premium revenues and the Reserve Fund. FEMA's report to Congress in 2013 outlined a 10-year repayment plan, but even in the most optimistic scenario, it would take at least 13 years to repay the debt. Realistically, it may take 20 years or more, especially if future catastrophic incidents occur. The NFIP's debt of $20.525 billion in 2017 may take at least 20 years to pay off, especially with future catastrophic incidents. In April 2017, CBO projected insufficient receipts for NFIP claims over the 2018-2027 period, requiring FEMA to use $1 billion of its borrowing authority. FEMA estimated a further $9.4 billion increase in NFIP's net debt after 20 years. Congress revised FEMA's authority to secure reinsurance for NFIP from private markets in HFIAA-14. In September 2016, FEMA obtained reinsurance for the NFIP, covering losses exceeding $5 million and $5.5 billion from single flood events. In January 2017, FEMA purchased $1.042 billion of insurance for a premium of $150 million, covering 26% of losses between $4 billion and $8 billion. This private reinsurance reduces the need for FEMA to borrow from the Treasury to pay claims. FEMA purchased $1.46 billion of reinsurance in January 2018 to cover losses above $4 billion for a single flooding event, with a premium of $235 million. This reinsurance covers 18.6% of losses between $4 billion and $6 billion, and 54.3% of losses between $6 billion and $8 billion. FEMA also transferred NFIP risk to private markets through insurance-linked securities in August 2018. NFIP transferred $500 million of financial risk to capital markets through a three-year agreement with Hannover Re, who will sponsor a cat bond. The bond covers losses from flooding due to named storms in the U.S. between 2018 and 2021. FEMA paid a $62 million premium for the first year of coverage. FEMA transferred $1.96 billion of NFIP's flood risk for the 2018 hurricane season to the private sector. In January 2019, FEMA purchased $1.32 billion of insurance for the period from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020, with a reinsurance premium of $186 million. The agreement covers losses above $4 billion for a single flooding event, with varying percentages for different loss ranges. The NFIP does not have a comprehensive expiration provision. After May 31, 2019, the NFIP's authority to provide new flood insurance contracts will expire, and borrowing funds from the Treasury will be reduced. Other activities like FMA grants will technically remain authorized, but the expiration of key authorities will have serious effects on NFIP activities."
