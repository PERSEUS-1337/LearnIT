    "content": "The text introduces a new section, SEC. 41714, which focuses on reducing the U.S. citizenship voting interest ownership requirement in Subchapter I of chapter 417, title 49, United States Code. SEC. 41714 allows non-U.S. citizens to purchase voting interests in an air carrier without meeting the 75 percent ownership requirement if approved by the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary of Transportation can approve non-U.S. citizens to purchase voting interests in an air carrier if certain conditions are met, including that at least 51 percent of the voting interests are owned by U.S. citizens. Factors considered for approval include the financial condition of the carrier, impact on employees, and competition. The Secretary of Transportation considers various factors when approving non-U.S. citizens to purchase voting interests in an air carrier, including the impact on competition, foreign ownership laws, government subsidies, and ownership percentages. After considering factors like competition, foreign ownership laws, and government subsidies, the Secretary of Transportation evaluates if a non-U.S. citizen purchasing an air carrier would allow control over it and if the foreign country allows equivalent access to its aviation markets as the U.S. does. Interested parties must submit an application meeting specified requirements for approval within 90 days. When an application meeting the requirements is submitted to the Secretary, they will approve it, approve it with conditions, or disapprove it. The President has the authority to review and either disapprove or impose conditions on the application based on national defense considerations. The Secretary's actions on applications under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program can be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. The President can disapprove or impose conditions based on national defense considerations. Any disapproval by the President renders the Secretary's action null and void. If the President does not disapprove within 30 days, the Secretary's action takes effect.

If the President does not disapprove within 30 days, the Secretary's action takes effect and shall be subject to judicial review. SEC. 2. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. Amends chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code by adding a new section 41714 regarding the reduction of U.S. citizenship voting interest ownership requirement."
