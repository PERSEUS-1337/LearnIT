    "content": "Economic factors, new technologies, and environmental concerns are changing energy sources for electricity generation in the US. Wind and solar energy generation has increased from 1% in 2008 to 9% in 2018. These sources are weather-dependent, unlike conventional sources like coal or natural gas. Power system operators have adjusted reliability standards to accommodate variable renewable energy sources. Congress mandated electric reliability standards in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to address the growth of wind and solar generation. These standards, developed by NERC and approved by FERC, apply to the bulk power system. Small-scale generators and local distribution systems fall under state PUC jurisdiction. Wind and solar generation have not caused reliability issues so far. According to NERC's 2018 annual report, wind and solar generation have not caused electric reliability issues at the national level. The report shows that most reliability metrics have remained stable or improved over the 2013-2017 period. However, questions remain about the potential impact of higher levels of wind and solar generation on electric reliability in the future. The effects of daily and seasonal variability in wind and solar sources on the bulk power system are a concern for Congress. Analysts expect an increase in generation from these sources, which could impact reliability. The electric power sector consists of three systems: generation, transmission, and distribution. The combined generation and transmission systems are referred to as the bulk power system. Other reliability concerns, such as cyber and physical security, small-scale generators, and local distribution networks, are also important but not extensively discussed in this report. The term \"bulk-power system\" refers to facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network, excluding facilities used in local distribution. The discussion excludes distributed energy resources like rooftop solar electricity generation. Ownership structures for bulk power system components vary, with competitive markets and regional transmission organizations managing the system. In RTO regions, electricity generators compete in auctions managed by ISOs to sell power to distribution utilities for resale to end-use customers. RTOs also oversee transmission systems and reliability. Market signals primarily guide investment decisions in RTO regions, while non-RTO regions are served by vertically integrated utilities operating as regulated monopolies without competition for generation and transmission services. Two-thirds of U.S. electricity demand comes from RTO regions. In non-RTO regions, utilities do not face competition for generation and transmission services. State regulators oversee utility operations and authorize new investments. Municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives may own system components outside of federal and state regulatory jurisdiction. Electric reliability is defined as having power when needed, with NERC setting specific standards for bulk power system components. NERC develops individual standards for power system components, including cybersecurity protection and design requirements. Compliance ensures reliable operation of the Bulk-Power System, ensuring most individuals have sufficient electricity. These standards do not apply to local electricity distribution systems. From 2008 to 2014, 90% of power outages originated in local distribution systems, even when reliability standards were met. NERC's standards aim for an Adequate Level of Reliability (ALR) for the bulk power system, accepting some risk of occasional power loss for economic reasons. The goal is to limit outages to no more than 1 day every 10 years under normal conditions, but achieving ALR does not prevent all brownouts and blackouts. Bulk power system outages can still occur even when reliability standards are fully met. System outages can still occur even when reliability standards are fully met, especially after major events like hurricanes. Factors that increase uncertainty reduce reliability, while factors that reduce uncertainty increase reliability. Wind and solar energy sources are variable and weather-dependent, posing challenges for integrating them into the existing power system designed for conventional sources like coal and nuclear. Figure 3 illustrates typical patterns of electricity generation from wind and solar sources in the United States. The electric power sector in the United States is increasing its use of wind and solar sources for electricity generation. Wind generation peaks overnight and during winter, while solar generation is highest in the middle of the day and during summer. Actual generation depends on specific weather conditions. Combined wind and utility-scale solar generation increased from 1% in 2008 to 8% in 2018, with 80% coming from wind. Conventional sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear still dominate electricity generation. The electric power sector in the United States has seen an increase in wind and solar generation for electricity. Wind generation peaks overnight and during winter, while solar generation is highest in the middle of the day and during summer. From 2008 to 2018, wind and utility-scale solar generation increased from 1% to 8%, with wind accounting for 80% of the increase. Despite this growth, coal, natural gas, and nuclear still dominate electricity generation. National-level data may not reflect the variation in wind and solar generation across different regions and times of day. Wind and solar sources have provided a majority of electricity in certain regions during specific times, such as wind supplying 56% of electricity demand in Texas at 3:10 am on January 19, 2019. The electric power sector in the United States has seen an increase in wind and solar generation for electricity. Wind generation peaks overnight and during winter, while solar generation is highest in the middle of the day and during summer. Some events in SPP set records for renewable generation share, showing potential for increased use of wind and solar sources. However, extrapolating to high national levels is complex due to short-lived events and low electricity demand during these times. High demand periods like summer may have lower renewable generation shares. The generation of electricity from renewable sources, such as wind, is lower compared to conventional sources like coal and natural gas. Wind generation peaks during winter and spring months, contributing to record-setting events. Balancing supply and demand of electricity is crucial to prevent system instability or failure, requiring adjustments in generator output over short timescales. Balancing authorities issue orders to generators for output changes to maintain reliability, following security-constrained economic dispatch rules. This approach aims for affordability and reliability by using higher-cost sources when necessary. Wind and solar sources, with low operating costs, are favored under SCED. Since wind and solar sources have low operating costs, they are favored for electricity generation. To balance their variable output, system operators use different sources with varying ramping capabilities. Reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) have high ramping capabilities and are commonly used in certain regions, using natural gas or fuel oil as fuel. Steam turbines, fueled by coal or nuclear energy, operate at steady, high output levels for efficiency. They can ramp to some extent, potentially incurring higher costs when ramped. Wind and solar sources can balance each other out across regions, offering zero fuel costs and emissions for balancing. Energy storage can be used for balancing by storing electricity during high supply periods and providing it when supply is low. It can help address daily variability in wind and solar sources, but many storage types are expensive and not widely deployed. Demand response involves adjusting electricity demand based on available supply, a practice that is becoming more common in the power system. Demand response programs involve consumers voluntarily reducing electricity usage for financial compensation, balancing the system without requiring additional generation. However, this comes at a social cost as consumers may not use electricity at their preferred times. The electric power sector is improving system balancing through better weather and power forecasting. For instance, MISO implemented a Dispatchable Intermittent Resources program in 2011, allowing wind sources to offer generation at five-minute intervals based on their own forecasts, reducing inefficiencies from hourly offers. Improved forecasting could lead to increased utilization of wind sources. Improved forecasting for wind and solar sources could increase their use in the power system balancing. Federal efforts have been made to address reliability issues associated with integrating Variable Renewable Energy (VRE). NERC established a task force in 2007 to study VRE integration and identify reliability standard gaps. FERC also plays a role in regulating interstate electricity to ensure electric reliability. Federal efforts have been made to address reliability issues associated with integrating Variable Renewable Energy (VRE). FERC regulates interstate electricity transmission and wholesale electricity markets, influencing system balancing and project revenues. Congress funds projects supporting technology development for reliability improvement, such as financial incentives for transmission investments under Section 219 of the Federal Power Act. Since the passage of EPACT05 in 2005, FERC has implemented rules allowing higher rates of return and full cost recovery for approved transmission investments. FERC opened an inquiry in 2019 to potentially change its transmission incentive policy. In 2011, FERC issued Order No. 1000, which increased the importance of meeting public policy requirements in approving new transmission projects, such as renewable portfolio standards. New transmission capacity is often necessary to access and integrate renewable energy sources. Order No. 745 and Order No. 841 by FERC allow demand response and energy storage systems to earn compensation from wholesale electricity markets for balancing and providing essential services. DOE grant programs support the development of technologies to improve balancing of wind and solar sources. The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) funds research to improve short-term weather forecasting for wind power. Congress has raised concerns about reliability as wind and solar energy are projected to increase in the electricity generation profile. In light of projections, wind and solar are expected to contribute 23% of electricity generation in 2050. Members may consider reliability in policies to increase generation from these sources. New approaches may be needed for maintaining electric reliability with higher levels of wind and solar generation. Regulatory framework can accommodate changes, with FERC and NERC having authority to develop new reliability standards. NERC is considering new reliability metrics due to the increasing use of variable renewable energy sources. The Assessment Subcommittee should lead the electric industry in developing a common approach and metrics to assess energy adequacy, especially with the changing resource mix affecting generation fleet characteristics. Additional analysis is required to determine energy sufficiency, particularly during off-peak periods and with energy-limited resources. Congress could provide guidance for FERC and NERC activities and assess the regulatory framework's adequacy for reliability if wind and solar generation increases. Discussion includes the siting and approval of transmission projects to enhance wind and solar availability for system balancing. Transmission facility siting is currently primarily under state jurisdiction. The siting of electricity transmission facilities is mainly under state jurisdiction. Section 1221 of EPACT05 gives FERC authority to issue permits for transmission facilities in designated National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors. However, actions by DOE and FERC were vacated by federal courts, and no significant action has been taken since. Power outages mostly occur on local distribution systems regulated by state or local authorities. Congress could consider expanding federal activities to improve distribution system reliability, including studying factors like weather and aging infrastructure that lead to power outages. This may involve providing federal financial support for projects and encouraging new operational regimes. Additionally, Congress might address the emerging issue of electric resilience by enhancing the federal role in electricity system resilience through research, development, and demonstration. The Department of Energy's current research focuses on grid modernization and systems integration to improve the resilience of the U.S. power grid. Federal support, such as tax credits and grants, has been provided for balancing wind and solar sources. Congress may need to consider expanding this support if current reliability efforts are insufficient. Electric reliability is governed by NERC standards, with system operators and planners implementing different practices. At the smallest timescales, factors like frequency control, voltage support, and ramping capability are essential for reliability. NERC refers to these as Essential Reliability Services (ERS), which historically were provided by steam turbines but now require additional components for wind and solar generators. Technologies are being deployed to enable wind and solar to provide ERS as mandated by FERC. Balancing, occurring over minutes to hours, is crucial for grid stability. Planning for long-term reliability, known as resource adequacy, involves forecasting electricity supply and demand, especially for variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Policy goals influence this planning more than short-term reliability aspects. Reliability planners use planning reserve margins to ensure sufficient generation and transmission capacity to meet electricity demand. The planning reserve margin is the difference between peak demand and available generating capacity, typically 10-18%. It is calculated in advance to assess reliability concerns, but high margins do not guarantee reliability, especially with variable sources. NERC assesses resource adequacy nationally over a 10-year period. NERC annually assesses resource adequacy over a 10-year forecasting window, using historic VRE generation data. In its 2018 Long-Term Reliability Assessment, NERC recommended enhancing its reliability assessment process to account for events where VRE sources provided large shares of generation during off-peak periods. Solar eclipses, like the one on August 21, 2017, test grid operators' ability to operate when solar sources are unavailable, with no reliability issues reported during that event. The electric industry implemented measures in advance to address issues during an event. The current electric reliability planning involves multiple entities and jurisdictions, ensuring wind and solar electricity integration. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC responsibility for grid reliability through setting and enforcing standards developed by NERC. NERC has over 100 reliability standards approved by FERC, with authority to enforce them. NERC has authority to enforce reliability standards in EPACT05, delegated to Regional Entities. Compliance jurisdiction includes all users, owners, and operators of the bulk-power system in the contiguous United States. Balancing authorities, such as RTOs, are responsible for matching generation with demand. Reliability coordinators also have operational responsibilities. Reliability coordinators, including RTOs, have operational responsibilities and can overrule balancing authorities to maintain power system reliability. NERC has certified 66 balancing authorities and 11 reliability coordinators in the US."
