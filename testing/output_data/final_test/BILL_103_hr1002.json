    "content": "The \"Public Housing Fair Compensation Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. It grants authority and specifies the amount for compensation. Section 6(d) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is amended to require low-income housing projects to be exempt from property taxes and make payments in lieu of taxes. The housing project must make payments in lieu of property taxes if not exempt, with contributions from the Secretary contingent on the local government's contribution exceeding the taxes paid for the project. The low-income housing project must make payments based on the number and size of dwelling units, with the amount determined by state law, local agreement, or failure of local public bodies to fulfill obligations. The housing agency must fulfill obligations under agreements for low-income housing projects by determining adjusted per unit payment amounts based on dwelling unit sizes and local housing costs. The housing agency determines adjusted per unit payment amounts based on dwelling unit sizes and local housing costs, ensuring that larger units receive higher payments. In fiscal year 1994, public housing agencies are authorized to receive $500,000,000 for making payments in lieu of taxes. The maximum amount payable for a single dwelling unit is $1,400, and for a project, it is the total of all property taxes that would apply if the project was not tax-exempt. For fiscal years 1994 to 1998, the authorized funding amounts are as follows: $500,000,000 for 1994, $1,000,000,000 for 1995, $2,000,000,000 for 1996, $2,000,000,000 for 1997, and $2,000,000,000 for 1998. The amendment made by section 2 applies to fiscal year 1994 and onwards. Section 6(d) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 applies to fiscal years before 1994."
