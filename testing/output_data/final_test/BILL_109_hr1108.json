The Congress finds that in the United States, millions are affected by liver diseases, with billions spent on medical care annually. Over 4 million people have or had hepatitis C, with limited effective treatments and no vaccine available. Hepatitis C causes thousands of deaths yearly, with projections of a significant increase without public health and research interventions. Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C is linked to an increased risk of primary liver cancer, now the fastest growing cancer in the US. There are 1.25 million people in the US with hepatitis B, and up to 15% of Asian and Pacific-Islander Americans are chronically infected. Primary biliary cirrhosis affects 15 out of every 100,000 people in the US, with 95% being women. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, an obesity-related condition, may impact 1 in 4 adults over 18. Liver disease affects up to 1 in 4 adults over 18 and 15,000 children are hospitalized in the US each year due to liver disease. The limited supply of livers for transplantation results in only around 5,100 transplants being performed annually out of the 17,600 people on the waiting list. Approximately 1,400 people die each year waiting for a liver transplant, highlighting the need for a National Center on Liver Disease Research. The National Center on Liver Disease Research aims to provide scientific leadership, create a research action plan, and secure funding for identified scientific opportunities. The National Center on Liver Disease Research is established under the Public Health Service Act to focus on liver disease research. The National Center on Liver Disease Research, established under the Public Health Service Act, is headed by a Director appointed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The Director's duties include assisting in developing a Liver Disease Research Action Plan and coordinating its implementation. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established under the Liver Research Enhancement Act of 2005, advises the Director of the National Center on Liver Disease Research on matters related to liver disease research and helps develop the Liver Disease Research Action Plan. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established under the Liver Research Enhancement Act of 2005, consists of 18 voting members appointed by the Director of NIH, including eminent scientists and lay persons. The Chair is selected by the Director. Additionally, ex officio members include directors of national research institutes funding liver disease research, along with representatives from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established under the Liver Research Enhancement Act of 2005, consists of 18 voting members appointed by the Director of NIH, including eminent scientists and lay persons. Ex officio members may appoint representatives. The Advisory Board will develop a Liver Disease Research Action Plan within 15 months for liver disease research support and submit it to the Director of NIH and relevant institutes. The Liver Disease Research Advisory Board, established under the Liver Research Enhancement Act of 2005, consists of 18 voting members appointed by the Director of NIH. The Liver Disease Research Action Plan shall identify scientific opportunities and priorities necessary to increase understanding, prevent, cure, and develop better treatment protocols for liver diseases. The Advisory Board shall revise the Plan every 3 years and allocate funds to liver disease research through peer-reviewed methods.
