    "content": "The overview of federal forfeiture law describes its origins, distribution of funds generated, and constitutional issues. Forfeiture has been authorized for over 200 years and is rooted in early English law. It is reminiscent of deodands, forfeiture of estate, and statutory forfeiture. The practice of deodands, where the Crown distributed proceeds from confiscated objects for religious and charitable purposes, was similar to modern civil forfeiture. Deodands were not common in the American colonies and had fallen out of use by the time of the American Revolution. Unlike deodands, common law forfeiture focused solely on human offenders convicted of treason or felony, resulting in the loss of all their property. The judicial declaration of civil death, resulting from final sentences for treason or felony, was rare in colonial America. The Constitution and Congress restricted common law forfeiture post-Revolution. Statutory forfeiture, used in admiralty and revenue cases in pre-colonial England, was also employed in the American colonies against smuggling. Confiscation proceedings were typically in rem, with the object as the defendant, or in personam, where the owner's conviction led to confiscation. Modern forfeiture laws in the United States have roots in English statutory forfeiture. Federal forfeiture statutes vary greatly and can apply to any kind of property under certain circumstances. Property used to facilitate a crime can be subject to confiscation, including contraband and vehicles. The confiscation of vehicles used in crimes has been a target of forfeiture laws. Congress has authorized the seizure of profits from illegal activities and substitute assets when tainted property is unavailable. Traditionally, forfeiture was triggered by crimes threatening government revenue or public health and morals. Starting with racketeering statutes, jurisdictions have expanded forfeiture laws. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA) allows for the confiscation of proceeds from crimes like money laundering and racketeering. After 9/11, Congress authorized the seizure of property owned by terrorists, even if not directly linked to a specific crime. Federal confiscation typically starts with a federal offense. Federal confiscation can occur for property in the US linked to crimes committed overseas, including public corruption, drug trafficking, and more. Forfeiture can be criminal or civil, with criminal forfeitures requiring a conviction of the property owner, while civil forfeitures use civil procedure. Civil forfeiture is typically done through civil procedure, treating the property as the offender regardless of the guilt or innocence of the owner. It can be done administratively or through contested proceedings, with different statutes dictating the process. Some statutes refer to customs laws for procedural guidance. CAFRA provides procedures that reduce reliance on customs laws for civil forfeiture matters. Possession of the property by the court is necessary for confiscation proceedings, which can be initiated through various means, including warrants or probable cause under the Fourth Amendment. Realty seizure is delayed until after a hearing for the property owner. The property owner has the opportunity to petition the court for release of seized property under CAFRA. Administrative forfeiture may be used in uncontested cases for expediency, but it involves procedural obstacles for both the government and claimants before a judicial proceeding. The government initiates forfeiture proceedings by seizing the property and notifying interested parties. Property owners have a limited time to contest confiscation by filing a claim under the Supplemental Rules. Failure to promptly file a claim may result in its dismissal by the court. The government can petition the court to dismiss a claim for lack of statutory standing, requiring the claimant to prove lawful acquisition of the property. If no viable claims are made, the property is forfeited. Administrative forfeiture can be overturned if there was inadequate notice or a due process violation. CAFRA sets a timeline for notifying property owners of confiscation, allowing them 35 days to file a claim and request judicial proceedings. The property owner has 35 days to file a claim and request a judicial hearing, while the government has 90 days to initiate judicial proceedings after receiving a claim. In cases where administrative forfeiture is unavailable or when the government chooses not to proceed administratively, civil judicial proceedings can be initiated by filing a complaint or a libel against the property. In cases governed by CAFRA, the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to confiscation. In cases governed by CAFRA, the government must establish probable cause for forfeiture and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to confiscation. Claimants can challenge confiscation by showing the criminal offense did not occur or that their property lacks the required nexus to the crime. The government must demonstrate a substantial connection between the property and the offense for forfeiture. Innocence or acquittal may not always prevent civil forfeiture, except in certain cases permitted by statute or due process. CAFRA establishes two \"innocent owner\" defenses for claimants with an interest in the property at the time of the offense and for those who acquired it afterwards. Claimants can seek a judicial reduction of the confiscation amount if deemed excessive in relation to the offense and their culpability. The court may release property to its owner if not subject to forfeiture, with claimants potentially entitled to compensation for damages, attorneys' fees, and interest. Criminal forfeiture is now more commonly used, with CAFRA expanding federal crimes subject to it. The court may order confiscation of property through criminal forfeiture procedures following a conviction. Unlike civil forfeiture, criminal forfeiture only targets the property interests of the convicted defendant related to the crime. In cases where the confiscated property is unavailable, substitute assets belonging to the defendant may be seized instead. The court may order confiscation of property through criminal forfeiture procedures following a conviction, targeting the property interests of the convicted defendant. Substitute assets belonging to the defendant may be seized if the confiscated property is unavailable. The indictment must list the property subject to confiscation, and a jury can determine the forfeiture issue. Pretrial restraining orders can be issued to prevent property transfer, but there is uncertainty about restraining orders for substitute property. The current version of section 2461(c) allows criminal forfeiture under the procedures of section 2461(c) whenever civil forfeiture is authorized, regardless of whether the statute also allows criminal forfeiture. It permits the government to elect criminal forfeiture in conjunction with the property owner's criminal prosecution. The current version of section 2461(c) allows criminal forfeiture under its procedures, even if alternative criminal forfeiture procedures were already available. The defense to criminal forfeiture differs from civil forfeiture, with overturned convictions or acquittals usually preventing confiscation. Bona fide purchaser exceptions protect those who acquire property after the offense but before forfeiture. After conviction, the government can choose to confiscate forfeitable property or seek a money judgment. The court determines the nexus between the property and the crime for confiscation or the amount the defendant must pay for a money judgment. A preliminary forfeiture order is issued, and the government must notify third parties with an interest in the property. After conviction, the government can confiscate forfeitable property or seek a money judgment. A preliminary forfeiture order is issued, and third parties with an interest in the property are notified. Third parties with a legal interest in the forfeited property are entitled to a judicial hearing by filing a timely petition. They must establish their claim by a preponderance of the evidence, either asserting a superior interest at the time of misconduct or being good faith purchasers. Unsecured claims of general creditors are not recognized, and state law determines superior interest. The court can amend the forfeiture order at any time. The government can enforce a money judgment against future assets when awarded, even if the defendant no longer has the forfeitable assets. Courts are divided on whether the government can enforce the judgment like any other creditor or only use substitute assets. Disposal of forfeited property is typically governed by statute, which may dictate how the proceeds are used, including for education, destruction of illegal property, victim restitution, or other purposes. The federal forfeiture statutes allow for distribution of confiscated property to various law enforcement agencies to encourage cooperation. Equitable sharing transfer authority must not circumvent state laws on forfeiture. Adoptive forfeiture is a controversial practice where property is forfeited. Adoptive forfeiture involves property forfeited under federal law due to illegal conduct like drug trafficking. The Department of Justice adopts cases from state or local law enforcement for federal processing, often for speed or when state forfeiture is difficult. The circumvention restriction is no longer in effect, but agencies must specify the law enforcement purposes for transferred property. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 changed how the federal government handles revenues from fines and forfeitures. Most of the confiscated cash or proceeds now go to the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund or the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. Congress used to deposit these funds in the general treasury but now allows them to be spent on law enforcement purposes. The Crime Control legislation established new funds to collect revenues from federal criminal law enforcement activities. The Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund and the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund receive confiscated cash and proceeds from forfeitures for law enforcement purposes, totaling over $2 billion annually. The Department of Justice administers the Asset Forfeiture Fund, created under the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. The Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Fund receives confiscated cash and proceeds from forfeitures for law enforcement purposes. The Attorney General may authorize transfers to other law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation. The Fund is used for forfeiture-related expenses, informant rewards, liens and mortgages, remission and mitigation, equipment for law enforcement purposes, and evidence purchases. The Asset Forfeiture Fund is used for law enforcement purposes such as purchasing evidence, paying taxes on forfeited property, and funding cooperative law enforcement operations. Congress has authorized the Attorney General to use the fund for any law enforcement or Justice Department purpose. Access to the fund is subject to annual appropriation for rewards, evidence purchases, and law enforcement equipment. The Asset Forfeiture Fund is used for law enforcement purposes, including purchasing evidence and refitting law enforcement vehicles. Congress has authorized annual appropriations for rewards and other purposes, with record-keeping functions outsourced. The Department of Justice now uses the Fund to pay salaries and administrative costs for personnel involved in asset forfeiture management. The Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, previously known as the Customs Forfeiture Fund, is managed by the Secretary of the Treasury and receives deposits from forfeitures under Treasury or Coast Guard laws. Confiscated cash or proceeds from confiscated property can be transferred to other law enforcement agencies before being paid into the Fund. Plans to merge Justice and Treasury Department Funds have not been implemented. The Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, managed by the Secretary of the Treasury, receives deposits from forfeitures under Treasury or Coast Guard laws. The Fund is used to equip vehicles for law enforcement, pay overtime for officers, satisfy environmental requirements, and cover expenses related to forfeitures. It is also available for various purposes such as paying claims, liens, rewards, and equipment for law enforcement. The Department of Treasury Forfeiture Fund is used to equip vehicles for law enforcement, pay overtime for officers, cover expenses related to forfeitures, and train foreign law enforcement personnel. Congress has established a permanent appropriation for forfeiture-related expenses, settlement of claims, and equitable sharing. The Special Forfeiture Fund, previously administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy, has been abolished. The Justice Department's Office for Victims of Crime administers the Crime Victims Fund, which provides grants for crime victim compensation and assistance programs, child-abuse prevention grants, and court administrative costs. The Court's extraordinary latitude in enforcing forfeiture statutes was sometimes seen as unfair, but not unconstitutional. In 1993, the Court showed uneasiness with forfeiture trends but did not completely reject the government's authority. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive fines and cruel punishments, with lower courts analyzing criminal forfeitures under this amendment. In 1993, the Supreme Court expanded the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause to apply to some civil forfeitures as well. The Court established a standard in Bajakajian, stating that a punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offense. Federal appellate courts now use this standard to measure forfeitures. Several circuits analyze punitive forfeitures based on factors distilled from Bajakajian or stark factual differences. A forfeiture may not be excessive if it is distinguishable on grounds of gross disproportionality, such as a single crime causing little harm but resulting in a disproportionate forfeiture. The procedure used for forfeiture matters for double jeopardy purposes, where civil proceedings against property owner differ from conviction-based forfeitures. The Supreme Court's conclusion in Austin that certain civil forfeitures might be considered punitive for Eighth Amendment purposes raised double jeopardy concerns. However, in United States v. Ursery, the Court reaffirmed that forfeitures designated as remedial civil sanctions do not implicate double jeopardy unless the statutory scheme is so punitive as to negate Congress' intent for a civil remedial mechanism. The Sixth Amendment guarantees rights in criminal proceedings, such as a jury trial and assistance of counsel. However, these rights do not apply in civil forfeiture cases. The Amendment only applies to criminal prosecutions, so there is no constitutional right to counsel in civil forfeiture cases. The Court's opinion in Libretti suggests that there is no right to a jury trial in criminal forfeiture cases, but recent rulings have emphasized the importance of jury involvement in sentencing decisions. The Apprendi v. New Jersey case established that any fact increasing the penalty for a crime must be decided by a jury. Despite the erosion of previous rulings, Rule 32.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows for an expanded jury determination right in federal criminal cases involving forfeiture. The federal appellate courts have not applied Apprendi to criminal forfeitures, acknowledging due process demands notice and opportunity for a hearing to contest property confiscation. Actual notice is not required, but efforts must be reasonably calculated to inform individuals of their right to contest. Due process requires the opportunity for a pre-seizure hearing for real property, with a probable cause determination for post-seizure restraining orders. Adversarial determination of probable cause is not necessary, as a grand jury indictment suffices. The Court has limited the circumstances for confiscating property of an innocent owner, with due process not uniformly preventing such confiscation. In Bennis v. Michigan, Justice Ginsburg emphasized the importance of individual facts in a 5-4 decision. Delay between seizure and hearing offends due process only if unreasonable, considering the length of delay, reasons, claimant's rights assertion, and prejudice. Lower federal courts have found due process permits shifting burden of proof to forfeiture claimant after government shows probable cause. The court allows the use of a probable cause standard in civil forfeitures and postpones determining third-party interests in criminal forfeiture cases until after trial. There was an 11-year delay in amending a criminal forfeiture order to reach overseas assets. Fugitive disentitlement is also a factor. Failure to honor procedural requirements can prevent criminal forfeiture. Lower courts have grappled with due process violations in civil forfeiture cases. CAFRA resolved conflicts regarding forfeiture proceedings by establishing a timetable for the government to restart proceedings after a successful motion setting aside a confiscation declaration. The Supreme Court rejected challenges to property confiscation on Sixth Amendment and Fifth Amendment grounds, leaving open the question of whether due process requires notice and a hearing before property restraining. The issue at hand is whether due process necessitates notice and a hearing before a restraining order can be issued. Some circuits argue that notice and a hearing are required, except in extraordinary circumstances where they can be postponed until after the order is issued but before trial. The United States Constitution's Article III does not seem to pose a threat to modern forfeiture statutes, although there is some debate over its scope beyond treason cases. The due process clause applies to all crimes, not just treason, and only pertains to forfeiture of estate, not statutory forfeitures. Forfeiture of estate involves confiscating all of the defendant's property, while statutory forfeiture only applies to property related to the criminal conduct. Some believe Congress intended to revive forfeiture of estate with RICO provisions, which have been upheld despite Article III challenges. In civil forfeiture cases, claimants must meet Article III standing requirements by showing they have a colorable interest in the property. This includes an ownership or possessory interest. The Fourth Amendment condemns unreasonable search and seizures, requiring a warrant issued upon probable cause for a seizure to be considered reasonable. However, warrantless seizures may be justified in certain circumstances, such as searches incident to arrest or for the search of vehicles. Older civil forfeiture statutes allowed for the seizure of contraband and forfeitable property without a warrant, particularly in customs or maritime contexts. The Fourth Amendment allows for warrantless seizures in certain circumstances, but unlawfully seized evidence cannot be used in forfeiture proceedings. Ex post facto laws are prohibited at both the state and federal levels, preventing retroactive criminalization or increased penalties. The Fourth Amendment allows for warrantless seizures in certain circumstances, but unlawfully seized evidence cannot be used in forfeiture proceedings. Ex post facto laws are prohibited at both the state and federal levels, preventing retroactive criminalization or increased penalties. The application of new sanctions like forfeiture to a continuing crime is allowed even if it straddles the date of enactment. When confiscation involves material protected by the First Amendment, stricter standards must be met. The First Amendment does not prevent the use of criminal forfeiture to punish those involved in the commercial exploitation of obscenity or civil forfeiture to confiscate equipment used by an unlicensed radio station. The curr_chunk discusses the forfeiture of property involved in criminal activities such as trafficking in weapons technology or controlled substances. It includes property within the jurisdiction of the United States derived from offenses against foreign nations. The offenses must be punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year in both the foreign nation and the United States. The curr_chunk discusses the forfeiture of property derived from various criminal offenses under US jurisdiction, including specified unlawful activities. The curr_chunk outlines specific criminal offenses related to fraud and false statements, including mail fraud and wire fraud, in relation to the sale of assets acquired by financial institutions under conservatorship.

The curr_chunk discusses the acquisition, maintenance, and use of assets in support of federal crimes of terrorism against the United States or its citizens. The curr_chunk discusses the forfeiture of property involved in violations of federal terrorism laws, including illegal goods and services. It specifies that the act must have occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States for forfeiture to apply. The curr_chunk explains that the term \"proceeds\" in cases of forfeiture includes the money acquired through illegal transactions, minus direct costs. It also mentions deductions allowed for repaid loans in cases of fraud. The curr_chunk discusses the seizure of property subject to forfeiture by the United States Attorney General or other agencies. Seizures can be made with a warrant or without if a complaint for forfeiture has been filed in court. The curr_chunk explains the conditions under which property can be seized for forfeiture, including lawful arrests, searches, or transfers from state or local agencies to federal agencies. Seizure warrants can be issued by a judicial officer in any district where a forfeiture action may be filed, and can be executed in any district where the property is found. Any motion for the return of seized property must be filed in the district court where the seizure warrant was issued. The Attorney General may apply for an ex parte order to restrain property subject to forfeiture for up to 30 days if a person is arrested or charged in a foreign country for an offense that could lead to property forfeiture in the United States under this section or the Controlled Substances Act. The application must detail the foreign charges and reasons for believing the person has property in the US. The Attorney General can apply for an ex parte order to restrain property subject to forfeiture for up to 30 days if a person is arrested or charged in a foreign country for an offense that could lead to property forfeiture in the United States under this section or the Controlled Substances Act.

The provisions of the customs laws relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws, the disposition of such property or the proceeds from the sale of such property under this section, the remission or mitigation of such forfeitures, and the compromise of claims shall apply to seizures and forfeitures incurred under this section. The Attorney General, Secretary of the Treasury, or Postal Service can authorize officers for property seizure and forfeiture under this section. The Attorney General is responsible for handling petitions for remission or mitigation in judicial forfeiture cases. They are also authorized to retain or transfer forfeited property to federal agencies or state/local law enforcement. The seized property can be transferred to federal agencies, state or local law enforcement, or financial institution regulatory agencies for various purposes such as reimbursement, restitution, or compensatory damages. The seized property can be transferred to federal agencies, state or local law enforcement, or financial institution regulatory agencies for purposes such as reimbursement, restitution, or compensatory damages. Additionally, it can be restored to victims of the offense or transferred to specific federal agencies like the Resolution Trust Corporation or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The seized property can be transferred to federal agencies, state or local law enforcement, or financial institution regulatory agencies for purposes such as reimbursement, restitution, or compensatory damages. The Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, or the Postal Service may order the discontinuance of any forfeiture proceedings under this section in favor of the institution of forfeiture proceedings by State or local authorities under an appropriate State or local statute. After filing a complaint for forfeiture, the Attorney General may seek dismissal in favor of State or local proceedings. The United States can transfer seized property to State or local officials upon initiation of proper actions. Notice must be sent to interested parties if forfeiture proceedings are discontinued. The United States is not liable for actions related to seizure, detention, or transfer of seized property. Upon commission of the act leading to forfeiture, all property rights transfer to the United States. The court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings at the request of the government to protect related criminal investigations. If a claimant is involved in a related criminal case and has standing in the civil forfeiture proceeding, the court may also stay the proceedings to avoid burdening their rights. The court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings to protect related criminal investigations and the rights of the claimant against self-incrimination. A protective order limiting discovery may be used instead of a stay if it does not unfairly limit the opposing party's ability to pursue the case. The terms \"related criminal case\" and \"related criminal investigation\" refer to ongoing prosecutions or investigations at the time of the request for a stay. The court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings to protect related criminal investigations and the claimant's rights against self-incrimination. The Government can request a stay and submit evidence ex parte in certain cases. The court must enter orders to preserve property value and protect the rights of lienholders during the stay. (7) A determination by the court that the claimant has standing to request a stay pursuant to paragraph (2) shall apply only to this subsection and shall not preclude the Government from objecting to the standing of the claimant. In addition to the venue provided for in section 1395 of title 28, a proceeding for forfeiture under this section may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant owning the property is found or where the criminal prosecution is brought. Whenever property is forfeited under this chapter, the Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury may transfer the forfeited property or proceeds to. The Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury may transfer forfeited property or proceeds to a foreign country under certain conditions, with the foreign country bearing all related expenses. The decision for such a transfer is final and not subject to review. The Attorney General or the Secretary of the Treasury may transfer forfeited property or proceeds to a foreign country, with the foreign country bearing all transfer costs. The terms and conditions of the transfer will be set at their discretion. This section does not limit other US authorities from providing assistance to foreign countries in obtaining crime-related property. A certified order or judgment of forfeiture by a foreign court concerning property described in subsection (a)(1)(B) can be transferred under this section. Certified orders or judgments of forfeiture or conviction from foreign courts related to unlawful drug activities are admissible as evidence in proceedings under this section. They create a rebuttable presumption of the forfeitability of the property in question. Certified orders or judgments of forfeiture or conviction from foreign courts related to unlawful drug activities are admissible as evidence in proceedings under this section, creating a rebuttable presumption of the forfeitability of the property. The provisions do not limit the admissibility of any evidence or the ability of the United States to establish probable cause for forfeiture. The terms \"Attorney General\" and \"Secretary of the Treasury\" are defined for this section. Interbank accounts are subject to forfeiture under this section or the Controlled Substances Act if funds are deposited into a foreign bank account. If funds are deposited into a foreign bank account with an interbank account in the United States, the funds are deemed to be in the US account. The Attorney General can suspend a forfeiture if there is a conflict of law between the foreign bank's jurisdiction and US laws. The Attorney General can suspend a forfeiture action if there is a conflict of law between the foreign bank's jurisdiction and US laws. In such cases, the Government is not required to trace the funds back to the original deposit or rely on specific sections. The owner of the funds can contest the forfeiture by filing a claim under section 983. The owner of the funds can contest the forfeiture by filing a claim under section 983, with specific definitions for \"interbank account\" and \"owner\" provided. The foreign bank may be considered the \"owner\" only under certain circumstances.

The person convicted must forfeit any property representing gross proceeds obtained from the violation. The court may order forfeiture of property obtained from specific federal law violations, including fraud offenses related to motor vehicles and immigration laws. The person convicted must forfeit any property representing gross proceeds obtained from the violation, regardless of any provision of State law. This includes any conveyance used in the offense and any property derived from or used to facilitate the offense. The court may order forfeiture of property obtained from federal law violations, including fraud offenses related to motor vehicles and immigration laws. The person convicted must forfeit any property representing gross proceeds obtained from the violation, regardless of State law provisions. This includes any property used in the offense and any property derived from or used to facilitate the offense. The defendant may forfeit property obtained from the offense, governed by the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. Substitution of assets is not allowed unless the defendant conducted three or more transactions totaling $100,000 in a year. Notice, claim, and complaint procedures apply. In nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceedings, the Government must send written notice to interested parties within 60 days of seizure, unless a civil judicial forfeiture action is filed within that time frame. If a criminal indictment alleging forfeiture is obtained, notice must be sent within 60 days to continue the nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding. In nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceedings, the Government must send written notice to interested parties within 60 days of seizure, unless a civil judicial forfeiture action is filed within that time frame. If a criminal indictment alleging forfeiture is obtained, notice must be sent within 60 days to continue the nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding. If the property is seized by a State or local law enforcement agency and turned over to a Federal agency for forfeiture, notice must be sent within 90 days of seizure. If the identity of a party is determined before a declaration of forfeiture is entered, notice must be sent within 60 days of that determination. The period for sending notice in civil forfeiture proceedings can be extended for up to 30 days by a supervisory official, and up to 60 days by a court upon motion by the Government. This extension can only occur if there is a reason to believe that notice may have adverse consequences, such as endangering an individual's safety or prompting flight. In nonjudicial forfeitures, Federal seizing agencies must report to Congress on extensions granted for sending notice of seizure. Failure to notify the property owner without an extension results in property return, except for contraband. The Government is not required to return contraband or property that cannot be legally possessed. A person can file a claim for seized property in a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding within a specified deadline, providing specific details and making the claim under oath. Each Federal agency conducting nonjudicial forfeitures must adhere to these procedures. Any person can file a claim for seized property in a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding within 90 days. The Government must either file a complaint for forfeiture or return the property within this timeframe. The Government must file a complaint for forfeiture within 90 days or return the property. If a criminal indictment is obtained before the deadline, the property will be released, and no further civil forfeiture action can be taken. The Government may also include a forfeiture allegation in a criminal indictment. The Government must file a complaint for forfeiture within 90 days or return the property. No complaint may be dismissed for lack of evidence. Any person claiming an interest in seized property may file a claim within 30 days. A person asserting an interest shall file an answer to the Government's complaint within 20 days. If a person with standing to contest the forfeiture of property is financially unable to obtain representation, the court may authorize counsel appointed under section 3006A to represent them. The court considers factors like the person's standing and the claim's good faith. In a judicial civil forfeiture proceeding, if a person is unable to afford representation and the property subject to forfeiture is their primary residence, the court must ensure they are represented by an attorney from the Legal Services Corporation. The Legal Services Corporation will submit a statement of attorney fees and costs to the court, which will be treated as payable regardless of the case's outcome. The court will determine the compensation for representation under this provision. The compensation for representation in civil forfeiture cases is set to match court-appointed representation fees. The burden of proof is on the Government to show by evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the property is linked to a criminal offense, a substantial connection must be established. An innocent owner can defend their interest in the property. An innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. The burden of proof is on the claimant to prove innocence by a preponderance of the evidence. An innocent owner is one who did not know of the illegal conduct leading to forfeiture or took reasonable steps to stop such use of the property upon learning about it. Ways to demonstrate innocence may include timely reporting to law enforcement. An innocent owner must give timely notice to law enforcement and take steps to prevent illegal use of the property to be considered innocent. They are not required to take actions that may endanger others. Innocent ownership applies to property acquired before the illegal conduct took place, and the burden of proof is on the claimant to prove innocence. An innocent owner must give timely notice to law enforcement and take steps to prevent illegal use of the property to be considered innocent. They are not required to take actions that may endanger others. Innocent ownership applies to property acquired before the illegal conduct took place, and the burden of proof is on the claimant to prove innocence. A valid claim for forfeiture shall not be denied if the claimant acquired the property as a bona fide purchaser or seller for value and had no knowledge or reason to believe the property was subject to forfeiture. The court limits the value of real property interest for innocent ownership to maintain reasonable shelter. No ownership interest can be asserted in contraband or illegal property. If an innocent owner has a partial interest in forfeited property, the court may sever or transfer the property. The innocent owner can be compensated by the Government once a final order of forfeiture is entered, or retain the property with a lien in favor of the Government. The term \"owner\" includes a person with an ownership interest in the specific property sought to be forfeited, but excludes those with only a general unsecured interest or claim against the property of another. In a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding, a nominee with no control over the property can file a motion to set aside a forfeiture declaration if they did not receive written notice and the Government failed to provide notice despite knowing of their interest. If the court grants the motion, the forfeiture declaration will be set aside without prejudice to the Government's right to pursue forfeiture later. A motion can be filed to set aside a forfeiture declaration in a civil forfeiture proceeding if the nominee did not receive notice and the Government knew of their interest. The motion must be filed within 5 years of the final publication of the seizure notice. If granted, the forfeiture declaration is set aside without prejudice, allowing the Government to pursue forfeiture later. If the forfeited property has been disposed of, the Government can seek a substitute sum of money equal to the value of the nominee's interest. The exclusive remedy for setting aside a forfeiture declaration in a civil forfeiture proceeding is through a motion. A claimant can request immediate release of seized property if they have a possessory interest, ties to the community, and face substantial hardship if the property is not returned. A claimant can request the release of seized property by filing a petition in the district court if the property is not released within 15 days of the request. The petition must outline the basis for release and the steps taken to secure it. The claimant can file a petition in the district court to request the release of seized property if it is not returned within 15 days. The court must render a decision on the petition within 30 days, unless extended by consent or for good cause. If the claim is found to be frivolous, the court will deny the petition. In some cases, the Government may submit evidence ex parte to protect ongoing criminal investigations. If the claimant meets the requirements, the court will order the property to be returned pending completion of government proceedings. The court may enter orders to maintain the value of seized property during forfeiture proceedings, including inspection, bonding, and insurance requirements. The Government can place a lien or file a lis pendens to prevent property transfer. This subsection does not apply to contraband, currency, or electronic funds. The court may enter orders to maintain the value of seized property during forfeiture proceedings, including inspection, bonding, and insurance requirements. The Government can place a lien or file a lis pendens to prevent property transfer. This subsection does not apply to contraband, currency, or electronic funds. Funds seized may not be returned unless they are assets of a legitimate business, used as evidence of a violation of the law, suited for illegal activities, or likely to be used for additional criminal acts if returned. Claimants can petition the court to determine if the forfeiture was constitutionally excessive, with the burden of proof on the claimant to show gross disproportionality. If the court finds the forfeiture excessive, it may reduce or eliminate it. In civil forfeiture proceedings, if the court deems the forfeiture excessive, it may reduce or eliminate it to avoid violating the Eighth Amendment. A civil fine of 10% of the forfeited property's value, with a minimum of $250 and a maximum of $5,000, may be imposed on claimants who assert frivolous interests in the property. This fine does not prevent the court from imposing additional sanctions. Prisoners are restricted from filing claims or appealing judgments in civil forfeiture cases. Prisoners are prohibited from filing claims or appealing judgments in civil forfeiture cases if they have a history of frivolous or malicious actions in court, unless they can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.
