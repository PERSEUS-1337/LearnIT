    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coming Together for National Guard and Reserve Families Act of 2007\". Key findings are also included in the Act. Since September 11, 2001, over 700,000 children have had a parent deployed overseas as a member of the Armed Forces, with over 2,700 children experiencing the loss of a parent in Iraq or Afghanistan. Mental health symptoms are reported by 41% of National Guard and Reserve members within three to six months of returning home from deployment, compared to 32% of regular military members. Additionally, 15% of National Guard and Reserve members are at risk for PTSD, compared to 9% of regular military members, with family stress potentially triggering PTSD symptoms. Military families, especially those of National Guard and Reserve members, face challenges due to distance from military bases and lack of support services. Multiple extended deployments lead to stress, putting children at risk for behavioral problems, academic difficulties, anxiety, and depression. Research suggests that military families facing difficulties due to deployments can benefit from community and social support. This support can help ease transitional stress, prevent mental health problems, and assist in a smooth transition back to civilian life for National Guard and Reserve members. SEC. 3. FAMILY SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES OF MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE UNDERGOING DEPLOYMENT. The Secretary of Defense will enhance programs to provide family support for National Guard and Reserve members, including staff to assist with family care plans during deployment.

The program aims to identify and prevent family problems, provide peer support, and reduce adverse outcomes for children, such as academic performance issues and behavioral problems. The pilot program aims to assess the feasibility of utilizing spouses of Armed Forces members as counselors for National Guard and Reserve families during deployment. This program is in addition to existing assistance programs by the Secretary of Defense. The pilot program involves providing assistance to spouses and families of National Guard and Reserve members deployed, focusing on family readiness, health care, crisis referral, and mental health outreach. Spouses acting as counselors will receive training, and a report on the program's activities will be submitted to Congress within a year of enactment.
