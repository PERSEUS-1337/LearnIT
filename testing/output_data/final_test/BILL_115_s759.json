    "content": "The Act titled \"Currency Optimization, Innovation, and National Savings Act of 2017\" aims to save taxpayers money by suspending the production of the penny. The United States policy states that sufficient one-cent coins have been minted, taxpayers are losing money producing them, and further production is unnecessary for the next decade. The Secretary of the Treasury will temporarily suspend production of new one-cent coins for 10 years, with an exception for producing coins for numismatic collectors. The one-cent coins produced under the exception will be sold as collectible coins, with net receipts covering production costs. A GAO study will assess the impact of suspending production of the one-cent coin within 3 years. The House committees will report on whether to continue or reinstate one-cent coin production, considering taxpayer savings, public demand, and the possibility of ending the one-cent denomination permanently. The one-cent coin remains legal tender in the United States for all debts, public charges, taxes, and duties, regardless of minting date or issue. Saving taxpayers money by changing the composition of the nickel. The Director of the United States Mint will modify the composition of the five-cent coin to 80% copper and 20% nickel to reduce costs to taxpayers and ensure seamless acceptance by coin-acceptors. The Director of the United States Mint may increase copper content and decrease nickel in the five-cent coin with Congressional approval and a submitted study. Replacing $1 notes with $1 coins to save taxpayers money. The United States policy aims to replace $1 Federal Reserve notes with $1 coins. After a transition period, the Federal Reserve may no longer issue $1 notes, ensuring an adequate supply of $1 coins. All $1 notes removed from circulation will be destroyed. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may produce $1 Federal Reserve notes for collectors, which will be sold as collectible versions. These notes remain legal tender in the United States regardless of the date of printing or issue."
