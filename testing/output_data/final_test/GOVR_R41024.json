    "content": "Since 1971, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has been a self-supporting, wholly governmental entity. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1971 replaced the U.S. Post Office Department with the USPS, which operates independently and covers its operating costs through revenue from postage sales. The USPS receives a small annual appropriation but does not rely on it for funding. The USPS receives a small annual appropriation of about $100 million, which is 0.1% of its $75 billion operating budget. This appropriation compensates the USPS for providing free mailing privileges to blind persons and overseas voters as directed by Congress. The Postal Service Fund, used for most financial transactions, is off-budget and not subject to congressional controls. The USPS can borrow money from the U.S. Treasury, with an annual debt increase limit of $3 billion. The USPS's finances have deteriorated with a total debt of $13 billion by FY2011, close to its statutory debt limit of $15 billion. The GAO flagged the USPS's financial condition as high-risk in 2009 due to mounting deficits attributed to a drop in mail volume. The USPS's recent deficits are not solely due to a drop in mail volume and postage revenue. Despite a decrease in mail pieces, revenues remained steady from FY2006 to FY2008 due to postage increases. However, from FY2009 to FY2011, mail volume continued to decline, leading to a 17.7% drop in volume and a 12.3% decrease in operating revenues. Operating expenses have also increased significantly, partly due to the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) established the Retiree Health Benefit Fund (RHBF) and required the USPS to prefund future retirees' health benefits at a cost of $5.6 billion per year for 10 years. This move shifted the USPS from funding retiree health care costs annually to prefunding obligations. The USPS reported an unfunded obligation of $46.2 billion as of the end of FY2011. Operating expenses spiked after the USPS began paying into the RHBF in FY2007, impacting profitability significantly. The USPS's profitability was significantly impacted by the Health Benefits Fund, with operating losses experienced until FY2009 if not for the fund payments. Despite Congress reducing payments in FY2009 and delaying payments in FY2011, expenses still exceeded revenues. By the end of FY2011, USPS had low cash reserves, leading to the suspension of contributions to the Federal Employee Retirement System to conserve cash. The USPS planned to resume payments after seeking legal advice. The USPS reported in November 2011 that it expected to resume paying the bi-weekly FERS payment, owing $911 million as of September 30, 2011. Despite concerns, the USPS was able to make a $1.3 billion payment to the Department of Labor for worker's compensation in October 2011. In FY2012, the USPS had an operating loss of $11.5 billion, with $12.6 billion in debt and a weak cash position of $893 million. The USPS may borrow only $2.0 billion more from the Federal Financing Bank. The USPS is facing financial challenges with insufficient cash to make payments to its Retiree Health Benefits Fund. It may experience a liquidity shortfall in October, but has not indicated a suspension of operations. The USPS is facing financial challenges with insufficient cash to make payments to its Retiree Health Benefits Fund. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe stated that the USPS could maintain operations until late next year. Congress alleviated the USPS's cash shortage in FY2009 by reducing its operating expenses by $4 billion. The USPS faced financial challenges with a $4 billion obligation deferred to FY2017, to be amortized over 40 years. Congress aided the USPS in FY2011 by delaying payments multiple times. The USPS's financial challenges raise questions about its ability to respond to market changes. Incremental reforms have been proposed to improve the USPS. The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) reported that USPS carries mail below cost, leading to a $609 million deficit in processing periodicals in FY2011. Congress may need to consider giving USPS more pricing flexibility to increase revenue due to declining mail volume. USPS requested a 5.6% postage rate increase due to a decline in mail volume, but the PRC denied the request, stating the cash flow problem was not due to the recession. After a federal court remanded the matter to the PRC in 2011, USPS plans to pursue the rate increase again. The USPS plans to pursue an exigent rate increase to increase revenues by offering nonpostal products and services. Congress may need to consider the USPS entering nonpostal business lines for immediate financial gains. The USPS has a significant unfunded obligation for retiree health benefits payments. The USPS has a significant unfunded obligation for retiree health benefits payments, totaling $33.9 billion for FY2011 through FY2016. The USPSOIG and the PRC have differing views on the payment schedule, with the PRC suggesting that the USPSOIG understated the liability due to underestimating healthcare inflation, while the OPM overestimated the liability. The PRC argued that the USPS's liability was overstated by the OPM due to inflated healthcare inflation rates and workforce size estimates. Disputes over annual RHBF payments have been overshadowed by the USPS's inability to pay $11.1 billion by September 30, 2012. Congress may need to reconsider payment schedules and obligations, potentially reducing annual payments to manageable levels. The OPM Inspector General (OPMIG) explains that the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) is funded by employee and agency contributions. The USPS has overpaid $10.9 billion into its FERS pensions and has requested a refund. The OPMIG supports the USPS's claim but notes that a statute would be needed for the refund to be authorized. The USPS overpaid $10.9 billion into its FERS pensions and requested a refund, which would require a statute for authorization. A report criticized the allocation of pension costs between USPS and the federal government for employees with service before and after 1971. The USPS is responsible for meeting all pension costs under CSRS for employees hired after 1971. The USPSOIG report criticized the unfair allocation of CSRS pension costs between the USPS and the federal government for employees with service before and after 1971. The Postal Service bears the responsibility for increases in pension costs resulting from pay raises granted after 1971, leading to a disproportionate allocation of costs for employees who worked for both the Post Office Department and the USPS. The USPSOIG report criticized the unfair allocation of CSRS pension costs between the USPS and the federal government for employees with service before and after 1971. It suggested a proportional allocation based on employees' length of service with the USPS. The current method has resulted in the Postal Service paying $75 billion more into the Civil Service Retirement System. The Postal Service has paid $75 billion more into the Civil Service Retirement System due to unfair allocation of pension costs. The OPM denied a request to reconsider the allocation method citing federal law. The purpose of H.R. 29 is to establish the responsibility of the U.S. Postal Service to finance increases in the liability of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. This legislation aims to ensure that any increase in CSRS pension expenses resulting from future pay raises for USPS employees is borne by the Postal Service. Changing the allocation of CSRS pension expenses between the Postal Service and the general fund of the U.S. Treasury could impact the unfunded liability of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The Postal Service and U.S. Treasury share CSRS pension expenses, with any reduction for USPS leading to an increase for the Treasury. The PRC examined USPS's pension liability, with a report suggesting a $50-$55 billion adjustment in favor of USPS. The OPMIG disagrees, stating current apportionment aligns with congressional intent and law, warning against setting a precedent by allowing USPS to reclaim CSRS pension funds. The GAO has stated that the USPS has not \"overpaid\" its CSRS obligation, and allowing the USPS to reclaim pension funds would set a dangerous precedent. President Obama proposed requiring USPS employees to pay the same percentage towards health premiums and life insurance as other federal workers, estimating savings of $752 million in FY2010 and $9.5 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. The USPS has made efforts to save money by closing facilities, including retail postal facilities and mail processing facilities. The agency announced closures of 48 mail processing facilities in 2012 and an additional 98 facilities in 2013. However, no closures were planned for the autumn due to high-priority mail volume during the election and holiday seasons. The GAO has criticized the USPS for not reducing its number of retail postal facilities. The USPS has not reduced its number of retail postal facilities and mail processing plants sufficiently, with about 80 percent of retail facilities not covering their costs. The number of USPS-operated retail facilities has remained largely unchanged over the past 5 years despite decreasing visits and transactions. The USPS has only reduced its facility footprint by 3.1% in the past five years, from 34,318 to 33,260. The USPS has faced stakeholder resistance in closing post offices and mail processing facilities, prompting Congress to consider granting additional authority to reduce facilities. Congress may also need to enact rules to prevent intervention in facility closures and provide appropriations for cost-savings lost due to delays. The GAO suggests reducing delivery schedules from six to five days, a policy the USPS supports, as Title 39 of the U.S. Code does not mandate mail delivery six days a week. The USPS is required by federal law to deliver mail six days a week, with Congress mandating this in annual appropriations since 1984. The USPS interprets this as preventing them from moving to five-day mail delivery until Congress changes the provision. Studies have shown that switching to five-day delivery would save money for the USPS. Studies suggest that reducing USPS delivery from six to five days would save money, mainly through reduced labor expenses. The estimated annual improvement to USPS's financial condition would be between $1.7 billion to $3.5 billion. The USPS plans to provide at least six months' notice before implementing five-day delivery, and requested an advisory opinion from the PRC on the matter in 2010. The PRC issued an advisory opinion in March 2011, suggesting that cutting Saturday delivery could save the USPS $1.7 billion annually. Critics argue that the USPS struggles to control its employment costs, which make up 80% of its total operating costs. The President's Commission on the United States Postal Service highlighted the special status of postal workers, who have the right to negotiate wages and workplace conditions through collective bargaining. The USPS is required by law to maintain compensation comparable to the private sector. Disputes between management and labor often favor employees, leading to lower health insurance premiums and protection from layoffs. The USPS has reduced its workforce through attrition and early retirement incentives. The USPS has reduced its workforce through early retirement incentives and buy-outs, with 21,000 postmasters recently offered incentives to retire. They have also requested Congress to authorize layoffs to eliminate 120,000 positions by FY2015. Over 189,000 Postal Service employees are eligible for retirement in 2012. Congress may need to consider measures to help the USPS control long-term labor costs."
