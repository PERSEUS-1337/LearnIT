    "content": "The \"Native American $1 Coin Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It establishes the Native American $1 Coin Program. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include the redesign and issuance of circulating $1 coins honoring Native Americans and their contributions to US history starting in 2008. The coins will feature the 'Sacagawea design' on the obverse and a design on the reverse selected according to specific guidelines. The Native American $1 Coin Act, if enacted after August 25, 2007, will substitute '2009' for '2008'. The $1 coins must have designs celebrating Indian tribes and Native Americans' contributions to the US history. The obverse design will be chosen by the Secretary. The Native American $1 Coin Act requires the $1 coins to feature the 'Sacagawea design' and the inscription 'Liberty'. The year of minting, 'E Pluribus Unum', and 'In God We Trust' must be edge-incused into the coin to preserve its distinctive edge for easy identification by visually impaired individuals. The designs for the reverse of the coins described in the Native American $1 Coin Act are chosen by the Secretary after consultation with various committees and may depict individuals and events. The Native American $1 Coin Act includes designs on the reverse of the coins depicting key figures and events such as the creation of Cherokee written language, the Iroquois Confederacy, Wampanoag Chief Massasoit, the `Pueblo Revolt', Olympian Jim Thorpe, Ely S. Parker, and code talkers who served in World War I and II. The Native American $1 Coin Act mandates that each year, a $1 coin will be issued with a design emblematic of an important Native American contribution. The design must not depict an individual in a size that could make the coin appear to be '2-headed'. The coin will be minted with the reverse design for a 1-year period starting on January 1 of that year. The Native American $1 Coin Act mandates issuing coins commemorating Native Americans and their contributions in chronological order until the program ends, then in any order deemed appropriate by the Secretary after consultation with relevant committees. The Secretary may also mint numismatic coins. The Secretary has the authority to mint and issue $1 coins in uncirculated and proof qualities, with a minimum of 20% of the total $1 coins minted each year featuring the Sacagawea design on the obverse. SEC. 3. TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Section 5112(n)(1) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to redesign beginning in 2007 and remove subparagraph (B), redesignating clauses (i) and (ii) as subparagraphs (A) and (B) respectively. SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF BARRIERS TO CIRCULATION OF $1 COIN. The Secretary of the Treasury will implement a campaign to promote the use of $1 coins with the Sacagawea design to encourage businesses to accept and distribute them. An annual report on the success of this effort will be submitted to Congress."
