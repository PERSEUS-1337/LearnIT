    "content": "Observers have long expressed concerns about the federal government's fiscal situation, focusing on the balance between revenues and spending, as well as trends in entitlement program spending. The Congressional Budget Office warns that the federal budget is on an unsustainable path, with debt growing faster than the economy. Despite widespread recognition of the problem, consensus on solutions is lacking, and policymakers struggle to agree on specific policy changes and decision-making processes. When addressing complex policy challenges like the federal government's fiscal situation or restructuring policies and agencies, Congress debates the process, sequence, and timing of decision-making. Different procedural strategies, including the regular legislative process, are considered to address issues such as reducing the budget deficit or making organizational changes post-emergency. The framers of the Constitution established various procedures for handling legislative proposals and presidential discretion, impacting power dynamics and policy implementation. The framers of the Constitution established a cautious system for enacting legislation, leading to frustration with Congress and the President not addressing policy problems in a timely manner. Congress has used alternative approaches like creating \"blue-ribbon\" commissions to review agencies and policies. Representation issues may arise with commission members, but expedited legislative consideration of commission recommendations is rare. In recent Congresses, legislative proposals have been introduced to establish a special commission to address aspects of the federal government's fiscal balance. These proposals include a commission that would review multiple agencies, programs, and revenue policies, making recommendations for changes in government operations. Some proposals suggest expedited consideration by Congress, prohibiting amendments. Legislation in the 111th Congress has also discussed similar measures. The legislation proposals aim to address the federal government's long-term fiscal situation through a bipartisan commission with members appointed by congressional leaders. Special procedures would expedite consideration of approved recommendations, limiting amendments and debate. The Senate Budget Committee hearing discussed legislation proposals that would establish bipartisan commissions to address the federal government's long-term fiscal situation. Specific bills mentioned include the SAFE Commission Act, the SSMSC Act, and the BTFRFA Act of 2007, which aimed to limit amendments and debate for final chamber passage. The Conrad-Gregg proposal, also known as the BTFRFA Act of 2009, was introduced in December 2009. Members were looking for a legislative vehicle to enact commission legislation. Senator Conrad and other Democrats were negotiating to attach the bill to the debt limit legislation. The White House was likely to propose its own panel with less power than the Conrad-Gregg commission. The BTFRFA Act of 2009 proposes a temporary commission with 18 members, appointed by the President and House/Senate leadership. If enacted, Democrats would appoint 10 members and Republicans would appoint 8. The BTFRFA Act of 2009 proposes a temporary commission with 18 members, appointed by the President and House/Senate leadership. The commission would review the federal government's fiscal imbalance, analyze potential courses of action, and provide recommendations to Congress. The commission report would need to be approved by 14 of the 18 commissioners and could include minority opinions. S. 2853 would authorize a transfer of $9 million for staff, member travel reimbursements, and contract authority. The Securing America's Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act proposes a temporary commission with 18 voting and two non-voting members. The bill includes provisions for public announcement of meeting details, hearings, and prohibits proxy voting. Expedited consideration of proposed legislation by the commission is allowed with a three-fifths majority vote required for final passage. If enacted, the commission would have 10 Democratic members if the President and Congress were Democrat-controlled. The SAFE Commission Act proposes a temporary commission with 18 voting and two non-voting members, including Democrats and Republicans. The commission would study and report on specific fiscal issues to the President and Congress. The proposed legislation, S. 1056, aims to establish a commission to address long-term fiscal issues. It requires at least 13 members to vote in favor of submitting a legislative proposal to Congress. The commission would need funding through appropriation or transfer authority and would have a director, additional staff, and the power to hold public hearings. Expedited consideration of proposed legislation would be allowed, with a prohibition on amendments. The House version of the SAFE Commission Act, H.R. 1557, is similar to the Senate version, S. 1056, with some differences in the number of commission members appointed by Democrats and Republicans. If H.R. 1557 is enacted with a Democrat President and majority in both chambers, Democrats would appoint 10 members and Republicans would appoint 6. H.R. 1557, like S. 1056, establishes a commission to study and report on fiscal issues. The commission would address federal spending imbalances, national savings, foreign debt ownership, and budget process improvements. A legislative proposal must be submitted with a three-fourths vote within 60 days of the report. Amendments are limited. The Social Security and Medicare Solvency Commission (SSMSC) Act proposes a 15-member commission to study the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. Members would be appointed by the President, Democratic and Republican legislative leaders, with specific requirements for appointees from Congress. Amendments to the legislative proposal must be submitted within 60 days of the commission's report. The bill proposes a 15-member commission to study the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. Commission members would include seven Democrats, seven Republicans, and one \"unaffiliated\" person, with at least four members being Members of Congress. The commission would report findings and recommendations every five years to the President, Congress, and relevant agencies. The bill proposes a 15-member commission to study the solvency of Medicare and Social Security. The commission would analyze problems, propose solutions, and ensure long-term solvency through legislative language. It would require at least 10 votes for any finding, conclusion, or recommendation to be included in the report. The bill also outlines provisions for the commission's operations, including the appointment of an executive director, hiring staff, holding public hearings, and funding. Special procedures would govern the consideration of legislation submitted by the commission, requiring a three-fifths vote to proceed to a vote on initial proposals. In the past, Congress has established over 80 advisory commissions to study policy problems and make legislative recommendations. Some previous commissions have influenced the design of fiscal commission proposals discussed in this report. Congress may consider the success of past commissions when creating new ones. The text discusses the potential application of past commission successes to the creation of a new commission addressing the federal government's long-term fiscal situation, particularly focusing on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Previous efforts to address entitlement-related issues through commissions are also highlighted. The establishment of commissions to review public policy, specifically Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commissions, has been proposed as a procedural model for achieving policy objectives. Following the end of the Cold War, there was consensus that the Department of Defense had more bases than needed, but debates arose over which bases to close, how quickly, and the criteria for closure decisions. The impact of base closures would be significant in certain congressional districts, but would result in savings. The closure of military bases could have a significant impact on specific congressional districts, but the savings from closing multiple bases would benefit all taxpayers. This created strong incentives for coalitions of Members of Congress to protect bases from closure. Concerns were raised about the Department of Defense potentially closing bases for political reasons, with reports of implied threats to close bases in districts where support was lacking. House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey highlighted the historical use of base closings as political leverage by administrations to influence Congress. In the late 1980s, efforts were made to ease restrictions on base closures, leading to the establishment of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act in 1988. This framework, involving a commission to make recommendations and a fast-track voting process, was effective and led to the creation of subsequent BRAC Commissions in 1990. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 created three subsequent BRAC Commissions in 1991, 1993, and 1995. The legislation vested power in both the executive and legislative branches, with the President appointing commissioners after consulting with congressional leadership. All commissioners were subject to Senate approval. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 established criteria for evaluating installations for closure or realignment. The Secretary of Defense had to submit recommendations to a commission, which could accept, amend, or reject them. The President could only accept or return the commission's list once for reconsideration. If not rejected by Congress within 45 days, the Secretary of Defense had to implement approved recommendations. In 1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen proposed two new rounds of base closures and realignments to save costs. Despite pressure from the Department of Defense, most Members of Congress were hesitant to authorize new base closure legislation. An additional round of base closures was approved in 2001, with changes to the process including an increase in the number of commissioners from eight to nine. The BRAC statute required an increase in the number of commissioners from eight to nine to prevent tie votes and a supermajority for installation closure decisions. It mandated impartial recommendations based on expert analysis, with the Secretary of Defense providing documentation for review. Legislation introduced in the 107th Congress by Senator Sam Brownback and Representative Todd Tiahrt laid the groundwork for the commission bills discussed in the report. The proposals in the report aimed to establish a commission to review multiple agencies and programs, make recommendations, and have Congress consider draft legislation under expedited procedures. Similar bills have been introduced in subsequent Congresses, including the CARFA bills introduced by Senator Brownback and Representative Tiahrt in 2002. The CARFA bills proposed the establishment of a commission to review executive agencies and programs, make recommendations for realignment or elimination, and expedite the legislative process in Congress. Proponents argued it would eliminate ineffective programs, while critics viewed it as an abdication of congressional responsibilities. The CARFA bills proposed delegating congressional responsibilities to presidential appointees or appointees chosen by the President's political party. A Senate hearing was held on S. 1668 in the 108th Congress, and H.R. 5766 was postponed in the 109th Congress due to opposition. Senator Judd Gregg sponsored S. 3521 in the 109th Congress, including CARFA-like provisions in a budget reform package. The report supported provisions in S. 3521 for fiscal responsibility and accountability. An amendment to replace the CARFA commission with congressional committees was proposed but defeated. The bill also included provisions for a National Commission on Entitlement Solvency, similar to previous legislation. The provisions in S. 3521 of the 109th Congress focused on fiscal responsibility and accountability, including the establishment of a National Commission on Entitlement Solvency. Significant differences were noted between the entitlement commission provisions in various bills from different Congress sessions, with special legislative procedures to expedite consideration of approved recommendations. The fiscal commission proposals aim to restrict the amendment process and limit floor consideration or debate, with a broad scope covering all policies related to the federal fiscal balance. Supermajority approval by commission members and Congress is required for the recommendations to pass. The CARFA proposals, similar to the fiscal commission proposals, aimed for broad scopes across multiple agencies and programs but faced opposition due to concerns about appointment control and process-related provisions. The fiscal commission and CARFA proposals differed in the appointment of commission members, with the former potentially reducing the President's influence. Supermajority voting requirements in the fiscal commission proposals aimed to promote broader compromise for approval. Special legislative procedures in both proposals could impact power relationships within Congress. The use of a commission to address long-term fiscal issues may impact power relationships within Congress and raise questions about representation. Decisions on establishing a commission could affect policy outcomes and the public choice process. Key issues include comparing the strengths and weaknesses of using a commission versus the regular legislative process, implications of fast-track procedures with commission recommendations, and structural concerns. Throughout American history, Congress has found advisory commissions to be useful tools in the legislative process. Commissions are established to cope with legislation complexity, forge consensus, draft bills, promote communication, address jurisdictional issues, and provide recommendations. The advantages of commissions include expertise, handling political complexity, building consensus, reducing partisanship, solving collective action problems, and increasing visibility. Congress may establish commissions when lacking knowledge in a policy area. Establishing commissions with experts in specific policy areas can help legislators efficiently tackle complex public policy problems. These commissions can focus on individual issues full-time, bypassing jurisdictional and institutional challenges faced by Congress. Additionally, they allow for in-depth analysis and solutions without distractions. Establishing commissions with experts in specific policy areas can help legislators efficiently tackle complex public policy problems by allowing legislation or policy solutions to bypass the traditional development process in Congress. This can help avoid impediments in a decentralized legislature and provide a more flexible environment for policy debates to develop over time. Commissions can focus on individual issues full-time, allowing for in-depth analysis and solutions without distractions. Establishing commissions with experts in specific policy areas can help legislators efficiently tackle complex public policy problems by allowing legislation or policy solutions to bypass the traditional development process in Congress. The potential for a congressional advisory commission to take on a nonpartisan or bipartisan character may make its findings and recommendations less susceptible to criticisms and more politically acceptable. A perception of bipartisanship or nonpartisanship may give a commission's recommendations credibility, even when dealing with divisive issues. Commissions provide space for factions to negotiate compromises and allow legislators to address collective action problems. Legislators can use a commission to jointly \"tie their hands\" to protect the interests of their district, allowing consensus on policy solutions. BRAC commissions are examples of neutral bodies making decisions on military base closures. Congress had to accept or reject the list of bases as a whole, preventing amendments to save individual bases. This protection didn't always prevent charges of not saving a district's base. By establishing a commission, Congress can provide a visible forum for important issues, composed of notable public figures transferring personal prestige to policy solutions. Commissions may garner more media attention than congressional committees, temporarily focusing public attention on topics for potential congressional action. However, congressional advisory commissions have faced criticism from political and scholarly observers. Critics argue that commissions are an \"abdication of responsibility\" by legislators, undemocratic, and financially inefficient. Some believe commissions are created for \"blame avoidance,\" allowing legislators to distance themselves from controversial decisions. Critics argue that commissions may not represent the general population and lack popular accountability, leading to undemocratic practices. Commission members, often not elected officials, may not reflect diverse public interests, potentially limiting the goals pursued compared to the regular legislative process. Commission members are insulated from election pressures and public opinion, operating in private. High costs and low returns, coupled with Congress's lack of obligation to act on recommendations, may undermine legitimacy. There is no guarantee of a balanced product as members may have their own agendas. Some argue that advisory boards may lead to inefficiency and patronage, with members having biases and producing mediocre work. The overall cost of commissions varies, with budgets ranging from tens of thousands to millions annually, depending on staff numbers and commission scope. The cost of commissions can vary greatly depending on factors such as staff numbers and scope. Expedited legislative procedures may have advantages and disadvantages, with perceptions varying based on policy objectives. Congress rarely considers commission recommendations under expedited procedures. The BRAC commissions have rarely been considered under expedited legislative procedures, which are pursued to facilitate action on controversial matters with widespread agreement on needed changes. These processes help elected officials communicate difficult trade-offs and may result in changes to power relationships among Congress, the President, agencies, and other participants. Expedited procedures in legislative processes can impact power relationships within Congress, affecting agendas, schedules, and workloads controlled by committees. These procedures may also influence the consideration of measures approved by committees, the determination of measures on the floor by a voting majority, and the setting of floor agendas by the majority party. The House and Senate can set conditions for floor debate and amendment appropriate for each measure. Special procedures in fiscal commission bills may differ from traditional legislative processes. Commission proposals resemble aspects of the BRAC process, limiting amendments and floor debate. S. 276 allows \"relevant\" amendments, while S. 2853 and S. 276 would require proposed legislative language for congressional consideration. The proposed commissions, such as S. 2853 and S. 276, require three-fifths votes for final passage or initial vote. S. 1056 and H.R. 1557 do not need supermajorities. The commissions study policy problems, provide advisory reports, and have unique membership structures. The proposed commissions have different membership and appointment structures, partisan balance of appointments, and supermajority requirements. Congressionally created commissions use various appointment structures, including designating members, appointing leaders with party balance, or having leaders recommend candidates for appointment. The decisions made when devising a commission's appointment structure may be significant, particularly concerning Member participation as commissioners. Inclusion of legislators on such panels ensures that Congress will be able to exercise control over the entity concerned, but this may conflict with the goals of reducing Congress's workload and producing independent advice. Legislators can influence the autonomy of a commission even without direct membership. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the importance of congressional leaders selecting nine out of ten members to maintain Congress's influence. The appointment scheme of a commission can impact its ability to fulfill its duties and the diversity of viewpoints in its final work product. The appointment structures of fiscal commission proposals involve \"hybrid\" appointments by both Members of Congress and the President. The majority of appointments would be made by Members of Congress, with variations in the relative weight of congressional appointments. Each proposal includes a portion of the commission's membership drawn from Members of Congress, which is somewhat unusual compared to other congressional advisory commissions. 80 congressional advisory commissions have allowed Members of Congress to serve as commissioners, potentially complicating the use of unelected experts. Non-Member commissioners could raise concerns about delegating legislative power to the President or unelected interests. The proposals for congressional appointments aim for a balanced partisan representation, with some including executive branch appointments. For example, S. 276 calls for equal appointments from majority and minority congressional leaders, along with specific party affiliations for presidential appointments. S. 2853 and S. 1056 also strive for partisan balance in congressional appointments, with additional executive branch appointments included. H.R. 1557, on the other hand, leans towards a majority advantage in congressional appointments. H.R. 1557 and S. 1056 propose congressional commissions with majority advantage in appointments, including two partisan executive branch appointments. Past commissions have been bipartisan to enhance credibility and acceptance of findings and recommendations. Seeking bipartisanship in commission bills may hinder support and compromise the commission's work. Having an equal number of majority and minority commissioners can promote partisanship rather than suppress it, especially in sensitive issues viewed through a partisan lens. The proposed commissions would issue final reports with findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Supermajority support is required for approval of recommendations in each proposal. The use of supermajority voting may impact the work product by producing more general statements. The use of supermajority voting requirements in congressional commissions may lead to more general statements and enhance minority coalition bargaining power. However, bipartisan or non-partisan work products can still be achieved without supermajority procedures, as evidenced by unanimous agreements in past commission reports. The curr_chunk discusses the long-term fiscal situation of the federal government and major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It highlights the importance of projections for these programs in assessing the government's fiscal situation and considers the use of a commission to address these issues. The August 2009 budget report by CBO highlighted future health care costs as a major challenge for the country's long-term budget outlook. Rising health care costs per beneficiary and an aging population are expected to drive up Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security costs faster than per capita GDP. Medicare and Medicaid face \"excess cost growth,\" leading to large projected increases in spending. These programs mainly benefit the elderly, with Medicaid also supporting low-income individuals. Increasing health care costs and the aging population will cause federal spending to rise rapidly under current law. Medicare and Medicaid will account for 80% of spending growth between now and 2035, and 90% between now and 2080. CBO concluded that federal fiscal policies aimed at retirees, the disabled, and the chronically ill are unsustainable in the long term. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is deemed unsustainable in the long term, with slowing the growth rate of outlays for Medicare and Medicaid identified as a central challenge. The complexity of addressing the long-term fiscal situation is further highlighted by the uncertainty of how to structure reforms to reduce federal spending on healthcare without compromising health outcomes. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, as projected by CBO, may necessitate drastic reductions if revenue policies remain unchanged. According to CBO projections, maintaining current spending levels could require significant cuts in all areas except Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending on these programs is expected to reach 15% of GDP, necessitating drastic budget cuts to keep overall spending stable. Social Security presents a smaller fiscal gap compared to Medicare, posing different challenges to the federal government's long-term fiscal position. The long-term fiscal gap between Medicare outlays and revenues is sensitive to changes in assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Spending projections for Medicare and Medicaid are also sensitive to medical inflation. The current state of the U.S. economy complicates the long-term fiscal challenges facing the federal government, with calls for stabilizing the government's annual deficit as a percentage of GDP. This would require lower spending, higher revenues, and faster economic growth. Labor and real estate markets may remain weak, and state and local governments are likely to face severe budgetary challenges in the coming years. State and local governments may need additional economic stimulus or a delay in imposing fiscal policies due to severe budgetary challenges. Postponing spending adjustments could have serious economic consequences as debt requires interest payments that strain budgets and limit flexibility. Concerns about entitlement programs' long-term trends have been addressed through various efforts, including commissions established by Congress or the President. Some commissions, established by Congress or the President, tap expertise and facilitate bargaining on significant trade-offs and high political risks. They focus on entitlements or health care, with efforts to address policy concerns pursued through the legislative process without special commission involvement. Fiscal commission proposals highlight major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Social Security is a federal program that provides monthly cash benefits to 52 million beneficiaries. It was established in the 1930s to improve the economic circumstances of the elderly. The program has been modified by Congress over the years to provide protections against income loss due to retirement, disability, and death. Social Security's trust funds currently generate more revenue than they pay out in benefits. The Social Security trust funds currently generate more revenue than they pay out in benefits. Income primarily comes from a 6.2% payroll tax on employers and employees, with additional income from investments and beneficiary income taxes. Excess funds are invested in U.S. government obligations. By 2037, the trust fund assets are projected to be exhausted, leading to a decline in benefits payments to 76% in 2038 and 74% by 2083. The actuarial deficit for Social Security is projected to be 2% of taxable payroll over 75 years, requiring a potential increase in payroll tax from 12.4% to 14.4% to close the financial gap. Bipartisan commissions, including the Greenspan Commission in 1981, have addressed the system's financial challenges. The Greenspan Commission in 1981 proposed solutions to address Social Security's financial challenges, leading to the Social Security Amendments of 1983. A new Advisory Council on Social Security was appointed in 1994, offering options for system financing and benefit adequacy. The Social Security Administrative Reform Act of 1994 created the Social Security Administration as an independent agency and replaced Advisory Councils with the Social Security Advisory Board. In 2001, President George W. Bush established the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security, which proposed three model reform plans with voluntary personal retirement accounts. The costs of federal health insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, have significantly increased over the past decades. Medicare provides federal health insurance for 45 million elderly or disabled individuals. Medicare provides federal health insurance for 45 million elderly or disabled individuals, covering inpatient services, skilled nursing, and hospice care. It consists of four parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance), Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), Part C (Medicare Advantage), and Part D (prescription drug benefit). The program is financed through payroll taxes and has faced a projected shortfall since its inception. The HI trust fund of Medicare is projected to become insolvent in 2017, two years earlier than previously estimated. The National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, chaired by John Breaux and Bill Thomas, proposed a Medicare reform plan in 1999, which was approved with 10 ayes and 7 nays. The commission voted 10-7 on a motion to report to Congress and the President. Other proposals for Medicare-related commissions have been suggested, including elevating MedPAC into an executive agency. Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides medical services for low-income populations and is a significant part of state and federal healthcare spending. Medicaid and CHIP programs are crucial for low-income populations, with federal spending averaging about 57%. Despite being a health safety net, these programs face challenges due to their growing share of budgets and increased demand during economic downturns. The policy debate will focus on balancing rising health costs for these targeted populations. The debate will focus on balancing rising health costs for Medicaid and CHIP programs against the needs of vulnerable populations. A Medicaid Commission was established in 2005 to advise on modernizing the program for sustainable healthcare. The commission's reports were transmitted in 2005 and 2006, with support for recommendations from most members."
