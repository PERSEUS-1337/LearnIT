    "content": "Under FERPA, educational institutions receiving federal funds must grant parents access to their children's educational records within forty-five days of a request. Parents can challenge the content of records to ensure accuracy and privacy rights. Education records include information directly related to a student, maintained by the institution, but exclude certain types of records. FERPA grants parents access to their children's education records, excluding certain types of records like those solely in possession of the maker, law enforcement unit records, employment records, and medical records for students over eighteen. Once a student turns eighteen or attends postsecondary education, FERPA rights transfer to the student. However, postsecondary students cannot access their parents' financial records or pre-FERPA recommendation letters. FERPA requires educational records to be kept confidential, with exceptions for certain situations where consent is not needed for release. Educational agencies must have written consent from parents before releasing a student's records, and must keep a record of who has accessed the records. Under FERPA, education records can be released without consent to specific school or government officials with a legitimate educational interest, including those involved in audits or evaluations of federally supported education programs. Controversial 2011 regulations also allow disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties under limited circumstances. Education records can be released without consent to specific school or government officials with a legitimate educational interest, including those involved in audits or evaluations of federally supported education programs. Additionally, nonconsensual disclosure is allowed to caseworkers or other state, local, or tribal child welfare agency officials with legal responsibility for the care or protection of the student. Education records may be released to accrediting organizations, parents of dependent students, and organizations conducting studies for educational purposes. These studies must protect personal identification and destroy records when no longer needed. In 2001, the Supreme Court reviewed the release of education records in the case Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo. The Court examined whether peer grading and calling out grades in class violated FERPA by releasing education records. The plaintiff argued that student-graded assignments were education records, while the school district contended that only institutional records were covered. The Court ultimately ruled that peer-graded student assignments were not education records based on statutory explanations. The Court determined that student assignments are not \"maintained\" as education records under FERPA, as grades are not kept in a formal manner. Additionally, student graders are not considered \"person[s] acting for\" the school, as this term refers to school agents, not students. Correcting a classmate's work is seen as part of an assignment. The Court clarified that student assignments, including peer-graded work, are not considered education records under FERPA. Directory information, which can be released without consent, includes student details like name, address, and participation in activities. Public notice is required when compiling directory information. The Department of Education expanded the definition of directory information in 2011 to include student identification numbers on cards or badges, which parents cannot opt out of. Educational records may be released without consent in certain circumstances. In the wake of the Virginia Tech shootings, there have been efforts to clarify FERPA's health or safety exception. Amendments to the Higher Education Act in 2008 require guidance on disclosing information when a student poses a risk of harm. Institutions disclosing in good faith are not liable, and regulations provide clarifications on disclosure requirements in case of a threat to health or safety. FERPA does not prevent postsecondary institutions from sharing certain student information. The Higher Education Act amendments in 2008 require postsecondary institutions to disclose information about student misconduct, including drug and alcohol violations. Institutions can share disciplinary outcomes with victims of crimes or anyone if a violation is found. These amendments override FERPA's optional disclosure rule. The Higher Education Act amendments in 2008 require postsecondary institutions to disclose disciplinary outcomes to victims of crimes. FERPA allows disclosure to parents of students under 21 for alcohol or drug violations. In 2001, FERPA was amended to allow the Attorney General or designated employees to access education records relevant to terrorism investigations. The AG must submit a written application to a court for an order to release the records if specific facts indicate they contain relevant information. The application includes a certification. Education records disclosed under a court order are exempt from FERPA's record-keeping requirement. In 2011, ED issued a final rule amending FERPA regulations to allow increased data sharing for statewide longitudinal data systems. Improved data access aims to evaluate education programs effectively, increase accountability, and promote innovation in education. The changes to FERPA regulations include allowing educational agencies to disclose personally identifiable information for audits, using student identification numbers as directory information, and adding new enforcement mechanisms. These changes have sparked controversy, with privacy advocates expressing concerns about increased risks to student privacy. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has filed a lawsuit against the regulations, alleging that they exceed statutory authority and are contrary to existing law. The lawsuit against changes to FERPA regulations was dismissed, but future legal challenges may arise. FERPA allows for denial of federal funds to educational agencies that restrict parental access to student records. The Secretary of Education can address violations and establish a review board for investigations. The Family Policy Compliance Office handles complaints and notifies parties of violations, outlining necessary steps for compliance. In Gonzaga University v. Doe, the Court considered whether a student could enforce FERPA provisions by suing an institution for damages under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983. The respondent, a former student at Gonzaga, was denied an affidavit of good moral character needed for teacher certification. The Court may withhold payments, issue a cease-and-desist order, or terminate funding eligibility if an agency fails to comply with FERPA. The respondent was denied an affidavit for teacher certification after allegations of sexual misconduct were reported. The Court ruled that FERPA does not create personal rights enforceable under section 1983, stating that federal funding provisions do not allow for private enforcement. The Court disagreed with the argument that statutes intended to \"benefit\" plaintiffs could be enforced under section 1983. The Court ruled that FERPA's nondisclosure provisions focus on rights, not benefits or interests, and cannot be enforced under section 1983."
