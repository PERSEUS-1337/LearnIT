All dollar amounts in the program are adjusted for inflation. The TIGER program, now called the BUILD program, provides grants for transportation projects without adjusting for inflation. It was created during the 2007-2009 recession to improve infrastructure and stimulate the economy. President Obama proposed an economic stimulus bill in 2009, which included $43 billion for transportation infrastructure, including a $1.5 billion discretionary grant program. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program, now known as the BUILD program, was created during the 2007-2009 recession to improve infrastructure and stimulate the economy. President Obama proposed an economic stimulus bill in 2009, which included $43 billion for transportation infrastructure, including a $1.5 billion discretionary grant program labeled \"national infrastructure investment.\" The program aimed to improve the nation's surface transportation infrastructure quickly to provide immediate economic stimulus. The TIGER program, now called the BUILD program, was created during the 2007-2009 recession to improve infrastructure and stimulate the economy. The initial awards were announced on February 17, 2010, with 51 grants totaling $1.69 billion awarded out of 1,497 applications requesting $72.5 billion. In response to criticism of earmarks, in 2011, Republican conferences in both the House and Senate prohibited Members from requesting them. In response to criticism of earmarks, in 2011, Republican conferences in both the House and Senate prohibited Members from requesting them. President Obama vowed to veto any legislation containing earmarks in his State of the Union Address on January 25, 2011. Congress reduced opportunities for earmarking in the 2012 surface transportation reauthorization legislation, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141), by abolishing most of DOT's discretionary grant programs. The TIGER grant program, not included in MAP-21, became one of the few remaining discretionary transportation grant programs. Since the Democratic Party regained the House majority in the 2018 midterm election, the House has supported sizable increases in the TIGER/BUILD program. Congress has continued the program on an annual basis, allowing for adjustments to criteria each year, such as ensuring equitable distribution of grant funds. Funding has been distributed to a larger number of grantees over time. The TIGER/BUILD grant program has evolved over the past decade, initially focused on improving transportation infrastructure and stimulating the economy. Additional merit criteria were added as the economy recovered, with funding being distributed to more grantees through adjustments in grant size. The TIGER/BUILD grant program has evolved over the past decade, with criteria that can conflict with each other. For example, projects could reduce emissions by supporting alternatives or altering roadways. DOT has not disclosed how they reconcile such conflicts. Funding applied for greatly exceeds available funds each year. The TIGER/BUILD grant program has seen a significant decrease in funding in succeeding years, with the total amount applied for dropping significantly. This decline may be due to opposition from the House of Representatives, limitations on appropriations, and competition for funding among different programs. One reason for the drop in funding from FY2016 to FY2017 was a reduction in the maximum grant size decreed by Congress. The TIGER/BUILD grant program has seen a decrease in funding in recent years, with the amount applied for dropping significantly. The decline in funding may be attributed to a lowered cap on grant amounts and the introduction of new transportation grant programs. Congress directed the Department of Transportation to ensure an equitable geographic distribution of grants, with limits on the amount awarded to projects in a single state. 553 grants have been awarded from FY2009-FY2018, with every state and most territories receiving at least one grant. The TIGER/BUILD grant program has awarded grants to every state and most territories over the period FY2009-FY2018. California received the most funding, but not proportionate to its population share. Some states received more funding than their population share, while others received less due to factors like cost and merit. Matching funding to each state's population share is challenging. The TIGER/BUILD Grant program has a congressional directive to ensure a balance between urban and rural project funding. Initially, 7% of funding went to rural areas, but Congress later mandated a minimum share of 20-30% for rural projects. The program's definition of rural and urban areas differs from the Census Bureau's, with 81% of the population living in urban areas and 19% in rural areas from 2011-2015. In 2015, 70% of the U.S. population lived in urban areas, while 30% lived in rural areas. The TIGER/BUILD program defines urban areas as Urbanized Areas and rural areas as everything else. Around 21% of grant funding was awarded to rural projects from FY2009-FY2016. The Trump Administration announced special consideration for rural projects in the 2017 NOFO, despite only 19% of the population living in rural areas. The FY2017 round of awards aimed to address under-investment in rural communities, with 44% of program funding requested for rural areas and 65% awarded to them. Special consideration for rural project applications continued in FY2018, and FY2019 NOFO reiterated this focus on rural areas. The FY2017 round of grant funding saw a significant drop in applications and funding from urban areas, possibly due to new discretionary grant programs and a lowered cap on TIGER/BUILD grants. The Administration's focus on funding projects in rural areas is questioned, despite the majority of the nation's roads being in rural areas. Rural roads receive 37% of federal highway funding despite accounting for only 30% of total vehicle miles traveled. In 2012, 93% of vehicle miles on rural roads had acceptable pavement conditions, compared to 78% on urban roads. While highway deaths are higher on rural roads, the proportion has been decreasing. Traffic fatalities in rural areas decreased by 18% from 2008-2017, while urban fatalities increased by 17%. The share of highway fatalities in rural areas exceeds the share of population due to factors like driver behavior, longer travel times for medical care, and vehicle condition. Congress limited funding to rural areas to 50% in the FY2019 DOT appropriations act. Urban areas are defined as areas with a population over 200,000 in the 2010 Census. In 2015, roughly 60% of the U.S. population lived in urban areas, while 40% lived in rural areas. Changes in the definition of urban areas may impact funding distribution for the BUILD program in FY2019 and beyond. The program prioritizes investment in various transportation modes, with flexibility in funding eligible surface transportation infrastructure projects. Road projects historically received more funding, but other modes collectively received two-thirds of the total program funding. Beginning with the FY2017 round of grants, road projects received over two-thirds of the funding awarded, with the remainder divided among four other modes. Congress directed grants for projects with significant impact, such as Amtrak's Hudson River Tunnel Project costing over $11 billion. The TIGER/BUILD program, which aims to distribute grant funding equitably across the nation for transportation projects, faces limitations in providing significant funding due to the cap on individual project amounts. The largest grant awarded was $118.5 million for a project spanning two states, with few grants exceeding $50 million. Most of the largest grants were awarded in the program's first year when funding was higher. The TIGER/BUILD program has seen a decrease in grant sizes since its inception, with the largest grant awarded being $25 million, despite a maximum permitted grant size of $200 million. The average grant size has fluctuated between $9 million and $17 million in subsequent rounds of funding. The decrease in grant sizes may be attributed to the lower total funding available each year compared to the program's first year. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the DOT sometimes awarded grants to lower-ranked projects over higher-ranked ones without explanation, raising concerns about the selection process. DOT stated that it had to prioritize lower-ranking projects to meet other criteria set by Congress, such as geographic balance. In FY2018, the TIGER grant program was renamed BUILD, with DOT giving priority to grant applicants. The DOT renamed the TIGER grant program to BUILD in FY2018 and prioritized grant applicants providing new, nonfederal revenue for projects. Examples of new revenue sources included sales or gas tax increases, tolling, tax-increment financing, and asset recycling. Borrowing (issuing bonds) was not considered a new revenue source. Critics argued that this policy penalized states and localities that had already increased transportation project funding. In FY2018, the DOT renamed the TIGER grant program to BUILD and prioritized grant applicants providing new, nonfederal revenue for projects, such as sales or gas tax increases, tolling, tax-increment financing, and asset recycling. Critics noted the challenge for rural areas in raising additional revenue, but in FY2018, rural projects received 69% of the program's funding, the highest ever. The details of how much nonfederal revenue was raised in connection to the projects were not provided. In FY2018, the DOT renamed the TIGER grant program to BUILD and prioritized grant applicants providing new, nonfederal revenue for projects. Congress directed DOT not to use nonfederal revenue as a selection criterion for future BUILD grants. DOT published reports on project performance, highlighting the challenge of measuring diverse projects' outcomes. Grantees must develop performance plans and measures, with no requirement for comparability across projects. The reports do not summarize projects and benefits but emphasize the importance of setting up relevant performance measures. The DOT reports focus on individual project case studies and the performance measures chosen by each grantee, rather than summarizing the projects and their benefits."
