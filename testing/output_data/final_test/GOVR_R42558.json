    "content": "This report provides background information on Department of Defense (DOD) energy initiatives, focusing on reducing fuel needs and changing energy sources. Congress faces policy and oversight issues related to DOD's energy initiatives, which could impact capabilities, funding, and U.S. energy industries. The report supplements earlier CRS reports on DOD fuel use and conservation, with a primary focus on liquid fuels. The Department of Defense (DOD) is a significant consumer of energy, primarily using petroleum-based fuels for various operations. In FY2010, DOD accounted for almost 1% of all U.S. energy consumption and about 1.9% of U.S. petroleum use. Despite being the largest government user of energy, DOD's spending on petroleum fuels is relatively small as a percentage of its budget. In FY2011, DOD spent $17.3 billion on petroleum-based fuels, accounting for 2.5% of its total outlays. Despite a 4% decrease in petroleum use, spending rose 381% in real terms. Petroleum fuels make up 71% of DOD's energy use, with electricity at 11% and natural gas at 8%. In FY2011, the Air Force was the largest user of fuel in the Department of Defense, accounting for 53% of total fuel use. The majority of the fuel used by the Air Force was aviation fuel, with 64% used for mobility and logistics air operations. In FY2010, the Department of the Navy met 59% of its energy needs from petroleum, 22% from nuclear-powered ships, and 19% from electricity. Aircraft operations use 54% of Navy's petroleum fuels, ships use 43%, and non-tactical uses use 3%. Marine Corps accounted for 4.7 million barrels of the 30 million barrels of petroleum used by the Navy in FY2010. The Army consumes less fuel than the Air Force or Navy despite having the greatest number of personnel. In FY2011, the Army used about 21 million barrels of petroleum fuel, relying on the Air Force and Military Sealift Command for troop transportation. DOD's energy use is divided into operational energy for military operations and installation energy. The term operational energy includes energy used by tactical power systems, generators, and weapons platforms, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2924. DOD's use of operational energy can vary depending on military operations worldwide. Installation energy, also known as facilities energy, refers to energy used at installations, including non-tactical vehicles. The distinction between operational and installation energy is not always clear, with energy used for drone operations at a domestic base potentially falling under operational energy. The DOD is working on rules for allocating activities to operational or installation energy. Currently, 75% of DOD's energy use is operational, reflecting recent operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. During peacetime, the split between operational and installation energy would likely be different. In FY2010, 80% of installation energy was electricity and natural gas, 15% was fuel oil and coal, and the rest was renewable energy. Energy used to support expeditionary operations is a subset of operational energy, with the military being more reliant on fuel during these operations. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is responsible for acquiring, storing, distributing, and selling energy, including petroleum, natural gas, and coal. DLA-E buys fuel from suppliers worldwide and resells it to DOD, operating as a clearinghouse for fuel needs. Fuel is purchased from sources close to where it will be used to reduce transportation costs. Operations in different regions source fuel accordingly, with varying costs incurred by DLA-E. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) purchases fuel from sources within the Pacific Command at varying costs depending on regional fuel prices and logistic costs. DLA-E establishes a \"global leveled set price\" for each fuel type, charging DOD customers the same price regardless of purchase location. The global leveled set price is calculated by averaging worldwide fuel costs and adding an operating surcharge. The fully burdened cost of fuel includes all personnel and assets needed to move and protect fuel from supplier to point of use. DLA-E charges DOD customers less than the fully burdened cost, covering commodity and overhead costs but not transportation or storage. The cost varies depending on location and circumstances, with costs near DLA-E delivery points in the US close to set price. The fully burdened cost of fuel can vary significantly depending on the location and circumstances. In some cases, the cost can be in the hundreds of dollars per gallon, particularly for fuel delivered by air to remote locations. The hidden costs associated with supplying fuel to battlespace forces have led to the undervaluation of the true cost by the DOD. Studies have estimated the fully burdened cost of fuel in Afghanistan to be between $9 to $31 per gallon and in Iraq to be between $9 to $45 per gallon. The fully burdened cost of fuel in Iraq ranges from $9 to $45 per gallon, depending on force protection and delivery method. A 2008 report estimated the cost for a Stryker brigade at $14.13 to $17.44 per gallon. This cost is used in the acquisitions process for selecting new equipment and understanding logistical footprints, not for budgeting. The provision at 10 U.S.C. 2911 note requires life-cycle cost analysis to include fully burdened fuel costs for new capabilities. The military relies on contractors who use fuel for activities, leading to higher DOD fuel expenditures not reflected in data. Rising fuel costs and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan pose financial, operational, and strategic challenges for DOD. DOD faces challenges and risks related to operational energy use, including financial concerns due to increasing fuel costs. Despite a slight decrease in petroleum use, DOD's spending on fuel has risen significantly over the past seven years. This trend could lead to higher costs and impact future force structure planning. The Department of Defense (DOD) has seen a significant increase in fuel costs, with spending on fuel rising from about 1.6% to 2.5% of total spending since FY2005. This trend could impact DOD's ability to fund other priorities such as personnel pay and equipment acquisition programs. Analysts expect the price of oil to continue rising, leading to further challenges for DOD in managing fuel costs. The Department of Defense (DOD) projects a 13% decline in fuel costs from FY2013 to FY2014, with prices expected to remain lower through FY2017. Short-term fuel cost volatility complicates budgeting and can lead to funding shortfalls. Unexpected increases in fuel prices can result in significant Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding gaps, as seen in the FY2012 budget. The Navy and U.S. Pacific Command are facing significant unfunded fuel costs, with potential shortfalls in O&M funding due to higher-than-expected fuel prices. Even slight increases in fuel costs can have a substantial impact on DOD's budget, with a one-dollar increase in the price of a barrel of petroleum costing the Navy $30 million annually. A 10% increase in fuel prices from FY2011 levels could cost DOD an additional $1.7 billion per year. Responding to O&M funding shortfalls caused by unexpected increases in fuel costs can require submitting supplemental funding requests or reducing funding for other activities. Then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates testified in 2011 that unbudgeted fuel costs could force cuts in Air Force flying hours, Navy steaming days, and training for home-stationed Army troops. DOD's petroleum costs have shown significant volatility in recent years, prompting adjustments in pricing practices. Analysts predict continued volatility in future oil prices. Many analysts predict future oil prices to remain volatile. The reliance on fuel for military operations poses operational challenges and risks, including diverting resources, impacting mobility and combat effectiveness, and vulnerability to supply line disruptions. Maintaining logistics for overseas military operations requires significant resources, with reports indicating high fuel consumption for delivery. This diversion of resources for fuel logistics hinders meeting other military requirements. A 2008 DOD analysis highlighted the challenges of moving and protecting fuel in military operations, which can increase sustainment costs and divert resources from in-theatre force capability. The use of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan has caused problems and undermined U.S. efforts. Fuel requirements can impact deployment speed, battlefield maneuverability, and weapon system effectiveness. A 2001 DOD study suggested that increased fuel efficiency for tanks could improve operational efficiency in combat scenarios. During military operations, fuel dependency can hinder logistics support and constrain tactical options. The need for fuel can impact deployment speed, battlefield maneuverability, and weapon system effectiveness. To address these challenges, the U.S. military aims to become more expeditionary and reduce its logistical footprint by decreasing fuel and energy demands. Fuel supply lines are vulnerable to disruption from enemy attacks or natural events, such as poor weather or earthquakes. During military operations, fuel dependency can hinder logistics support and constrain tactical options. The U.S. military aims to reduce its logistical footprint by decreasing fuel and energy demands. Protecting fuel-supply lines from enemy attacks or natural events is crucial. Attacks on fuel convoys in Afghanistan and Iraq demonstrate the vulnerability of current supply networks. The Marine Corps and Army estimated casualties related to fuel convoys in Afghanistan and Iraq. Around 10-18% of battlefield casualties were linked to convoy operations. A 2009 study reported over 3,000 U.S. troop and contractor deaths or injuries due to fuel supply convoys. DOD faces strategic challenges in ensuring fuel supply for overseas missions and the global free flow of oil. The challenges of maintaining supply lines for overseas missions, particularly in Afghanistan, where fuel and supplies must pass through neighboring countries. Vice Admiral Mark Harnitchek described it as \"the logistics challenge of our generation.\" Routes through Pakistan were crucial, accounting for 70% of fuel and 29% of supplies for U.S. forces in Afghanistan until November 2011. Following the closure of supply routes through Pakistan in 2011, the U.S. forces in Afghanistan had to shift to using the Northern Distribution Network for logistics, leading to increased costs and complexities. DLA-E is now transporting all fuel through these northern routes, with concerns of corruption in fuel contracts in Kyrgyzstan affecting operations at the Manas Transit Center. Using northern routes has increased DOD's costs for transporting fuel and supplies to Afghanistan to $104 million per month, $87 million more than when routes through Pakistan were used. Shipping a 20-foot cargo container to Afghanistan costs $10,000 more on northern routes. The northern route cannot transport lethal cargo, operates at full capacity, and is one-way only. Both northern and Pakistani routes are necessary for the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan. Oil is critical to the U.S. economy, providing 37% of total energy consumed and 94% of transportation energy. The U.S. economy relies heavily on oil, which provides 37% of total energy consumed and 94% of transportation energy. Protecting global oil distribution networks, particularly through chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz, is crucial for national and economic interests. The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain plays a key role in securing Persian Gulf shipping lanes to ensure the free flow of oil. Observers estimate that the Department of Defense spends billions annually protecting global oil transit routes, particularly in the Persian Gulf. DOD's role in safeguarding oil supply can lead to combat operations, like those against Iranian forces during Operation Earnest Will in the 1980s. The Department of Defense considers a closure of the Strait of Hormuz a \"redline\" and will not tolerate any disruption. DOD is implementing energy initiatives to reduce fuel needs and risks associated with reliance on fuel. Reducing logistic footprints and energy demands are key goals for DOD to enhance mission effectiveness and save lives. The Department of Defense is requesting over $1.4 billion for operational energy initiatives in FY2013 to reduce its reliance on fuel. The FYDP includes about $8.6 billion for energy initiatives over five years. Challenges include slow changes in aircraft and ship inventory and the need for reliable data to evaluate effectiveness. The Department of Defense is allocating funds for operational energy initiatives to reduce fuel reliance. The Office of Operational Energy Plans and Programs (OEPP) is responsible for developing DOD policy and coordinating energy efforts across the services. Air Force officials are also involved in energy initiatives. The Air Force's energy initiatives aim to reduce costs and volatility in fuel prices. Goals include reducing aviation fuel consumption by 10% by 2015 and acquiring 50% of domestic aviation fuel from alternative blends by 2016. The FY2013 budget requests $655 million for operational energy initiatives and programs a total of $2.6 billion across the FYDP. The Department of the Navy has six major objectives for FY2013, including leading in energy initiatives. The Navy's major objective for FY2013 is to Lead the Nation in Sustainable Energy. They are pioneering efforts to reduce energy consumption through investments in alternative fuels, leading to success in aircraft and ships. Energy-saving efforts on bases include new solar and geothermal technologies. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus emphasized the importance of reducing dependence on foreign oil through biofuel efforts. The Navy's biofuel efforts aim to increase energy security and reduce vulnerability to price shocks. Operational energy goals include using alternative sources for 50% of energy consumption by 2020 and reducing fuel consumption by 15%. The FY2013 budget requests $338 million for energy initiatives. The Navy's operational energy initiatives include a $1.9 billion budget across the FYDP, with $338 million requested for FY2013. This includes funding for maritime, aviation, expeditionary energy, and alternative fuels procurement. A controversial initiative is the Navy's plan to invest $170 million in a domestic advanced biofuels industry, with support from the Departments of Agriculture and Energy. The goal is to construct or retrofit biofuel plants and refineries for testing and certification purposes. The Navy has allocated over $200 million for alternative fuel purchases and biofuel production facilities. The Marine Corps focuses on increasing combat effectiveness by addressing energy challenges and risks in the field. The Marine Corps aims to increase efficiency by 50% by 2025 and deploy a self-sufficient expeditionary force from the sea by 2025. They request $64.5 million for operational energy efforts in FY2013 and plan to spend $352 million on energy initiatives over the FYDP. The focus is on reducing fuel usage and improving energy characteristics of equipment. The goal is to extend operational capability without fuel resupply. The Army's operational energy initiatives aim to reduce energy demand, increase fuel efficiency, and utilize alternative and renewable energy sources. The FY2013 budget includes $560 million for these efforts, with a total of $4.1 billion allocated across the FYDP. Research and development are conducted at the Ground Systems Power and Energy Laboratory, while new technologies are tested at the Base Camp Integration Laboratory for contingency operations. The focus is on enhancing remote operational capabilities. The Army's energy initiatives aim to enhance remote operational capabilities. Congress has set specific energy-reduction targets for DOD installation energy but not for operational energy. Legislation has been passed to increase renewable power in federal government energy use. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates federal buildings to reduce energy use by 30% by FY2015, increase renewable energy consumption to 7.5% annually, and reduce petroleum use in non-tactical vehicles by 20% by FY2015. Additionally, DOD installations are required to produce or procure at least 25% of their electric energy consumption. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act directed DOD to set an interim goal for 2018 regarding the quantity of electric energy consumed from renewable sources. Section 902 of the FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act established the DOD position of Director of Operational Energy Plans and Programs, which was later redesignated as an Assistant Secretary of Defense. This position is responsible for overseeing operational energy plans and programs within DOD. The Director of Operational Energy Plans and Programs oversees energy plans and programs within the Department of Defense and the military branches. They establish the operational energy strategy, coordinate planning activities, and monitor all energy initiatives. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative or synthetic fuels. The Department of Defense must ensure that any contract for alternative or synthetic fuel must have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fuel. This is in line with the policy to improve fuel efficiency of weapons platforms to enhance performance, reduce logistics systems, lower operating costs, and mitigate high fuel consumption burdens. The Department of Defense is required to consider the fully burdened cost of fuel in life-cycle cost analysis for new capabilities. Congress mandates reports on operational energy, including an annual Energy Performance Master Plan. The FY2011 Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act requires a comprehensive master plan for achieving energy performance goals in the Department of Defense. The FY2009 Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act mandates an annual report on operational energy management and strategy implementation. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs must review and certify budgets for operational energy activities. The Department of Defense is required to provide annual reports on energy performance goals, installations energy management, and mitigation of power outage risks. Congressional oversight is needed for DOD's energy initiatives. The Department of Defense's energy initiatives pose potential policy and oversight issues for Congress. Oversight questions include how well the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs is coordinating the energy initiatives of the military services and if any changes have resulted from this coordination. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs is tasked with coordinating the energy initiatives of the military services. Questions arise regarding the services' operational energy strategies, coordination of initiatives, and potential duplication or overlap. Additionally, concerns are raised about the Department of the Navy's efforts to spur a domestic biofuels industry compared to the Air Force's approach of not purchasing biofuels until they are cost competitive with petroleum-based fuels. The potential oversight issues for Congress include the status of DOD's efforts to gather data and develop metrics for evaluating energy initiatives. DOD faces challenges in gathering reliable data on energy use, which hinders the ability to measure the effectiveness of current initiatives. DOD faces challenges in gathering reliable data on energy use, impacting the ability to evaluate current initiatives and coordinate operational energy initiatives. The questions revolve around DOD's actions to address these challenges, the timeline for comprehensive data, confidence in current decisions, metrics for evaluating energy initiatives, and potential revisions to these metrics. DOD is revising metrics for evaluating energy initiatives, considering financial, operational, and strategic challenges. Factors like climate effects and environmental degradation are also being used as metrics. Fuel costs are projected to decline, but some analysts believe the projections may be overly optimistic. Some analysts believe DOD's projected fuel cost declines may be overly optimistic, which can complicate budget planning and evaluation of energy initiatives. DOD adds a markup to OMB-provided crude oil costs for refined petroleum products, with past markups ranging from 45% to 60%. Future fuel cost estimates include a 50% markup for FY2013 and 30% for FY2014-FY2017. DOD is requesting substantial funding for energy initiatives and partnering with other federal agencies. In 2010, DOD and DOE signed an MOU to enhance national energy security and transition to a low carbon economy. The Navy partnered with the Department of Agriculture and DOE to invest in developing a domestic advanced biofuels industry, with each agency contributing $170 million. Congress may question if DOD's energy initiatives are coordinated with other federal agencies, potential overlap, and the criteria used to determine which agency should pursue an initiative. Under the July 2010 MOU between DOD and DOE, DOD anticipates demonstrating federal government leadership in transitioning America to a low carbon economy. The priority areas for technologies include innovative energy and conservation technologies. The division of costs between the Navy, USDA, and DOE in the August 2011 MOU for developing a domestic advanced biofuels agency is being questioned by Congress. Specifically, Congress is concerned about the Navy's role in jumpstarting a domestic advanced biofuels industry. The Navy's role in jumpstarting a domestic advanced biofuels industry is a topic of debate during Congress's review of DOD's proposed FY2013 budget. Supporters argue that developing this industry will improve energy security, reduce exposure to financial shocks, and the Navy's planned $200 million investment is a small fraction of its annual petroleum fuel costs. The Navy's planned $170 million investment in developing a domestic advanced biofuels industry will leverage equal investments being made by USDA and DOE. Early purchases by the Navy of advanced biofuels will help create production economies of scale, causing the cost to come down over time and become price competitive with petroleum-based fuels. Skeptics argue that the initiative may not be cost-effective given the high fuel usage of a Navy carrier strike group during overseas deployments. Developing a domestic advanced biofuels industry may not significantly diversify the Navy's fuel sources during overseas deployments. Alternatives like nuclear propulsion or kite-assisted propulsion could reduce dependence on petroleum-based fuels. Advanced biofuels may not protect against fuel price volatility as providers could adjust prices to match petroleum-based fuels. The Navy's decision to invest in jumpstarting a domestic advanced biofuels industry and paying a premium for early biofuel purchases is questioned, as the Air Force has chosen not to take these actions. It is uncertain if the Navy's initiative, along with support from USDA and DOE, will successfully establish cost-competitive advanced biofuels. The Navy's initiative to establish a domestic advanced biofuels industry is questioned due to budget constraints. The $200 million spent could be better allocated to other Navy priorities. Congress may question why the Navy is leading the DOD effort instead of the Air Force. The Navy's initiative to establish a domestic advanced biofuels industry is being questioned due to budget constraints. Congress may inquire about the Air Force's use of multiyear fuel-purchasing contracts to mitigate petroleum-based fuel costs and the potential for legislation to increase their use. Additionally, there are concerns about the timeline for advanced biofuel prices to become competitive with petroleum-based fuels and the cost-effectiveness of developing a domestic biofuels industry. The Navy's initiative to establish a domestic advanced biofuels industry is being questioned due to budget constraints and concerns about cost-effectiveness. Congress may also need to consider potential implications for DOD energy initiatives due to shifts in U.S. military strategy, such as increased emphasis on operations in the Asia-Pacific region. Potential oversight questions for Congress include alignment of DOD energy initiatives with operational patterns under strategic guidance. Section 253 of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act requires a briefing on power and energy research at University Affiliated Research Centers. The curr_chunk discusses collaboration efforts with university-based research centers on energy research and development activities, specifically focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energy in areas such as lighting, heating, ventilation, air-conditioning systems, and renewable energy integration. It also includes exemptions for the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements and limitations on the availability of funds for procurement of alternative fuel. The Act prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds for alternative fuels if they cost more than traditional fossil fuels, with an exception for fleet certification. Energy conservation projects are authorized, and there are notification requirements for contracts related to energy production facilities. The Act prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds for alternative fuels if they cost more than traditional fossil fuels, with an exception for fleet certification. Section 2821 requires notification to Congress for contracts exceeding 20 years for energy production facilities on military department real property. Section 2822 continues limitations on funds for leadership in energy and environmental projects. Section 2822 of the Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 prohibits the use of funds for LEED gold or platinum certifications and expands to include implementing ASHRAE building standard 189.1 for fiscal year 2013. This section aims to continue limitations on funds for energy and environmental projects. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 limits funds for LEED gold or platinum certifications and ASHRAE building standard 189.1 implementation for fiscal year 2013. The Department of Defense's significant investment in aggressive certifications without demonstrating ROI is a concern. The committee awaits the Department's report by June 30, 2012. Section 2823 allows the Department of Defense to use energy cost savings for energy security. Section 3104 authorizes funds for FY2013 energy security programs for national security. The committee commends the Department of Defense for energy reduction efforts but is concerned about lack of visibility into energy investments and fuel expenditures.
