    "content": "The Islamic State, also known as ISIL/ISIS or Daesh, has roots in Iraq's political changes post-Saddam Hussein's overthrow and Syria's Sunni Arab rebellion against the Asad regime. Abu Musab al Zarqawi played a key role in the organization's growth. The Islamic State, also known as ISIL/ISIS or Daesh, originated from the forces led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi in Iraq from 2002 to 2006. Zarqawi took advantage of Sunni resentment towards U.S. forces and Iraq's Shiites and Kurds to push a sectarian agenda. After Zarqawi's death, the group rebranded as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and later declared the reestablishment of the caliphate in June 2014. In June 2014, Islamic State leaders declared the reestablishment of the caliphate, naming Abu Bakr al Baghdadi as caliph. They highlighted Baghdadi's descent from the Quraysh tribe and religious training as qualifications for his position. The group's implementation of historical caliphate requirements is cited as religious legitimacy. Muslim critics question its legitimacy and actions. Prior to 2015, most IS terrorist attacks were in Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State's strategy evolved in 2015 to include global terrorist attacks, drawing adversaries into larger conflicts. Attacks outside Iraq and Syria have increased, with civilian deaths nearing 1,000 since January 2015. Some armed groups have recognized the Islamic State caliphate. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43612 and CRS Insight IN10209. Some armed groups outside of Iraq and Syria have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State caliphate led by Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. IS affiliates in Yemen, Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Afghanistan, and Nigeria are considered significant and capable. These groups refer to themselves as \"wilayah\" (state/province) within the broader IS caliphate. The implications of such loyalty pledges on their objectives, tactics, and leadership structures vary. The Obama Administration considers IS affiliates participating in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners as legitimate military targets under the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force against Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda affiliates in various countries have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State caliphate. IS funding sources include oil sales, taxation, extortion, and selling looted antiquities. Oil sales used to be the main revenue but decreased due to US airstrikes. For more details, refer to related CRS reports. The Islamic State's financial strength relies on its income, expenses, and ability to devote resources to military operations. Holding and governing territory is a financial burden for the group, making it vulnerable to exploitation by diminishing its revenue generation. Targeting IS finances is a key strategy to degrade and defeat the terrorist organization. General John Allen, the former U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, emphasized the importance of cutting off the Islamic State's financial resources to defeat the group. Current U.S. policy focuses on disrupting IS revenue streams, imposing sanctions on leaders, and collaborating with international partners on financial intelligence. President Obama announced the formation of a global coalition in 2014 to degrade and defeat the terrorist organization. In September 2014, President Obama formed a global coalition of 60 nations to combat IS. The coalition organized efforts in five areas, led by different countries, including military operations, stopping foreign fighters, cutting off financing, humanitarian relief, and exposing IS's true nature. Participation in the coalition is flexible. Since August 2015, coalition participants, including France and the United States, have adjusted their military forces to counter the Islamic State. France initially avoided operations in Syria but changed course after the November attacks, launching aggressive air strikes on Raqqa within 48 hours. President Hollande pledged to intensify efforts to destroy IS. France has increased its airstrikes on the IS stronghold of Raqqa, Syria, with the number of fighter jets rising from 12 to 38. President Hollande aims to strengthen the international military coalition against IS, including closer cooperation with the US, Russia, and regional countries. Russia's military involvement in Syria escalated after the downing of a Russian airliner in October 2015, attributed to IS. Russia's military operations in Syria to support the Asad regime appear independent of the global counter-IS coalition's activities. The U.S. government leads a coalition aiming to degrade and destroy the Islamic State organization through various lines of effort, including direct military action and support for Iraqi and Syrian forces. The U.S. government leads a coalition to degrade and destroy the Islamic State organization through various efforts, including military action, support for ground forces, intelligence sharing, and disrupting finances. Progress has been made, but achieving all objectives may take time with potential delays or setbacks. High-profile attacks by the Islamic State are influencing policy debates. The U.S. government, under President Obama's direction, leads a coalition to degrade and destroy the Islamic State organization through various efforts, including military action, support for ground forces, intelligence sharing, and disrupting finances. Progress has been made, but achieving all objectives may take time with potential delays or setbacks. The President, under Article II of the Constitution, has authority to use military force against the Islamic State. Two enacted authorizations for use of military force provide authorization for certain U.S. military strikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The President has authority to use military force against the Islamic State. Enacted authorizations provide for U.S. military strikes against the Islamic State and the Khorasan Group of Al Qaeda in Syria. The President seeks a new AUMF specifically targeting the Islamic State to update existing legislation. Congress is urged to enact a new AUMF targeting the Islamic State. Members of Congress have introduced proposals for a new AUMF, stating that current authorizations are outdated and insufficient. Some Members of Congress believe that current authorizations for the use of military force are outdated and insufficient for addressing the Islamic State crisis. They argue for a new authorization to prevent long-term conflicts similar to those in Afghanistan and Iraq. This new authorization would expand the President's authority to combat evolving terrorist threats beyond just the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Some Members of Congress are pushing for a new authorization for the use of military force, beyond just the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Proposals include identifying targets, limiting U.S. armed forces use, restricting geographic areas of operations, setting time limits, and requiring regular reporting. The Islamic State leaders have threatened to attack the United States since 2012, describing the US and its allies as \"crusaders\" and urging attacks by any means possible. They welcome direct military confrontation, viewing it as a sign of apocalyptic battles. The Islamic State leaders have threatened the United States since 2012, welcoming direct military confrontation as a sign of apocalyptic battles. In November 2014, Al Baghdadi expressed willingness for Western ground forces to engage, foreseeing their destruction. IS leaders provoke adversaries to meet them on the ground, anticipating conflict leading to enemy destruction. Post-Paris attacks statements suggest transnational attacks as a tactic to draw the US into larger-scale conflict. The Islamic State has identified Washington, DC, and New York City as potential targets for future attacks. U.S. officials debate the group's capability to conduct attacks in the United States, citing inspiration from jihadist-Salafist propaganda in previous shooting incidents. The Islamic State has praised lone wolf attacks in Europe and elsewhere, urging supporters to carry out similar acts. U.S. officials express increasing concern about the Islamic State threat, citing potential for attacks in the United States. National Counterterrorism Center Director warns of ISIL's evolving capabilities and trajectory towards external operations. Recent attacks in Paris, Beirut, Sinai, and Ankara highlight the group's dangerous potential. CIA Director John Brennan warns that the Islamic State has developed an external operations agenda, posing a long-term threat. He believes the group's embrace of transnational terrorism is to show momentum despite setbacks in Iraq and Syria. Brennan acknowledges the inevitability of terrorist groups attempting attacks but emphasizes that their success is not guaranteed. Efforts to prevent future attacks and assess risks to U.S. security are ongoing. Efforts to prevent future attacks and assess risks to U.S. security will involve analyzing recent attacks and their planners. The FBI estimates that around 200 Americans have tried to join the conflict in Syria, while the State Department reports over 22,000 foreign fighters have joined the Islamic State. The current challenges posed by the Islamic State require U.S. law enforcement attention. The challenges posed by the Islamic State require U.S. law enforcement to identify and preempt individuals who pose a terrorist threat. Counterterrorism investigations post-9/11 suggest that the Islamic State and its followers present broad challenges for domestic law enforcement, including American foreign fighters who plan to leave or have returned from fighting with the Islamic State. The Islamic State poses challenges for U.S. law enforcement, including American foreign fighters who may plan and execute attacks in the United States. These individuals can be categorized as the Inspired, the Others, and the Lost, with some remaining unknown to law enforcement after fighting abroad. Investigations suggest that some American IS supporters may die abroad. Law enforcement faces challenges in keeping up with terrorists' evolving tactics and technologies, such as enhanced data encryption. Enhanced data encryption, a response to privacy concerns post-Snowden, raises debate on its impact on law enforcement investigations. Officials fear encryption may hinder investigations, allowing criminals and terrorists to conceal illicit activities. Critics argue law enforcement has necessary tools for investigations. The Deep Web, including the Dark Web, contains hidden content not indexed by search engines like Google. The Dark Web can be used for legitimate or illegal activities, raising concerns for law enforcement. The Dark Web provides anonymity for both criminals and law enforcement, allowing officials to conduct online surveillance, sting operations, and maintain anonymous tip lines. It can shield officials from identification and hacking, and be used for covert operations like website takedowns or intercepting communications. Efforts are ongoing to deanonymize Dark Web activity and identify malicious actors. Iraq's sectarian divisions have resurfaced, posing a challenge to stability and U.S. policy in the region. The rise of the Islamic State in Iraq posed a major challenge to stability in the region. Iraq's Sunni Arabs resented the Shiite-dominated government, leading to the capture of a significant portion of Iraqi territory by the extremist group. The Kurds also faced disputes with Baghdad but united in the fight against the Islamic State. The conflict in Syria, now in its fifth year, has been reshaped by the rise of IS and Russia's military intervention on behalf of the Syrian government. The Islamic State controls large areas of northeastern and central Syria, launching assaults on various forces. Russian military intervention in support of Asad challenges U.S. goals in Syria. Coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 were attributed to the Islamic State. The Paris attacks in 2015, claimed by the Islamic State, were the worst-ever terrorist incident in France. The attacks highlighted concerns about European citizens joining extremist groups in foreign conflicts, such as in Syria and Iraq, and raised fears of terrorists entering Europe, possibly among migrants and refugees. News reports suggested that one attacker may have entered Europe through Greece with a Syrian passport, while two suspects had traveled to Syria. The Islamic State's direct involvement was indicated by evidence. Recent terrorist incidents in Europe include the 2014 killing at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, the 2015 attacks in Paris targeting Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, and the 2015 shootings in Copenhagen. Perpetrators were often homegrown extremists with ties to Islamist groups like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. A Palestinian descent citizen committed multiple murders and wounded police officers in attacks at a cafe hosting a free speech debate and a synagogue. The suspect in an attempted 2015 train attack from Amsterdam to Paris was a Moroccan man possibly linked to Syria. The increasing concern for U.S. and European leaders is the rising number of citizens traveling to fight with rebel and terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. The rise of terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq is a growing concern for U.S. and European leaders, with several deadly attacks in Europe linked to individuals who have spent time with these groups. U.S. intelligence indicates that over 20,000 foreign fighters, including 3,400 Westerners, have traveled to the region since 2011. U.S. authorities estimate that some Americans have died in the conflict in Syria, with thousands of fighters killed in military operations against the Islamic State group. The potential foreign fighter threat highlights the importance of close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. Concerns have been raised about European fighters in Syria and Iraq due to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program allowing short-term visa-free travel for citizens of most European countries. Europe is facing a significant migration and refugee crisis, with many fleeing conflict and poverty in neighboring regions. The influx includes Syrians, as well as migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan, Africa, and Western Balkans countries. This mixed migration poses security challenges, but the Visa Waiver Program requires travelers to provide biographic information, which may help limit travel by known violent extremists. The surge of migrants and refugees in Europe has challenged governments and the EU, with questions arising about the distinction between different groups of people in mixed migration flows. The key policy consideration is whether the movement is voluntary or forced, with the UNHCR stating that 85% of those arriving in Europe by sea in 2015 are from refugee-producing regions. The UNHCR reports that 85% of those arriving in Europe by sea in 2015 are from refugee-producing countries. European governments debate whether some are economic migrants. Attention shifts to the US and its plans to admit Syrian and other refugees in FY2016. The Obama Administration initially proposed a refugee ceiling of 75,000 for FY2016 but increased it to 85,000. The United States plans to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in FY2016. The FY2015 worldwide refugee ceiling is 70,000, with 31,000 allocated for the Near East/South Asia region. From October 1, 2010, to August 31, 2015, 1,494 Syrian refugees have been admitted, with almost 1,300 since October 1, 2014. Refugees flee their country due to persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The United States sets an annual refugee ceiling, with regional allocations for admissions. For FY2015, the worldwide refugee ceiling is 70,000, with regional allocations as follows: Africa (17,000), East Asia (13,000), Europe and Central Asia (1,000), Latin America/Caribbean (4,000), and Near East/South Asia (33,000). Overseas processing of refugees follows three priorities for admission. Priority 1 involves cases with compelling security concerns, Priority 2 includes cases of special humanitarian concern (e.g., Iranian religious minorities), and Priority 3 is for family reunification cases. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris have raised concerns about terrorist travel, especially after reports of one attacker carrying a Syrian passport. For more information on U.S. immigration inspections and border security issues, refer to CRS Report R44041 and CRS Report RL31269. Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, concerns have been raised about terrorist travel, particularly after reports of one attacker carrying a Syrian passport. The federal government utilizes various tools to prevent individuals from traveling to commit acts of terrorism, including Terrorist Databases, Screening, No-Fly List, Criminal Sanctions, Passport Restrictions, and Immigration restrictions. The application of these tools may vary depending on factors such as the nationality of the suspected terrorist. For more information, refer to CRS Legal Sidebar WSLG1438 and CRS Report R42336. The government maintains terrorist watchlists like the \"No Fly\" list to protect national security. Individuals on this list are denied boarding on commercial flights. Legal challenges have arisen due to mistaken identities or erroneous determinations. Legal challenges have been brought to court regarding placement on the No Fly list, as it may impede constitutionally protected interests such as the right to travel internationally. Due process requires the government to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before a neutral party, with procedural protections varying based on relevant factors. Courts use a balancing test to determine procedural protections in cases involving placement on the No Fly list, weighing private interests against the government's interest. Factors considered include severity of deprivation, risk of erroneous deprivation, and government's interest in national security. Legal challenges have been raised regarding No Fly list placement, impacting the right to travel internationally. Several governors have expressed intentions to restrict the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states following reports of a fake or stolen Syrian passport found on an individual involved in the Paris attacks. States have discretion in participating in federally funded refugee resettlement programs, but the specifics of their actions are not always clear from their statements. States have discretion in participating in federally funded refugee resettlement programs, but they cannot prohibit a Syrian refugee from entering or staying within their jurisdiction.
