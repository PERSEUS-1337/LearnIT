    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". The findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that cord blood, obtained from the placenta and umbilical cord, can be used for clinical applications such as bone marrow reconstitution for various medical conditions. This cord blood, normally discarded after childbirth, contains stem cells that can be collected without risk to the donor, preserved for years, and used for transplantation or research purposes. Cord blood stem cells can be frozen for preservation and used for transplantation or research. Advantages over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to donors, quicker availability of donor cells, and lower transplant complications. Matching unrelated donors improves success rates, especially for ethnic minorities. Cord blood stem cell banks increase genetic diversity in donor supply, allowing for fully matched transplants. Partially matched transplants lead to high complications in conventional bone marrow transplants. Unrelated bone marrow donors from the National registry can be identified for transplantation. Unrelated bone marrow donors from the National registry can take months to over a year to identify. Having an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, could provide matches for 90% of those needing transplants within days. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, especially for genetic conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia prevalent in certain ethnic groups. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia have a high risk of severe bacterial infections and painful crises from infancy. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, especially African-American newborns, are at high risk of severe bacterial infections and painful crises from infancy. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has shown promising results in curing the disease, with better outcomes when performed earlier in the course of severe disease. Unrelated cord blood transplants are particularly beneficial for ethnic minority patients. Unrelated cord blood transplants are especially beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients. With an ethnically balanced national cord blood bank of at least 150,000 units, 90 percent of African American patients with conditions requiring bone marrow replacement could find appropriately matched cord blood stem cells for successful treatment. The National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants since 1987, and cord blood transplantation complements conventional bone marrow transplantation by providing matched units to patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplantation by providing matched units to patients, especially those of non-caucasoid ethnicity. Radiation exposure may cause bone marrow failure, requiring treatment with cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units. Research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases. Recent scientific developments suggest that research on cord blood stem cells may lead to improved therapies and potential cures for chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers, which contribute significantly to healthcare costs in the United States. SEC. 3. NATIONAL CORD BLOOD STEM CELL BANK NETWORK. Part H of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section, SEC. 376A, establishing the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, as defined in this section, includes terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, donor bank, human cord blood stem cells, and National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is a network of qualified cord blood stem cell banks established to contain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of the donor banks in the network is to acquire, tissue-type, test, cryopreserve, and store donated units of human cord blood for transplant centers. The cord blood stem cell bank must obtain consent from donors, comply with regulations, provide units for transplantation, and allocate a portion for research. Eligible donor banks must have necessary licenses, implement screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients from infections. The cord blood stem cell bank must ensure confidentiality, encourage diverse donors, and establish communication systems with other banks and transplant centers for cord blood unit distribution nationally. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network facilitates communication for cord blood unit distribution and tracks recipients' outcomes. It also educates the public on the benefits of donating cord blood stem cells. The Board of Directors, led by a chairperson, administers the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. It includes representatives from transplant centers, birthing hospitals, research community, transplant recipients, and patient family members. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network's Board of Directors includes representatives from the research community, recipients of cord blood stem cell transplants, family members of patients, individuals with expertise in social sciences, members of the general public, the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation of the Health Resources and Services Administration, and network donor banks. Members may serve up to two consecutive 3-year terms. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network can serve up to 2 consecutive 3-year terms, with approximately 1/3 of the members' terms expiring each year to ensure continuity. Additionally, a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will be established as part of the Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will operate a system for identifying, acquiring, and distributing donated cord blood units matched to patients. It will provide a website for searching donor matches and maintaining a database on cord blood unit collection, storage, distribution, and transplantation outcomes. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Registry will maintain a database on transplantation outcomes, operated according to standards of consent and confidentiality. The Board of Directors will ensure donor banks meet requirements continuously. The Board of Directors will ensure that donor banks in the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network meet requirements continuously and that the network and collection sites are geographically distributed throughout the United States. $15,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2004, $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and additional funds for fiscal years 2006 through 2008 or until the 150,000 unit inventory is acquired."
