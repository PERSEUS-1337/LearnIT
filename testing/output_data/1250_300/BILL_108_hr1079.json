The \"Neutral Cost Recovery Act for Small Business\" includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It increases the dollar limitation for aggregate costs under section 179(b) to $75,000 and raises the phaseout threshold to $325,000. Additionally, it defines \"section 179 property\" to include tangible property as specified in section 168. The term 'section 179 property' includes tangible property, computer software, and section 1245 property acquired for use in a trade or business. It excludes certain types of property and air conditioning or heating units. Subsection (b) of section 179 is amended to include inflation adjustments for taxable years. Inflation adjustments are made to the dollar limitation and phaseout threshold for taxable years beginning after 2003. The dollar amounts in paragraphs (1) and (2) are increased based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. If the increased amount is not a multiple of $1,000, it is rounded to the nearest multiple. The amendment to section 179(c) of the Code allows taxpayers to revoke an election under paragraph (1) with respect to any property, making it irrevocable once done. These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002. SEC. 3. NEUTRAL COST RECOVERY DEPRECIATION ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN PROPERTY PLACED IN SERVICE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2003.

The applicable neutral cost recovery ratio for property placed in service is calculated by multiplying a number by 1.035 to the nth power, where 'n' is the number of full years from the quarter the property was placed in service. The ratio should never be less than 1.
