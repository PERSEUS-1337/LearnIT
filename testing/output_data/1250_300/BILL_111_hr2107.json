    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, particularly among children and young adults. Approximately 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but lack a suitable match. Cord blood cells have been successfully used in treating these conditions, with over 14,000 transplants performed globally in the last 20 years. Cord blood cells have been effectively used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for transplantation, especially for children, with lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have been used to treat various nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain different types of stem cells and are pluripotent, able to differentiate into various cell types. Cord blood cells are rich in various types of stem cells that can differentiate into different cell types in the body. They have shown potential in reducing inflammation, promoting tissue repair, and treating conditions like type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart defects. Despite their benefits, over 90% of cord blood cells from births in the US are discarded as medical waste, with limited awareness about banking options for parents. Less than one quarter of states require expectant parents to receive information about banking their baby's cord blood. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended clear information and balanced perspectives on cord blood banking options, along with obtaining informed consent before labor and delivery. SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop and publish information on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. This publication will cover the value and uses of cord blood, differences between autologous and allogeneic use, public vs private cord blood banking, and options for mothers regarding stem cells in cord blood after delivery. The options for umbilical cord blood banking include donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, or discarding the stem cells. Medical processes for cord blood collection and family history criteria impacting the decision are also important considerations. The curr_chunk discusses the medical processes for cord blood collection, family history criteria affecting cord blood banking decisions, ownership options for donated cord blood, average costs of public and private cord blood banking, availability of public and private cord blood banks, and the need for publicly donated cord blood samples among specific racial and ethnic groups. The curr_chunk discusses the need for publicly donated cord blood samples among specific racial and ethnic groups based on medical data developed by the Health Resources and Services Administration. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document regarding cord blood disposition to be signed by expectant women before delivery. The document will include information on cord blood banking options, medical value of cord blood stem cells, and a declaration of the chosen disposition option. Certain professionals are required to disclose information and obtain informed consent from pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after enactment, healthcare professionals must provide pregnant women with information on umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent must be obtained before delivery regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells. Effective 1 year after enactment, healthcare professionals must provide pregnant women with information on umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Written consent must be obtained before delivery regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells. Additionally, Medicaid regulations are amended to ensure that healthcare providers offering ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women comply with specified requirements and enforcement methods. The legislation requires healthcare providers to inform pregnant women about cord blood banking options before the third trimester. Non-compliance by states may result in reduced Medicaid payments. Additionally, employer group health plans under ERISA are also affected by the new requirements. The legislation mandates informing pregnant women about cord blood banking options during prenatal care. Employer group health plans under ERISA are also impacted by the new requirements. The legislation requires physicians and healthcare professionals to comply with informing pregnant women about cord blood banking options during prenatal care. This applies to agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will develop professional educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for health care providers. Grants may be provided for targeted education on cord blood stem cells to various groups, including health care providers, minorities, families with genetic diseases, and populations affected by conditions treated with cord blood stem cells. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2014."
