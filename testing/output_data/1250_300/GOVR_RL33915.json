    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, as required by law. The budget documents provide detailed information on budget estimates, historical data, policy proposals, and economic forecasts from FY2007 through FY2012. Additionally, they address long-term fiscal issues and historical budget data. The congressional budget process, including the annual budget resolution and appropriations bills, begins with these documents. The documents discuss long-term fiscal issues and historical data on appropriations, outlays, and revenues. The congressional budget process starts with the Administration's budget submission to Congress. Congress adopted the FY2008 budget resolution in May 2007 and began considering appropriation bills shortly after. By August, the House had passed all twelve regular appropriations bills, while the Senate passed some but not all by the end of FY2007. In August, the House passed all twelve regular appropriations bills, while the Senate passed some bills but failed to pass the remaining eight by the end of FY2007. The Senate passed the defense appropriations and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills in October. The House passed a continuing resolution to fund the government until November 16, which the Senate also passed. The President signed the continuing resolution on September 29. Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill and Defense bill in November, with the President vetoing the former and signing the latter. The defense bill included extended funding for government operations until December 14. The defense bill included extended funding for government operations until December 14. Congress passed multiple funding continuations and appropriations bills in December, with the President signing them into law. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions. CBO's first budget report for FY2008 estimated a baseline deficit of $98 billion, with a projected surplus in FY2012 and FY2017. Assumptions set by law influence CBO baseline projections. The CBO baseline projections show a surplus in FY2012 and FY2017, with assumptions that discretionary spending remains constant, tax cuts expire after 2010, and the AMT patch lapses. These assumptions lead to declining deficits and surpluses over the 10-year forecast window, but future deficits are expected to grow rapidly beyond that without major policy changes. The CBO projects declining deficits and surpluses over the 10-year forecast window, with future deficits expected to grow rapidly due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The report includes estimated budgetary effects of various policies, such as making tax cuts permanent and freezing discretionary appropriations. In March 2007, CBO forecasted slightly higher revenues and smaller outlays, resulting in a FY2008 deficit of $226 billion. In March 2007, CBO analyzed the President's budget proposals, forecasting higher revenues and smaller outlays. The projected FY2008 deficit was $226 billion, lower than the President's estimate of $239 billion. By FY2012, CBO predicted a $31 billion deficit, contrasting with the Administration's expected $61 billion surplus. The difference in forecasts was mainly due to medium-term projection uncertainties. President Bush's FY2008 budget aimed to extend and make permanent tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by nearly $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. Bush's FY2008 budget proposed extending and making permanent tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The budget also included proposals to reduce mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years, with a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for personal Social Security accounts. The Administration's budget provided limited information for years beyond FY2012. The Administration's budget proposed significant changes, including personal Social Security accounts, with projected savings of $59 billion over five years and $359 billion over 10 years. The budget also aimed to eliminate, reduce, or reform 141 programs, cutting $22 billion in budget authority in FY2008. The Mid-Session Review in July showed a deterioration in the FY2008 budget outlook, with a deficit estimate of $19 billion. The Administration's Mid-Session Review (MSR) in July revealed a $19 billion increase in the FY2008 deficit estimate compared to the February budget. The rise in the five-year deficit estimate to $651 billion was mainly due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending driven by rising healthcare prices and hospital patient volumes. CBO analyzes FY2008 appropriations, estimating new budget authority and outlays for non-emergency and emergency spending. The CBO analysis of FY2008 appropriations showed $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority was slightly higher than defense discretionary budget authority. The McConnell Amendment added $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate Budget Committee reported the Senate budget resolution specifying expenditures and revenues for FY2008. The Senate Budget Committee reported the Senate budget resolution with $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The resolution projected a $249 billion deficit for FY2008, with higher discretionary spending levels than the President's proposal. The resolution aimed to extend expiring tax cuts if offset by lost revenues, resulting in a reduced FY2012 surplus of $1 billion. The Senate budget resolution reduced the expected FY2012 surplus to $1 billion. The House Budget resolution projected a FY2008 deficit of $213 billion and a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion. All proposals aim for a balanced budget in FY2012, with assumptions that may be questioned by independent analysts. Funding for military operations after FY2008 is assumed to be minimal, and more middle-income taxpayers are expected to be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. After FY2008, more middle-income taxpayers are expected to be subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), despite annual fixes in recent years. The President's budget assumes limited growth in discretionary spending over five years, while the House and Senate budget resolutions anticipate the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts unless offset by other revenue gains or spending reductions. Budget projections are uncertain, with measures of statistical unbiasedness and accuracy used to evaluate economic forecasts. Budget forecasts are constructed to estimate the costs of policy changes consistently. Actual outcomes may differ due to policy changes, technical factors, and economic conditions. OMB and CBO assess the accuracy of their forecasts. Projections depend on economic models, assumptions about tax and program changes, and other factors. Economic conditions like growth, inflation, and policy changes impact budget estimates. Budget models may evolve with the economy and demographic trends, like the retirement of baby boomers, also influence estimates. Budget estimates are influenced by various factors such as stable trends like population demographics and unpredictable factors like future productivity growth. Changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on budget estimates, with even small changes in GDP growth leading to large changes in deficits. For example, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth rate could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years. New government policies, such as military operations or tax cuts, also affect budget estimates. The President's FY2008 budget includes an analysis of why previous budget estimates differed from actual results. OMB found that the standard deviation for deficit forecasts increased over time, with a gap of over $1.1 trillion between upper and lower bounds at the end of a five-year period. This suggests that budget projections can vary significantly due to policy and economic changes. The OMB found that the standard deviation for deficit forecasts increased over time, with a gap of over $1.1 trillion between upper and lower bounds at the end of a five-year period. This suggests that budget projections can vary significantly due to policy and economic changes. The House Budget Committee reported its version of the FY2008 budget resolution, which was passed after rejecting three amendments. Both the House and Senate appointed conferees to resolve differences, leading to an agreement on discretionary spending of $954 billion for FY2008. This set the stage for the Appropriations Committees to draft the FY2008 appropriations bills. In FY2008, Congress approved most of the 12 regular appropriations bills, with the House passing all 12 and the Senate passing seven. The President vetoed the Labor-HHS-Education bill but signed the Defense bill. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government operations until November 16. In FY2008, Congress passed most appropriations bills, with the President vetoing some due to disagreements. A continuing resolution was signed to fund government operations until November 16. Congress passed multiple bills to extend funding, including an omnibus appropriations bill and continuing resolutions, to fund government operations through the end of the calendar year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed future federal outlays, with projections for defense and homeland security spending, non-defense discretionary spending, and growth in mandatory programs like Medicare. The Administration's budget proposals for FY2007 and FY2008 include increased funding for defense and homeland security, a 1% annual increase for non-defense discretionary spending, and slight growth in mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would rise, with a $30 billion increase in FY2012 for Social Security personal accounts. The proposals would raise outlays by $118 billion above the FY2007 estimate and increase total outlays by 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012. The proposed outlays exceed the FY2008 baseline by $150 billion, mainly for security activities including defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs, with additional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes increased funding for security activities, with a focus on defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs. There is also a proposed increase in non-security discretionary spending and a reduction in mandatory spending compared to baseline levels. The budget shows a rise in net interest payments due to increased federal borrowing, leading to an overall increase in outlays from FY2007 to FY2008. The Administration's projections aim to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP, with a target of 18.3% by FY2012. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes increased funding for security activities, with a focus on defense, homeland security, and foreign affairs. Outlays are projected to decrease from 20.2% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.0% in FY2008, with a target of 18.3% by FY2012. Defense spending is set to increase by 6.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, but is projected to drop to $546 billion by FY2012. Non-defense discretionary spending exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion for FY2008. In FY2012, defense spending is projected to drop to $546 billion. Non-defense discretionary spending falls from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012, decreasing as a percentage of GDP from 3.7% to 2.8%. The Administration's budget aims to reduce mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008. Mandatory spending in the President's budget grows by 4.2% ($62 billion) from FY2007 to FY2008, with proposals to reduce mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008. The reductions target activities like Medicare and Medicaid, aiming to decrease total mandatory spending by almost $60 billion over five years. Despite efforts to slow its growth, mandatory spending remains the largest category of federal spending, increasing from $1,465 billion in FY2007 to $1,923 billion in FY2012. Net interest outlays are also projected to rise by $22.1 billion from FY2007 to FY2008, reflecting the rapid growth of federal debt. The Administration's proposals will lead to a continued growth in debt, resulting in higher net interest payments. Proposed net interest outlays for FY2008 exceed the baseline estimate by $7.8 billion, and for FY2012, it is almost $30 billion above the estimate. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to remain between 1.6% and 1.8%. CBO projections show federal outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0% in FY2012. Analysts believe that the current-law baseline underestimates future growth in discretionary spending. If discretionary spending were to grow, federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period. According to CBO projections, federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period if discretionary spending grew at the same rate as the economy. Defense spending is expected to rise from $547 billion in FY2007 to $599 billion in FY2008, with projections showing it reaching $684 billion in FY2012 and $773 billion in FY2017. Defense spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to gradually decrease over the 10-year period, from 4.0% in FY2007 to 3.6% in FY2017. Defense spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall gradually over the 10-year period, from 4.0% in FY2007 to 3.6% in FY2017. Alternative scenarios show lower spending trajectories if troops are withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan. Withdrawing troops by 2010 or 2013 could save about $1.25 trillion or $750 billion in projected discretionary spending and interest costs over the period FY2008-FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017, with a decrease in percentage of GDP from 3.6% in FY2007 to 2.9% in FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017. Mandatory spending is expected to rise from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion by FY2017. Net interest is forecasted to grow from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008. CBO projections show mandatory spending reaching 12.1% of GDP in FY2017, with net interest growing from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008. Surpluses in FY2012 and beyond would reduce federal debt, lowering net interest payments. Projected net interest payments peak at $292 billion in FY2012, easing back to $278 billion in FY2017. Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012, including defense funding matching the President's request. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012, including defense funding matching the President's request. The House passed the resolution with no changes on March 29, providing $2,933 billion in outlays in FY2008, rising to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The May 17, 2007, conference agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Figure 1 shows spending by category as percentages of GDP from the Administration's July 2007 Mid-Session Review. The President's budget proposals from FY2007 to FY2012 show a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The Administration assumes that non-defense discretionary spending will fall after 2007 and no additional spending will be provided for military operations overseas after FY2008. Limited reductions in mandatory spending keep it stable as a share of GDP, but the introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would increase mandatory spending relative to GDP. The President's budget proposals from FY2007 to FY2012 show a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. The introduction of private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would lift mandatory spending relative to GDP above current levels. The President's proposed outlays fall sharply after FY2007, with spending just below its level as a percentage of GDP in FY2000 by FY2012. The President's budget proposals from FY2007 to FY2012 show a decline in defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP, while mandatory spending is projected to increase. By FY2012, spending would be just below its level as a percentage of GDP in FY2000. Outlays in the Mid-Session Review (MSR) are slightly above those in the February budget, mainly due to reestimation rather than policy changes. The alternative estimate assumes discretionary appropriations grow with the economy and troop deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan decreases, leading to higher outlays, deficits, federal debt, and net interest payments. The alternative estimate projects higher net interest payments and outlays as a percentage of GDP increasing to 21.1% in FY2017. Federal receipts have shown rapid growth in recent years, but future forecasts are uncertain due to economic conditions. Receipts rose significantly from FY2003 to FY2006, following three years of decline. OMB's MSR indicates little variation in receipts. Federal receipts increased from 14.5% to 18.4% of GDP from FY2004 to FY2006 after three years of decline. OMB's MSR showed stable receipts as a share of GDP from FY2008 to FY2012. CBO's baseline projected receipts to reach 19.8% of GDP in FY2012. The Administration's proposals aimed to make most tax cuts permanent, leading to a slight decrease in receipts as a percentage of GDP from FY2007 to FY2008, followed by stability until FY2011. Receipts then rose to 18.6% of GDP in FY2012. Making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent was estimated to reduce cumulative receipts by $374 billion. Federal receipts increased from 14.5% to 18.4% of GDP from FY2004 to FY2006. The Administration aimed to make most tax cuts permanent, leading to a slight decrease in receipts as a percentage of GDP from FY2007 to FY2008, followed by stability until FY2011. Receipts then rose to 18.6% of GDP in FY2012, with estimates showing a reduction in cumulative receipts by $374 billion due to making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. The Administration's budget documents show actual receipts as a percentage of GDP for FY2000 through FY2006. Corporate income taxes stabilize near 2% of GDP, while individual income taxes remain about 1% below their FY2000 level. The budget includes extending relief from the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for FY2007 and FY2008, with estimated costs for temporary fixes and indexing AMT thresholds for inflation. The President's budget aims to limit the growing reach of the AMT. The cost of temporary AMT \"fixes\" is estimated to be $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. Indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion a year on average over the next 10 years. The President's budget aims to limit the expanding reach of the AMT but does not include estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix. This omission increases the Administration's post-FY2008 estimates of federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year. Total receipts in the President's budget are expected to remain near their 40-year average of 18.3% of GDP. CBO's baseline revenue estimates show a rise to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017. Extending the expiring provisions of the major tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 would reduce revenues by an estimated $418 billion over the first five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Extending expiring tax cuts would reduce revenues by $418 billion over 5 years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Limiting AMT coverage alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over 5 years and $570 billion over 10 years. CBO's estimates differed from the President's budget due to economic assumptions. The CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than the cumulative revenue baseline estimates over five years. The alternative policy estimates show slower growth in receipts compared to the baseline, with interactions between AMT reform and tax cut extensions leading to greater revenue losses. The CBO estimates show slower revenue growth compared to the baseline due to interactions between AMT reform and tax cut extensions. The alternative revenue projections fall short of baseline revenues by $389 billion in FY2012 and $560 billion in FY2017. House and Senate budget resolutions require offsets for extending expiring tax provisions to prevent deficit growth. The conference agreement includes provisions to extend expiring tax cuts with offsets to prevent deficit growth. Historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP are shown, with estimates remaining fairly close through FY2010. CBO's revenue reestimate extends to FY2017, showing receipts rising to slightly above 19% of GDP. Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years. The President's revenue estimates are similar through FY2012, with receipts rising to slightly above 19% of GDP in FY2017. OMB's MSR projects slightly larger receipts than the February budget over five years. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing federal debt. The federal government runs deficits when spending exceeds receipts, increasing debt held by the public. Surpluses occur when receipts exceed outlays, reducing federal debt. Running surpluses during strong economic growth is seen as beneficial by many economists. The last surplus was in FY2001 at $128 billion or 1.3% of GDP. Projections show deficits decreasing over time, with a potential surplus in FY2012. The Administration's current service baseline estimates show surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than projected. The budget is expected to reach a small surplus in FY2012, requiring strict limits on spending growth and entitlement spending. Some proposals may increase spending or reduce receipts, necessitating larger spending reductions in other areas. The President's proposals aim to increase spending or reduce receipts, leading to larger spending reductions in other areas of the budget. The federal deficit is projected to decrease through FY2011, with surpluses expected from FY2012 to FY2017. CBO's baseline projections assume no fix to the AMT and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010, boosting revenues. Discretionary spending is expected to grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending will increase with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. Alternative assumptions show a less optimistic fiscal outlook. The CBO baseline projections assume discretionary spending will grow at the rate of inflation, while mandatory spending will increase with eligible populations and cost-of-living adjustments. Alternative scenarios show a less optimistic fiscal outlook, with deficits projected to grow from FY2007 through FY2017 under different policy assumptions. The deficit would increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017 under alternative policies. The 2007 CBO analysis of the President's policies projected deficits and surpluses in FY2008 and FY2012. The House and Senate budget resolutions also included deficit and surplus projections. The conference agreement on the budget resolution showed a deficit in FY2008 and a surplus in FY2012. Figure 5 illustrates deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017. The data from FY2007 through FY2017 includes deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP, with projections from CBO and OMB. The President's policy proposals involve additional defense spending, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, and changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Projections show a rapid decline in the deficit, with a potential surplus in FY2012. The CBO and OMB deficit projections show an improving federal fiscal situation, with projected deficits falling in proportion to the economy. However, alternative CBO projections based on different policy assumptions depict a steady deterioration in the federal government's fiscal conditions, with deficits reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. This outlook is less optimistic than the baseline projections of OMB and CBO. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable due to the nation's aging population and rising healthcare costs. This leads to constantly rising deficits and a federal debt burden that could spiral out of control. Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP would require drastic reductions in all spending except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending for these programs is projected to reach roughly 15% of GDP, necessitating significant cuts in the rest of the budget to maintain overall spending close to 20% of GDP. The aging population and rising healthcare costs will lead to a growing demand for resources to finance federal spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. To maintain overall spending close to 20% of GDP, drastic reductions in other budget areas would be necessary. Attaining fiscal stability in the future may require significant cuts in spending growth and possibly higher taxes. The current structure of major entitlement programs will place an unsustainable burden on the budget by 2050. The President's FY2008 budget raises concerns about the long-term outlook for the budget due to unsustainable growth in major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. By 2050, spending on these programs is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, posing significant fiscal challenges. Estimates show a smaller fiscal gap for Social Security compared to Medicare and Medicaid, with projections sensitive to assumptions about productivity growth and interest rates. Some analysts offer a more optimistic outlook for Social Security based on favorable assumptions. The long-term budget outlook for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is sensitive to changes in assumptions about productivity growth, interest rates, and medical inflation. Unexpected events like natural disasters or economic downturns can impact the short-term budget outlook. The retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs will put pressure on the federal budget, potentially overwhelming it without policy changes. The growth of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs could strain the budget and limit the government's flexibility to meet new needs, potentially overwhelming the economy's resources."
