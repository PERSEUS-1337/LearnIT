    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS employees hired before 1984 do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS employees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), with only FERS employees receiving employer matching contributions. CSRS and FERS are not governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which protects spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector retirement plans. ERISA protects spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector plans by requiring certain provisions such as joint and survivor annuities, compliance with QDROs, and spousal consent for beneficiary designations. Federal employees' retirement benefits under CSRS and FERS are governed by Title 5 of the United States Code, which has similarities to ERISA but also some differences. Title 5 of the United States Code governs federal employees' retirement benefits under CSRS and FERS, similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. Both require joint and survivor annuities and written consent for waiving the survivor annuity. However, ERISA allows pension payments to former spouses when the participant reaches retirement age, while Title 5 prohibits payments until the employee separates from federal service and applies for an annuity. Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible to receive an annuity, and has applied for it. ERISA requires spousal consent for naming beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, while federal regulations allow Thrift Savings Plan participants to name anyone as beneficiary without spousal consent. State court decrees can award former spouses a share of retirement annuity or survivor annuity, or both. State court decrees can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of the employee's retirement annuity or survivor annuity, or both. The court order must specify both benefits for the former spouse to receive them. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will only pay benefits specified in the court order. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by the court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse after the employee has separated from federal service and is eligible for an annuity. OPM will divide the retired employee's retirement annuity as directed by a court order, with the former spouse receiving a share only after the employee has separated from federal service and applied for an annuity. The former spouse's right to a survivor annuity ends upon the retired employee's death, unless specified in a court order or if the employee elected it. A CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity, funded by a reduction in the worker's annual pension. The survivor annuity for a retired worker's spouse or former spouse is equal to 55% of the worker's full annuity before any reduction. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity through a court order, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. A survivor annuity for a former spouse terminates upon their death or remarriage before age 55, with an exception for marriages lasting at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. The survivor annuity for a former spouse terminates upon death or remarriage before age 55, with exceptions for marriages lasting at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. An employee's election or court order for a survivor annuity can only be modified before retirement or death. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse waived their rights. Refunding contributions forfeits CSRS annuity rights, and state courts can block refunds if a former spouse is awarded a share of the annuity. FERS retirement annuities are generally exempt from state court proceedings. Section 8470 of Title 5 exempts FERS from state court proceedings, but Section 8467 allows a FERS retirement annuity to be divided between a federal annuitant and a former spouse as directed by a court order. OPM will divide the annuity and pay the former spouse's share only after receiving the court order. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it or a court order must specify it. A federal employee's retirement annuity terminates upon death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it or a court order must specify it. A FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse can be elected, with the amount being 50% of the single-life annuity. The joint and survivor annuity is funded by reducing the retiree's single-life annuity by 10%. The total FERS survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity. An employee may provide for the equivalent of no more than one FERS spouse survivor annuity, with the total amount not exceeding 50% of the single-life annuity. If a survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse, the current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. A survivor annuity terminates upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse, with exceptions for remarriages lasting at least 30 years. Any election or court order for a FERS survivor annuity can only be modified before the employee retires or dies. If an employee participating in FERS dies after completing at least 18 months of service but fewer than 10 years, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump-sum payment. This benefit may be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a state court order. If the employee dies after 10 years of service, the surviving spouse or former spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the employee's earned annuity at the time of death. A separating employee forfeits the right to receive a FERS annuity if they elect to receive a refund of contributions to the retirement system. A state court can block this refund if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the employee's FERS retirement annuity. An employee can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Board. Married participants are not required to designate their spouse as the beneficiary of the TSP account. Consent is needed from a spouse before receiving a loan from the TSP account. A married FERS participant must obtain spouse's consent for TSP account transactions. CSRS participants do not need spousal consent but spouse will be notified. Spouse entitled to joint and survivor annuity from TSP. TSP recognizes state court orders for divorce settlements, alimony, and child support. Former spouse of worker eligible for benefits. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) can recognize state court orders for divorce settlements, alimony, and child support. Former spouses of FERS participants can receive Social Security benefits if married for at least 10 years. Remarriage may affect benefit eligibility unless the subsequent marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. Divorced spouses of Social Security insured workers can receive survivor benefits if married for at least 10 years."
