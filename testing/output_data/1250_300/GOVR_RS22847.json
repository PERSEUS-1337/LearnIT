    "content": "NATO held a summit in Bucharest, Romania in April 2008 to address challenges in stabilizing Afghanistan and discuss potential new member admissions. Disputes over Macedonia's name and Georgia and Ukraine's admission to the Membership Action Plan were not resolved. The summit focused on clarifying NATO's mission and future objectives, with plans to draft a new Strategic Concept next year. NATO faces debates on its role in defense, stabilization efforts, and peacekeeping. NATO's efforts to stabilize Afghanistan are testing allied capabilities and political will, with some allies hesitant to engage the Taliban directly. This has led to criticism from countries like the United States, Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark, who have troops in combat zones. Currently, there are approximately 42,000 troops in Afghanistan under a U.N. mandate, along with 25 Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The upcoming debate on NATO's Strategic Concept will likely address issues related to security, peacekeeping, and the strategic implications of enlargement. The allies, including the United States, Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark, have around 42,000 troops in Afghanistan and 25 Provincial Reconstruction Teams. They aim to rebuild the country by improving governance, combating the narcotics trade, and stabilizing the region.

France plans to send 700 more combat troops to eastern Afghanistan.

NATO recognizes the increasing threat of ballistic missile proliferation and the potential contribution of US missile defense assets. NATO is studying various ballistic missile defense systems for protection. NATO discussed various ballistic missile defense systems for protection, but did not finalize a decision on which system to use or how it would be funded. Critics raised concerns about the effectiveness of the U.S. system and the need for further testing.

NATO discussed various ballistic missile defense systems for protection but did not finalize a decision. The summit addressed the candidacies of Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia for NATO entry, as well as the requests from Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO's Membership Action Plan. None of the candidate states have large military forces to contribute significantly to allied operations, but they are developing specialized capabilities. The three candidates could contribute to regional stability in southeastern Europe. Croatia has made improvements in governance and military modernization under its Membership Action Plan. Croatia has recognized Kosovo and almost 60% of the population supports NATO membership. Almost 60% of the Croatian population supports NATO membership, which has been steadily increasing. Croatia has recognized Kosovo and could play a role in discussions to bring Serbia back into the western-oriented European states. Albania, a small and impoverished country, is in the process of professionalizing and downsizing its military. Despite passing anti-corruption legislation, doubts remain about its implementation. Albania has pursued a moderate policy regarding Kosovo's independence and has renounced any efforts to merge with Kosovo. Albania has recognized Kosovo's independence and renounced merging with Kosovo. NATO is preparing protocols for Albania and Croatia to join the alliance, with completion expected by the end of July. Greece blocked Macedonia's accession negotiations due to a dispute over Macedonia's name. Athens blocked Macedonia's accession negotiations over a name dispute. Macedonia argues for the right to name their country and has renounced territorial claims on Greece. NATO allies have the authority to invite Macedonia for talks if the issue is resolved. The Macedonian government fell after the summit, delaying progress. A debate at Bucharest centered on admitting Georgia and Ukraine to the MAP, with Germany's concerns about Moscow's reaction being a key factor. Berlin was concerned about negative reactions in Moscow to putting neighboring countries on the road to NATO membership. Interviews with allied governments revealed broader opposition, with some countries wishing for a slower process for Georgia and Ukraine's entry into the Membership Action Plan (MAP). Despite some governments not wanting to antagonize Russia, larger issues were also considered. Majority of Ukraine's population opposes NATO membership, and some allies believe that Kiev must first convince its population of the benefits before starting the MAP process. Georgia is also expected to hold parliamentary elections and meet international standards before moving forward. Some allies oppose NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia, citing the need for persuasion of their populations and meeting international standards. Concerns were also raised about energy security and criticism was directed at the Administration's handling of the Membership Action Plan issue. The allies' opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia goes beyond concerns over Russia's reaction. They agreed that the countries will become NATO members, signaling confidence in their ability to reform. NATO conducted a successful bombing campaign in Kosovo in 1999 to stop ethnic cleansing. Russia opposed a plan for Kosovo's supervised independence. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence with support from the United States and the majority of EU countries, despite opposition from Serbia and Russia. The United Nations established a protectorate mission in Kosovo, and NATO's KFOR maintains peace in the region with U.S. troops. The alliance aims to persuade Serbia to join the Euro-Atlantic community and emphasizes the importance of a stronger European defense. NATO allies acknowledge the value of a stronger European defense. France is set to rejoin NATO's Integrated Military Structure in 2008. Debate over a new Strategic Concept for NATO is postponed until early 2010 due to the upcoming change in the U.S. Administration."
