    "content": "Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller model mimics a larger pretrained model. To improve the generalization and robustness of compact models, introducing noise at input or supervision levels can be beneficial. Variability through noise can enhance neural network training, with methods like \"Fickle Teacher\" using dropout for response variation showing significant generalization improvement. The study explores the impact of adding Gaussian noise to the output of a teacher model on the image, improving the adversarial robustness of the student model. It also discusses the surprising effect of random label corruption on model robustness. The importance of considering memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security in designing Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment is emphasized, especially in resource-constrained devices like self-driving cars. Additionally, the need for models to perform well on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, while being robust to malicious attacks, is highlighted. In the study, knowledge distillation is focused on as a method to train a smaller network under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network. Despite the performance improvement, there is still a gap between the student and teacher models, raising questions on the optimal method for transferring knowledge. The study focuses on knowledge distillation to train a smaller network under a larger pre-trained network. Despite performance gains, there remains a significant gap between student and teacher models. The challenge lies in finding the optimal method to transfer knowledge effectively. The proposed methods draw inspiration from neuroscience, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and neuroplasticity in learning. The study emphasizes collaboration and neuroplasticity in learning. Cognitive bias and trial-to-trial response variation theories are central. Introducing constructive noise in collaborative learning can deter cognitive bias and improve learning outcomes. In this work, the beneficial effects of introducing noise in knowledge distillation are highlighted. The study explores how noise can improve model generalization and robustness, with a focus on adding various noise types in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework. A novel approach called \"Fickle Teacher\" uses Dropout in the teacher model to transfer uncertainty to the student, leading to significant generalization improvement. Additionally, Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation is shown to enhance learning outcomes. The \"Fickle Teacher\" method introduces Dropout in the teacher model to transfer uncertainty to the student, improving generalization. Another approach, \"Soft Randomization,\" uses Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation to enhance adversarial robustness while limiting the drop in generalization. Random label corruption is also shown to improve adversarial robustness with minimal reduction in generalization. Noise has been used as a regularization technique to improve generalization in deep neural networks for years. Various noise techniques, including Dropout and gradient noise injection, have been proven to enhance generalization in overparameterized deep neural networks. Randomization techniques that introduce noise during training and inference are effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing can increase l2-norm robustness guarantees. Label smoothing improves network performance, but it may hinder knowledge distillation. Incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation could be a promising direction. For empirical analysis, CIFAR-10 dataset was used due to its prevalence in knowledge distillation and robustness research. The addition of noise in the knowledge distillation framework, following the Hinton method, was explored to improve model generalization and robustness. Experiments were conducted on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) using \u03b1 = 0.9 and \u03c4 = 4 for training the student model. In experiments on Wide Residual Networks (WRN), \u03b1 = 0.9 and \u03c4 = 4 were used. Image normalization between 0 and 1 was applied, and standard training schemes were followed. ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used for out-of-distribution generalization evaluation. Adversarial robustness was tested using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. The models were also tested for robustness against common corruptions and perturbations. Different types of noise were injected in the student-teacher learning framework to analyze their impact on generalization and robustness. In the student-teacher learning framework, different types of noise were injected to analyze their impact on generalization and robustness. Signal-dependent noise was added to the output logits of the teacher model, improving generalization to CIFAR-10 test set and slightly increasing adversarial and natural robustness of the models. This method differs from previous approaches by training the teacher model without noise and only adding noise during the distillation process. Our method improves the distillation process by adding noise to the student model's softened logits. We use dropout in the teacher model to introduce variability in the supervision signal, leading to different output predictions for the same input. This approach differs from previous methods that use noise or knowledge distillation for uncertainty encoding. Our proposed method enhances distillation by incorporating noise from dropout in the teacher model to improve the student model's generalization and robustness. Dropout is used to introduce uncertainty in the supervision signal, leading to better performance on unseen and out-of-distribution data. Training the student model with dropout significantly improves generalization compared to traditional methods.

Adding trial-to-trial variability through dropout helps distill knowledge to the student model, enhancing robustness. Our method incorporates Gaussian noise in the input image during knowledge distillation, balancing robustness and generalization. Our proposed method involves adding Gaussian noise to the input image during knowledge distillation to train the student model with the teacher model's assistance. This approach enhances adversarial robustness while mitigating the loss in generalization. Training with six levels of Gaussian noise showed improved robustness and decreased generalization compared to traditional methods. Our method outperforms compact models trained with Gaussian noise alone, achieving better generalization and robustness. Our proposed method enhances adversarial robustness by adding Gaussian noise during knowledge distillation, outperforming models trained with noise alone. It improves robustness to common corruptions and allows for lower noise intensity while maintaining low generalization loss. Our method enhances adversarial robustness by introducing label noise during training, reducing the need for high noise intensity while maintaining low generalization loss. This regularization technique aims to prevent overconfidence and memorization in deep neural networks. Random label noise is explored as a constructive source of noise to improve model generalization. The effect of label corruption on different models and corruption levels is extensively studied, showing increased generalization even at high corruption levels during knowledge distillation.

Injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability in knowledge distillation is a promising approach for training compact models with good performance. Our study explores injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability in the knowledge distillation framework, showing promising results for training compact models with good generalization and robustness. The method involves using a raised temperature final softmax function and smooth logits from the teacher model as soft targets for the student model. Neural networks tend to generalize well when test data matches training data distribution, but real-world models often face domain shift challenges affecting generalization performance. Models in the real world often face domain shift challenges, impacting generalization performance. Test set performance alone is not sufficient for evaluating model generalization. To measure out-of-distribution performance, ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset are used. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their deployment. Robustness to these attacks has gained significant attention. Adversarial attacks on deep learning models have raised concerns about their deployment in the real world. Researchers are focusing on evaluating and improving the robustness of models against these attacks using techniques like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. This attack involves initializing an adversarial image with random noise within an epsilon bound and adjusting the image in the direction of loss while staying within the valid data range. The projection operator clips the step size within the epsilon bound and valid image range. Adversarial robustness is crucial for security, but models also need to be robust to natural perturbations. Recent studies have shown vulnerabilities of Deep Neural Networks to real-world perturbations, leading to significant accuracy degradation. In a study by Gu et al. (2019), they found that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to natural transformations in video frames. They used robustness to synthetic color distortions as a proxy for natural robustness. In another study, the authors emphasized the trade-off between generalization and adversarial robustness, cautioning against overemphasizing robustness to norm-bounded perturbations. Recent research has shown that adversarially trained models can significantly degrade in performance when faced with semantics-preserving transformations in input data distribution. Recent research has shown that adversarially trained models can significantly degrade in performance when faced with semantics-preserving transformations in input data distribution. Adversarially trained models improve robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but at the expense of low frequency perturbations. There is an inherent trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization in the literature. To exploit the uncertainty of the teacher model for a sample, random swapping noise methods are proposed. The proposed random swapping noise methods aim to improve in-distribution generalization but have a negative impact on out-of-distribution generalization. Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs to capture the uncertainty of the teacher model effectively. Different dropout rates require varying numbers of training epochs and learning rate adjustments. Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs for different dropout rates. Dropout rates of 0.1 and 0.2 train for 250 epochs with learning rate adjustments at 75, 150, and 200 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.3 trains for 300 epochs with adjustments at 90, 180, and 240 epochs. Dropout rates of 0.4 and 0.5 train for 350 epochs with adjustments at 105, 210, and 280 epochs. Noise on teacher supervision improves student accuracy on unseen data but not generalization to out-of-distribution data."
