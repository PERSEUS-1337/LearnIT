    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Our Nation's Trade, Infrastructure, Mobility, and Efficiency Act of 2007\" or the \"ON TIME Act of 2007\". The growth in international trade, particularly containerized trade, is increasing pressure on the nation's transportation network and causing traffic congestion near major US-international gateways. From 2000 to 2005, the value of international trade and the number of containerized trade shipments both rose significantly. Existing and potential future trade agreements are expected to further boost international trade and worsen freight congestion. The US is a member of the World Trade Organization, has 11 free trade agreements, and is negotiating with multiple countries and organizations for additional agreements. The United States has agreed to 11 free trade agreements and is negotiating with 4 countries and organizations for more. Traffic congestion in US cities is worsening, costing billions of dollars annually. Over 200 freight bottlenecks are causing economic losses and delays. Significant investments are needed to maintain and improve the transportation system. To improve the transportation system and address major investment needs, the government must invest $235 billion in 2006, $304 billion in 2015, and $472 billion in 2030. The Act aims to reduce freight congestion, enhance reliability, and improve the quality of life for citizens. The Act aims to establish and collect a national trade gateway corridor fee. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national trade gateway corridor fee on imported articles, amounting to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee will be collected for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will assess and collect a fee for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors for imported articles. The fee will be deposited in a designated account and will not apply after fiscal year 2017. Additionally, a national trade gateway corridor fee will be established on exported articles, equal to .075 percent of the article's value. The fee on exported articles from the United States in commerce is equal to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. The fee will be collected for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors and deposited in a designated account. The fee on exported articles from the United States in commerce is equal to .075 percent of the article's value or $500, whichever is less. Amounts received will be deposited in the \"National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund\" account. The fee will not apply after fiscal year 2017. The account will be used for eligible transportation projects in trade corridors until October 1, 2018. SEC. 4. APPORTIONMENT OF FUNDS. The Secretary of Transportation sets aside 2 percent of funds from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund for administrative expenses. After this set-aside, the remaining funds are apportioned to State departments of transportation for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on fees collected at Customs ports of entry. The Secretary apportions funds for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors based on fees collected at Customs ports of entry. If a corridor spans multiple states, the funds are divided among the states based on the total lane miles of Federal-aid highways in each state. The apportionment of funds for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors is based on the total lane miles of Federal-aid highways in each state. The funds remain available for obligation for 6 years after the fiscal year for which they are authorized. The funds apportioned for eligible projects in transportation trade corridors are available for obligation for 6 years. Any unobligated amounts after this period will be allocated to other states for similar projects at the Secretary's discretion. SEC. 5. PROJECT SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary of Transportation must issue project selection guidelines for State departments of transportation to follow in selecting eligible projects for grants under this Act. Guidelines include consulting with various stakeholders, adhering to planning processes, developing a transparent selection process, and rating proposed projects. The State department of transportation must develop and implement a transparent selection process for rating proposed projects eligible for grants under this Act. SEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation may grant funds to a State department for projects in transportation trade corridors. Projects must meet construction standards for highways on the Federal-aid system. The Federal share of project costs is 80%, and non-Federal funds cannot come from other Federal sources. Wage rates must comply with Section 113 of title 23, United States Code. The grant for eligible projects under this Act cannot use Federal funds from other laws. Prevailing wage rates apply to projects under this section as they would under chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code. SEC. 7. TRANSPORTATION TRADE CORRIDORS. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry, with specific criteria for their boundaries and locations. These corridors may include areas in multiple contiguous states, extend up to 300 miles from the port of entry, and only include areas used for international trade-related movements. Additionally, a single corridor can be established for multiple ports of entry located close to each other, with a deadline of 180 days for the establishment of proposed corridors. The Secretary of Transportation must establish transportation trade corridors for Customs ports of entry within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A 45-day comment period will be provided for public input, with final corridor boundaries to be published within one year. Periodic reviews and modifications will occur annually before each fiscal year. Transportation trade corridors boundaries will be published in the Federal Register by the Secretary of Transportation. Periodic reviews and modifications will be conducted annually to ensure appropriate corridor boundaries for Customs ports of entry. The Secretary of Transportation will issue regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. Appropriations from the National Trade Gateway Corridor Fund will be available for fiscal years 2009 through 2018. Grants approved by the Secretary for highway projects are considered contractual obligations of the Government. The Act defines \"eligible project\" as projects eligible for assistance under title 23, US Code, including intermodal freight facilities. It also defines \"Federal-aid highway\" and \"State\" as per title 23, US Code. The Act defines \"Federal-aid highway\" as per title 23, US Code, and \"State\" as any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico."
