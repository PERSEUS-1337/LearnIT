    "content": "Restoration of deduction for interest on educational loans. The amendment defines personal interest to include interest on qualified educational loans provided by certain organizations or guarantee programs. The amendment allows for the deduction of interest on qualified educational loans provided by specific organizations or guarantee programs, with a phaseout of the benefit based on the amount of interest incurred. The amendment allows for the deduction of interest on qualified educational loans with a phaseout based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The deduction for interest on qualified educational loans has a phaseout range based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The dollar amount ranges from $40,000 to $60,000 for joint returns and zero for other cases. The deduction is allowable only for the first 48 months of repayment, and qualified educational expenses include tuition and related expenses for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependents. The term 'qualified educational expenses' refers to tuition and related expenses for the taxpayer, spouse, or dependents at an eligible educational institution. These expenses include reasonable living expenses while away from home. The phaseout range for the deduction of interest on qualified educational loans is adjusted for inflation annually. For taxable years starting after 1994, the $40,000 and $60,000 amounts in subparagraph (B) will be adjusted for inflation based on the cost-of-living adjustment. Amounts will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1993, for loans with the first required payment after that date. The loan amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50."
