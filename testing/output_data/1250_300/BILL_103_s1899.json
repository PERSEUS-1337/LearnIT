FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that the Augusta Canal National Landmark in Georgia is listed on the National Historic Register, possesses excellent water quality, historic landscapes, and recreational opportunities for people in the United States.\" The Augusta Canal area in Georgia offers significant undeveloped recreational opportunities, representing the development of the cotton textile industry and early industrial economy. It also contains sites associated with various historical events and diverse cultural groups. Despite conservation efforts, the area's cultural, historical, natural, and recreational significance remains important. The Augusta Canal area in Georgia, despite conservation efforts, has not reached its full potential and is at risk of losing its cultural, historical, natural, and recreational resources without assistance from the Federal Government. The Secretary of the Interior has designated it a priority for protection, and there is a strong desire from local, regional, and State agencies, businesses, and private citizens to work together to preserve and enhance the Augusta Canal National Historic Landmark. The purpose of this Act is to establish a cooperative management framework for the Augusta Canal in Georgia to retain, enhance, and interpret its significant features while promoting positive economic impact and development. The Act also aims to benefit present and future generations in the State of Georgia and the United States.

The Augusta Canal Commission is established with members appointed by the Secretary from various entities. The Commission will elect a chairman from its members, and vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.

The plan should integrate existing Federal, State, and local plans, including the Augusta Canal Master Plan, for the protection and enhancement of cultural, natural, and recreational resources. The Secretary can offer technical and financial assistance, and must approve or disapprove the plan within 180 days based on specified criteria.

Upon approval of the management plan, the Secretary and the Augusta Canal Commission will implement it through cooperative agreements with various entities. Economic development efforts will be encouraged to align with the goals of the Augusta Canal Master Plan. SEC. 6. ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS.
