    "content": "The United States, Iraq's neighbors, and Iraqi political groups have different views and interests regarding Iraq's future. Iraq's neighbors are focused on understanding and influencing changes in areas such as the regional strategic balance, sectarian violence, terrorist groups, refugees, and economic opportunities. The removal of Saddam Hussein upset the political and economic balance in the Persian Gulf region, impacting long-term relations with neighbors. The fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War removed a military threat to Arab Gulf states but also eliminated a strategic counterweight to Iran. The Shiite-dominated government in Iraq has friendly ties to Iran, and the end of U.N. sanctions created new economic opportunities. However, ongoing violence limits regional economic growth. Postwar trends in Iraq, such as ethnic and sectarian mobilization, challenge central government authority and worry regional powers. The U.S. no longer needs a containment policy towards Iraq, leading to a shift in military posture. The fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq removed a military threat to Arab Gulf states but also eliminated a strategic counterweight to Iran. The Shiite-dominated government in Iraq has friendly ties to Iran, creating concerns among Sunni Arab governments about an emerging \"Shiite crescent.\" The U.S. no longer needs a containment policy towards Iraq, leading to a shift in military posture towards stabilization, training efforts, and regional counterterrorism activities. Future considerations of U.S. military presence in the region will be influenced by developments in Iraq and Iran. The empowerment of Iraq's Shiite Arabs and close ties between the Iranian government and Iraqi Shiite political parties have raised concerns of a \"Shiite crescent\" in the region. Sunni Arab countries have accused Iraqi Shiite militia groups of targeting Sunni civilians, while Shiites fear attacks from Sunni insurgent groups. Turkish worries about Kurdish separatism and the Turkoman minority in Iraq also influence their policy. The strengthening of Iraqi Shiite political parties and religious establishment in An Najaf has regional implications, causing concern in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain about the political activism of indigenous Shiite Arabs. The strengthening of Iraqi Shiite political parties and the Shiite hawza in An Najaf has regional implications, causing concern in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain about the political activism of indigenous Shiite Arabs. This could lead to increased sectarian tension in Bahrain and scrutiny of Saudi Arabia's minority Shiite population. There are also concerns in Iran that clerics in An Najaf may challenge the religious authority of the hawza in Qom. The United States and Iraq's neighbors are worried about the potential for Iraq to become an ungoverned or terrorist haven. Terrorist organizations in Iraq, including Al Qaeda, PMOI/MEK/MKO, PJAK, and PKK, pose transnational threats to neighboring countries like Turkey and Iran. Concerns also exist about foreign fighters and regional instability. Foreign fighters in Iraq may spark regional instability, similar to PKK attacks in Turkey leading to military responses. Concerns arise about these fighters returning to their home countries or other conflict zones to fuel insurgencies and terrorism. Experienced fighters from past conflicts have bolstered groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Cooperation among the US, regional governments, and the international community is crucial to prevent the spread of foreign fighters. The conflict in Iraq has led to a humanitarian crisis with millions displaced internally or fleeing to neighboring countries. The United Nations urges regional and international cooperation for effective relief efforts. Strong religious and ethnic ties drive calls for involvement, while the influx of refugees causes economic and political disruptions in some countries. If civil conflict in Iraq reignites, the situation could worsen. The massive influx of Iraqi refugees has caused economic and political disruptions, leading the United Nations to call for a more coordinated relief response. Iraq's energy resources and strategic location make it an attractive economic partner, but lingering effects of sanctions and postwar violence hinder trade and investment potential. Violence has also limited regional entities' willingness to invest in Iraq. The increase in bilateral and intra-regional trade levels post-Saddam era is driven by regional demand for Iraq's energy resources. However, violence has hindered investment and business activities in Iraq. Rehabilitation of oil production infrastructure is expected to boost availability of oil in the region but may lead to production quota competition within OPEC. The diverse political landscape in Iraq and regional/international policy issues complicate predicting future events. Changes in U.S. policy and regional dynamics since 2003 have influenced Iraq's neighbors' perspectives and policies. Expectations are for varied reactions to different scenarios and U.S. policy choices. The violence in Iraq post-Saddam era has hindered investment and business activities, with U.S. forces trying to reduce sectarian and ethnic violence. The bombing of a Shiite mosque in Al Samarra in 2006 escalated sectarian attacks, leading to concerns of civil war. U.S. policy makers and the Iraqi government faced challenges from insurgency, foreign terrorists, and criminal activities. Iraq's neighbors' reactions to different scenarios and U.S. policy choices are expected to vary. Since November 2007, U.S. and Iraqi officials have reported a significant decrease in sectarian violence, credited to the U.S. troop surge and ceasefire of the Shiite Jaysh al Mahdi militia. Iran and Turkey have engaged with Iraq's Kurdish and Shiite Arab populations to protect their interests. Iran's support for Iraq's Shiites may fuel Sunni-led resistance, while Iraq's Kurds are cautious of Turkish actions in northern Iraq against the PKK. Iran's intervention in Iraq on behalf of Shiites may be fueling Sunni-led resistance, while Iraq's Kurds are wary of Turkish actions in northern Iraq against the PKK. Members of Congress may need to consider potential U.S. responses to neighboring countries' efforts to influence Iraq. Relations between Iraq and Sunni Arab neighbors are characterized by limited engagement and reluctance to support the Iraqi government. Arab governments and citizens are divided on the impact of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, with fears of government failure and chaos. The Bush Administration claimed success in reversing the security deterioration in Iraq through the troop surge strategy. The Obama Administration supports the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement to consolidate security gains. U.S. troops were required to withdraw from Iraqi cities by June 2009. The Obama Administration supports the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement, with plans for U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq by December 31, 2011. The shift is from combat to support and training roles, aiming for a full withdrawal of U.S. forces. The Obama Administration supports the U.S.-Iraqi Security Agreement for troop withdrawals by December 31, 2011, transitioning to support and training roles for U.S. forces in Iraq. Concerns remain about achieving political reconciliation among Iraq's key communities and the role of U.S. forces in the region. The United States and Iraq's neighbors are determining the future of Iraq post-transition, focusing on stability and unity. Neighbors may support a strong central government to prevent violence and terrorist threats. Some argue that a united, democratic Iraq could pressure neighboring countries to improve political rights. A stable Iraq with diverse political representation could influence neighboring countries to improve political rights. Key unresolved issues include Iraq's role in regional organizations, military projection, presence of foreign military bases, and relations with regional and global powers. Limited understanding of regional perspectives on Iraq persists despite available policy statements and analysis. Iran's interests in Iraq are driven by regional ambitions and the desire to influence disputes with the United States and the Arab-Israeli conflict. With the threat from Saddam Hussein's regime removed, Iran aims to prevent Iraq from becoming a threat again. Iran seeks to ensure that Iraq does not pose a threat to Iran, viewing Iraq's Shiite population as a strategic asset. Iran's aid to Iraqi Shiite parties has hindered U.S. efforts in Iraq, but now faces challenges as these factions compete. Iran's strategy in Iraq aimed to unite Shiite factions to ensure Shiite dominance in the government. The United Iraqi Alliance, supported by Iran, won elections in 2005 but faced challenges as factions like Moqtada al Sadr's withdrew support. The current Prime Minister, Nouri al Maliki, is from the Dawa Party and spent most of his exile in Syria. The Sadr faction, led by Moqtada al Sadr, initially had ties to Iran but was less extensive due to family remaining in Iraq during Saddam's rule. The January 31, 2009 elections represented a setback for Iran as Maliki is less pro-Iranian than ISCI or Sadr. The January 31, 2009 elections were a setback for Iran as Maliki's less pro-Iranian stance resulted in ISCI not winning in any Shiite province. Maliki's slate won in most Shiite provinces, including an outright majority in Basra. ISCI only tied with Maliki in Najaf, limiting their ability to form coalitions for provincial governance. The U.S. Defense Department report acknowledged that Iraqi nationalism could check Iran's ambitions, noting Tehran's reduced support for militants. The report highlighted that Iraqi nationalism could act as a check on Iran's ambitions, despite Tehran's selective reduction in support for militants. However, Iran still poses a significant challenge to Iraq's stability and political independence, continuing to support Sadr's religious studies in Qom. The emergence of Iraqi nationalism since 2007 has reduced Iraq's flexibility to compromise with Iran on longstanding disputes. Iraqi officials took responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war, signed military cooperation agreements with Iran, and supported Iran's right to peaceful nuclear technology. Iran has not returned Iraqi aircraft taken during the Gulf War, and efforts are ongoing to resolve missing persons from the Iran-Iraq war. The ICRC is working to resolve the 75,000 Iranians and Iraqis still missing from the Iran-Iraq war. Tensions arise from Iran's accusations that Iraq is not doing enough to stop the PJAK group from staging incursions into Iran. Territorial disputes were mostly resolved in 2000 by recognizing the thalweg as the water border. The 1975 Algiers Accords established the water border between Iran and Iraq, but Iraq abrogated it before invading Iran in 1980. In 2008, both countries agreed to renovate border posts. Iran has been accused of foot-dragging on demarcation issues. Iraq now has more control over U.S. operations due to the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement. Iran is pressuring Iraq to expel the Iranian opposition group PMOI from Camp Ashraf near the border. Iran is pressuring Iraq to expel the Iranian opposition group PMOI from Camp Ashraf near the border. Iraqi leaders have expressed resentment towards the PMOI for their close ties to Saddam Hussein. Despite pledges to respect the residents' human rights, the Iraqi Security Forces attempted to assert control over Ashraf, leading to violent altercations with the unarmed residents. The U.S. position, as stated by Secretary of State Clinton, is focused on resolving the issue of Camp Ashraf. The PMOI leaders claim that at least 10 residents have been killed in altercations with the ISF, with many others injured. The U.S. believes that resolving the Camp Ashraf issue is now up to Iraq, as Iran tries to influence Iraqi leaders for political and economic gain. Iran attempted to sabotage the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, fearing it would strengthen U.S. military presence in the region. Iran attempted to derail the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement by bribing Iraqi parliamentarians, and Iran's Supreme Leader warned against trusting the U.S. to fulfill its pledges. Despite this, Iraq has welcomed Iran's support, with Prime Minister Maliki visiting Iran multiple times to consult on various issues and sign agreements. Iran and Iraq have engaged in various agreements and visits, including a visit by Ahmadinejad to Iraq in 2008 resulting in $1 billion in credits for Iranian exports and agreements in various sectors. In return, Iraq awarded a $1 billion contract to an Iranian firm for reconstruction projects. Trade relations between the two countries have been strengthened. In February 2009, Iraq awarded a $1 billion contract to an Iranian firm for reconstruction projects in Basra and historical sites in southern Iraq. Trade relations between the two countries have grown, with bilateral trade reaching $4 billion. Plans were made to increase trade to $5 billion annually, focusing on oil and electricity. The United States engaged in bilateral meetings with Iran in Baghdad in 2007, led by ambassadors from both countries. Talks scheduled for December 2007 were postponed by Iran. In 2007, the United States and Iran engaged in bilateral talks in Baghdad, with meetings held in May, July, and August. However, talks scheduled for December were postponed by Iran. In 2008, Iran decided to discontinue dialogue due to civilian casualties caused by U.S. forces in Sadr City. This decision may have been influenced by Iran's assessment that the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq signaled a diminishing of U.S. influence in the region. Iran's influence in Iraq is substantial, but some aspects are waning, particularly efforts to sustain Shiite militias. A secular, strong Arab nationalist leader in Iraq could pose a challenge to Iran's current influence. Some analysts believe Iran fears a successful non-cleric-led democracy in Iraq, as it could increase pressure for political liberalization in Iran. Others suggest a stable Iraq could benefit Iraq's An Najaf over Iran's holy city of Qom. Iran's position may be strengthened if its ally ISCI remains empowered. Iran's influence in Iraq remains substantial, with efforts to sustain Shiite militias waning. Turkey's relationship with Iraq has evolved since the Gulf War, allowing for the development of an autonomous Iraqi Kurdish administration despite initial unease. Turkey has played a significant role in Iraq, initially establishing a protective shield for Iraqi Kurds and later expressing doubts about U.S. regime change plans. They seek a stable, democratic, and unified Iraq to maintain regional stability, while also being wary of Iran's influence and the potential chaos from a U.S. military withdrawal. Turkey encourages Iraqi parties to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation. Turkey has established a dialogue with Iraqi parties to promote reconciliation and participation in the Baghdad government, emphasizing the importance of Iraq's federal structure and the constructive role of Kurds. They prioritize the well-being of Iraqi Turkomen and aim to strengthen economic ties with Iraq. Turkey views Iraq as a strategic partner and is committed to regional stability, assisting in reducing tensions between Iraq and Syria. Their focus on Iraq's territorial integrity aims to prevent the emergence of an independent Iraqi state. Turkey's concern for Iraq's territorial integrity is driven by the fear of a potential independent Kurdish state that could inspire separatist movements within Turkey. The PKK, listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. State Department, poses a threat to Turkey, leading to military deployments in northern Iraq. Ankara asserts its right to self-defense under international law if Iraq fails to prevent terrorist activities on its soil. Diplomatic efforts with Iraqi and Kurdish officials are also underway to address this security issue. Ankara asserts its right to self-defense under international law if Iraq fails to prevent terrorist activities on its soil. In response to the PKK threat in northern Iraq, Turkey mobilized military forces on the border in 2006. The Bush Administration appointed General Joseph Ralston as Special Envoy to coordinate with Turkey and Iraq to eliminate the PKK threat. However, Ralston's mission did not yield concrete results, leading to frustration on the Turkish side. In 2007, General Joseph Ralston resigned as Special Envoy after failing to achieve concrete results in combating the PKK threat. Turkey refrained from military action against the PKK for a year due to his appointment. Despite diplomatic efforts, including a memorandum of understanding signed between Turkey and Iraq, cooperation with the Kurdistan Regional Government was hindered. In 2007, despite diplomatic efforts and a memorandum of understanding signed between Turkey and Iraq, cooperation with the Kurdistan Regional Government was hindered. President Bush invited Prime Minister Erdogan to the White House to address the PKK threat, referring to them as \"our common enemy\" and promising \"real time\" intelligence. This led to consultations between US and Turkish military officials, showing Turkey that their concerns were being taken seriously. After consultations between US and Turkish military officials, Turkish forces conducted targeted air strikes against the PKK. A week-long incursion into the Iraqi border area of Zap was launched by Turkish special forces, degrading PKK communications and training facilities. Turkish officials were pleased with US intelligence assistance but displeased when President Bush and Secretary of Defense Gates called for rapid withdrawal of Turkish troops. Turkish President Gul invited Iraqi President Talabani to Ankara to ease tensions, despite Talabani's stance against the PKK as a terrorist organization. In March 2009, President Gul became the first Turkish president to visit Iraq in 33 years. He met with President Talabani and KRG Prime Minister Barzani, discussing the PKK issue. Turkey's diplomatic efforts have not stopped terror attacks, with casualties suffered by Turkish forces. In October 2008, PKK terrorists carried out deadly attacks at the Turkish border outpost of Akt\u00fcnt\u00fcn and a police bus in Diyarbakir, killing soldiers and police officers. In October 2008, PKK terrorists carried out deadly attacks at the Turkish border outpost of Akt\u00fcnt\u00fcn, killing 17 soldiers, and a police bus in Diyarbakir, killing 6 officers. Turkey responded with air strikes and extended authority for cross-border operations into northern Iraq. Diplomatic efforts with KRG leader Barzani showed progress, leading to a trilateral mechanism with Turkey, Iraq, and the US to counter terrorism. In August 2009, Barzani stated that the PKK cannot sustain armed struggle. In August 2009, Massoud Barzani encouraged peaceful means for Kurdish rights, not violence. Turkey extended the mandate for cross-border operations into northern Iraq. Security cooperation between Turkey and Iraq includes military training and technical cooperation. The High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council aims to establish a common security framework, political dialogue, economic interdependence, and cultural cooperation. Iraqi Turkomen remain a policy concern. The Iraqi Turkomen, ethnic kin of the Turks residing alongside Kurds in northern Iraq, are a policy concern for Turkey due to displacement and outnumbering by Iraqi Kurds. Ankara advocates for equitable sharing of resources in Kirkuk to prevent Kurdish dominance and financing of an independent state. The city of Kirkuk is predominantly Kurdish, causing tension with Turkomen residents. Turkish officials argue for equitable sharing of Iraq's natural resources. Economic ties between Turkey and Iraq are growing, with plans for a free trade agreement and increased trade. Cooperation in the energy field is also expanding. Trucks loaded with Turkish goods cross into Iraq daily, with Iraqi Kurds collecting tariffs. Plans for a common industrial zone on the border are in progress. Bilateral cooperation in the energy field is increasing, with agreements signed for oil exploration and transportation in northern Iraq. The Kirkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline is a source of income for both countries, with plans to construct a twin pipeline to increase capacity. Iraqi oil shipments to Turkey are expected to double by mid-2010. Turkey hopes Iraq will use the Nabucco natural gas pipeline to export gas to Europe. Turkey hopes Iraq will use the Nabucco natural gas pipeline to export gas to Europe, with Iraqi shipments depending on increased gas production. Bilateral water issues between Turkey and Iraq, as upstream and downstream riparians on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, are being addressed cooperatively. Iraq has raised concerns about reduced water flow from the Euphrates, but Turkey maintains its commitment to provide water despite drought conditions. Turkey maintains commitment to provide Iraq and Syria with water despite drought conditions. Memorandum of understanding signed for joint measurement stations on Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Turkey and Iraq have diplomatic relations despite past attacks. Plans for consulate in Irbil to strengthen ties with KRG. Ankara emphasizes relations with KRG. Turkish government maintains embassy in Baghdad despite past attacks. Turkish authorities accept Iraqi Kurds' claim of no independence goal. Turkey reaches out to all Iraqi ethnic groups for unity. Cooperation with Iran against PKK likely to continue. Turkish officials emphasize cooperation with Iran against PKK in northern Iraq. Public opinion towards the United States in Turkey remains low despite efforts to improve relations. The United States has a low favorability rating in Turkey, mainly due to U.S. policies towards Muslim-majority countries like Iraq. Turks lack confidence in Iraq's stability efforts. Turkey may not decrease its anti-American sentiment, but it is likely to support U.S. withdrawal from Iraq through its Incirlik Air Base and Mercin port, with the condition of preventing arms from reaching the PKK. Saudi Arabia has a historically tense relationship with Iraq, but cooperation has occurred during shared interests, such as the Iran-Iraq war. Saudi Arabia's relationship with Iraq has been historically tense, with periods of cooperation during shared interests like the Iran-Iraq war. Saudi Arabia's main interests in Iraq include preventing instability, protecting Sunni interests, and limiting Iran's regional influence. They also aim to ensure Iraq's oil industry revival does not threaten Saudi preeminence in global energy markets. Saudi Arabia has refrained from overt political or military intervention in Iraq since 2003. Saudi Arabia has refrained from overt political or military intervention in Iraq since 2003. Saudi policy initiatives focus on meeting humanitarian needs, promoting reconciliation, and taking security measures to prevent violence from spreading into Saudi Arabia. There are speculations that Saudi Arabia has not fulfilled aid pledges to Iraq due to concerns about supporting a Shiite sectarian agenda. Additionally, there are suggestions that the Saudi government may be offering financial support to Sunni Arab individuals and groups in Iraq. Saudi Arabia refrains from direct involvement in Iraq since 2003, focusing on humanitarian aid, reconciliation, and security measures. Speculations suggest Saudi support for Sunni Arab groups in Iraq, despite official clerics condemning violence. Saudi fighters in Iraq pose a long-term security risk, with ties to past terrorist attacks in the kingdom. Prince Saud al Faisal denies disproportionate Saudi involvement in Iraq, dismissing reports of high numbers of terrorists traveling from Saudi Arabia. In late 2002 through early 2006, there were successful and attempted terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. Prince Saud al Faisal denied reports of high numbers of Saudis traveling to Iraq as combatants. U.S. military assessments show a decline in Saudi fighters reaching Iraq due to stricter exit visa controls. Estimates suggest that 12% of foreign fighters killed or captured in Iraq were Saudi nationals. Reports indicate that 30 to 40 Saudis were traveling to Iraq each month to fight, with many being foreign suicide bombers. Saudi officials are taking measures to prevent the return of Saudi volunteers and combatants from Iraq. Saudi officials claim that 30 to 40 Saudis were traveling to Iraq monthly to fight, with many being foreign suicide bombers. To prevent the return of Saudi volunteers and combatants from Iraq, Saudi Arabia awarded a $2 billion contract to build a 5,600-mile security system along its borders with Yemen and Iraq. Concerns about Iraq's Shiite Arab population and Iranian influence in the region are reflected in Saudi official and public views. The historically tense relationship between Saudi Arabia's Sunni Arab majority and Shiite Arab minority complicates efforts to engage with Iraq. Sunni-Shiite tensions have been elevated on Saudi Arabia's domestic agenda due to clashes between Saudi Shiites and security forces. Despite increased cooperation between Saudi and Iraqi security services, some Iraqis are frustrated by the slow pace of official Saudi-Iraqi relations. Saudi leaders maintain regular contact with Iraqi government officials, clerics, and political figures, and Saudi-Iraqi security cooperation has increased. However, Iraqis are frustrated by the slow progress in relations and Saudi Arabia's failure to prevent sectarian incitement. Despite efforts to improve relations, there have been delays in reopening embassies due to security concerns. Saudi Arabia had plans to open an embassy in Baghdad, but security concerns led to delays. Advanced preparations were made, but high-level diplomatic personnel were hesitant to be sent permanently due to security issues. The bombing of Iraqi government ministries in August 2009 further confirmed Saudi views of insecurity in Baghdad. As of September 2009, a Saudi Embassy had not been opened, and debt forgiveness remains a key issue in Iraqi-Saudi relations. Debt forgiveness is a major issue in Iraqi-Saudi relations, with Iraq owing Saudi Arabia $9 billion from the Saddam Hussein era. Private Saudi firms hold an additional $19 billion in Iraqi debt. U.S. officials have urged forgiveness to support Iraqi reconstruction. Saudi Arabia has pledged funds for development projects and humanitarian aid, but trade between the two countries remains limited. The Saudi government has refrained from overt interference in Iraq, despite reports of private Saudi support for anti-coalition activities. The Saudi government has refrained from overt interference in Iraq, despite reports of private Saudi support for anti-coalition activities. However, influential figures in Saudi Arabia have called for direct political and security assistance to Iraq's Sunni Arab community to counter perceived Iranian influence. Popular support for anti-U.S. or anti-Iranian activity may remain strong among Saudis. The Saudi government has refrained from overt interference in Iraq, despite private Saudi support for anti-coalition activities. Popular support for anti-U.S. or anti-Iranian activity may remain strong among Saudis. Prince Saud al Faisal dismissed calls for direct involvement in Iraq, stating the Kingdom will stand at an equal distance from all Iraqi groups. Saudi officials remain frustrated with Prime Minister Al Maliki's anti-Sunni sectarian policy and close ties with Iran. Reconciliation and stability in Iraq could ease Saudi fears of instability. Saudi Arabia's immediate concern is the reintegration or elimination of returning Saudi militants. Reconciliation and stability in Iraq could ease Saudi fears of instability and the reintegration or elimination of returning Saudi militants is a key concern. The outcome of conflict or reconciliation in Iraq, as well as the leadership and character of Iraq's government, will impact Saudi fears about Shiite empowerment and Iranian influence. Future Iraqi decisions on energy and military policy will also affect Iraqi-Saudi relations in the long term. Syria's initial obstructionist stance towards the U.S. presence in Iraq shifted as sectarian warfare escalated, leading to improved relations with Iraq as stability returned. Syria, a Sunni Arab country with ties to Shiite Iran, played both sides of the Iraqi sectarian divide. By 2009, U.S.-Syrian ties strengthened, focusing on border security and overall relations with Iraq. The Obama Administration improved U.S.-Syrian ties by discussing security along the Syrian-Iraqi border and enhancing relations with Iraq. Delegations from U.S. Central Command met with Syrian officials to establish a committee for border monitoring. Syria expressed willingness to cooperate on Iraq, aiming for stability and refugee return. Despite improved Syrian-Iraqi relations and U.S. support for cooperation, tensions persist due to a diplomatic dispute over bombings in Baghdad in 2009. Allegations of Syrian involvement led to the recall of ambassadors from both countries. The situation highlights ongoing enmities and challenges to stability in the region. Despite improved Syrian-Iraqi relations and U.S. support for cooperation, tensions persist due to a diplomatic dispute over bombings in Baghdad in 2009. Both countries recalled their ambassadors. U.S. officials claim Syria harbors groups opposed to the Maliki government, hindering progress on joint economic and political fronts with Iraq. Syria needs to address border security and foreign fighter networks transiting into Iraq. Syria remains the primary gateway for Iraq-bound foreign fighters. Some speculate the Asad regime harbors Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials for leverage. Despite decreased fighter flow from Syria into Iraq, Syria remains the main gateway for foreign fighters heading to Iraq. Speculations suggest that Syria may be using Al Qaeda in Iraq operatives and former Baath party officials as leverage in negotiations with the United States and Iraqi government. The Maliki government insists on improved relations with Syria, emphasizing the need for Syria to crack down on foreign fighters and Al Qaeda in Iraq's Syrian network. Despite some cooperation, reports indicate ongoing activities against the Iraqi government. Syria continues to be a key route for foreign fighters entering Iraq, with reports indicating ongoing support for Al Qaeda in Iraq and former Baath party officials operating within Syria. The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned individuals for their involvement in supporting insurgents in Iraq. Syrian harboring of these elements has strained Syrian-Iraqi relations, especially after a U.S. airstrike in Syrian territory in 2008. Syrian-Iraqi relations were disrupted by Baath party elements and lax border security. The Iraqi government initially supported a U.S. airstrike in Syrian territory in 2008 that killed an Al Qaeda operative. Despite condemning the attack later, Iraq acknowledged the threat posed by insurgents using Syria as a base. Efforts were made to improve relations, with Syria demanding security coordination and assurances from President Asad. The Syrian government demanded provisions in the U.S.-Iraqi Status of Forces Agreement to prevent raids from Iraqi bases into neighboring countries. Tensions escalated after Al Qaeda bomb attacks in Iraq led to accusations against the Asad regime. This strained Syrian-Iraqi relations despite recent diplomatic breakthroughs. Relations between Iraq and Syria have deteriorated following recent diplomatic breakthroughs. Prime Minister Maliki accused Syria of sheltering armed organizations and individuals wanted by Iraqi courts. He presented evidence of Iraqi Baathists and Al Qaeda operatives meeting in Syria. Syrian President Assad defended his country's hosting of Iraqi refugees. Iraq is demanding the extradition of two operatives from Syria. Iraq is demanding the extradition of two operatives believed to be in Syria following the August bombings. The Maliki government has called for an international tribunal similar to the Hariri tribunal. President Talabani objected to the tough stance against Syria, stating it is not in the interest of both countries. The Iraqi refugee crisis has also strained Syrian-Iraqi relations. The Iraqi refugee crisis has strained Syrian-Iraqi relations, with Syria hosting an estimated 1.3 million Iraqi refugees. This has led to strains on the Syrian economy, changes in neighborhoods, and an increase in the sex trade. Syrian authorities have imposed a visa requirement and are seeking more assistance from the Iraqi government and the international community. Syrian authorities imposed a visa requirement in September 2007 for Iraqi refugees, leading to strains on the Syrian economy. The Maliki government has provided minimal assistance, with only $15 million pledged in April 2007. International aid organizations have faced challenges working with Syria's bureaucracy, resulting in insufficient support for Iraqi refugees. Despite bilateral discussions on various issues, both countries have withdrawn their ambassadors due to ongoing security disputes. In 2007, Syria and Iraq agreed to revive the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline for Iraqi oil exports, but repairs have not started despite a contract with a Russian firm. Cooperation on energy and other issues has stalled due to tensions over alleged Syrian support for Al Qaeda in Iraq terrorists. Despite earlier reports of a contract with a Russian firm for repairs, the Kirkuk-Banias pipeline in Syria, with a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, has yet to undergo repair work. Syria is now seeking other foreign firms to assess the damage and rebuild the pipeline. Additionally, Syria has been reaching out to various Iraqi parties, including the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Sadrists, in an effort to maintain influence as Iranian influence among Iraqi Shiites grows. Syria has been engaging with various Iraqi groups to maintain influence as Iranian influence among Iraqi Shiites grows. Syrian-Iraqi relations are strained due to alleged Syrian support for Sunni insurgents and terrorists in Iraq. The total volume of Syrian-Iraqi trade reached $6.6 billion in 2008. The Obama Administration's diplomatic efforts have had limited success in addressing the costs of supporting Sunni terrorist groups in Syria. Syrian support for such activities against Iraq may be indirect to maintain relations with the United States. Without sustained bilateral cooperation, economic benefits like energy deals and market access cannot be fully realized. Jordan's relations with Iraq have been strained since the Saddam Hussein era, with Jordan providing quiet support for the U.S.-led campaign in 2003. Jordanians criticize the political marginalization of Iraq's Sunni Arab population, but Jordan has limited ability to intervene in Iraq's affairs currently. Jordan has been criticized for marginalizing Iraq's Sunni Arab population since 2003. The country is concerned about Iraq's influence on its politics, trade, and security. Zarqa is known for producing foreign fighters joining the Sunni insurgency. Jordan faces threats from transnational terrorism and has limited ability to intervene in Iraq's affairs. Young men in Zarqa are influenced to join jihad and become martyrs. Potential threats from transnational terrorism dominate Jordan's Iraq policy agenda. Despite the killing of Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al Zarqawi in 2006, the threat of Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists using Iraq to destabilize Jordan remains. In 2005, explosions at Western-owned hotels in Amman were claimed by Al Qaeda in Iraq. Jordanian authorities thwarted a bomb attack at Queen Alia Airport in 2006. Several conspirators were Iraqis, with one attempting to use explosives commonly used by insurgents in Iraq. Jordan, with a significant Palestinian population, has coped with refugee issues. The convicted conspirators in Jordan were Iraqis, with one ringleader attempting to use explosives commonly used by insurgents in Iraq. Jordan, with a significant Palestinian population, has been dealing with refugee issues for decades. The influx of 400,000-500,000 Iraqis in Jordan has created economic and social challenges, leading to inflation and hardships for middle-class Jordanians. Jordan has sealed its borders to prevent further inflow of Iraqis and there are concerns about sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shiite groups. The Jordanian government may be treating the Iraqi refugee influx as a national security issue. Jordan has imposed restrictions on young Iraqi males entering the country due to security concerns. Displaced Iraqis in Jordan are classified as \"visitors\" or \"guests\" as Jordan lacks a domestic refugee law. Those who deposit $150,000 in Amman banks are granted residency instantly. In 2008, Jordan normalized relations with Iraq, with King Abdullah II becoming the first Arab leader to visit since 2003. Jordan also appointed an ambassador to Baghdad, the first nation to do so. King Abdullah II of Jordan visited Iraq in response to U.S. demands to end Arab states' isolation of Iraq. Jordan appointed an ambassador to Baghdad, seeking benefits from the relationship with its oil-rich neighbor. Iraq previously supplied Jordan with oil, but due to political turmoil, Jordan had to find alternative sources until 2008 when Iraqi oil shipments resumed. Initially, Jordan was to receive 10,000 barrels of oil per day under the agreement. In 2008, Iraqi crude oil shipments to Jordan resumed after years of delay. Jordan was initially set to receive 10,000 barrels per day at a discounted price. Plans for a pipeline from Iraq to Jordan were scrapped due to cost projections, with Jordan now seeking international financing for a railroad system to transport Iraqi oil to its refinery in Zarqa. Jordanian Prime Minister Nader Dahabi visited Iraq in 2009 for discussions with Iraqi leaders. Jordan sought international financing for a 600-mile railroad system to transport Iraqi crude oil to its refinery in Zarqa. In 2009, Jordan and Iraq signed an agreement to establish a free trade zone to boost bilateral trade, which reached $1 billion in 2008. Discussions also addressed Iraq's debts to Jordan, estimated at over $1 billion. The presence of militant Islamist groups in Iraq poses a threat to Jordan, especially as U.S. forces withdraw. The status of Al Qaeda in Iraq and other terrorist groups remains uncertain.
