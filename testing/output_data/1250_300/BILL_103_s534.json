The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against various unavoidable causes, including drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, and more. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure agricultural commodities against unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, and frost. Insurance coverage for aquacultural species is limited to the period the commodity is in the field. Standard yield coverage provides protection against yield loss up to 75% of the average yield on the insured farm. Average yields may be adjusted by the Board for fairness among farms in the same area. The Corporation provides insurance coverage for agricultural commodities against unavoidable causes like drought, flood, hail, wind, and frost. Average yields may be adjusted by the Board for fairness among farms in the same area, with lesser levels of yield coverage available, including coverage at 50 percent of the recorded or appraised average yield. Adjusted yields can be used for insurance coverage if greater than the recorded or appraised yield on the farming unit. Insurance coverage can be provided for agricultural commodities based on adjusted yields determined by the Service, rather than recorded or appraised yields by the Corporation. Additional premiums are set by the Board to accurately reflect increased risk and cover potential losses. The Corporation may offer coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. The Corporation may offer insurance coverage for agricultural commodities based on adjusted yields, with levels exceeding 75 percent of the average yield. The maximum coverage level is set at 75 percent, except in certain circumstances. One price election option must approximate the projected market price for the commodity. The Corporation offers insurance coverage for agricultural commodities based on adjusted yields, with a maximum coverage level of 75 percent. One price election option approximates the projected market price for the commodity. Insurance does not cover losses due to neglect, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board may limit insurance based on risk, and insurance may not be provided in counties where income from the commodity is insignificant. The Corporation provides insurance coverage for agricultural commodities based on adjusted yields, with a maximum coverage level of 75 percent. Insurance may not be provided in counties where the income from the commodity is deemed insignificant. The Corporation must report annually to Congress on the operations and results of the insurance program for each commodity insured.

Insurance coverage is provided to producers based on a price election set by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. SEC. 3. LATE PLANTING COVERAGE. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act allows producers to plant after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days, with a reduction in yield guarantee for each day of delay. Late planting coverage is included in a basic insurance policy unless producers opt out. If late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums, it can be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm. This coverage applies if planting is prevented due to excess moisture, drought, or natural disasters, with eligibility for 50% coverage of the guaranteed level. Producers also have the option to plant a substitute crop, with its value offsetting the remaining coverage for the insured crop. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm, allowing for 50% coverage of the guaranteed level if planting is prevented by excess moisture, drought, or natural disasters. Producers can also opt to plant a substitute crop, which will offset the remaining coverage for the insured crop. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to eliminate penalties for de minimis yields. Producers affected by disaster losses may not have deductions from indemnity payments if the market value of the actual production is lower than the cost of harvesting. Additionally, yield averages are addressed in the following section. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to establish yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. The Corporation will set a minimum insurance protection level for producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters, allowing the use of transitional yields if actual production history is not established. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now allows yield coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. Producers can use previous yield history or transitional yield data for new parcels of land. The Corporation will make adjustments for nonstandard classification procedures. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to account for yield declines due to natural disasters. Transitional yield is the countywide average used when actual production records are unavailable for producers on a farm."
