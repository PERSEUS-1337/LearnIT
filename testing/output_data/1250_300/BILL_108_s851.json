Title 18, United States Code, is amended to include a new chapter on the transportation of minors in circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion. The \"Child Custody Protection Act\" introduces penalties for knowingly transporting a minor across state lines to obtain an abortion without parental consent, in violation of state laws requiring parental involvement in abortion decisions. The \"Child Custody Protection Act\" prohibits transporting a minor across state lines for an abortion without parental consent, except in cases where the minor's life is at risk. Transporting a minor in violation of this law is not subject to prosecution, and it is a defense if the defendant reasonably believed they had parental consent. The \"Child Custody Protection Act\" allows an affirmative defense for those who reasonably believed they had parental consent before a minor's abortion. Parents can seek civil action for harm caused by violations of the law requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision. The \"Child Custody Protection Act\" mandates parental notification or consent before an abortion is performed on a minor, defining a parent as a guardian, legal custodian, or person in loco parentis. A minor is defined as an individual not older than the maximum age requiring parental involvement in abortion decisions.
