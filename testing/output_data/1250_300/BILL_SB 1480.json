    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to be filed by February 15 each year with the assessor. The assessor must review the claims to ensure they meet specific requirements before approving the exemption. The assessor may audit the operations of the property owner to verify eligibility for welfare or veterans' organization exemptions. If the property is found ineligible, the claimant can seek a refund of property taxes paid by filing a refund claim with the county. The property owner may seek a refund of property taxes if the property is found ineligible for exemption. If the refund claim is denied by the county, the owner can file a refund action in superior court. Additionally, an applicant granted a welfare exemption does not need to reapply in subsequent years if there are no changes in ownership or use of the exempted property. The applicant must notify the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible for the exemption. Prior to the lien date, the assessor sends an annual notice to applicants exempt from filing yearly applications. The notice outlines circumstances that may make the property ineligible for exemption and advises applicants to inform the assessor if this occurs. It also explains the process for reaffirming exemption eligibility for the next fiscal year. Failure to do so may prompt the assessor to verify exempt activity. The assessor must redetermine eligibility for welfare or veterans' organization exemptions if incorrectly granted. Any property no longer eligible will have the exemption canceled. Incorrectly allowed exemptions will result in an escape assessment with interest and a penalty. The board will review the assessor's administration of these exemptions to ensure proper implementation.

Every application must present the necessary facts to the board, with a copy filed with the assessor. The board will provide notice and a hearing upon receiving a timely application, following its rules. Failure to file on time will prevent relief under Section 11 of Article XIII or this section. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to state that any excess proceeds from a delinquent tax sale trust fund, after satisfying certain distributions, can be claimed by parties of interest in the property. If not claimed within a specified period, the excess proceeds may be transferred to the county general fund, with certain costs deducted by the county before the transfer."
