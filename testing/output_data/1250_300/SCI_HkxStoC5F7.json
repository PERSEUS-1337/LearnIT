VERSA substitutes optimization procedures with forward passes through inference networks, resulting in faster test-time performance. It employs a flexible amortization network for few-shot learning datasets and sets new state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. The framework introduces a multi-task probabilistic model and a method for meta-learning probabilistic inference. It utilizes a standard multi-task directed graphical model with shared parameters for all tasks and task-specific parameters. The goal is to meta-learn fast and accurate approximations to the posterior predictive distribution for unseen tasks. The section introduces a framework for meta-learning approximate inference to quickly approximate the posterior predictive distribution for unseen tasks. It employs point estimates for shared parameters and distributional estimates for task-specific parameters. The probabilistic solution for few-shot learning involves forming the posterior distribution over task-specific parameters and computing the posterior predictive. The emphasis is on performing these steps quickly at test time. The framework introduced focuses on meta-learning approximate inference to quickly approximate the posterior predictive distribution for unseen tasks. It involves learning an amortized distribution using a feed-forward inference network with parameters \u03c6. The approximate posterior predictive distribution is constructed by amortizing the approximate posterior q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D) and may require additional approximation like Monte Carlo sampling. The form of the distributions is similar to those used in amortized variational inference. The framework focuses on meta-learning approximate inference to quickly approximate the posterior predictive distribution for unseen tasks using a factorized Gaussian distribution. Training aims to minimize the KL-divergence between true and approximate posterior predictive distributions, returning parameters that best approximate the posterior predictive distribution in an average KL sense. The amortized procedure meta-learns approximate inference supporting accurate prediction. The training procedure involves selecting a task, sampling training data, forming the posterior predictive, and computing the log-density. The objective is to optimize the unbiased estimate by simulating approximate Bayesian held-out log-likelihood evaluation. The procedure scores the approximate inference by minimizing KL divergence between the posterior predictive distribution and the approximate distribution. The training differs from standard variational inference as it focuses on the posterior predictive distribution. The training procedure focuses on the posterior predictive distribution and minimizes KL divergence.
