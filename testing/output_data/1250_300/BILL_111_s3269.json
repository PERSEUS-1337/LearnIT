    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection Act of 2010\" or the \"STANDUP Act.\" Congress finds that motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Americans aged 15-20, with a high fatality rate for drivers in this age group compared to older drivers. Teenage drivers account for over a third of all fatalities in crashes they are involved in. Teenage drivers account for a significant portion of fatalities in motor vehicle crashes, with two-thirds of the fatalities being other drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. The risk of a crash for 16- or 17-year-old drivers doubles with two peers in the vehicle and quadruples with three or more peers. Cognitive distraction from cell phones significantly affects teenage drivers between 15 and 20 years old. Despite only 20% of teenage driving occurring at night, over 50% of crash fatalities involving teenage drivers happen during nighttime. Teenage drivers between 15 and 20 years old face increased crash risk, especially at night. Graduated driver licensing systems have shown success in reducing fatal and injurious crashes among teenage drivers. California's program led to a decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries. Between 1998 and 2000, California's graduated driver licensing program led to a 40% decrease in teenage passenger deaths and injuries from crashes involving 16-year-old drivers. Additionally, the number of at-fault collisions with 16-year-old drivers decreased by 24%. The National Transportation Safety Board reports that over 40 states have implemented 3-stage graduated driver licensing systems, but many states have not yet implemented other safety features. A 2001 Harris Poll shows that 95% of Americans support 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult, and 92% support a 6-month learner's permit period. (A) 95 percent of Americans support a requirement of 30 to 50 hours of practice driving with an adult; (B) 92 percent of Americans support a 6-month learner's permit period; and (C) 74 percent of Americans support limiting the number of teenage passengers in a car with a teenage driver and supervised driving during high-risk driving periods, such as night. State graduated driver licensing laws. State graduated driver licensing laws require novice drivers under 21 to go through a 2-stage process, starting with a learner's permit stage at 16 years old, lasting at least 6 months, with restrictions on cellphone use and night driving. The intermediate stage of state graduated driver licensing laws starts after the learner's permit stage, lasts at least 6 months, prohibits cellphone use and night driving, and limits non-familial passengers under 21 years old. The intermediate stage of state graduated driver licensing laws includes restrictions on non-familial passengers under 21 years old, limits on cellphone use and night driving, and additional requirements such as behind-the-wheel training and supervision by a licensed driver over 21 years old. In the intermediate stage of state graduated driver licensing laws, a licensed driver over 21 must accompany and supervise the driver at all times. Additionally, any individual convicted of driving-related offenses during this stage will have their unrestricted driver's license issuance automatically delayed. The Secretary of Transportation will create regulations for implementing restrictions on driving offenses, including misrepresentation of age, reckless driving, not wearing a seat belt, speeding, and other offenses. SEC. 4. INCENTIVE GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation will award grants to compliant States for the first 3 fiscal years after the enactment of the Act. States must submit an application including certification of compliance with section 3(a) to be eligible for the grant. The amount of the grant will be determined based on the appropriation for that fiscal year. Each fiscal year, funds will be apportioned to compliant States based on a ratio of funds apportioned under section 402 of title 23, United States Code. States can use the grant for enforcing a 2-stage licensing process, training law enforcement personnel, publishing educational materials on graduated driver licensing laws, and other administrative activities related to the licensing process. Authorization of $25,000,000 annually from the Highway Trust Fund for administrative activities related to a State's 2-stage licensing process. SEC. 5. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. During the fourth fiscal year after the enactment of the Act, the Secretary will withhold 3% of funds from states not in compliance with section 3(a). In the fifth year, the withholding increases to 5%, and from the sixth year onwards, it will be 10%. During the sixth and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary will withhold 10% of funds from states not complying with section 3(a) on the first day of the fiscal year. The withheld funds will remain available for distribution to the state until the end of the third fiscal year following the appropriation year. The Secretary will withhold funds from non-compliant states for up to six fiscal years. If a state complies before the funds expire, they will be distributed back to the state. Any funds withheld under subsection (a) must be used by the State within three fiscal years. If not spent, the funds will return to the Treasury. Noncompliance with section 3(a) results in funds reverting back to the Treasury."
