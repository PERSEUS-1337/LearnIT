    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct a pilot project to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resource management activities. The Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a pilot project on Federal lands in California to implement resource management activities as recommended in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal. The pilot project area includes specific forests designated for group selection. Certain lands, spotted owl habitat areas, and protected activity centers are excluded from the pilot project area. During the pilot project in California, certain lands, spotted owl habitat areas, and protected activity centers are deferred from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 directs that no resource management activities, road building, or timber harvesting shall be conducted on designated Federal lands within specific forests. Riparian protection measures are also included. During the pilot project in California, certain lands in the Tahoe National Forest are designated as \"Off Base\" or \"Deferred\" for resource management activities and timber harvesting. Riparian protection guidelines from a Forest Service research document dated March 1993 apply to all activities in the pilot project area. Compliance with these guidelines is required for all resource management activities. During the pilot project in California, resource management activities on Federal lands must comply with guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl. This includes fuelbreak construction using various vegetation management methods. During the pilot project in California, fuelbreak construction will be conducted on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year using thinning and other vegetation management methods. Group selection and individual tree selection will be used to achieve fire resilient forests. During the pilot project in California, fuelbreak construction will be conducted on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year using thinning and other vegetation management methods. Individual tree selection may also be utilized within the pilot project area, with a total acreage limit of 70,000 acres each year. Riparian management, including wide protection zones and restoration projects, will be implemented. The Secretary will prioritize cost-effective means for resource management activities and use funds provided by the Forest Service. During the pilot project in California, the Secretary will use allocated funds for resource management activities according to the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal and excess funds for the administration of specific national forests. The Secretary is prohibited from using funds designated for other units of the National Forest System. Forest supervisors have flexibility to allocate and use excess funds during the pilot project. During the pilot project in California, forest supervisors of Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest can allocate excess funds for resource management activities. The Secretary or forest supervisors cannot use funds if it hinders other multiple use activities. Overhead costs are limited to 12%, with 88% allocated for required activities. During the pilot project in California, forest supervisors can allocate excess funds for resource management activities. Overhead costs are limited to 12%, with 88% allocated for required activities. Authorized supplemental funds are available as necessary, and baseline funds must include existing funding levels for resource management activities. The pilot project will run from the enactment of the Act until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for specified forests or five years after the project's commencement. The Forest Service will revise land and resource management plans for Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest within five years of the pilot project's start. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required, and private contracts may be used for project implementation. The Regional Forester for Region 5 will initiate the process to amend the plans within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The pilot project must incorporate designated areas, resource management activities, and aspects of the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal. Changes will be made based on environmental analyses and applicable laws. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress on the project's status, including fund usage details. The annual report to Congress must include a complete accounting of fund usage, a schedule of amounts drawn from each account, total acres treated for resource management activities, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues generated. The annual report to Congress includes details on economic benefits to local communities, revenue comparisons for resource management activities, a schedule for activities, and any adverse environmental impacts. Federal funds for each report are limited to $50,000. The final report for the pilot project will assess its effectiveness in meeting goals, including watershed monitoring, analysis of environmental impacts, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. The pilot project's final report will assess effectiveness in meeting goals, including environmental impacts analysis, consultation with the Quincy Library Group, and submission to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002. The project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
