    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options. Congress has added titles and amended TSCA, but the core program remains unchanged. Bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate. Since the enactment of TSCA in 1976, there has been ongoing debate on amending the chemical evaluation process and regulatory criteria. Proponents argue that the current framework is not sufficiently protective, as only a few chemicals have been evaluated and regulated. States have enacted their own statutes to address chemical concerns not covered by EPA, leading to potential inconsistencies in regulations. Manufacturers and processors have raised concerns about compliance with varying state regulations. States have enacted statutes to address specific chemical concerns not covered by EPA under TSCA, leading to potential inconsistencies in regulations. Manufacturers argue that compliance with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient. Proponents of state regulations argue that states should be allowed to lead in trying alternative approaches to protect their citizens. Non-governmental programs, like voluntary labeling, have also emerged as alternative regulatory approaches. This report tracks legislative status in the 114th Congress for bills amending Title I of TSCA. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate EPW held hearings and marked up amendments for S. 697, which was reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce also announced a discussion draft for amending Title I of TSCA. On June 18, 2015, Senate EPW filed the report for S. 697. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce introduced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015. The subcommittee held a hearing and ordered the revised draft to be forwarded to the full committee for consideration. H.R. 2576, based on the House discussion draft, was introduced on May 26, 2015. The bill was approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 3, 2015, and passed by the House on June 23, 2015. On June 3, 2015, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce approved the bill H.R. 2576 with technical amendments on a 47-0 vote. The House passed the bill on June 23, 2015, with a 398-1 vote. Key debated issues include prioritizing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting substances, EPA's options for regulation, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, disclosure protection, and EPA resources for administering the act. Comparisons are made among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues related to prioritizing chemical substances for risk evaluation, regulatory criteria for restricting substances, EPA's options for regulation, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, and EPA resources for administering the act. EPA has discretion in evaluating chemical substances for risks, including those on the initial inventory reported to EPA and those reported in premanufacture notices. Over 83,000 chemical substances may be evaluated, with EPA identifying more than 1,200 substances for possible evaluation in 2012. In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for evaluation based on prioritization criteria, leading to 90 substances prioritized for risk evaluation. EPA has assessed five of these chemicals, with three found to present risks. Section 5 of TSCA requires manufacturers to submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing a new chemical, allowing EPA to evaluate risks and determine regulation. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. The EPA has received thousands of PMNs and exemption applications since 1979. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 propose different methods for prioritizing and evaluating chemical substances for risks. The bills aim to assess active and inactive substances, conduct safety evaluations, and take regulatory actions based on the results. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 propose prioritizing and evaluating chemical substances for risks, including active and inactive substances. Manufacturers can request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee. EPA would evaluate risks and take regulatory actions based on the results, with varying deadlines for completion. S. 697 and S. 725 propose prioritizing and evaluating chemical substances with varying deadlines for regulatory actions. EPA must designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessments within five years. S. 725 has similar procedures but with tighter deadlines and differing conditions. H.R. 2576 requires risk evaluations to be published within three years after a manufacturer's request or EPA's evaluation. H.R. 2576 sets tighter deadlines for risk evaluations compared to S. 697 and S. 725. It requires EPA to initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year and does not limit manufacturer requests, as long as they pay for the evaluation. H.R. 2576 does not amend TSCA Section 5 for new chemicals, leaving the current evaluation process in place. The Senate bills require EPA to evaluate risks of new chemicals within 90 days of receiving a PMN. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it will undergo the same safety assessment procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA standard for regulation is based on whether a chemical poses an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. The TSCA regulatory threshold for chemical substances is based on whether they present an unreasonable risk of harm to human health or the environment. There is debate on clarifying the criteria for determining regulatory control, as the current standard is subject to interpretation and not defined in statute. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard has been interpreted as a multi-factor balancing test by the circuit court. The Fifth Circuit interpreted TSCA's \"unreasonable risk\" standard as a multi-factor balancing test in the influential 1991 decision, Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA. The court emphasized the need to consider costs and carry out actions in a reasonable and prudent manner, balancing environmental, economic, and social impacts. The court ruled that EPA had ignored the cost side of the equation in an asbestos ban, deeming it unreasonable to spend $200-$300 million to save approximately seven lives over thirteen years. This highlights the importance of considering costs and benefits in determining whether regulation of a substance is warranted under the current TSCA standard. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" that uses the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA and adds some qualifiers. It would establish the regulatory threshold based on whether the \"conditions of use\" of a chemical substance would attain the safety standard and explicitly include \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" among the general population with respect to an evaluation of risks. Additionally, it would prohibit the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors\" in evaluating risks. S. 697 and S. 725 define a \"safety standard\" for evaluating chemical risks, with S. 697 prohibiting the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors.\" In contrast, H.R. 2576 does not define a \"safety standard\" but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process. H.R. 2576 adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process to determine risks, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting the consideration of costs or non-risk factors. This contrasts with S. 697 and S. 725, which define a safety standard for evaluating chemical risks and prohibit the consideration of cost and non-risk factors. Section 6 of TSCA directs EPA to promulgate regulations to protect against unreasonable risks using the least burdensome requirement, considering costs and alternatives. The \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. In Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, the Fifth Circuit found EPA's total ban on asbestos uses not the least burdensome adequate alternative. The \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond cost-benefit analysis. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 would eliminate the requirement for EPA to choose the least burdensome regulatory option for chemical substances. Instead, they would direct EPA to choose a regulatory option that is \"necessary\" for meeting safety standards, considering costs and alternative regulations. H.R. 2576 would also require EPA to consider risks to potentially exposed subpopulations when promulgating restrictions. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to promulgate rules that adequately protect against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations. It would also amend factors for considering restrictions on chemical substances and require rules to be \"cost-effective.\" All three bills allow EPA to exempt certain chemical uses under specific circumstances, such as national security concerns or lack of feasible alternatives. H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of chemical substances if deemed necessary for national security or economic reasons. EPA can renew exemptions every five years based on risk evaluations and scientific data collected through reporting requirements under TSCA Section 8. Section 8 of TSCA allows EPA to require reporting and record keeping of existing information on chemicals by manufacturers, processors, and distributors. Section 4 mandates testing if risks are unknown, based on threshold findings of unreasonable risks or substantial production with environmental or human exposure. EPA has required testing for over 200 chemicals, but limits on its authority under TSCA have hindered risk assessment efforts. The limits on EPA's authority under TSCA have hindered risk assessment efforts by limiting the agency's ability to require the development of new information on chemicals. EPA faces challenges in determining whether a chemical substance poses an unreasonable risk, leading to delays and costs for those required to provide information. Proposed Senate bills would give EPA discretion to require testing, while H.R. 2576 would still require specific findings for testing under TSCA Section 4. H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to require testing if necessary for risk evaluation under TSCA Section 6, in addition to specific findings under Section 4. All three bills allow EPA to mandate new information through rules, orders, or consent agreements, with a focus on minimizing animal testing. The issue of TSCA preemption in relation to state chemical regulations remains a key discussion point at the federal level. Under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress can preempt state laws with its enumerated powers. The current TSCA preemption allows EPA to manage chemicals while giving states some flexibility to set their own requirements. States can enforce federal requirements that are identical to their own laws and regulate disposal, among other exceptions to preemption. S. 697 would amend TSCA preemption, allowing states to co-enforce federal requirements and regulate disposal. Advocates argue for a uniform national framework to reduce compliance costs, while opponents believe states should have the flexibility to implement more stringent regulations to protect their citizens. S. 697 would amend TSCA preemption, allowing states to enforce federal requirements and regulate disposal. It would modify the state-federal relationship in chemical management, prohibiting states from restricting chemicals already deemed safe by EPA. States would also be restricted from imposing new regulations on high priority chemicals listed by EPA. S. 697 would amend TSCA preemption, prohibiting states from imposing new regulations on high priority chemicals listed by EPA if they fall within EPA's safety assessment scope. Preemption exceptions would be retained, but states would be prohibited from enforcing duplicative or more stringent penalties. S. 697 would refine TSCA preemption by adding new provisions to prohibit states from imposing duplicative or more stringent penalties. Exceptions to preemption would allow states to enforce certain requirements under state environmental laws. Waivers could be granted based on peer-reviewed science, with EPA required to make a decision within 90 days. H.R. 2576 would make changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to impose different regulations for chemicals. It would preempt state laws only if EPA determined a chemical did not pose an unreasonable risk. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals based on EPA risk management actions. It would align preemption with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6 and allow states to enforce identical requirements with penalties. Certain past actions and state laws in effect since 2003 would not be preempted. The bill also includes savings clauses for common law causes of action in civil actions. The three bills aim to add savings clauses for common law causes of action in civil actions under TSCA. They also address the balance between public access to chemical information and protection of confidential data. TSCA prohibits disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information, with penalties for wrongful disclosure. Under TSCA, disclosure of confidential business information (CBI) is prohibited, with exceptions for health and safety studies. EPA can disclose CBI if necessary to protect health or the environment. Submitters can designate information as CBI for protection. The EPA must notify information submitters before disclosing protected information. Submitters can designate information as confidential without needing to provide proof. CBI protection can last indefinitely unless EPA determines otherwise. EPA has been reviewing confidentiality claims more closely since 2010, including chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has also encouraged industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and increase public access to non-confidential information. The proposed bills would maintain TSCA's framework for protecting information but would allow EPA to disclose CBI in more situations. The three proposals aim to expand EPA's authority to disclose confidential business information (CBI) in certain circumstances, such as responding to requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, environmental releases, or healthcare professionals for patient diagnoses. The Senate bills propose more detailed procedural requirements and review processes for information submitters compared to H.R. 2576. They also outline categories of information presumed protected from disclosure, including specific chemical identities before commercial distribution, while information on chemicals under a ban or phase-out rule would not be protected. In contrast, H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting chemical identities in health and safety. The three proposals aim to expand EPA's authority to disclose confidential business information (CBI) in certain circumstances. H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting chemical identities in health and safety studies, requiring submitters to substantiate confidentiality claims every 10 years. Congress is considering funding EPA's activities under TSCA through discretionary appropriations or establishing dedicated funding sources. Under TSCA, EPA's funding is authorized through annual appropriations or dedicated funding sources. Section 26(b) allows EPA to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors, with a maximum fee of $2,500 for certain actions. Small businesses have a fee cap of $100. EPA can collect fees for costs within these limits. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under Section 29 of TSCA, while H.R. 2576 would not amend Section 29. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under Section 26(b) of TSCA to varying degrees, allowing fees to accompany submissions of information to EPA regarding chemicals. Fees collected under TSCA are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, subject to annual appropriations. Section 29 of TSCA would be revised by all three bills to allow the collection of fees for submitting information to EPA for chemical evaluation. S. 697 would set fees to provide sustainable funding, capped at $18 million, with receipts deposited in a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions. The bills H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 propose to authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for evaluating chemical submissions. The fees would be used to cover costs without a fiscal year limitation, deposited in a dedicated fund, and set at a level necessary for administering TSCA. S. 725, similar to S. 697 and H.R. 2576, aims to remove the statutory limit on EPA fees for chemical submissions under TSCA. Fees collected would go to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for discretionary appropriations, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office."
