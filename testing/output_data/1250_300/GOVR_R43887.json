    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older, including nutrition services, caregiver support, employment programs, and abuse prevention. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Funding for different titles comes from either HHS or the Department of Labor. The Older Americans Act (OAA) provides social services for individuals aged 60 and older through seven titles. Funding for OAA Titles II, III, IV, VI, and VII comes from annual HHS appropriations, while Title V funding is provided in the annual DOL appropriations. Congress has reauthorized and amended the act multiple times, with the last reauthorization in 2006. Despite the expiration of authorizations of appropriations in FY2011, Congress continues to appropriate funding for OAA programs. This report discusses OAA funding, including an overview of FY2015 funding, a breakdown of current-year funding, funding history since FY2001, legislative activity in FY2015, and funding decisions for selected programs. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding. Appendices provide detailed funding information and history. In FY2015, OAA programs were funded at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest share of funding, with 70.7% allocated to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V received 23.1% of funding, while the remaining funds were distributed among Titles II, IV, VI, and VII. Two exceptions to the consistent funding levels were Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities under Title IV, which received new funding for supportive services for Holocaust survivors and an Elder Justice Initiative, respectively. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, and remained relatively flat through FY2006. Annual increases in OAA program funding occurred from FY2006 to FY2010, with funding levels remaining below the FY2010 level since then. OAA funding increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, an overall increase of 31% over this time period. Additional funding was provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs declined from FY2011 to FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was slightly below the FY2012 level. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure. The FY2015 appropriations law reflected the new consolidated ACL account structure, with funding for OAA Title II \"Program Administration\" now including aging and disability services programs administered by ACL. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for OAA programs was provided through three continuing resolutions, maintaining funding levels similar to FY2014. The FY2015 appropriations law funded discretionary Labor-HHS-Education programs at the same rate as FY2014, with a slight reduction. The House did not markup a bill, but a proposed bill would have increased funding for OAA programs. The Senate subcommittee approved an appropriations bill for FY2015. The Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill on June 10, 2014, funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels. The bill proposed increases in family caregiver funding and decreases in funding for the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, slightly less than FY2014 levels. President Obama's FY2015 budget request proposed $1.819 billion for OAA programs, with some programs receiving new funding such as $20.0 million for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, $380.0 million for the CSEOA Program, $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and $3.0 million for the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, $25.0 million was requested for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" and the administration of the CSEOA program was proposed to be transferred from DOL to ACL. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. Variations in funding for selected OAA programs and issues were highlighted among different budget requests and final funding enacted under P.L. 113-235. This includes funding for CSEOA, support for Holocaust survivors, ADRCs, and the White House Conference on Aging. The CSEOA program aims to provide part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The budget request suggested transferring program administration to ACL for participant benefits. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% compared to FY2014. The transfer aimed to integrate CSEOA with other aging services programs under ACL to help older Americans maintain independence and active participation in communities. This transfer would streamline operations and align Federal oversight of the OAA under one department, pending congressional authorization. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, aiming to integrate CSEOA with other aging services programs under ACL. This transfer would streamline operations and align Federal oversight of the OAA under one department, pending congressional authorization. The CSEOA program did not align well with the Workforce Investment Act framework as older workers are focused on increasing income and contributing to the community. The program remained funded and administered under DOL for FY2015 with no changes in funding. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the US, with 25% living in poverty. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund. In FY2015, the President proposed $5.0 million for a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund to support 130,000 survivors in the US, with 25% living in poverty. The Senate and H.R. 5464 did not specify funding for this fund due to budget constraints. However, $2.5 million in new discretionary funding was allocated to provide supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers aim to provide information and counseling on long-term services and supports. The Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) serve as single entry points for information on long-term services and supports, offering counseling, access to public programs, discharge planning, and care transition services. With over 500 sites nationwide, ADRCs had 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. They received $10 million in mandatory funding under the ACA from FY2010 to FY2014, in addition to discretionary funding. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding but $20.0 million annually for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding for ADRCs but $20.0 million annually for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The Senate bill would have provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs and urged ACL to improve coordination among ADRCs, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), and Centers for Independent Living (CILs). Final FY2015-enacted funding provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding to ADRCs, the same as the FY2014 amount, but did not fulfill the President's budget request for additional mandatory funding. H.R. 5464 did not specify a dollar amount for ADRCs, providing $6.1 million in discretionary funding for FY2015, the same as FY2014. The President's budget requested additional mandatory funding, but it was not fulfilled. White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused on older individuals' concerns and provided guidance to policymakers. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a conference, but the Senate bill did not allocate dedicated funding, suggesting support from existing resources. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 did not receive dedicated funding from the Senate bill or H.R. 5464. The conference will be held in Washington, DC, with a focus on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. The event will commemorate the 80th anniversary of Social Security and the 50th anniversary of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act. The conference organizers plan to use technology to engage more people than in previous years. The White House Conference on Aging in 2015 will focus on retirement security, healthy aging, long-term services and supports, and elder justice. Regional forums and listening sessions will be held to gather input for the conference. For more information, visit http://www.whitehouseconferenceonaging.gov. Appendices provide details on authorizations of appropriations and funding history for Older Americans Act programs from FY2006 to FY2015."
