BOX DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENT PERIOD FOR MINIMUM PAYMENTS ON CREDIT CARD BALANCE. Section 127(b) of the Truth in Lending Act is amended to include new requirements for minimum payment terms on credit card balances. This includes clear and conspicuous repayment information in a tabular format, showing the required minimum monthly payment as a dollar figure and percentage of the outstanding balance, along with the estimated number of months to pay off the balance by making only minimum payments. The Truth in Lending Act now includes new requirements for minimum payment terms on credit card balances. Consumers must pay the required minimum monthly payments and refrain from making further advances or extensions of credit to maintain the balance. Creditors must apply the applicable annual percentage rate of interest in effect on the date of disclosure, considering different rates for various outstanding balance portions. The Truth in Lending Act requires creditors to apply the applicable annual percentage rate of interest to different outstanding balance portions, including temporary or introductory rates that may change based on an index or formula.

Interest rate changes due to other indexed rates must be notified 60 days in advance, while other rate changes require a 30-day notice. No fees can be imposed on the account before the end of a 30-day period. \"No fees, including annual, late payment, or over-the-limit fees, can be imposed on a credit card account before the end of a 30-day period from the date the obligor receives a specific notice. The notice must be sent separately from any statement or other notice, without advertising, and include an explanation of how, when, and why a fee will be imposed.\" The notice pursuant to paragraph (2) must explain the imposition of a fee, including options for addressing it and preventing future fees."
