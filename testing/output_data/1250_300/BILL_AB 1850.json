    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, which aims to educate the public about the exclusion and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) concluded that the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II was not justified by military necessity but driven by race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, acknowledging the grave personal injustice done to American citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II, apologizing for the violation of their civil liberties and constitutional rights. The actions were driven by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership, resulting in significant human suffering. Appropriate compensation has not been made for the damages suffered.
