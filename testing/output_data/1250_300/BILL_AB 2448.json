    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11320.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to outline the employment-related activities required of aid recipients, including orientation, job search, family stabilization, education programs, and support services for substance abuse, mental health, or domestic violence. The recipient will be referred to assessment if employment is not found or job search is not likely to lead to employment. A welfare-to-work plan will be developed specifying work activities and supportive services. The welfare-to-work plan developed by the county welfare department and the participant shall include work activities such as unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, and subsidized public sector employment. The welfare-to-work plan includes various work activities such as unsubsidized employment, subsidized private sector employment, subsidized public sector employment, work experience, on-the-job training, and unpaid work experience limited to 12 months. Grant-based on-the-job training allows for cash grants or aid grant savings to be diverted to the employer as a wage subsidy, as long as it does not exceed the family's maximum aid payment. Participants must voluntarily agree to participate and will receive information on job termination, Earned Income Tax Credit, and increased CalFresh benefits. The federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and increased CalFresh benefits can be obtained to increase earned income. Grant-based on-the-job training includes community service positions. Wages funded by cash grant diversion are not exempt from income calculation. Supported work or transitional employment includes grant-based on-the-job training where the recipient's cash grant is diverted to an intermediary service provider to offset wages. Other options include workstudy, self-employment, community service, adult basic education, job skills training, and vocational education and training. The curr_chunk discusses various services and activities aimed at assisting individuals in obtaining unsubsidized employment, including job skills training, vocational education, job search assistance, education related to employment, mental health and substance abuse services, and other necessary activities. The amended Welfare and Institutions Code requires applicants or recipients to participate in welfare-to-work activities, including education needed for employment. Participation is limited to 24 cumulative months, with exemptions and activities tailored to individual welfare-to-work plans. Meeting requirements in Section 11322.8 exempts a month from the 24-month limit. After 24 months of welfare-to-work activities, aided adults must engage in various activities like unsubsidized employment, job search assistance, vocational training, and community service. Months meeting specific requirements do not count towards the 24-month limit. The welfare-to-work program includes on-the-job training, job search assistance, vocational training, community service, job skills training, and education related to employment. Certain conditions exempt months from counting towards the 24-month participation limit. The recipient may be excused from welfare-to-work program participation for various reasons, such as job search, assessment, appraisal, welfare-to-work plan development, no longer receiving aid, good cause exemption, or family stabilization participation for up to six months. The recipient may be excused from welfare-to-work program participation for reasons such as job search, assessment, appraisal, plan development, no longer receiving aid, good cause exemption, or family stabilization participation for up to six months. County welfare departments must provide written notice of the 24-month time limitation and process for claiming exemptions or extensions. The notice for aid recipients includes the remaining months of eligibility, requirements to meet, dispute process for the 24-month limit, welfare-to-work plan modification, and exemption opportunities. The recipient can modify their welfare-to-work plan and request an exemption or extension for the 24-month time limit. The department will convene a workgroup to determine the noticing and engagement requirements, with recommendations for refining procedures and due process. The workgroup will make recommendations to refine procedures and due process requirements for individuals in the welfare-to-work plan. An assistance unit with an eligible adult can continue in the plan for up to 24 months starting January 1, 2013, unless they exceed the 48-month time limit. Months of assistance before January 1, 2013, do not count towards the 24-month limit. Section 11325.3 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 11325.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows recipients without a high school diploma to participate in a high school equivalency program. Participation is optional, and recipients are not required to undergo an assessment before joining the program."
