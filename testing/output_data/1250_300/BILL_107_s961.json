    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Breast Implant Research and Information Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The findings section highlights the lack of a patient registry for breast implant recipients, estimates the number of women who have received breast implants, reports adverse reactions to silicone and saline-filled implants, emphasizes the need for complete information on health risks, and notes that silicone breast implants have never been approved. Silicone breast implants were never approved by the FDA; saline implants were approved in 2000 despite high complication rates. After three years, many patients experienced local complications and required additional surgeries. In 1998, a criminal investigation was opened due to allegations of research data manipulation by a breast implant manufacturer. A criminal investigation was opened in 1998 due to allegations of research data manipulation by a breast implant manufacturer. Despite high complication rates, saline breast implants were approved by the FDA in 2000. Studies found that many women required additional surgeries within 5 years of receiving implants, and after 10 to 15 years, almost 70 percent had at least one ruptured implant. The FDA researchers found that 21 percent of women had silicone migrating away from breast implants, with unknown implications for disease development. A 1993 study showed a significant incidence of anticollagen antibodies in women with implants, suggesting serious implications. The Institute of Medicine's 1999 study highlighted local complications as the primary safety concern with silicone breast implants. Silicone breast implants raise safety concerns due to potential complications such as silicone migration leading to severe inflammation and pathologic responses. Studies have shown higher rates of cancer among breast implant recipients, indicating the need for more research on the long-term effects of these implants. Silicone breast implants can lead to complications like silicone migration, causing pathologic responses. Studies suggest that implants can hinder accurate mammograms, delaying breast cancer detection. Additionally, there are concerns about the negative impact of implants on breastfeeding, as silicone may pass into breast milk with unknown effects on infants. The purpose of this Act is to promote research on the health effects of breast implants and ensure accurate information for women. It also aims to address concerns about silicone migration into breast milk and potential impacts on infants. The Act aims to expand and intensify research on silicone breast implants at the National Institutes of Health. The Director of NIH must provide a report on existing research within 90 days. Additionally, an amendment to the Public Health Service Act includes a new section on breast implant research. The Director of NIH appoints a coordinator for breast implant research, involving various Institutes. Study sections are established to review grant applications for appropriate design. The Director of NIH establishes study sections to review breast implant research grant applications for appropriate design and quality. Additionally, the Director conducts research to understand the health implications of saline and silicone breast implants, focusing on local complications like capsular contracture. A study is needed to differentiate between women receiving breast implants for mastectomy, reconstructive, or cosmetic purposes, focusing on local complications such as capsular contracture, leakage, and rupture. The study should also evaluate atypical symptoms, silicone migration, neurological dysfunction, and immune system irregularities, comparing the health of these women with suitable controls. The Director of NIH is required to annually report the results of this study to Congress. The FDA will intensify postmarket research on saline breast implants based on recommendations from their panel. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will report to Congress on the implementation status of these recommendations at regular intervals. Additionally, activities regarding silicone breast implants will be expanded and intensified at the FDA. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will expedite the conclusion of a criminal investigation into wrongdoing by a silicone breast implant manufacturer, update consumer information materials, and require manufacturers to regularly update package inserts with accurate information on implant complications. To ensure accurate information, manufacturers of silicone breast implants conducting clinical studies must update package inserts and informed consent documents regularly. Clinical investigators must provide patients with FDA's breast implant booklet and inform them about obtaining a Medwatch form. Patients must receive informed consent documents at the initial consultation. Appoint a special ad hoc patient information panel to review breast implant information and advertisements for accuracy. Panel members include breast implant recipients, bioethicists, rheumatologists, and oncologists with experience in clinical care and research."
