This practice has expanded from manufacturing to service providers, raising concerns about job loss and unemployment. The impact of offshore outsourcing on the labor market remains uncertain, with some attributing it to the \"jobless recovery\" after the 2001 recession. The labor market implications of offshore outsourcing remain unclear, with some attributing job loss to offshoring after the 2001 recession. Estimates suggest offshoring may have accounted for 3% of net job loss in the early 2000s. While some believe offshoring is contributing to the slow labor market rebound from the 2007-2009 recession, economists argue that it benefits the nation by enabling firms to sell higher quality products at lower prices. Many economists believe that offshoring benefits the nation by allowing firms to offer a greater variety of higher quality products at lower prices and expanding markets. However, some question if this applies to services offshoring. Companies engaging in offshoring of service activities may primarily benefit by increasing dividends, raising stock prices, and pursuing mergers rather than reinvesting in the U.S. economy. The movement of services jobs to other countries may have different implications for the labor market compared to production jobs. The offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about the impact on college graduates and the adequacy of existing job assistance programs. Congress aims to promote job growth and support workers affected by job losses due to economic shifts. Offshoring of service jobs raises concerns about job losses for workers, whether due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. Some policymakers support measures to encourage U.S. firms to expand employment domestically. The impact of offshore outsourcing on U.S. employment is examined in this report. The development of outsourcing by U.S. companies began in the 1970s and 1980s in response to competition from foreign corporations. This led to the overseas relocation of manufacturing work and the outsourcing of various activities to specialized domestic enterprises. The impact of offshore outsourcing on U.S. employment is analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. The outsourcing trend in the U.S. started in the 1970s and 1980s due to competition from foreign companies, leading to the relocation of manufacturing work and outsourcing to specialized domestic enterprises. This shift towards domestic outsourcing of in-house functions has become a permanent reorganization of work in the U.S. The 2001 recession further pushed U.S. employers to utilize technological innovations for efficiency, enabling offshoring of services beyond just goods production. The advancement in communications technology has allowed U.S. firms to offshore not only manufacturing jobs but also services like software development, credit card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis. This trend has been fueled by events like the Y2K crisis and the availability of well-educated individuals in low-wage foreign countries. The advancement in communications technology has enabled U.S. companies to offshore services like software development, credit card processing, and financial analysis to low-wage foreign nations with well-educated individuals. This has led to the fragmentation of tasks across borders, allowing firms to distribute intangible production tasks such as research, design, and IT support among various countries. This trend has been driven by the availability of skilled workers in countries like China, Eastern Europe, India, and the Philippines, where the number of individuals with IT and accounting skills exceeds local demand. English being the language of the computer industry globally has further facilitated the provision of IT services from non-English-speaking, low-wage countries. The extension of task fragmentation to service activities, such as research, design, management, and IT support, has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States. Technological change and deunionization have also played a role in wage polarization during the 1980s and 1990s. Data on job losses due to offshoring is limited, with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics only tracking layoffs at large firms since 2004. This data underestimates job losses at service providers and small companies. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks layoffs at large firms, underestimating job losses at service providers and small companies. In the third quarter of 2012, out of over 100,000 workers laid off, less than 1% had their jobs moved abroad. Forrester Research forecasts 3.4 million service-sector jobs may move overseas between 2003 and 2015. Forrester Research forecasted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015. This projection indicated a trend of employers increasingly transferring service activities overseas. Despite the large number, the annual average job loss of 300,000 was considered small compared to the typical job turnover in the United States. Researchers focused on identifying jobs susceptible to offshoring and estimated that around 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, representing 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could potentially be moved abroad. In the early years of services offshoring, Bardhan and Kroll estimated that over 14 million jobs in 49 service occupations, about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001, could be sent overseas. Vulnerable occupational groups include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, and technical writers, concentrated in industries like information, finance, and professional services. The study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas would be offshored between 2004 and 2015. Some metro areas like Boulder, Lowell, San Francisco, San Jose, and Stamford were expected to lose more jobs (between 3.1% and 4.3%). Metropolitan areas most vulnerable to offshoring tend to be populous with high concentrations of IT jobs, located in the Northeast and West regions. The study by Jensen and Kletzer estimated that about 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was in offshorable industries, with manufacturing and professional services industries being particularly vulnerable to offshoring. Manufacturing had over 12% of employment at risk, while professional services had almost 14%. They also developed a geographically based approach to identify metropolitan areas with high concentrations of IT jobs and IT-enabled back-office jobs. Jensen and Kletzer analyzed the vulnerability to offshoring in different industries, finding that manufacturing and professional services were particularly at risk. They ranked service occupations based on task content, with computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and other fields being highly offshorable. They also noted a positive correlation between educational attainment and offshorability in service occupations. In 2005, BLS found that service occupations with higher educational attainment were more vulnerable to offshoring. Out of 515 service occupations, 160 were estimated to be susceptible to offshoring, with computer and mathematical science occupations being particularly at risk. These offshorable occupations accounted for over one-fifth of total employment in 2007, growing slightly faster than overall service-providing employment. Wage growth was also higher in these offshorable occupations between 2001 and 2007. Offshored service-providing occupations saw slightly faster employment and wage growth from 2001-2007. However, the 33 most vulnerable occupations to offshoring experienced below-average growth. These occupations range from office and administrative support to professional and related fields. Blinder created an offshorability index for various occupations, estimating that a majority are non-offshorable. Blinder estimated that a majority of U.S. occupations (533) and employed persons (92.6 million in 2004) are non offshorable. However, he also identified about 200 U.S. occupations and almost 30 million workers as highly offshorable or offshorable. He believed that the percentage of potentially offshorable jobs was underestimated and included a moderate estimate of 25.6% and an aggressive estimate of 29.0% of all U.S. workers. Blinder noted that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs in terms of wages or education level. Blinder's research found that about 29.0% of all U.S. jobs, totaling almost 40 million workers, are potentially offshorable. He discovered that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs in terms of wages or education level. Blinder and Krueger used three survey methods to determine job vulnerability to offshoring, finding that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, especially in factory and administrative support occupations. Blinder and Krueger's analysis suggests that offshorability is prevalent in factory and administrative support occupations, as well as in industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Some believe fears about services offshoring are exaggerated, with only a fraction of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes being realized by 2006. Executives need to learn how to effectively use offshore talent to boost productivity, as rising global salaries may diminish cost gains from offshore outsourcing. Deloitte Consulting predicts that outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail,\" with companies carefully defining core functions to retain control and knowledge in-house. In the future, companies will not outsource as it is no longer seen as a \"holy grail.\" Organizations will define core functions to retain control and knowledge in-house. Some will outsource short-term, while others will engage in re-insourcing, bringing back operations to the United States. This trend is evident in various industries such as IT services, call centers, legal support, and manufacturing. Reshoring has contributed to the sector's employment rebound post-recession. Perry found that about one-fifth of U.S. manufacturers brought production back from overseas in 2011 due to China's shrinking wage advantages and rising shipping costs. Examples include Caterpillar, National Cash Register, and Wham-O. Despite concerns post-9/11, some industries like IT services continued outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas. Despite fears about security post-9/11, U.S. airline carriers have increased outsourcing maintenance jobs overseas to countries like Singapore and Brazil. Concerns have also arisen over unrest in regions like India and the Middle East. Global software service providers are placing work in various countries, including Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer moving work to Canada due to fewer cultural differences. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. Comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore locations is lacking. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations like India, low wages in countries such as Vietnam continue to attract U.S. jobs. Comprehensive data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is lacking, with empirical analyses focusing on jobs susceptible to movement beyond U.S. borders. This approach may overstate job losses as it does not consider all factors influencing employers' decisions on work location."
