    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States with laws expanding gun rights for self-defense have seen a decrease in firearm-related crime. Currently, federal regulations restrict firearm possession in National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, hindering individuals from exercising their Second Amendment rights. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of an individual in a unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict any individual from possessing or carrying a firearm or ammunition in these units based on their location. Federal law should clarify that second amendment rights in National Park System or National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed. No Federal regulation shall restrict possession or carrying of firearms or ammunition in these units based on location. The purpose of this section is to require hunting activities as a land use in all Federal land management plans unless clearly incompatible. The head of the agency must ensure hunting is allowed unless incompatible with the land's purposes, and reasons for any restrictions must be published in the management plan. Hunting activities on Federal land are restricted, with fees charged related to hunting activities limited to offset management costs. The definition of hunting includes hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing. The Act defines hunting to include hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing on Federal land. It also specifies that the term \"management plan\" encompasses various plans for the management or use of Federal land. This section applies to all management plans developed, approved, or amended after the enactment of this Act."
