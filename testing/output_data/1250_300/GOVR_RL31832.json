    "content": "Legislation to rewrite and reauthorize the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA) may be considered in the 111th Congress. The EAA provides authority for export controls on sensitive dual-use goods and technologies with civilian and military applications. The EAA has been periodically reauthorized since its original expiration in 1989, with the last extension expiring in August 2001. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the EAA. The Export Administration Act (EAA) provides authority for export controls on dual-use goods and technologies. The regulations are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the Department of Commerce. The EAA focuses on regulating exports of civilian goods with military applications, based on strategic relationships and threats to national security. There is a debate between liberalizing export regulations for U.S. companies to compete internationally and maintaining controls for national security reasons. The Export Administration Act allows for export controls on dual-use goods and technologies, administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security. There is a debate between liberalizing export regulations for U.S. companies and maintaining controls for national security reasons. The report discusses the evolution of the Act, types of controls authorized, export licensing procedures, and issues regarding export controls under IEEPA. It also highlights controlled commodities and debates on technology controllability, multilateral control regimes, organization of the export control system, and the impact of export controls on the U.S. The Export Control Act of 1949 formalized the need for an extensive peacetime export control system to address security threats. It identified reasons for imposing export controls, including preventing the export of scarce goods, promoting U.S. foreign policy, and addressing issues of regional stability and human rights. The Export Control Act of 1949 established controls to prevent the export of goods that could harm U.S. industry and national security. These controls were used to promote U.S. foreign policy, address issues like regional stability and human rights, and restrict the transfer of critical technology to countries posing a threat. A multilateral control regime, including the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom), was established to manage technology transfers to NATO allies. The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) was established in 1949 to manage technology transfers to NATO allies. The Export Control Act was renewed multiple times with high restrictions until the U.S.-Soviet era of \"detente\" in the late 1960s led to a reexamination and revision of the export control system. The Export Administration Act of 1969 replaced the near-embargo characteristic of the Export Control Act of 1949, leading to a shift towards less restrictive export controls. The act was comprehensively rewritten in 1979 and forms the basis of the export control system today. The Export Control Act of 1949 was renewed in 1974 and 1977 with less restrictive export controls. It was comprehensively rewritten in 1979 and amended in 1985. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 led to changes in the export control system. The export control system has been reduced in scope since the George H.W. Bush Administration. There are calls to revamp the act for various reasons. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 also significantly changed the export control environment. The dissolution of CoCom in 1994 and its replacement by the Wassenaar Arrangement in 1997 significantly changed the export control environment. The new multilateral arrangement is more loosely structured, raising questions about the effectiveness of U.S. export controls in achieving national security objectives. Congress has struggled to reform the Export Administration Act, leading to temporary extensions and reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Operating under IEEPA is seen as imposing constraints on the administration of the export control process. Legislation passed in 2000 extended the Export Administration Act until 2001, temporarily removing the need to operate under IEEPA powers. However, export control authority has since been operating under IEEPA provisions again. Efforts to rewrite the Export Administration Act have been ongoing in Congress, with the House passing the Omnibus Export Administration Act in 1996. In 1996, export control legislation (H.R. 1942) was introduced in the 105th Congress, but no action was taken. In the 106th Congress, the Export Administration Act of 1999 (S. 1712) was introduced by Senator Michael P. Enzi. However, action by the Senate on S. 1712 was not taken due to concerns about national security. Export control legislation was again introduced in the 107th Congress in the form of the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149). Senator Enzi introduced the Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149) in March 2001, which was favorably reported by the Senate. The legislation passed in September 2001 with three amendments. The House version, H.R. 2581, was introduced by Representative Benjamin Gilman in July 2001 and included provisions related to oversight of nuclear transfers to North Korea. The House International Relations Committee passed the bill with 35 amendments in August 2001. The House International Relations Committee passed H.R. 2581 with 35 amendments. The House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence received the legislation through sequential referral. In the 108th Congress, Representative Dreier introduced EAA legislation (H.R. 55), identical to S. 149, but no action was taken on it. The National Defense Authorization Act has been used periodically to attempt to amend the export control regime. The House NDAA report (H.Rept. 108-491) included provisions related to dual-use export controls, requiring licenses for certain technologies and items to destinations that had previously exported to China, with conditions on transfer assurances. Concerns were raised about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China due to possible repeals of military embargoes. The House NDAA report (H.Rept. 108-491) expressed concerns about potential transfer of U.S. goods or technology to China due to possible repeals of military embargoes. A bill to revise the Export Administration Act was introduced in the 109th Congress but did not receive consideration. The EAA was extended for two years, with authorization of appropriations for export control activities. No comprehensive legislation to rewrite or reauthorize the EAA was introduced in the 110th Congress. Various bills were introduced to amend enforcement and penalty structures, integrate export control information into electronic filing, and target countries of diversion concern. Only S. 3445/H.R. 7112 was acted upon in the 110th Congress, with H.R. 7112 passing in the House under suspension of the rules. In the 110th Congress, S. 3445 was reported out of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee but did not receive floor consideration. H.R. 7112 was introduced and passed in the House under suspension of the rules. Representative Sherman introduced the Export Control Improvements Act (H.R. 3515) with provisions on export controls enforcement, integration of export control data in the AES, and diversion control. The legislation grants additional enforcement authority for the Export Administration Regulations during the lapse of the EAA under the IEEPA. The draft legislation proposed in H.R. 3515 grants investigative authority to departments and agencies under the EAR for conducting investigations in the US and abroad. It allows for search, detention, and seizure of goods by Commerce within the US and at ports of entry or exit. The bill also includes provisions for publishing best practices guidelines for export control compliance programs, confidentiality provisions, and new language governing the use of funds for undercover investigations and operations. Title 1 of H.R. 3515 aims to streamline licensing requirements and data collection rules for exporters and shippers through the Automated Export System. The legislation focuses on integrating export control data into the AES to prevent improper shipments and address evasion of U.S. export controls through transhipment hubs. The BIS proposed the creation of a 'Country Category C' to address diversion concerns to Iran, but no country was designated. H.R. 3515 would legislate the concept, requiring the President to identify countries of concern for transhipment, reexportation, or diversion to Iran within 180 days. The bill aims to address diversion concerns to Iran by designating countries as possible diversion concerns or diversion concerns. If a country does not cooperate within 12 months, it will be designated as a Destination of Diversion Concern. Countries of diversion concern will face additional licensing requirements and increased scrutiny. Additionally, the legislation mandates an annual report on transfers of dual-use U.S. technology to concerning countries and entities. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009. President Obama initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009, focusing on transfers of significant dual-use U.S. technology to countries and entities of concern. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates proposed a 4-pronged approach to reform the system, including creating a single export control licensing agency, adopting a unified control list, establishing a single integrated information technology system, and setting up a single enforcement coordination agency. The changes are planned to be implemented in three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. The administration's plan for export control reform includes creating a single database of sanctioned and denied parties, establishing a single enforcement coordination agency, and harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List in three phases. Phase I involves preparatory work to harmonize the lists and develop standardized licensing processes. Phase II implements a harmonized licensing system with two identically structured control lists, aiming to reduce license requirements significantly. Certain items would be moved from the munitions list to the dual-use list, requiring congressional notification. The administration's plan for export control reform includes creating a single database of sanctioned and denied parties, establishing a single enforcement coordination agency, and harmonizing the Commerce Control List with the U.S. Munitions List in three phases. Phase III would see the debut of a new export control system with a single licensing agency, merged control lists, and a Primary Enforcement Coordination Agency. Secretary Gates predicted the 3-phase plan will unfold over the next year, but many questions remain unanswered, especially regarding legislative actions required for some proposals. The 3-phase plan for export control reform includes merging control lists and establishing a new licensing agency. Legislative action may be needed for some proposals, such as changing the structure of control lists and agency organization. Key principles include national security, foreign policy controls, and licensing procedures. The plan aims to create a more streamlined and efficient export control system. The Export Administration Act (EAA) and efforts to renew it have common principles and concepts related to export controls. These provisions include types of controls authorized, licensing procedures, review process, and enforcement procedures. U.S. dual-use export controls have restricted items based on national security, foreign policy, and domestic economic impact since the 1949 Act. The Commerce Control List (CCL) controls items for national security and foreign policy reasons, with different standards for licensing to specific countries. The 1979 Act restricted exports that could enhance military capabilities of other countries, aiming to protect national security. The 1979 Act restricted the export of goods or technology that could enhance military capabilities of other countries, aiming to protect national security. National security control items fall under the National Security licensing requirement of the EAR, with licenses reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) to identify goods and technology controlled for national security purposes. The list of controlled countries is currently \"Country Group D-1\". Licenses are approved if the item is destined for civilian use or would not significantly contribute to the military potential of the destination country. The Secretary of Defense maintains the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) for national security control items, which are subject to foreign availability determinations. Items not covered by U.S. national security controls are controlled for foreign policy purposes. The Secretary, along with other agencies, continuously assesses the foreign availability status of items subject to export control for national security reasons under the 1979 Act. The Secretary, along with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies, determines if items subject to export control for national security reasons meet foreign availability status. A request for a determination can be made by a license applicant or the Secretary. If a determination is made, the item must be decontrolled, unless the President decides it would harm national security. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, gathers data for these determinations. The Office of Foreign Availability, now replaced by the Office of Technology Evaluation, is responsible for assessing foreign availability. The Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee (ETRAC) was created to involve university experts in determining technologies for export control. BIS conducted a review of the Commerce Control List (CCL) and plans to review 1/3 of it each year. In 2009, BIS lifted licensing requirements on thermal imaging cameras for 36 U.S. allied countries. The rule decontrolled low to mid-market night vision cameras for 36 U.S. allied countries, tightened export controls on higher-end thermal imaging cameras, and required exporters to report transactions to BIS. Concerns remain about the time taken to resolve the issue, with industry sources noting delays in BIS engagement and interagency agreements. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation but is not currently included in regulations. The concept of mass market status was proposed in EAA legislation introduced in the 106th and 107th Congress. It defines mass market status as applying to items produced in large volume or made available to multiple buyers. Criteria for determining mass market status include the item's distribution, conduciveness to commercial shipping, and usefulness without modification. This feature was controversial, with concerns about wholesale decontrol of sensitive items. The EAA authorizes export controls for promoting foreign policy objectives, complying with international obligations, and deterring terrorism. Foreign policy controls are currently in place for anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, and United Nations sanctions. The President has the authority to control exports to promote foreign policy objectives, comply with international obligations, and deter terrorism. Foreign policy controls cover anti-terrorism, regional stability, crime control, UN sanctions, unilateral embargoes, non-proliferation agreements, and restrictions on items like chemical and biological weapons. The EAA imposes limitations on foreign policy controls, requiring annual renewal, clear objectives reported to Congress, negotiations to remove foreign availability of controlled items, and compliance with international treaties. Licenses are needed for exporting certain items to countries supporting terrorism, excluding medicine and medical supplies. The Export Administration Act (EAA) allows the President to impose controls to comply with international obligations or treaties, including licensing for exports to countries supporting terrorism. Foreign policy controls exempt sales of essential items like medicine, food, and water resources. Catch-all controls require a license for any item if it may be used for proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list for monitoring purposes. The Export Administration Act (EAA) allows controls on exports for compliance with international obligations, including licensing for countries supporting terrorism. Catch-all controls require a license for any item if it may be used for proliferation activities. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains an end-user list for monitoring purposes and administers the license application process. In FY2008, BIS reviewed 21,213 applications totaling $72.1 billion in value. Short-supply controls remain for exports of crude oil, petroleum derivatives, unprocessed western red cedar, and the export of horses by sea. In the 107th Congress, short-supply control authority was not provided. The Bureau of Industry and Security reviewed 21,213 license applications in FY2008, totaling $72.1 billion. This included $50.2 billion in licenses for crude oil exports in exchange for refined petroleum. Dual-use technology licenses amounted to approximately $21.9 billion, representing 1.7% of total U.S. exports in FY2008. China received the largest number of controlled goods with 1,990 licenses approved worth $2.7 billion. Chemical manufacturing facilities and equipment had the highest number of approved license applications in FY2008, with 2,212 applications valued at $294 million. The Commerce Control List (CCL) was created under the 1979 EAA, containing items controlled for national security, foreign policy, and short-supply purposes. It includes ten categories such as nuclear materials, electronics, and marine equipment, each further divided into functional groups. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items for national security and foreign policy reasons. It includes categories like electronics, marine equipment, and propulsion systems, each with functional groups. Each item on the CCL has an export control classification number (ECCN) and may be subject to restrictions based on end-use or end-user. Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, providing exporters with certain due diligence requirements. The Commerce Control List (CCL) categorizes controlled items for national security and foreign policy reasons, with each item having an export control classification number (ECCN). Items on the CCL may be eligible for license exceptions, but some products may still require a license due to the risk of diversion or controversial nature. A commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determines if a product is dual-use or a munition, with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls making the final decision. Exporters can request a classification from BIS for items not listed on the CCL. The BIS commodity classification process involves exporters requesting a classification for export items not listed on the CCL. However, there have been criticisms regarding the low number of classifications referred to State and Defense, highlighting jurisdictional disagreements and coordination issues between the two departments. In 2008, GAO highlighted jurisdictional disagreements and coordination issues between the Departments of State and Defense regarding the review of export license applications. The EAA and EAR establish procedures for resolving disputes, with the Secretary of Commerce having the power to determine license disposition. Other agencies like State, Defense, and Energy can also review licenses, with the Secretary able to refer licenses as needed. The Secretary of Commerce has the power to review and determine the disposition of export licenses, with other agencies like State, Defense, and Energy also able to review licenses. Within 30 days of receiving an application, agencies must recommend approval or denial, providing justification for a denial. If no recommendation is provided within 30 days, the process moves forward. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) is a three-level interagency dispute resolution mechanism created in 1995. It consists of the Secretary, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of Central Intelligence as non-voting members. The Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) is under the EARB and includes relevant assistant Secretaries and officials from agencies. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) includes the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The Operating Committee (OC) of ACEP consists of representatives from relevant departments. Dispute resolution starts with the OC, with the Chair making decisions within 14 days. Appeals can be made to the ACEP within five days, and a final decision must be made within 11 days. The Export Administration Review Board (EARB) includes the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP) which reviews recommendations and votes on applications within 11 days. A department head of a dissenting agency can appeal to the Secretary within five days of a majority decision. The EARB must decide on the application within 11 days of the appeal. A member of EARB can appeal to the President within five days. The interagency appeal process must be completed within 90 days. BIS's denial of an export license must be supported by specific considerations and modifications for reconsideration. An explicit appeal procedure is specified in the EAR, including an assessment of foreign availability as a basis for appeal. In FY2008, BIS reported that 422 cases were escalated to the OC, and a further 20 were examined by the ACEP. President George H.W. Bush extended export regulations after the 1979 EAA expired in 1990. Controls were terminated during temporary EAA extensions in 1993 and 1994, with President Clinton reimposing controls under IEEPA in 1994. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published during this period. President Clinton reimposed export controls under IEEPA in 1994 after the 1979 EAA expired. A major restructuring of export control regulations was published in 1996. President Clinton signed legislation in 2000 to extend the authority of the 1979 Act until 2001. President George W. Bush renewed emergency controls in 2001. Deficiencies in maintaining export controls under IEEPA authority include lapses in enforcement power and limitations on judicial review. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) lacks provisions for judicial review and confidentiality, as well as the authority to discourage compliance with foreign boycotts. Critics argue that the US's failure to enact appropriate legislation weakens its credibility in urging other countries to strengthen their export control laws. The penalties under IEEPA are lower compared to the expired Export Administration Act (EAA), but the International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million. The International Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act raised criminal penalties to $1 million or up to 20 years' imprisonment for natural persons, and civil penalties to $250,000. Controversial exports include telecommunications, advanced electronic equipment, precision machine tools, guidance technology, aerospace technology, synthetic materials, and specialized manufacturing equipment. Congressional attention has focused on these issues in recent years. In recent years, congressional attention has focused on technologically advanced computers known as HPCs, which can perform complex digital operations quickly. The benchmark for gauging HPC computing performance was previously measured in MTOPS, but a new standard was approved in 2005. The Wassenaar Arrangement approved a new standard for calculating computing power in 2005, called adjusted peak performance (APP), measured in weighted teraflops (WT). The control level is set at 0.75 WT for high-end proprietary HPCs. This level replaces the 190,000 MTOPS benchmark. Restrictions on U.S. exports have been in place due to the rapid advancement of HPC technology. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations, there were changes to HPC export thresholds, with the last update in 2002 raising the limit to 190,000 MTOPS for Tier 3 countries. This decontrol process significantly impacted BIS regulations, reducing license applications for computer assemblies and hardware. Despite the shift to WT metric, control level changes still require notification under the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1998 imposed special conditions on the export of high performance computers, requiring prior notification for exports above the MTOPS threshold to Tier III countries. Encryption is the process of encoding electronic messages for secure transfer of information. Encryption technology has become increasingly important for e-commerce security and cryptography. Executive Order 13026 transferred control authority of encryption technology from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Retail encryption products can now be exported to western countries and non-governmental end-users with a license exemption. Licenses are still required for countries covered by anti-terrorism controls. Stealth technology, used to protect systems against electronic detection, falls into two categories: materials that deflect radar signals and materials that absorb them. Export control concerns led to certain stealth-related technology being reclassified as munitions in the 1990s. Congress has debated the strictness of controlling exports of commercial communication satellites. In the 1990s, concerns over potential exports led to reclassifying stealth-related technology as munitions. Congress debated controlling exports of commercial communication satellites and the effectiveness of monitoring foreign launch operations. The Cox Committee found improper transfer of missile design information to China through satellite manufacturers. The Department of State regained authority to license satellite exports in 1999, causing delays and lost sales in the industry. The industry has lobbied to reverse export controls on commercial communication satellites due to regulatory uncertainty. These satellites may contain sensitive technology controlled under the U.S. Munitions List. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2010-11 allowed for the transfer of commercial satellite technology from the USML to the CCL. The industry claims that lack of multilateral controls over manufacturing equipment used for missiles and aircraft engines has hindered their competitive position. The industry has been vocal about the lack of multilateral controls over sales of advanced manufacturing equipment, especially regarding China. The BIS Office of Technology Evaluation recommended decontrol of certain products to China and Taiwan. \"Hot section\" technology is crucial for jet aircraft development and is controlled by different departments based on its use. Concerns were raised in Congress about decontrolling sensitive technologies like hot section technology. During debates in the 106th Congress on EAA legislation, concerns were raised about decontrolling hot section and other sensitive technologies in the foreign policy-based control category. The civilian aviation industry has expressed worries about DDTC's increasing jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts. Section 17(c) of the EAA specifies that FAA-certified standard equipment in civil aircraft, exported to non-controlled countries, should be exclusively controlled under the act. Commercial suppliers have complained about DDTC's jurisdiction over non-FAA components, following the QRS-11 case. In response to concerns over DDTC's jurisdiction over civilian aircraft parts, Representative Manzullo introduced legislation (H.R. 3633) clarifying that civil aircraft equipment eligible for export airworthiness approval under FAA regulations should only be subject to controls under the EAA. DDTC released a new rule clarifying that Commerce will have jurisdiction over parts and components of civil aircraft that are standard equipment, covered by an FAA certificate, and integral to the aircraft, unless considered significant military equipment. The Export Administration Regulations require a license for technology transfers to foreign nationals in the US. Deemed exports are not explicitly mentioned in the 1979 EAA but have become a larger part of BIS activity, with 1,056 deemed export licenses reviewed in FY2007. The 107th Congress defined deemed exports as falling under the jurisdiction of the act. BIS reviewed 1,056 deemed export licenses in FY2007, with nearly 57% for Chinese nationals. BIS established a rule-making procedure in response to an IG report recommending a change in the standard for foreign nationals subject to export controls. Foreign nationals are currently subject to controls based on citizenship or permanent residency, but the IG suggested using country of birth. David McCormick announced in December 2005 that deemed export controls would continue to be based on country of citizenship or permanent residency. In December 2007, the Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for streamlined deemed export applications. The program would evaluate an applicant's loyalties based on various factors including country of birth, prior residence, and current citizenship. The Commission also suggested simplifying certain regulations and establishing an expert panel for annual technology reviews. The Deemed Export Advisory Commission recommended a \"trusted entity\" program for streamlined deemed export applications, evaluating applicant loyalties based on various factors. Industry representatives and the research community criticized the recommendations as unadministerable for the government and difficult for industry to comply with. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) sought comments on technologies subject to deemed export controls and criteria for assessing country affiliation for foreign nationals. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a key theme in export administration legislation debates. The tension between commercial and national security concerns is a principal theme in debates on export administration legislation. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy. Perspectives vary on reforming the current export control system, with some focusing on assisting U.S. businesses to compete globally and others emphasizing effective controls on potential exports to security threats. Controversies arise regarding technology control, multilateral regimes, licensing processes, and the impact of export controls on the U.S. economy. Industry groups support foreign availability and mass market provisions in EAA legislation, arguing that U.S. dominance of cutting-edge technology is no longer assured. They believe unilateral controls are ineffective and that other countries will obtain advanced technology regardless. Advocates argue that current multilateral controls on dual-use articles are ineffective, leading to other countries obtaining advanced technology. Unilateral export controls are seen as detrimental to American business, as foreign businesses gain new markets. The export control system is becoming unworkable due to globalization, with component parts being sourced globally. Concerns have been raised about delays in American licensing procedures, prompting some companies to reduce dependence on American components. Critics of export control argue that mass market and foreign availability standards could undermine U.S. control regime by decontrolling items used for proliferation. Industry advocates claim that robust export industries enhance national security. Industry argues that selling current technology is crucial for national security, as it allows for the development of future technology. They believe that hindrances in export controls could lead to foreign firms gaining market share and surpassing the US in technological advancements, potentially impacting national security. Critics, however, disagree with this stance, stating that selling advanced technology may not promote national security effectively. Critics argue against industry's push for streamlined export processes, stating that selling advanced technology to potentially hostile states could jeopardize national security. They point to past instances like Iraq using U.S. weaponry against allies. Some suggest funding R&D for defense capabilities within the Defense Department to maintain control over technology exports. Industry groups highlight the challenges of the export control system in keeping up with rapid technological advancements. The rapid rise in computing power challenges the export control system's ability to regulate technology trade effectively. Clustering commodity computers can create high-performance systems that blur the line between super-computers and regular computers, making it difficult to restrict access to advanced computing capabilities. This poses a dilemma as controlling computing power may limit market opportunities and profits that could be used for research and development. The Defense Science Board highlighted the challenge of restricting access to high-performance computing due to the ability to cluster commodity computers. Some believe the US can control access by limiting exports, as American-made computers are seen as superior. Advocates argue that qualitative differences matter, especially in networking parallel processing systems. Post-shipment verification requirements have been used to monitor the end-use of controlled goods. The post-shipment verification requirement (PSV) on the export of high-performance computers (HPCs) mandated by Sec 1213 of NDAA98 aims to monitor and verify the end-use of controlled goods, especially to tier III destinations like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, and other nations in areas of regional instability. Lawmakers are concerned about HPC exports to China, where access to U.S. HPC exports is restricted, and monitoring compliance is challenging due to ties with the Chinese military. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes like the Wassenaar Arrangement on Dual-Use Goods. The United States participates in multilateral export control regimes like the Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) on Dual-Use Goods and Munitions, which was created in 1996. Other proliferation-related control regimes include the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. These groups operate under national discretion with a common control list and reporting requirements, unlike CoCom which performed pre-license reviews. The Wassenaar Arrangement and other multilateral export control regimes operate under national discretion with a common control list. These organizations pledge disclosure of export licensing decisions and consultation on sensitive licenses. However, they are criticized for relying on consensus among member states, which limits their effectiveness. Critics argue that the minimal reporting requirements and need for consensus hinder effective pre-export consultation. Industry representatives emphasize the importance of effective multilateral controls for all capable exporting states. Industry representatives stress the necessity of effective multilateral controls for technology exports, criticizing unilateral policies towards China. They argue that stringent domestic controls combined with minimal multilateral constraints only harm American companies. Proponents of tighter export restrictions highlight America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts. Proponents of tighter export restrictions emphasize America's historical leadership in export controls and non-proliferation efforts. They argue that the United States must lead to strengthen multilateral controls, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, and convince other nations to follow suit. Both industry spokesmen and advocates agree on the need to enhance multilateral controls, but consensus is required on which goods and countries pose a threat. The dilemma of U.S. export control policy towards China revolves around balancing economic benefits with national security risks. There is a lack of consensus on which countries pose a threat, particularly with regards to China. The debate focuses on how to benefit from the Chinese market while minimizing the risk of exporting sensitive technologies. Some in the business community argue that U.S. export control policy towards China is too strict, hindering technology transfers. They claim Chinese companies avoid U.S. bids due to licensing delays. However, concerns exist about China's acquisition of dual-use technologies, citing instances of evasion and circumvention of controls. The Cox Commission findings highlight China's evasion of export controls to obtain technology, leading to the need for tighter enforcement. The final rule by BIS introduces new controls for military end-use products in China, including a VEU program and end-user statement requirement. Industry questions the effectiveness of these controls. The final rule by BIS introduces new controls for military end-use products in China, including a VEU program and end-user statement requirement. The new licensing policy includes new military end-use controls for the PRC and a revised License Review Policy for national security controlled items destined for China. The rule requires a license for the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of certain items if intended for military end-uses in China. The final rule by BIS introduces new controls for military end-use products in China, including a VEU program and end-user statement requirement. It clarifies a presumption of denial for items contributing to China's military capabilities in key weapons systems and increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods exported to China. The BIS final rule introduces new controls for military end-use products in China, including a VEU program and end-user statement requirement. It increases the exemption threshold for obtaining End-Use Statements from $5,000 to $50,000 for most goods exported to China. The VEU program allows trusted PRC civilian end-users to receive items without a license, with strict evaluation criteria in place. China's Minister of Foreign Commerce announced that companies seeking VEU status must obtain authorization before inspections. Not all items on the CCL are eligible for export under this program, and items controlled for crime control or missile technology do not qualify. The approved VEU application will include a list of items that can be exported to the end-user, which can be expanded or contracted by the ERC. The VEU can import approved items from any exporter, not just the nominee, streamlining licensing for certain companies. The VEU program allows approved companies to import items from any exporter, streamlining licensing processes. General Electric India was the first eligible company in India, and five companies were announced as VEUs in 2007. Concerns were raised about diversion risks with two entities affiliated with the Chinese military. The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control raised concerns in 2008 about AVIC I and HHNEC, stating they pose diversion risks due to their affiliations with Chinese government-owned companies doing business with the military. BIS Undersecretary Mario Mancuso defended the companies, citing their history of using U.S. technology. The controversy surrounding the VEU program continued, with a GAO study recommending its suspension in China due to the lack of inspection agreements and selection criteria for on-site reviews. The VEU program with China has faced challenges as BIS has not reached a specific inspection agreement with China for on-site reviews of validated end-users. Commerce has conducted checks under a pre-existing 2004 end-use verification understanding, but these checks require an end-use statement from MoFCom, hindering the program's trade facilitation rationale. Despite announcing full implementation of the VEU to China in 2009, concerns were raised about a VEU approved entity sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. Representative Markey referenced information from the Wisconsin Project regarding Aviza Technology China sharing an address with a state-owned firm sanctioned for illicit sales to Iran and Syria. Various agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Department of State, play roles in regulating dual-use exports and conducting national security reviews for license applications. The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department oversees the export of weapons and military technology through the U.S. Munitions List. The licensing system for exportation of nuclear materials and weapons is overseen by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) at the State Department. Industry leaders have identified issues with the current system, including overlapping jurisdiction between departments, lengthy approval times, and a lack of consideration for technological advancements and economic impacts. There is also no opportunity for judicial review of licensing decisions. Export administration officials claim to conduct thorough and fair reviews, but concerns remain about the system's efficiency and transparency. Some analysts question if the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) belongs in the Department of Commerce due to concerns about institutional bias towards promoting exports over national security goals. Export administration officials conduct thorough license reviews, checking proposed items against controlled lists and investigating issues on a case-by-case basis. Coordination with multiple government agencies is necessary to prevent sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong hands. Some analysts question institutional bias in export license granting, while others argue for equal agency participation to prevent bias against national security goals."
