    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to protect both providers and the children in their care from hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, and physical strain. Family child care providers face risks similar to industrial workers but are not covered by workers' compensation insurance, making training crucial to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. The director must annually publish a list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department will protect the privacy of small family day care homes by not including their names and addresses on the lists. To protect the privacy of small family day care homes, the department will not include their names and addresses on lists, except for necessary licensing purposes and providing information to specific agencies and programs. The department will not disclose names and addresses of small family day care homes, except for licensing purposes and specific agency referrals. Regulations will ensure only licensed homes in good standing are referred to for child care services. Violators may lose access to information and be reported to relevant authorities. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program. The program subsidizes early learning and care for children and is administered by various state departments, excluding the K-12 public education system. Family child care providers are required to attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to their profession. The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule for completion within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. The training for family child care providers covers chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards. It also includes small and large group discussions, learning opportunities from current professionals, presentations by relevant organizations, feedback on received training, and selection of a training entity by the Department of Industrial Relations based on specific requirements. The training required for family child care providers includes occupational health and safety training, periodic updates on health and safety matters, and curriculum development with input from providers. The State Department of Social Services administers the training contract, which aims to reduce the burden on providers by coordinating with other training requirements and resource networks. The training for family child care providers is coordinated with other training requirements and resource networks to reduce the burden on providers. The Department provides lists of providers who have attended the training and those who are required to attend but have not yet, to the training entity for updates on health and safety issues. Providers can request to have their personal information removed from the lists before release. The department and training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section becomes effective on July 1, 2017. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to this act creating new crimes or infractions. The Legislature aims to establish the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints with the State Department of Education for violations of federal or state laws. Licensed or license-exempt providers can file complaints under the Uniform Complaint Procedures against alternative payment programs like the California Alternative Payment Program and CalWORKs programs. The legislation allows child care providers in alternative payment programs to file complaints for violations of laws. Contractors under specific contract types operate these programs, contingent on annual budget appropriations."
