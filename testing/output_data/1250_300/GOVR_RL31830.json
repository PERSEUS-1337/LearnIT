    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) authorizes federal funding for the education of children with disabilities, requiring the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and detailed due process provisions. IDEA has been amended multiple times, most recently by the 1997 IDEA reauthorization. H.R. 1350, 108th Congress, passed the House in 2003, aiming to make significant changes to current legislation. The House passed H.R. 1350 in 2003, making changes to IDEA. The bill was favorably reported by the Committee on Education and the Workforce. The Senate also had a version of the bill, S. 1248, which was reported out of committee and placed on the legislative calendar. Some issues like full funding and parental choice were not included in the final House version. Definitions in current law remained largely unchanged, with a few amendments, including the definition of FAPE. The House passed H.R. 1350 in 2003, amending IDEA with changes such as redefining FAPE to include providing educational benefit for disabled children to access the general curriculum. Additionally, a new definition of \"highly qualified\" aligned IDEA with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.R. 1350 amended IDEA in 2003 to align with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act by redefining \"highly qualified\" and including provisions for children with disabilities. The bill also required GAO studies on various IDEA issues, including state variations in definitions and evaluation processes for providing services to children with specific conditions. H.R. 1350 made minimal changes to IDEA state and substate grant formulas, simplifying language and limiting the number of children with disabilities counted for maximum state grants. H.R. 1350 would specify authorized amounts for Part B appropriations, increasing annually until FY2010, after which authorizations would return to \"such sums.\" The bill aims to discourage states from over-identifying children with disabilities to increase their maximum grants. H.R. 1350 maintains permanent authorization of Part B grants to states, with changes in state reserves for administration and other activities. States can reserve a minimum of $570,000 or 20% for administration. Current provisions allow states to retain about 10% of their grants for state purposes and 2% for administration, but these percentages may change in the future. H.R. 1350 would set the maximum amount a state can retain for state-level activities at the FY2003 level if their grant equals or exceeds that amount. The bill also increases the state minimum for administration to $750,000, with no inflation adjustment. States can use up to 40% of the reserved amount for establishing special education funds. H.R. 1350 allows states to use up to 40% of funds for special education activities, addressing the issue of educating children with high cost disabilities. This provision was influenced by the Supreme Court case Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., where the court ruled that schools must provide extensive services for students with disabilities as long as they are not medical services. The Supreme Court ruled that schools must provide extensive services for students with disabilities, as long as they are not medical services. H.R. 1350 would change the permitted uses of funds for state-level activities under IDEA, including implementing voluntary binding arbitration and developing a prereferral educational support system. States would be required to distribute the remaining funds to local educational agencies. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to IDEA requirements for FAPE and IEPs, with a focus on demonstrating compliance with less stringent language. The House report explains the shift to \"reasonably demonstrates to\" instead of \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary\" to address concerns about process compliance oversight by the Department of Education. This change aims to allow states to show they have effective policies and procedures in place without reducing the need for implementation or demonstration of their effectiveness. H.R. 1350 aims to align state eligibility requirements and personnel standards with the No Child Left Behind Act. The change in language is intended to focus on overall compliance with IDEA without forcing states to change individual words unless there is a clear contradiction. H.R. 1350 aligns state eligibility requirements and personnel standards with the No Child Left Behind Act, removing certain requirements and setting performance goals for children with disabilities. It also addresses provisions for children with disabilities in private schools. Under current law and the House bill, children with disabilities placed in private schools by their parents must have a proportionate amount of IDEA funds spent on them. Special education services can be provided at private schools, including parochial schools. The costs of placement in private schools by public agencies are covered by the public agency, with potential reimbursement to parents if FAPE was not provided in a timely manner. Limitations on reimbursement exist in certain situations, with exceptions to notice requirements. H.R. 1350 clarifies the requirement for states to spend a proportionate amount of IDEA funds on children placed in private schools by their parents. The bill also specifies that the funds must be used to provide direct services to these children. Exceptions to the notice requirement for reimbursement exist in cases of illiteracy, harm to the child, school prevention, or lack of notice from the educational agency. The House bill H.R. 1350 adds provisions for child find, consultation, and reimbursement for private school placement for children with disabilities. It ensures that children in private schools receive timely child find services and requires consultation with private school officials. Private school officials have the right to appeal if consultation is not meaningful or timely. H.R. 1350 would require private school officials to have the right to complain to the state educational agency if they feel consultation was not meaningful or timely. It also changes exception provisions to the notice requirement for reimbursement, ensuring it is not reduced or denied in certain circumstances. Additionally, the bill makes changes to local educational agency eligibility. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to local educational agency eligibility, including the establishment of cost-sharing funds for special education services. It also maintains financial requirements such as supplementing, not supplanting, special education funding. LEAs can count up to 20% of increased IDEA grants towards meeting funding requirements. H.R. 1350 proposes changes to IDEA grants, allowing LEAs to use up to 20% of increased funds for ESEA programs. It modifies state oversight and expands permitted uses of funds for accommodations and supplemental services for children with disabilities in schools identified for improvement. H.R. 1350 aligns IDEA with the No Child Left Behind Act by allowing LEAs to use funds for accommodations and supplemental services for children with disabilities in schools identified for improvement. It also permits LEAs to use up to 15% of their Part B grant for prereferral services, focusing on students needing additional support in a general education environment. H.R. 1350 allows LEAs to provide educational and behavioral services, professional development for teachers, and accommodations for children with disabilities in schools. It amends provisions related to evaluations, assessments, and IEPs, including determining specific learning disabilities without using a discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability. The bill expands LEA flexibility in cases where parental consent is not provided for evaluations or services under IDEA. H.R. 1350 expands LEA flexibility by allowing them to proceed with an initial evaluation if parental consent is not provided. It also states that LEAs are not obligated to provide special education services if consent is not given, and makes changes to IEP requirements to reduce paperwork for teachers and schools. H.R. 1350 aims to improve the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) by allowing for more flexibility in IEP team meetings, offering options for multi-year IEPs, and using alternative means of meeting participation. It also seeks to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents of children with disabilities and schools. H.R. 1350 aims to reduce litigation and restore trust between parents of children with disabilities and schools by making significant changes to procedural safeguards. This includes adding a statute of limitations for presenting complaints and altering the substance of prior written notices provided by LEAs. The bill also eliminates certain requirements, such as providing copies of procedural safeguards to parents on each notification of an IEP meeting. The House bill H.R. 1350 proposes changes to procedural safeguards for parents of children with disabilities, including altering when copies of procedural safeguards are provided and changing the content of the notice. It also introduces new provisions for voluntary binding arbitration and resolution sessions to resolve disputes. H.R. 1350 proposes new provisions for voluntary binding arbitration and resolution sessions to resolve disputes related to children with disabilities. The bill requires procedures for mediation to be available for matters prior to filing a complaint, and for disputes to be resolved through voluntary binding arbitration when a hearing is requested. The arbitration process must be agreed upon in writing by both parties and conducted by an impartial arbitrator. The parties agree to use an arbitrator from a state-maintained list for voluntary binding arbitration under state law or the revised uniform arbitration act. The arbitration must be timely and convenient. Parents of children with disabilities have rights in due process hearings, including the right to counsel, present evidence, confront witnesses, and receive written findings. H.R. 1350 proposes significant changes to IDEA due process procedures, allowing either parents or the LEA to request a due process hearing conducted by the SEA. It introduces a new \"resolution session\" where the LEA meets with parents and professionals to discuss complaints before a due process hearing. The decision made in the hearing is final, with the option to appeal or bring a civil action in court. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to prevailing parties. H.R. 1350 introduces a new \"resolution session\" where the LEA meets with parents and professionals to discuss complaints before a due process hearing. If the complaint is not resolved within 30 days, the due process hearing will occur. The resolution session does not provide procedural safeguards like the right to be accompanied by counsel or present evidence. Additionally, H.R. 1350 changes the issues allowed to be raised in the due process hearing for parents of a child with a disability. H.R. 1350 introduces a \"resolution session\" for complaints before a due process hearing, where procedural safeguards like the right to present evidence or cross-examine witnesses are not available. The bill also limits issues raised in the due process hearing to those discussed in the complaint or resolution session. An amendment changes how attorneys' fees are determined, with rates set by the Governor instead of the court. Attorneys' fees may be awarded to parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party, based on community rates with specific prohibitions and reductions. Fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer, or for IEP team meetings unless convened due to administrative or judicial action. Awards may be made if the parent was justified in rejecting a settlement offer, but fees may be reduced if the parent unreasonably prolonged the resolution. The proposed amendment to H.R. 1350 would change the criteria for awarding attorneys' fees to parents of children with disabilities, basing the fees on rates determined by the Governor of the State. It also prohibits the use of bonuses or multipliers in calculating the fees awarded. The amendment to H.R. 1350 changes how attorneys' fees are awarded to parents of children with disabilities, based on rates set by the Governor. No bonuses or multipliers can be used in calculating the fees. It also outlines disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities who violate rules, including options like suspension and placement in alternative education settings. The amendment to H.R. 1350 outlines disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities who violate rules, including options like suspension for up to ten days and placement in alternative education settings. It allows school personnel to order a change in placement for a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct. H.R. 1350 allows school personnel to order a change in placement for a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct, to an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 school days. This change in placement can extend beyond 45 days if required by state law for safety reasons. The bill removes the requirement to determine if the child's behavior is a manifestation of their disability. H.R. 1350 would amend disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities, removing the requirement to determine if behavior is a manifestation of disability. It also includes provisions for professional development on behavioral supports for school administrators and requires states to provide data on long-term suspensions/expulsions by race, ethnicity, and disability category. H.R. 1350 would make amendments to include data on disproportionality in disciplinary actions, emphasize the importance of safe schools for children with disabilities, and subject students with behavioral problems to regular school disciplinary codes. H.R. 1350 would amend section 616 to include new monitoring and enforcement provisions, focusing on improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities and ensuring compliance with program requirements. The bill would require the Secretary of Education to monitor specified state indicators of educational outcomes for children with disabilities, such as academic achievement, graduation rates, and dropout rates. The bill would require the Secretary to monitor state indicators of educational outcomes for children with disabilities and take actions if progress is unsatisfactory, including providing technical assistance and withholding funds. Additional actions would be required for states not in compliance, such as preparing corrective action plans and further withholding of funds. H.R. 1350 outlines enforcement actions for states not in compliance with IDEA, including corrective action plans and fund withholding. It also introduces a pilot program on paperwork reduction and allows waivers for paperwork requirements for up to four years for select states. The Secretary must report on the effectiveness of these waivers annually.
