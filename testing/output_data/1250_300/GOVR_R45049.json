    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), outlines requirements for state assessments in Title I-A to receive funding. Title I-A provides aid to local educational agencies for disadvantaged students. States must comply with standards, assessments, and accountability systems to receive funds. The program was funded at $15.5 billion in FY2017. States must implement high-quality academic assessments in reading, math, and science, testing students annually in grades 3-8 and once in high school. Science testing is required within three grade spans. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) provides flexibility for states in implementing academic assessments in reading, mathematics, and science. States must conduct 17 assessments annually for students in elementary and secondary schools, with options for using nationally recognized tests and alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) allows states to use alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities and computer adaptive assessments. It also permits exceptions for 8th-grade students taking advanced math and provides a demonstration authority for states to create innovative assessment systems. Additionally, the ESSA allows the Secretary of Education to reserve funds for specific purposes. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) allows states flexibility in assessment requirements, including validation of student readiness, differentiated support, and assessment audits. The report discusses issues related to assessment of student growth, students with disabilities and English learners, computer adaptive assessments, participation requirements, and testing burden. States must implement changes to maintain validity and reliability in accountability systems. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) allows states flexibility in assessment requirements, including validation of student readiness, differentiated support, and assessment audits. States face challenges in implementing changes to maintain validity and reliability in accountability systems, particularly in relation to adaptive assessments, participation requirements, and testing burden. The focus is on assessments required in Title I-A of the ESEA, which outlines state assessment and accountability system requirements. The report focuses on Title I-A of the ESEA, detailing state assessment requirements and changes made by the ESSA. It discusses academic assessments, State Assessment Grants program, funds allocation, assessment audits, and innovative assessments. The section examines current ESEA assessment requirements regarding content areas, grades assessed, student participation, assessment properties, new options, and public information. The report analyzes ESEA assessment requirements, including content areas, grades assessed, student participation, assessment properties, new options, and public information. States must conduct high-quality academic assessments in reading, math, and science annually in specific grade levels. Results must align with state standards and inform student progress. The ESEA requires states to conduct annual high-quality academic assessments in reading, math, and science that align with state standards. Results must provide timely information on student attainment and performance at grade level, used for school accountability. States must ensure at least 95% of all students and subgroups participate in the assessments, with accommodations for students with disabilities and English learners. ELs may take assessments in their preferred language for accurate results. The ESSA includes provisions for English learners (ELs) to participate in alternate assessments aligned with alternate achievement standards. It also added provisions for parents to opt their child out of required assessments and requires LEAs receiving Title I-A funds to notify parents of their right to opt out. State assessments must meet requirements for format, administration, and technical quality, emphasizing higher-order thinking skills. The ESSA provides flexibility in state assessment administration, allowing for either a single summative assessment or multiple interim assessments leading to a single score. States can set limits on assessment time as a percentage of instructional hours. Assessments must meet technical quality standards and measure higher-order thinking skills. The ESSA requires states to provide evidence of the technical quality of academic assessments on their website. Assessments must be valid, reliable, and aligned with professional standards. States must use multiple measures to ensure valid results. The ESSA allows for new assessment options, including nationally recognized high school assessments. The ESSA authorizes new assessment options for states to use, including nationally recognized high school assessments and computer adaptive assessments. These assessments must align with state standards, provide valid and reliable data, and meet general assessment requirements. Computer adaptive assessments under ESSA do not have to offer the same questions to all students but must measure academic proficiency and growth towards state standards. An exception allows 8th-grade students taking advanced math to take an end-of-course assessment instead of the 8th-grade math assessment. The ESSA allows 8th-grade students taking advanced math to take an end-of-course assessment instead of the 8th-grade math assessment, under certain conditions. Each LEA receiving funds under Title I-A must provide public information on state assessments, including subject matter, purpose, source of requirement, time spent on assessments, schedule, and reporting format. These assessments are used in a state accountability system to determine school performance. The assessments required by the ESEA are used in a state accountability system to identify schools for support and improvement. States previously determined school progress based on proficiency levels in math and reading, additional academic indicators, and assessment participation rates. Failure to meet requirements triggered accountability consequences. States had to establish proficiency goals for all students. The ESEA required schools to meet proficiency goals in math and reading assessments, with consequences for failing to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). The high-stakes accountability system could lead to schools implementing improvement requirements based on assessment results. The ESSA has since made changes to lessen the association between assessment results and school identification for support and improvement. Under the ESSA, changes have been made to the accountability system to reduce the high-stakes connection between student assessment results and school improvement identification. The state must differentiate all public schools based on various indicators, including student proficiency in math and reading. Schools with consistently underperforming student subgroups are identified for additional support to enhance student achievement. Under the ESSA, states must differentiate schools based on various indicators to identify low-achieving schools requiring comprehensive support and improvement. This includes the lowest-performing 5% of Title I-A funded schools, public high schools with low graduation rates, schools not improving despite targeted support, and other statewide categories at the state's discretion. States must also identify consistently underperforming student subgroups for targeted support. The changes made aim to reduce the high-stakes connection between student assessment results and school improvement identification. The ESSA has reduced the high-stakes emphasis on assessment in the accountability system, allowing states to determine the weight of assessment results and identify schools for support based on various indicators. Funding for State Assessment Grants continues under the ESEA, with formula and competitive grants authorized for state assessments. The ESEA authorizes funding for State Assessment Grants through formula and competitive grants based on trigger amounts. The Secretary reserves funds for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas before awarding grants to states, with the option to reserve funds for assessment system audits. Each state receives a minimum grant of $3 million, with any remaining funds allocated accordingly. The Secretary reserves funds for assessment system audits and provides each state with a minimum grant of $3 million. Any remaining funds are allocated based on the number of students. Excess funds are awarded through a competitive grant process for assessment activities. The Secretary may reserve up to 20% of the funds for state assessment formula grants to conduct audits at the state and LEA levels. States must submit an application detailing their need for the grant. The Secretary provides annual grants to states for assessment system audits and subgrants to LEAs. States must submit an application detailing the audit, stakeholder participation, and subgrants. Each state and LEA must conduct audits, with states required to develop a plan to improve the assessment system. The ESEA allows for the development of innovative assessment systems, including competency-based assessments and interim assessments. States or consortia of states may apply for the demonstration authority to develop an innovative assessment system that includes various types of assessments for each student. Up to seven SEAs, with a maximum of four states in consortia, may receive this authority. Funding is not provided separately for this authority, but states can use existing grant funding. States and consortia can apply for an initial three-year demonstration period to develop and implement innovative assessment systems, with the possibility of a two-year extension if successful. States and consortia can apply for an initial three-year demonstration period to develop and implement innovative assessment systems, with the possibility of a two-year extension if successful. The innovative assessments must meet general state assessment requirements and can include competency-based assessments, instructionally embedded assessments, interim assessments, cumulative year-end assessments, and performance-based assessments. Results can be reported in terms of \"student competencies\" aligned with state achievement standards. States have the authority to select their own assessments aligned with academic standards. Assessments include state-specific, common, and end-of-course exams for grades 3-8 and high school. Science assessments can be state-specific, end-of-course exams, or a combination. ESSA allows for a \"nationally recognized\" high school assessment option. The NCLB expanded state assessments under the ESEA, leading to each state having its own academic standards and assessments. This lack of standardization prompted the development of Common Core State Standards in 2009 by the NGA and CCSSO. The Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI) was developed in 2009 by the NGA and CCSSO to create standardized reading and math standards for college and career readiness. The federal government supported the initiative through incentives like Race to the Top State Grants, Comprehensive Assessment Systems Grants, and the ESEA flexibility package. Adoption of these standards by states is optional. The Department of Education created the RTT CAS Grant program to support the development of high-quality assessments aligned with college- and career-ready standards. Two consortia, PARCC and SBAC, were awarded grants to develop new assessment systems aligned with Common Core State Standards. The ESEA flexibility package, announced in 2011, allowed states to receive waivers of various ESEA provisions. In 2011, the Obama Administration announced an ESEA flexibility package that allowed states to receive waivers of various provisions by adhering to college- and career-ready standards in reading and math. Initial interest in common assessments was high, but participation declined in later years. Both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations supported measuring student growth in addition to proficiency. The Obama Administration supported measuring student growth in addition to proficiency by requiring states to incorporate measures of student growth into their accountability systems to receive waivers of ESEA requirements. Two organizations, ECS and Education Week, collect data on state assessments to meet Title I-A requirements. Based on recent surveys by Education Week and ECS, about half of states used state-specific or end-of-course assessments in the 2015-2016 school year. Some states also used a combination of common assessments, state-specific assessments, end-of-course exams, and nationally recognized high school academic assessments. Examples include Michigan using a blend of state-specific and SBAC assessment items, Massachusetts using a state-specific assessment, and Louisiana using end-of-course assessments. Seven states relied entirely on common assessments. In the 2015-2016 school year, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Louisiana used blended approaches for assessments. Other states relied on common assessments. States have been submitting ESEA state plans to receive funding under Title I-A in 2017. All states, DC, and Puerto Rico had to submit plans by April 3, 2017, or September 18, 2017. States detailed the assessments they will use to meet Title I-A requirements in their plans. Several states have submitted ESEA state plans for approval, detailing the assessments they will use to meet Title I-A requirements. States are expected to use a combination of assessments, such as SBAC, end-of-course assessments, and PSAT/SAT, or rely primarily on state-specific annual assessments. The ESSA provides states with more flexibility in using assessments for accountability, potentially adding nuance to state accountability systems. It is crucial to implement changes to Title I-A requirements in a way that maintains the validity and reliability of state assessments and does not compromise the accuracy of state accountability systems. The section discusses assessment-related issues under ESSA-enacted changes, including student growth, special needs assessments, computer adaptive assessments, opt-out practices, and testing burden. It highlights adjustments intended to enhance assessments in accountability systems and addresses valid and reliable assessment uses for accountability purposes. The focus is on navigating challenges and identifying tensions in using assessments for accountability. Prior to ESSA, state accountability systems focused solely on reporting student proficiency, which critics argued was not a valid measure of school quality or teacher effectiveness. This led to unintended consequences such as instruction being targeted towards students just below the proficient level. As ESSA-enacted adjustments are implemented, challenges in using assessments for accountability purposes, including student growth and testing burden, need to be navigated. Some education policy groups argue for a different way to report student achievement than focusing solely on proficiency. They suggest using a \"performance index\" to give credit for various levels of achievement, aiming to avoid targeting only students just below proficiency. This approach could provide a more comprehensive measure of student success. Some education policy groups advocate for a \"performance index\" to measure student achievement, which would give credit for different levels of achievement and incentivize schools to improve all students' performance. Another suggestion is to report average scale scores, which are more sensitive to changes in achievement and allow for better comparison across students, subgroups, and schools. The ESSA allows for student achievement to be measured using student growth as well, addressing concerns about relying solely on proficiency levels. The ESSA allows for student achievement to be measured using student growth in addition to proficiency levels. States have the option to incorporate measures of student growth into their accountability systems, with different types of growth models being used. Different types of growth models are used by states to measure student growth, including state-set targets, student growth percentiles (SGPs), and SAS EVAAS. State-set targets measure student growth or reaching performance benchmarks, SGPs compare a student's achievement to peers, and SAS EVAAS measures value-added growth. The CCSSO provides guidance on developing and implementing growth models in ESEA. The CCSSO provides guidance on different growth models used to measure student growth, including gain scores, growth rates, and student growth percentiles. These models involve calculating differences in test scores, fitting trend lines across data points, and comparing academic achievement to peers. The CCSSO provides guidance on various growth models for measuring student growth, including gain scores, growth rates, student growth percentiles, transition tables, and residual models. These models involve comparing academic achievement to peers, fitting trend lines, and analyzing the effect of outside factors on student growth. Residual models compare class, school, or LEA performance to expected change without a vertical scale. Some caution against \"growth to proficiency\" models as they may not differentiate student progress accurately. When using a \"growth to proficiency\" model, certain types of growth can be weighted differently. Measuring student growth over time is more effective for evaluating learning than proficiency alone. Schools may not be penalized for low achieving students if they meet growth targets. This model provides a more valid measure of factors within the school's control. Reliable assessments are crucial for measuring growth targets accurately. The ESEA requires all students to participate in annual academic assessments, with special provisions for students with disabilities and ELs. Alternate assessments for students with disabilities are limited in state accountability systems, while ELs are included based on their time in the US and English proficiency level. States must include all students with disabilities in statewide assessments and disaggregate results. Assessments for students with special needs are included in state accountability systems, with states required to include all students with disabilities in the statewide assessment system and disaggregate their results. The ESEA mandates that state assessments be developed using universal design for learning (UDL) principles to ensure full participation of students with disabilities. UDL focuses on providing multiple means of representation, action and expression, and engagement to reduce cognitive burden in the assessment process. UDL principles are used in state assessments to ensure full participation of students with disabilities by providing multiple means of representation, action, and engagement. Accommodations are also required to increase the validity of assessments for students with disabilities, such as using \"read aloud\" for students with reading disabilities in math tests. The ESSA allows for alternate assessments aligned with alternate standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities. States must establish guidelines to identify these students, and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the student's IEP team. Parents must be informed of the decision regarding participation in the alternate assessment. The guidelines for determining student eligibility for alternate assessments are made on a case-by-case basis. Students with intellectual disabilities, autism, or multiple disabilities are often found eligible. States can provide alternate assessments aligned with alternate achievement standards, with a 1% cap at the state level. LEAs exceeding the cap must justify the need to the SEA. Scores over the cap are counted as nonproficient. The state must provide oversight for LEAs exceeding the 1% cap on alternate assessments. Scores over the cap are considered nonproficient. Alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities align better with academic standards. However, reliability issues may arise due to different test formats like portfolios or rating scales. Issues of reliability may arise with alternate assessments given in different formats, such as portfolios or rating scales. Inter-scorer agreement is crucial to maintaining the validity of the accountability system. States must include all English Learners (ELs) in the statewide assessment system and disaggregate results based on language proficiency and years of schooling in the US. ELs undergo assessments for English language proficiency and statewide assessments in reading, math, and science. The assessments for English Learners (ELs) in the United States vary based on language proficiency and years of schooling. There are two types of assessments: English language proficiency (ELP) and statewide assessments in reading, math, and science. States must ensure annual ELP assessments aligned with state standards, with many using the WIDA consortium's ACCESS 2.0 test. Changes in proficiency standards have led to some states seeing lower proficiency levels and fewer students exiting support programs. The ESEA requires states to adjust English language proficiency standards to align with college- and career-readiness standards, leading to lower proficiency levels in some states. This results in fewer students exiting support programs for ELs, potentially prolonging their inclusion in accountability determinations. States must include ELs in statewide assessments of reading, math, and science, with accommodations provided as needed. ELs are typically assessed in English after three years in U.S. schools, but can be assessed in a different language for an additional two years on a case-by-case basis. The ESSA allows for the assessment of English Learners (ELs) in a different language for up to two additional years if they have not reached English proficiency for reading assessments. States can exclude ELs from reading assessments if they have been in the U.S. for less than 12 months. Recently arrived ELs can be assessed in reading and math but their results may be excluded from the state's accountability system. The ESSA allows states to include the scores of formerly identified ELs in the EL subgroup for four years after they cease to be identified as ELs, impacting accountability measures for a longer period. This change in EL proficiency determination may result in ELs remaining in the EL subgroup for a longer time. The ESSA allows states to include former ELs' scores in the EL subgroup for four years, potentially leading to longer accountability periods. This change may improve the subgroup's performance as students gain English proficiency over time. The use of computer adaptive assessments is now explicitly authorized under ESEA, which was previously unclear. Title I-A of the ESSA clarified that computer adaptive assessments are allowed, despite the requirement for assessments to be the same for all students. These assessments adjust to individual student abilities by presenting more difficult items as students answer correctly, reaching a \"ceiling\" when a student either completes all difficult items or answers a set number incorrectly. Computer adaptive assessments can measure a student's ability above or below grade level, as required by the ESEA. They adjust difficulty levels based on student performance, reaching a \"ceiling\" when all difficult items are completed or a set number are answered incorrectly. These assessments are also used for alternate assessments and English language proficiency assessments. However, concerns have been raised about their use for statewide academic assessments due to their adaptive nature. Some concerns about using computer adaptive assessments for statewide academic assessments include longer administration times for high-achieving students, accurate measurement of special populations like students with disabilities and English Language Learners, and the potential focus on testing computer literacy skills instead of content areas like reading and mathematics. Some concerns have been raised about computer adaptive assessments potentially testing students' computer literacy skills instead of their proficiency in reading and mathematics. Other issues include technical, financial, and reporting challenges such as the need for computers, software, technical staff, and teacher training. However, computer assessments can offer quicker scoring and immediate feedback on student performance. Computer assessments provide quicker scoring and immediate feedback to teachers. States must assess at least 95% of all students and subgroups annually for valid accountability. Parents have rights regarding student participation in assessments under ESSA. The ESSA provides provisions for parental rights in the assessment process, allowing parents to request information on student participation and opt-out policies. State or local laws regarding opt-outs cannot be preempted by ESEA requirements. Excessive opt-outs may impact accountability and undermine the validity of student achievement measurements. Excessive opt-outs in statewide assessments may undermine the validity of student achievement measurements and the state accountability system by not representing the whole student population. States are required to assess all students, not a representative sample as in education research. In statewide assessments under the ESEA, states must assess all students to accurately reflect the true achievement of the entire population. Excessive opt-outs may lead to an unrepresentative sample, undermining the validity of student achievement measurements and state accountability systems. The emphasis on educational assessment in federal education policies has led to debates about the testing burden and narrowing of the curriculum. Test-based accountability may reduce instructional time due to test administration and preparation activities, leading to concerns about teaching to the test rather than broader instruction. Test preparation activities in schools often focus on specific content, format, and test-taking strategies, leading to a shift in instructional time towards tested subjects like reading and math. While some test preparation can be beneficial for students unfamiliar with standardized testing, excessive alignment between test items and curricula can negatively impact the validity of test scores. Test preparation can impact the validity of test scores, with excessive alignment between test items and curricula leading to score inflation on high-stakes assessments. Score inflation reduces the validity of assessment results, making it difficult to study its prevalence due to reluctance from LEAs to provide access to test scores for investigation. Studies comparing gains on state assessments to NAEP have consistently shown discrepancies in student achievement levels and gains. The ESSA addresses score inflation by comparing gains on state assessments to NAEP results, highlighting discrepancies in student achievement levels and gains. New provisions focus on reducing testing burden and setting limits on assessment time, questioning the validity of conclusions based on state assessments. Each state must provide information on subjects assessed, purpose, source of requirement, and time spent on assessments for each grade. The ESSA requires states to provide information on subjects assessed, purpose, source of requirement, and time spent on assessments for each grade. Funds may be reserved for audit assessments to determine the necessity of tests and grants may be provided to LEAs for a similar examination at the local level."
