    "content": "The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply in cases authorized by the Constitution, with exceptions for sudden emergencies and protection of federal property. Congress can authorize the military to execute the law in three ways. The Posse Comitatus Act does not apply where Congress has expressly authorized the military to execute the law in three ways: giving armed forces civilian law enforcement authority, establishing general rules for assistance, and addressing individual cases with specific legislation. Congress has vested the Coast Guard with law enforcement responsibilities and passed statutes allowing the President to call out the armed forces in times of insurrection. General legislation permits the armed forces to share information and equipment with civilian law enforcement agencies, with explicit grants of authority and restrictions on military assistance to police. The last general statutes were created to address issues from the Wounded Knee cases, providing authority and restrictions on military assistance to police at federal, state, and local levels. The legislation allows for sharing information, training civilian police, and providing equipment and expert advice. Military undercover agents and intelligence collection are permitted only for military purposes. The authority granted is subject to certain limitations to prevent misuse. The authority granted in \u00a7\u00a7 271-284 allows for the operation and maintenance of equipment, with military personnel providing expert advice. There are three general caveats: it must not undermine US military capability, civilian beneficiaries must pay for assistance, and regulations must prevent armed forces from being used for civilian law enforcement purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act does not restrict the Army from incidental support to law enforcement as long as the primary purpose is military. The Posse Comitatus Act allows for military support to civilian law enforcement as long as the primary purpose is military. The act prohibits \"willful\" misuse of the Army or Air Force, with limitations on what constitutes a violation. Violations occur when the armed forces perform tasks typically assigned to civilian government or solely for law enforcement purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the military from performing tasks assigned to civilian government or solely for law enforcement purposes. Violations often occur when the armed forces assist civilian police, with tests developed from incidents at Wounded Knee in 1973. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the military from performing law enforcement tasks. It does not apply to the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, but they are subject to similar restrictions through administrative and legislative supplements. The Coast Guard, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is not covered by the act while under DHS jurisdiction. The Coast Guard, located within the Department of Homeland Security, is subject to the orders of the Secretary of the Navy in times of war. It is authorized to perform law enforcement functions and is exempt from posse comitatus restrictions. The act does not specify coverage for the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, or off-duty military members. The Posse Comitatus Act does not specify coverage for the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, or off-duty military members. The National Guard is considered part of the Army or Air Force for purposes of the Act when in federal service, and historical reflection suggests it may also be covered when not in federal service. The Posse Comitatus Act does not specify coverage for the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, or off-duty military members. The Act's reference to \"posse comitatus or otherwise\" aims to limit the use of troops in enforcing laws. Courts have ruled that the National Guard is not covered by the Act when not in federal service. The historical perspective is unclear on whether the Act applies to soldiers assisting civilian law enforcement while off duty. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military members from providing assistance to law enforcement while off duty, aiming to limit their involvement in enforcing laws. Recent decisions focus on the nature of assistance provided and whether it is primarily for a military purpose. The Act does not specify coverage for the National Guard or off-duty military members, and courts have ruled that the National Guard is not covered when not in federal service. The Act's application to civilian employees of the armed forces is debated, with most considering them part of the armed forces for Posse Comitatus Act purposes. The Posse Comitatus Act restricts military involvement in law enforcement to prevent military usurpation of civilian responsibilities. It applies within the United States and its territories, with limited extraterritorial application. The Act has been used in various legal challenges and prosecutions, but only a few prosecutions have occurred. The Posse Comitatus Act is often used in legal challenges and prosecutions, serving as a defense in criminal cases, a basis for suppressing evidence, a defense against civil liability, and a means to halt military actions. Defendants have utilized the act to exclude evidence and testimony, but courts have not consistently applied an exclusionary rule. While some suggest a need for deterrence in cases of widespread violations, such a scenario has not yet arisen. The act has been helpful for defendants requiring the government to prove the lawfulness of its actions. At Wounded Knee, defendants used possible violations to avoid convictions for obstructing law enforcement. However, courts have generally not dismissed cases based on Posse Comitatus Act violations. The Posse Comitatus Act has been used in legal challenges and prosecutions, serving as a defense in criminal cases and a basis for suppressing evidence. Defendants at Wounded Knee avoided convictions for obstructing law enforcement by citing possible violations. Courts have not consistently dismissed cases based on Posse Comitatus Act violations, but a violation could constitute an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. This violation also provides a defense against claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Posse Comitatus Act limits the liability of federal officers and employees for injuries caused outside their authority. State and local law enforcement officers also benefit from qualified immunity due to lack of precedent. The Act has a significant impact on armed forces' compliance, with the military avoiding involvement in civilian affairs contrary to the Act since the founding of the Republic."
