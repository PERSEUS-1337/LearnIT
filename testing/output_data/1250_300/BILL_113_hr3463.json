    "content": "The \"Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013\" may be cited as the short title. The Act addresses the Border Patrol rate of pay. The \"Border Patrol Pay Reform Act of 2013\" aims to strengthen U.S. Customs and Border Protection by ensuring Border Patrol agents are ready for necessary work and can perform overtime as needed. It also provides flexibility for shift changes and work assignments based on operational requirements. The Act introduces the Border Patrol rate of pay, defining terms like \"available to work\" and \"Border Patrol agent.\" The term 'Border Patrol agent' refers to individuals performing functions under position classification series 1896 of the Office of Personnel Management, including detecting and preventing illegal entry, smuggling, and attending authorized training. Border Patrol agents are exempt from certain duties such as attending training, being on leave, travel status, official time, excused absence, light duty, administrative duties, caring for assigned canines, and similar activities while away from regular duties. Border Patrol agents have specific exemptions from duties, including training, leave, travel, official time, excused absence, light duty, administrative tasks, and caring for assigned canines. They also have the option to elect the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate of pay annually. Border Patrol agents must make an annual election between level 1, level 2, or decline both border patrol rates of pay. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will establish election procedures, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection will provide agents with election information. U.S. Customs and Border Protection must provide Border Patrol agents with information on available elections and how to make them. Failure to elect will result in a default election. Congress recommends that no more than 10% of agents decline level 1 or level 2 border patrol pay rates. Level 1 Border Patrol agents work 5 days a week, 8 hours per day with 2 additional hours of scheduled overtime. They receive pay at the level 1 border patrol rate for regular time work and do not receive additional compensation for overtime work. Level 2 Border Patrol agents are entitled to compensatory time off or pay at the overtime hourly rate for hours worked over 100 during a work period. They are also required to take leave in increments of 8 hours for 1 shift of leave, regardless of the shift length. Level 2 Border Patrol agents must take leave in 8-hour increments for one shift, regardless of its length. They are scheduled to work 5 days a week, with 8 hours of regular time per day and 1 additional hour of scheduled overtime each day. Regular time work is paid at the level 2 border patrol rate, while scheduled overtime work does not receive additional compensation. Border Patrol agents must take leave in 8-hour increments for one shift, regardless of its length. They receive compensatory time off or pay at the overtime hourly rate for hours worked over 90 in a work period. Leave is charged in 8-hour increments, and they are scheduled to work 5 days a week with regular time and scheduled overtime. Border Patrol agents are required to take leave in 8-hour increments for one shift, regardless of its length. They work 8 hours of regular time per day, 5 days a week, with any additional hours considered as overtime. They receive compensatory time off or pay for hours worked over 80 in a work period. Additionally, they are eligible for premium pay for night work. Border Patrol agents are eligible for premium pay for night work, Sunday, and holiday pay, without regard to their election under subsection (b)(1)(A). They are not eligible for any other form of premium pay except as provided in section 5542(a)(7). Pay received at the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate is treated as part of basic pay for various purposes. Pay received at the level 1 or level 2 border patrol rate is considered basic pay for specific purposes outlined in the law. U.S. Customs and Border Protection retains the authority to require Border Patrol agents to work overtime as needed, including during emergencies. Additionally, Border Patrol agents who elect to be assigned to the level 1 border patrol rate are subject to certain provisions regarding overtime pay. Border Patrol agents assigned to the level 1 border patrol rate of pay are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked over 100 in a 14-day period. They receive overtime pay for pre-approved overtime hours and compensatory time off for other overtime hours. Agents at the level 2 rate also have specific provisions for overtime pay. Border Patrol agents at the level 2 border patrol rate of pay are eligible for overtime pay for hours worked over 90 in a 14-day biweekly pay period. They receive overtime pay for pre-approved overtime hours and compensatory time off for other overtime hours. Border Patrol agents can receive overtime pay for hours worked over 80 in a 14-day biweekly pay period if they have an election under a specific section. They will receive pay at the overtime hourly rate for officially ordered or approved overtime work and compensatory time off for any additional overtime hours. There is a limit of 8 hours of compensatory time off for overtime work in a 14-day period, unless determined otherwise by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. During a 14-day biweekly pay period, Border Patrol agents are limited to 8 hours of compensatory time off for overtime work, unless waived by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Agents cannot earn more than 240 hours of compensatory time off in a year and must use any accrued time off within 1 year. Additionally, technical and conforming amendments have been made to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The amendment (29 U.S.C. 213(a)) adds a new category (18) for Border Patrol agents under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Border Patrol agents' rate of pay is addressed under the Fair Labor Standards Act."
