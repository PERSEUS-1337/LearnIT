    "title": "AB 815",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Board of Equalization amends Section 8670.40 of the Government Code to collect a fee for regulatory costs related to oil spill prevention. The fee shall not exceed $0.065 per barrel of crude oil or petroleum products. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is imposed on owners of crude oil or petroleum products received at marine terminals or refineries in the state, collected per barrel by the terminal operator or refinery. The fee applies to deliveries passing over state waters, whether from within or outside the state. The rebuttable presumption applies to crude oil or petroleum products received at marine terminals or refineries, stating they passed over state waters. Operators can overcome this by providing evidence that the products did not pass over state waters. The State Board of Equalization is restricted from petition for redetermination and claim for refund provisions under the Oil Spill Response, Prevention, and Administration Fees Law. The State Board of Equalization can accept petitions or claims for redetermination or refund of fees based on whether crude oil or petroleum products passed over state waters. The State Board of Equalization forwards appeals of redetermination or refund claims for fees related to crude oil or petroleum products passing over state waters. Refinery or marine terminal operators remit fees based on the volume received, with exemptions if fees have already been paid. The oil spill prevention and administration fee is not collected by marine terminal or refinery operators if it has already been paid at another location. Owners of crude oil or petroleum products are liable for the fee until it is paid to the State Board of Equalization, but payment to a registered operator relieves further liability. The administrator annually prepares a plan projecting revenues and expenses over three fiscal years, setting the fee to match expenses. Any surplus may be allowed for contingencies. The State Board of Equalization collects the fee for specific purposes and adopts regulations for its implementation. The State Board of Equalization collects a fee for oil spill prevention programs, research, environmental studies, emergency response equipment, and to fund the Oiled Wildlife Care Network. The fee is not used for responding to spills. The Oiled Wildlife Care Network is funded through a fee collected by the State Board of Equalization. The fund cannot be used for spill response or to provide loans to other funds. Amendments to this section will be effective from September 18, 2014. Additionally, definitions related to crude oil and petroleum products are specified in the Revenue and Taxation Code. Refineries, marine terminals, and pipelines must register with the board for specific purposes outlined in the Government Code. The State Board of Equalization collects an oil spill prevention fee on crude oil or petroleum products upon first delivery to a refinery or marine terminal, as mandated by the Government Code."
