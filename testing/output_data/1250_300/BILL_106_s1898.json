    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act of 2000\" or \"Jeanna's Act.\" Congress finds that States are increasingly using private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners, leading to escapes and the need for oversight by the Attorney General. While most prefer using trained law enforcement officers, fiscal or logistical concerns may necessitate the use of private companies. When governmental entities contract with private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners, regulation should be in place to enhance public safety. The Act defines key terms such as \"crime of violence,\" \"private prisoner transport company,\" and \"violent prisoner.\" It also addresses federal regulation of prisoner transport companies. The Attorney General, in consultation with relevant organizations, will establish regulations for transporting violent prisoners across state lines. These regulations will cover background checks, drug testing, and training requirements for employees involved in prisoner transport. Employees transporting prisoners must undergo up to 100 hours of training on restraints, searches, use of force, CPR, map reading, and defensive driving. There are restrictions on duty hours, minimum supervision standards for violent prisoners, and requirements for employee uniforms and identification. Minimum standards for employee uniforms and identification include wearing a uniform with a badge or insignia identifying the employee as a transportation officer. Standards also establish categories of violent prisoners required to wear brightly colored clothing for identification. Requirements for restraints during transportation include leg shackles and double-locked handcuffs. Private prisoner transport companies must notify local law enforcement 24 hours in advance of scheduled stops and immediately report any escapes to appropriate authorities. Private prisoner transport companies must immediately notify law enforcement and the contracting entity in case of a violent prisoner escape. Federal regulations for safety standards must align with applicable laws, with exceptions for certain federal agencies. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT. Any person violating regulations under this Act may face a civil penalty up to $10,000 per violation, restitution to entities for costs related to apprehending escaped violent prisoners, and prosecution expenses."
