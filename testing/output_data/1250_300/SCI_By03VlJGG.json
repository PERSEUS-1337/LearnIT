We extend existing datasets to create benchmarks with additional relations like textual descriptions and images. Our model effectively utilizes this additional information to improve accuracy and predict missing multimodal attributes. Knowledge bases are crucial in various computational systems but often suffer from incompleteness and noise. Knowledge bases (KB) are vital for computational systems in various domains, but they often lack completeness and suffer from noise. Research focuses on learning relational knowledge representation by estimating low-dimensional representations for entities and relations to infer missing facts efficiently. Real-world knowledge bases contain diverse data types beyond fixed entities, including numerical, textual, and image attributes. In this paper, a multimodal embedding approach is introduced for modeling knowledge bases with diverse data types like textual and images. This approach aims to go beyond traditional link-based graph views and address the uncertainty of multimodal relational evidence. The paper introduces a multimodal embedding approach for modeling knowledge bases with various data types. It extends the DistMult approach by incorporating neural encoders for different types of evidence data, such as images and textual attributes. The scoring module remains the same, producing a score indicating the probability of a triple being correct. This unified model allows for information flow across different relation types, improving the accuracy of relational data modeling. This module introduces a novel approach for modeling relational data by incorporating additional information such as textual descriptions, numerical attributes, and images. The evaluation demonstrates improved link-prediction accuracy by effectively utilizing this extra information. The learned multimodal embeddings can predict object entities based on similarity between entities in different data types. The text discusses relational modeling in knowledge bases, focusing on predicting object entities based on similarity. It introduces approaches for modeling linked data using dense vectors and extends this to a multimodal setting. The goal is to train a model to score the truth value of factual statements represented as triplets. Training data consists of observed facts in the knowledge base, which may be incomplete or noisy. Relational modeling in knowledge bases involves learning parameters for a model using training data consisting of observed facts in the knowledge base. The DistMult approach is popular for its simplicity and accuracy, mapping entities to dense vectors and relations to diagonal matrices to compute scores for triples. The model uses a pairwise ranking loss to differentiate between existing and non-existing triples. The DistMult approach uses a pairwise ranking loss to score existing triples higher than non-existing ones. Negative samples are generated by replacing entities in training triplets. This method learns entity and relation representations for knowledge base completion, queries, or cleaning. The proposed architecture aims to incorporate various data types for objects in triples.

An example instantiation of the model for a knowledge base containing movie details is provided.
