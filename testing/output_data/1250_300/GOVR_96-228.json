    "content": "A helper in the construction industry is typically an unskilled worker who assists skilled craftsmen. They may have a range of skills but lack formal training. Helpers are often not union members and are paid less than skilled workers, but can still perform well in certain tasks. They are valued for their flexibility and cost-effectiveness in completing specific aspects of a project under careful supervision. In the construction industry, helpers are unskilled workers who assist skilled craftsmen. They are valued for their flexibility and cost-effectiveness in completing specific tasks under supervision. The debate continues on whether assigning helpers to perform narrow aspects of complex tasks is economical in terms of productivity and quality of workmanship. Apprentices and trainees receive formal training and rotate throughout the worksite, while helpers receive minimal training and are seen as temporary workers. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices and trainees as a classification of workers for wage rate purposes. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices and trainees as a classification of workers for wage rate purposes, but generally does not recognize helpers. The Act requires construction contracts over $2,000 to state minimum wages based on prevailing rates for similar projects. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the task of applying the act to the Secretary, who is responsible for defining key concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" rates. Congress has left many aspects of the act open to interpretation, leading to ongoing debates and litigation over terms like \"helper\" and the scope of locality for federal construction work. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the task of applying the act to the Secretary, who defines key concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" rates. Congress has left many aspects open to interpretation, leading to ongoing debates and litigation over terms like \"helper\" and the scope of locality for federal construction work. The original Act referred to \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" employed on public construction projects and made no reference to \"helpers\" or other skill groups. The Secretary developed definitions for apprentices and trainees registered in formal training programs, with the term \"helper\" used casually without precise definition. The term \"helper\" in Davis-Bacon regulations lacked a precise definition and caused confusion in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot highlighted the issue of reclassifying helpers as journeymen or laborers to determine prevailing wages. The use of semi-skilled labor without DOL-approved apprenticeship programs also posed challenges in pay classification. Thieblot highlighted the challenges of classifying semi-skilled labor without DOL-approved apprenticeship programs for prevailing wage purposes. The recognition of helpers for Davis-Bacon rates is limited to areas where their classification is prevalent among open shop firms. Unions view DOL's restrictions on employing apprentices, trainees, or helpers at sub-craft rates as crucial for maintaining labor standards in the building trades and preventing contractors from undercutting prevailing wages. The use of informal titles like \"helper\" and \"trainee\" can lead to undercutting of prevailing wage rates, according to the Building and Construction Trades Department. Restrictions on employing helpers at sub-craft wages are seen as necessary to prevent wage-cutting practices by non-union contractors on federally funded projects. The Davis-Bacon Act was intended to address such abuses, and by the late 1970s, there was a push for reform. In the late 1970s, there was a push for reform or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act to prevent wage-cutting practices by non-union contractors on federally funded projects. The Carter Administration proposed a rule in December 1979 to revise the administration of Davis-Bacon, including adding language on classification and wage rates for laborers and mechanics. The proposed rule in the late 1970s aimed to establish special wage rates for helpers based on their distinct duties in the area of work, separate from other laborer and mechanic classifications. The final rule published in mid-January 1981 clarified the use of helpers, omitting a specific definition for them. In mid-January 1981, the Department of Labor addressed concerns about job opportunities for youths, minorities, and women in apprenticeship programs. The final rule emphasized the importance of maintaining strict conditions to prevent circumvention of wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act. However, the definition of a \"helper\" was still not provided in the rule. The Department of Labor emphasized the importance of maintaining strict conditions to prevent circumvention of wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act. Despite defining apprentice and trainee, the term \"helper\" was still not defined. The Department faced difficulties in recognizing helpers and determining prevailing wage rates for them. The Reagan Administration delayed and eventually withdrew the Davis-Bacon regulations for further review. The consideration of the helper issue during the Reagan era spanned three periods: issuance of a proposed rule in August 1981, publication of a final rule in May 1982, and subsequent litigation. During the Reagan era, the Department of Labor proposed a new rule for the Davis-Bacon Act, allowing for a helper classification on wage determinations. This proposal aimed to recognize common industry practices and provide more flexibility in determining wage rates. The Department noted that the previous practice of defining helpers had been too restrictive and proposed a broader definition for helper classifications. The Department of Labor proposed a new regulation for the Davis-Bacon Act, allowing for helper wage determinations to be issued based on industry practices. The regulation defined helpers broadly and permitted a ratio of one helper to five journeymen, while prohibiting the use of journeymen as helpers. The purpose was to increase the use of helpers in the area, with helpers defined as semi-skilled workers assisting journeymen in various tasks. The helper, under direction and supervision, assists the journeyman by preparing materials, tools, and equipment, maintaining work areas, and performing related tasks. The Department of Labor received numerous comments on the helper issue before issuing a final Davis-Bacon rule in 1995, rejecting previous restrictive approaches. The Department of Labor issued a final Davis-Bacon rule in 1995, increasing the ratio of helpers to journeymen to two helpers for every three journeymen. This decision was met with mixed reactions, with some criticizing the lack of evidence supporting the new ratio. The Department of Labor's decision to increase the ratio of helpers to journeymen to 2:3 was criticized by Secretary John Dunlop and the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO. They argued that there was no credible evidence to support the new ratio and that it would allow unlimited use of helpers. Industry groups, such as the Associated General Contractors and the American Farm Bureau Federation, supported the change for its cost-saving potential. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also praised the revision for permitting contractors to expand their use of helpers on federal projects. In response to the Department of Labor's decision to increase the ratio of helpers to journeymen, various organizations had differing opinions. The American Farm Bureau Federation commended the Reagan administration for the revision, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce viewed it as a major improvement. However, the AFL-CIO expressed concerns about the new treatment of the helper classification, stating that it could lead to wage-cutting and misclassification practices. In early June, the AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin enforcement of the new Davis-Bacon rules. The AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to prevent the Department of Labor's new rule increasing the ratio of helpers to journeymen, citing concerns about potential wage-cutting and misclassification practices. Judge Harold H. Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the rule, emphasizing the historical context of the Davis-Bacon Act in preventing such practices. The report highlighted how the classification of labor had broken down, leading to skilled wages decreasing towards unskilled levels. It recommended construction contracts specify minimum wages based on prevailing rates for different classes of laborers and mechanics. The new regulations risk allowing what Congress aimed to prevent in 1935 by diluting the concept of distinct labor classes. Under new regulations, helpers in the construction field are no longer defined in traditional terms and can perform any task. This flexibility may lead to contractors assigning helpers tasks of higher skilled workers at lower pay, undermining the requirement for wages to be based on corresponding classes. This dilution of distinct labor classes goes against the recommendations to specify minimum wages based on prevailing rates for different classes of laborers and mechanics. The Wage Appeals Board highlighted concerns that under new regulations, contractors can freely classify traditional craft work as they wish, potentially undermining the Davis-Bacon Act. The use of helpers no longer needs to be prevailing, just identifiable, allowing them to substitute for skilled workers across construction projects. The new regulations allow helpers to substitute for traditional craft workers in construction projects, departing from the central purpose of the Davis-Bacon Act. Judge Greene issued a permanent injunction against the helper rule, noting the significant changes brought about by the regulations. The decision was promptly appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1983. On December 23, 1982, Judge Greene issued a permanent injunction against the helper rule, which was promptly appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1983. The Appeals Court partly upheld and partly overturned the District Court verdict, stating that the provision allowing a helper classification to be 'identifiable' in an area undermines the act's purpose of mirroring local prevailing wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court also highlighted the potential for downgrading work classifications, such as turning \"carpenter work\" into \"carpenter's helper work\" to reduce wages, which Congress viewed as contrary to the act's goals. The Appeals Court reviewed the legislative history of the act and found that underclassification goes against the act's purposes. They supported the Secretary of Labor's new definition of \"helper\" based on supervision rather than tools. The Court split on the helper issue, upholding the \"identifiable\" versus \"prevailing\" practice but accepting the new helper definition. This decision blocked the implementation of the regulation. The Appeals Court split on the helper issue, upholding the \"identifiable\" versus \"prevailing\" practice but accepting the new helper definition. This decision blocked the implementation of the regulation, leading to the unions appealing the decision. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, leaving the Secretary of Labor to restructure the helper regulation for judicial approval. Judge Greene's standard for defining \"prevailing\" remained a problem. The Department proposed several options for determining prevailing classification and called for public comment. After Judge Greene vacated the injunction in September 1990, the Department was able to implement the helper regulation. However, building trades unions filed an appeal almost immediately. Despite the Department's notice that the helper rule would become effective in February 1991, Congress intervened with the \"Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\" bill in April 1991. After Congress intervened with the \"Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations\" bill in April 1991, the Department of Labor was barred from implementing the helper regulations. Despite appeals and requests for funding, the regulations were not implemented, leading to a dispute over whether the restriction was temporary or permanent. The Appeals Court eventually concurred with the Department's definition of \"helper\" and \"prevailing\" in April 1992. The new DOL budget (P.L. 102-170) was signed by President Bush on November 26, 1991, without the requested funding. The Appeals Court ruled that the ratio of helpers to journeymen in the Department's regulations was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and declared it invalid. The matter was sent back to the Department, which issued a new final Davis-Bacon rule on June 24, 1992, removing the problematic section. The Department issued a new final Davis-Bacon rule on June 24, 1992, removing the ratio of helpers to journeymen. This decision was seen as a blow to building trades unions but a victory for industry critics. Debate continued on the wisdom of the helper regulation and its effects on manpower utilization and costs. Calls for major revision or repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act through legislation persisted. The debate continued on the wisdom of the helper regulation in the Davis-Bacon Act, with calls for major revision or repeal through legislation. Efforts to reform through rulemaking were considered, but not seen as a permanent solution due to potential reversals by different administrations. Senator Nickles proposed changes to include \"helpers\" in the act, but the proposal was not adopted. Other attempts to codify the regulations and prevent implementation of the helper provision were unsuccessful. Senator Nickles proposed changes to include \"helpers\" in the Davis-Bacon Act, stating that it would save the federal government nearly $600 million a year on construction costs. He argued that restricting the use of helpers would waste taxpayer money and deny job opportunities to hundreds of thousands of Americans. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, suggesting that the regulations were already a decade old and should be evaluated by the new Clinton Administration. Senator Harkin opposed the Nickles/Craig proposal to delay the implementation of helper regulations, citing concerns about the impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs. He disputed the claimed $600 million in savings and argued for the regulations to be evaluated by the new Clinton Administration. Despite his objections, the committee passed the amendment to suspend the implementation of DOL's helper regulations for one year. The committee's amendment to suspend DOL's helper regulations for one year was passed, despite objections from Senator Harkin. The House Appropriations Committee later defeated a proposal to remove the helper funding restraint. Representative DeLay advocated for the implementation of the Rule to reduce construction costs and create more job opportunities, while Representative Ford argued that the Davis-Bacon requirement ensures quality construction and protects local wages and benefits. The requirement aims to protect local wages and benefits, ensure quality construction, and save money in the long run. Representative Ford argued against the implementation of the regulation, stating that it could undermine apprenticeship training programs and create low-skilled jobs. Despite objections, the DeLay amendment to remove the helper regulations was defeated, retaining the language in the bill. Congress has historically sought to modify the Davis-Bacon Act through various means. The DeLay amendment was defeated by a voice vote, retaining the language prohibiting implementation of the helper regulations in the bill. Congress has historically sought to modify the Davis-Bacon Act through various means, with recent emphasis on repealing the statute. Senator Kassebaum introduced S. 141 for repeal, while Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 for the same purpose. Both bills received mixed receptions and were referred to committees for further consideration. In 1995, Representative Ballenger introduced H.R. 500 for the repeal of the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts. The Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, chaired by Ballenger, voted to report the measure to the full Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. Two additional bills, S. 1183 and H.R. 2472, were introduced as compromises to reform the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Weldon argued against repealing Davis-Bacon, stating it would harm skilled construction workers. The Hatfield and Weldon bills proposed comprehensive revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The Hatfield/Weldon bills proposed revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. The bills did not fully resolve technical issues related to helper classifications and rates. The term \"prevails\" was left undefined, and no ratio of helpers to journeymen was established. This could have led to further court challenges. The Hatfield/Weldon bills proposed revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including provisions for helpers. However, technical issues related to helper classifications and rates were not fully resolved. The term \"prevails\" was left undefined, and no ratio of helpers to journeymen was established. This could have led to further court challenges. In November 1993, the Department suspended the helper regulation under mandate from Congress. The spending prohibition continued until the middle of fiscal 1996, but no such prohibition was imposed for the latter half of fiscal 1996 nor for fiscal 1997. In June 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) brought suit in federal court to require the Department to enforce the revised helper regulations, citing a cost of over $500 million per year to the American taxpayer. The Department quickly responded to ABC President Gary Hess's concerns about the exclusion of helpers in public construction practices, with Assistant Secretary of Labor Bernard Anderson stating that the current helper regulation was non-administrable. The Department had no intention of implementing the regulation in its current form, as clarified in the Federal Register of August 2, 1996. The DOL noted the challenges in distinguishing helpers from other workers and the extended period of suspension of the regulation. The Department of Labor (DOL) first promulgated the helper regulation, which has been suspended for over four years. The DOL stated that additional information has become available, warranting a review of the rule. Concerns were raised about the potential for abuse of the helper classification to justify lower wages. Data showed that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as initially thought. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the potential abuse of the helper classification to justify lower wages and its impact on formal apprenticeship programs. Due to Congressional controversy and lack of public comment, the DOL decided to reexamine the semi-skilled helper regulation and continue the suspension while engaging in substantive rulemaking. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the helper regulation to avoid disruption and uncertainty. They requested public comments and received 47 submissions, mostly addressing substantive issues of the rule. The Building and Construction Trades Department agreed with the suspension, while the Associated General Contractors disagreed, suggesting a quicker implementation process. The Department of Labor disagreed with the Associated General Contractors' suggestion for a quicker implementation process of the helper regulations, stating that it would take longer than 60 days to fully implement. The Department highlighted the need for a 30 to 60 day period for bid solicitations and contract signings after the effective date of the regulations. The Department of Labor stated that implementing the helper regulations would take longer than 60 days, with an additional 30 to 60 days needed for contracts potentially containing helper clauses to be signed. They also mentioned the need for conforming changes in government procurement regulations and standard contract forms, which could take several months. Contractors can only use helpers if the contract contains a wage determination with a helper classification and rate, or if the contractor requests a helper classification to be added and the Department determines it as a prevailing practice in the area. The Department aims to complete substantive rulemaking within a year. The Department of Labor intends to complete substantive rulemaking within a year and has decided to continue the suspension of helper regulations. They are reexamining the basis and effect of semi-skilled helper regulations but have not made a final decision on repealing or amending them. The Department of Labor is reexamining the semi-skilled helper regulations and has not yet decided on any changes. They are concerned about the potential abuse of the helper classification and its impact on formal apprenticeship programs. The Department is exploring the extent of private sector helper utilization and related costs/savings impacts. The Department of Labor is reexamining the helper classification due to concerns about potential abuse and difficulty in enforcement. Critics worry about the impact on formal apprenticeship programs and the incentive for contractors to participate in training programs. The Department of Labor is reexamining the helper classification, with concerns about its impact on formal apprenticeship programs and contractor participation. Some believe helpers provide entry-level opportunities for workers to gain experience and move towards higher-paying jobs. The Department of Labor is reevaluating the helper classification to determine its impact on apprenticeship programs and contractor involvement. The helper regulation is currently suspended pending further rulemaking, with divergent opinions on its role in providing opportunities for workers to gain experience and progress to higher-paying jobs. In 1997, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Department's indefinite suspension of the helper regulations. In July 1997, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor of the Department of Labor's indefinite suspension of the helper regulations. Judge Stanley Sporkin stated that the Department had \"good cause\" for the suspension in 1993 due to a congressional spending ban. He disagreed with the plaintiffs' argument that the regulations had to be implemented once the ban expired in 1996, noting that the Department had the discretion to review and update the regulations as needed. The Department of Labor was allowed to review and update regulations after a two-and-a-half year suspension. New data collected during this time cast doubt on the cost-saving assumptions of the revised helper regulations. Judge Sporkin emphasized the Department's discretion to consider changed circumstances and new information in their decision-making process. Judge Sporkin emphasized the Department's duty to seek an indefinite postponement of the effective date of the revised helper regulations due to new information casting doubt on their cost-saving assumptions. He noted that the plaintiffs focused on the substance of the regulations rather than procedural issues, offering little evidence of arbitrary delays by the Department. Judge Sporkin ruled in favor of the Department of Labor, suspending the helper regulation indefinitely. A new proposed rule was published in the Federal Register in 1999, reinstating the Department's longstanding policy on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The rule would only allow helpers on covered projects where their duties are clearly defined and distinct from other roles. The Wage and Hour Division affirmed the reinstatement of its longstanding policy on the use of helpers on covered projects, with specific criteria for their roles. The notice reviewed Departmental initiatives, including past proposals and court outcomes, as well as constraints imposed by Congress. Despite initial expectations of cost savings and increased job opportunities, after nearly two decades of analysis, the agency had a different perspective. The agency initially believed that reinstating the policy on helpers would lead to cost savings and job opportunities for unskilled workers. However, after extensive analysis, it was found that the rule could not be effectively enforced and may have a negative impact on apprenticeship and training programs. The Department concluded that the suspended regulation posed significant administrative difficulties and would revert to pre-1980s practices. The Department found that the suspended regulation on helpers could not be effectively enforced due to significant administrative difficulties. The definition of \"helper\" was criticized as internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from that of a general laborer. Wage and Hour struggled with issues such as identifying the line between semi-skilled and skilled workers, determining when a semi-skilled helper could become a skilled worker, and whether a skilled worker could work as a semi-skilled helper without violating regulations. The Department dissected the provisions of the suspended rule on helpers, arguing that the definition provided little guidance for distinguishing between semi-skilled helpers and journeyworkers. The rule allowed for significant overlap between the duties of helpers and laborers, making it difficult to identify distinctions. The Department criticized the suspended rule for its lack of clarity in distinguishing between semi-skilled helpers and journeyworkers, highlighting the significant overlap in duties between helpers and laborers. The subjective nature of the term \"helper\" in the construction industry was also noted, making it challenging to conduct a meaningful wage determination process for helpers. The Department found that the assumption of widespread use of helpers in the construction industry was overstated, as survey data showed their use was substantially lower than previously thought. The Department also emphasized the effectiveness of formal apprenticeship training programs in producing skilled and productive workers. Encouraging training for unskilled workers has been a key objective in Davis-Bacon implementation considerations. The Department emphasized the importance of apprenticeship programs in producing skilled workers and encouraging training for unskilled workers, including women and minorities. The proposed new helper rule aimed to prevent contractors from using helpers instead of apprentices in formal training programs. Representative Norwood introduced legislation to establish new regulations. In the 105th Congress, Representative Norwood introduced legislation to establish a separate classification for \"helpers of laborers and mechanics\" under the Davis-Bacon Act. The bill aimed to ensure that helpers are paid the prevailing wage on similar projects. In the 106th Congress, Norwood reintroduced the proposal, defining a helper as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman in various tasks. Introduced in March 1999, a bill was proposed to establish a separate classification for \"helpers of laborers and mechanics\" under the Davis-Bacon Act. The Department of Labor (DOL) reviewed the legislation and concluded that it was imprecise and would result in administrative burdens. In November 2000, DOL issued a final rule recognizing helpers as a separate category of workers on Davis-Bacon projects. The Department of Labor amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers under the Davis-Bacon Act. The regulation took effect in January 2001, with the Department explaining the difficulties in administering the suspended rule's definition of helpers. The AFL-CIO agreed with the Department's duties-based approach, while industry spokespersons disagreed, suggesting easier identification of helper classes through area practice surveys. Laborers and mechanics are entitled to be paid the prevailing rate for their work according to local standards. The Department amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers under the Davis-Bacon Act. It reasoned that helpers could overlap with other classifications, making it difficult to identify their work for enforcement and wage determination purposes. This change in policy aimed to prevent helpers from performing work of other classifications at lower wages, thus preserving the prevailing wage structure. The Department of Labor (DOL) expressed concerns about the definitional ambiguities and challenges in drawing the line between semi-skilled and skilled work, especially in today's construction market. DOL highlighted the difficulty in objectively evaluating supervision on a construction worksite and the potential for skilled craft workers and laborers to perform a range of duties. The suspended rule regarding helpers would have undermined the prevailing wage structure by allowing them to perform work of other classifications at lower wages. The Department of Labor (DOL) expressed concerns about the definitional ambiguities and challenges in evaluating supervision on a construction worksite. The suspended rule regarding helpers raised issues with wage determination processes and enforcement. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University acknowledged enforcement difficulties but highlighted potential productivity and cost-saving benefits. The Department emphasized the need to protect prevailing wages despite cost-saving features. The Department of Labor (DOL) argued that cost-saving features should not determine regulations if they conflict with the goal of protecting prevailing wages. They found that the use of helpers was less prevalent than previously thought, contradicting earlier projections. The Department of Labor (DOL) found that the use of helpers in construction was not as widespread as previously assumed, with only 3.9% of classifications using helpers. Estimates of helpers employed in construction ranged from 1.2% to slightly higher percentages. The DOL expressed concerns that suspending the helper rule could negatively impact formal apprenticeship and training programs in the construction industry. The Department of Labor (DOL) found that suspending the helper rule in construction could have a negative impact on formal apprenticeship and training programs. Building trades unions argued that allowing contractors to use low-wage helpers instead of apprentices would undermine the training program and lead to a shortage of skilled craft workers. Employers disputed this claim, stating that there is no basis for the argument. Employers disputed the Department of Labor's concern that suspending the helper rule in construction would lead to a shortage of skilled craft workers. They argued that there is no basis for this claim and suggested a preference for helpers over apprentices. The Department, however, maintained that formal structured training programs are more effective than informal on-the-job training alone. They expressed concern that the use of helpers could replace apprentices and trainees enrolled in formal programs, posing a significant risk to apprenticeship and training programs on Davis-Bacon projects. The Department of Labor restored the definition of \"helper\" after concerns that suspending the rule would undermine formal apprenticeship and training programs on construction projects covered by the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. The final rule now requires a distinct classification of \"helper\" in wage determinations only if their duties are clearly defined, their use is a prevailing practice, and they are not employed as trainees in informal programs. In the early 2000s, legislation was introduced in Congress regarding the classification of helpers in the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Norwood and later Representative Blackburn introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" to establish helpers as a separate classification for wage purposes on construction projects. The \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" proposed by Representative Blackburn aimed to establish helpers as a separate classification for wage purposes on construction projects under the Davis-Bacon Act. The bill defined helpers as semi-skilled workers who assist journeyman mechanics and may use tools under supervision. Despite being reintroduced in the 109th Congress, no action was taken on the measure. Blackburn and Representative Norwood reintroduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" (H.R. 3907) but no action was taken on the measure. The issue of helpers has not reemerged during the 110th Congress, while the Davis-Bacon Act remains a focus of public policy debate. The act underwent substantive review in the 1960s and saw changes in prevailing wage regulations in 1964. Further review occurred in the late 1970s during the Carter Administration. The review of Davis-Bacon regulations in the late 1970s during the Carter Administration led to rulemaking that continued into the Reagan Administration. Litigation followed the proposed regulations, with the helper provision gaining court approval in 1992. Congress intervened in 1996, blocking enforcement of the helper regulation. The Department of Labor (DOL) eventually declared the regulation \"non-administrable\" and suspended it for further review in December 1996. In response to a court order, the Department of Labor suspended the enforcement of a regulation in December 1996. New evidence led to a reassessment of the regulation, resulting in a proposed rule in April 1999. The final helper rule was published on November 20, 2000, taking effect on January 19, 2001. The Department of Labor reinstated its longstanding practice regarding the use of helpers after a lengthy process spanning over two decades. The final helper rule was published on November 20, 2000, just before the end of the Clinton Administration, effectively reverting to the 1970s practice for helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The Department of Labor reversed its policy on helpers in November 2000, abandoning the previous documentation. Congress debated and endorsed a new helper classification, but a proposed bill recognizing helpers on Davis-Bacon projects did not pass in the 109th Congress. The issue has not resurfaced in the 110th Congress."
