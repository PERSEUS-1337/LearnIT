SEC. 54. TAX TO BE STATED AND CHARGED SEPARATELY. The sales tax must be charged separately from the purchase price by the vendor. A receipt provided to the purchaser should include details such as the price exclusive of tax, amount of tax paid, price inclusive of tax, tax rate, date of sale, vendor's name, and registration number. Vending machine sales are exempt from these requirements. The vending machine exception exempts sales made through vending machines from the requirement to separately charge sales tax. Vending machines must dispense taxable items for coins or bills up to twenty dollars, with no single item exceeding ten dollars in price. SEC. 55 allows for installment agreements and compromises for tax liabilities to facilitate collection. The agreement remains valid unless inaccurate information is provided. SEC. 56 outlines the use of the cash method for tax remittance and reporting, with an option to elect the accrual method for invoiced sales. SEC. 57 states that the exemption for taxable property or services used by a trade or business is not available if the business is not operated for profit. If the business has received gross payments exceeding certain expenses in 2 of the last 4 years, it is deemed to be engaged in for profit. The Internal Revenue Service is not authorized to use appropriations for certain expenses, including processing income tax returns. New subsections are added to Section 7801 for the Excise Tax Bureau and Sales Tax Bureau within the Department of Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury can appoint up to 5 assistant general counsels. The Secretary of the Treasury can appoint up to 5 Assistant General Counsels without regard to civil service laws. For taxable years ending June 30, 1999, modifications to Federal income tax are outlined, including adjustments to dollar figures for calendar and fiscal year taxpayers. The Secretary will publish tax rate schedules based on the ratio of months in the taxpayer's taxable year ending June 30, 1999, to 12. Starting January 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration will collect payroll taxes. Section 7 of the Act pertains to self-employment tax. For revised rules on self-employment tax, refer to section 7, and for revised withholding tax schedules and family consumption refund rules, see section 13. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define 'self-employment income' as gross payments received in a calendar year from the sale of taxable property or services, minus purchases of taxable property or services, wages paid in furtherance of a business purpose, unused transition amounts, and undeducted negative self-employment income amounts from prior periods. Transition amounts for the ten calendar years starting in 1999 are calculated based on the unrecovered basis amount as of December 31, 1998. The unrecovered basis amount pertains to income tax basis for prior law section 167 property placed in service before January 1, 1999, and inventory held at the end of 1998. Conforming amendments repeal subsections 1402(b) and 1402(c), while renumbering subsections 1402(d) et seq. as subsections 1402(b) et seq. Social Security benefits will be indexed on a sales tax inclusive basis. The amendment to the Social Security Act now includes the calculation of the CPI increase percentage for cost-of-living adjustments, taking into account the Consumer Price Index and national sales tax. The base quarter or cost-of-living quarter in any calendar year is determined by the percentage of the Consumer Price Index for that quarter and the national sales tax factor. The national sales tax factor is calculated as one plus the sales tax rate divided by one minus the sales tax rate. SEC. 9. COMPENSATING PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN PERSONS ON FIXED INCOME. Compensating Payment: Eligible persons receive a compensating payment if they comply with the application requirements. The payment is calculated based on the qualified fixed income payment amount and the excess inflation rate. An eligible person is someone who receives Social Security benefits and qualified fixed income payments. Qualified fixed income payments are received through a defined benefit plan or an annuity contract with an insurance company. The qualified fixed income payment amount is determined based on fixed income payments received through a defined benefit plan or annuity contract. Payments that vary with investment performance, interest rates, or inflation are not considered qualified. Payments from annuity contracts entered into after June 30, 1999, are also not qualified. Additionally, payments to beneficiaries who were participants in a defined benefit plan for less than 5 years are not considered qualified fixed income payments. The qualified fixed income payment amount for an eligible person cannot exceed $5,000 per year. An eligible person can receive compensating payments up to $5,000 per year, with excess inflation rate defined as the difference between actual and projected consumer price index. To receive payments, applicants must apply as per the Secretary's requirements, and payments will be received alongside Social Security benefits. Each person entitled to compensating payments will receive them with their Social Security benefit payment, funded from the general fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may require insurers and defined benefit plan sponsors to provide necessary information for determining qualified fixed income payment amounts. SEC. 10 amends the Internal Revenue Code by adjusting interest rates. SEC. 11 requires a supermajority vote in Congress to raise federal sales tax rates or provide tax benefits resulting in revenue reduction."
