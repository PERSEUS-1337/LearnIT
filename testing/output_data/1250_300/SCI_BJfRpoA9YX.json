    "content": "We propose a novel generative model architecture that learns to separate object identity from attributes in images. This allows for manipulation of image attributes without changing the object's identity. The model successfully synthesizes images with and without specific attributes and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. The model achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks by manipulating image attributes through latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs. This allows for semantically meaningful changes in images, such as editing existing images or synthesizing avatars. Latent space generative models can be used to manipulate image attributes, allowing for semantically meaningful changes like editing images or synthesizing avatars. Research has focused on class conditional image synthesis, but a new approach aims to manipulate specific elements or attributes of image content, such as changing a person's expression in a synthesized face. In this paper, the authors address the problem of image attribute manipulation by proposing a new model that learns a factored representation for faces. They aim to synthesize images with only one attribute changed, such as a person's expression, rather than creating entirely different faces. Their core contribution is a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to separate binary facial attribute information from a continuous identity representation. The authors introduce a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to factorize binary facial attributes from a continuous identity representation. They provide quantitative analysis of loss components, competitive classification scores, successful 'Smiling' attribute editing in over 90% of cases, and code for experiment reproduction. They discuss the distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing. Latent space generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) allow synthesis of novel data samples from latent encodings. VAE consists of an encoder and decoder, trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x). The encoder predicts \u00b5 and \u03c3 for a given input x, and new data samples are generated by calculating the reconstruction error. By choosing a multivariate Gaussian prior, the KL-divergence can be calculated analytically. VAEs offer a generative model and an encoding model for image editing in the latent space. However, VAE samples are often blurred. An alternative model for sharper images is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consisting of a generator and discriminator implemented using convolutional neural networks. GAN training involves a mini-max game between the two networks. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) involves a mini-max game between a discriminator and a generator, implemented using convolutional neural networks. The objective is for the generator to synthesize samples that confuse the discriminator, with the distribution of synthesized samples sampled from a chosen prior distribution. The approach presented allows data samples to be faithfully reconstructed through adversarial training on high dimensional distributions. The approach involves combining a VAE with a GAN for attribute editing, ensuring high quality data samples outputted from the decoder. Various suggestions exist on how to merge VAEs and GANs, each with different structures and loss functions, but none specifically designed for attribute editing. The content of synthesized image samples depends on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution, resembling training data samples when the model is well-trained. Conditional VAEs and GANs provide a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples by incorporating label information into the encoder and decoder models. A more advanced approach involves the encoder outputting both a latent vector and an attribute vector, minimizing a classification loss between the true label and the attribute vector. Incorporating attribute information in autoencoders can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. Modifying the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector may not always result in the intended changes, suggesting that attribute information is partially contained in the latent vector. This issue has been addressed in the GAN literature, where label information is sometimes ignored during sample generation. Incorporating attribute information in autoencoders can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. The proposed 'Adversarial Information Factorization' process aims to separate information about attributes from the latent vector using a mini-max optimization involving the encoder, auxiliary network, and attribute vector. This process is necessary when the latent vector contains information that should be encoded within the attribute vector. The proposed method aims to separate attribute information from the latent vector in a VAE-GAN model by training an auxiliary network to predict the attribute accurately while updating the encoder to output values that cause the auxiliary network to fail. This adversarial approach helps factorize the label information out of the latent encoding, ensuring that the desired attribute is encoded within the attribute vector. The proposed method integrates a novel factorization technique into a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality by separating label information from the latent encoding. An auxiliary network is introduced to predict attributes accurately, while the encoder is updated to deceive the auxiliary network. This adversarial approach ensures that the desired attribute is encoded within the attribute vector. The encoder parameters for synthesizing images can be updated by minimizing a function with regularization coefficients. An additional network and cost function are proposed for training an encoder for attribute manipulation. The model includes a VAE with information factorization and a GAN architecture with a discriminator. The encoder parameters are updated to classify samples as \"fake\" or \"real\" in a conditional VAE-GAN model. An auxiliary network is introduced to factor out label information from the latent space, promoting the encoder to avoid encoding attribute information. This approach, called Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN), is trained using a mini-max objective to confuse the auxiliary network. The encoder loss is determined by the inability of the auxiliary network to predict the true label from the latent output. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) is trained using a mini-max objective to confuse the auxiliary network. Attribute manipulation in the representation space is achieved by encoding images to obtain an identity representation and appending it to the desired attribute label for synthesis. Quantitative and qualitative results are presented to evaluate the model, followed by an ablation study and facial attribute classification using a standard DCGAN architecture. The study involves using a cVAE-GAN model for facial attribute classification and image attribute editing. Residual layers are incorporated to improve classification results. The model is evaluated qualitatively, showing its potential for image attribute manipulation. Two key aspects evaluated are reconstruction quality and the proportion of edited images with desired attributes. When performing image attribute manipulation, two important aspects are quantified: reconstruction quality measured by mean squared error (MSE) and the proportion of edited images with desired attributes. An independent classifier is trained on real images to classify attribute presence. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function is crucial for attribute editing, as without it, the model fails completely. Including a classification loss on reconstructed samples aims to maximize information content but does not contribute to attribute information factorization. The model proposed in the current text chunk aims to separate the representation of identity and facial attributes in faces by minimizing mutual information between them. This approach differs from existing methods like IcGAN, which focus on attribute editing tasks but do not factorize attribute information effectively. The model encourages putting label information into \u0177 rather than \u1e91, making it potentially useful for facial attribute classification. The model in the current text chunk focuses on separating facial attributes from identity representation by minimizing mutual information between them. It demonstrates competitive performance in facial attribute classification compared to a state-of-the-art classifier. The model effectively factorizes attribute information from identity representation, as shown in the results. The section also discusses attribute manipulation by reconstructing input images for different attribute values. The model focuses on attribute manipulation by reconstructing input images for different attribute values. It highlights the challenges of editing desired attributes and the importance of learning a factored latent representation while maintaining good reconstruction quality. The model achieves good reconstruction quality by learning a factored latent representation. It outperforms a state-of-the-art classifier in facial attribute classification. The model uses specific weightings on loss terms and hyperparameters, resulting in successful synthesis of images with desired attributes. Our model, the IFcVAE-GAN, outperforms the naive cVAE-GAN in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute with a 98% success rate. This demonstrates the model's ability to achieve good reconstruction while changing desired attributes, unlike other conditional models. Both models have comparable reconstruction errors, but only our model can synthesize images without smiles. Our model, the IFcVAE-GAN, can synthesize images of faces without smiles and manipulate other facial attributes successfully. The model learns to factor attributes from identity and benefits from using an auxiliary classifier. The IFcVAE-GAN model learns to factor attributes from identity, benefits from using an auxiliary classifier, and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks. It incorporates adversarial training to factorize attribute label information from the encoded latent representation. Similar approaches by Schmidhuber and BID16 also factorize latent space, but BID16's encoder does not predict attribute information. BID4 proposed predicting mutual information between latent representations and labels, while our model minimizes it via adversarial information factorization. Our work, similar to cVAE-GAN architecture by BID3, focuses on synthesizing specific attributes in images. Unlike BID3, our model simultaneously learns a classifier for input images and acknowledges the importance of \"identity preservation\" in the latent space. Our model focuses on attribute editing in images, emphasizing the importance of preserving identity in the latent space. Unlike other works, we highlight the need to factor label information out of the latent encoding for successful attribute editing. In this paper, the focus is on attribute editing in images by preserving identity in the latent space and factoring label information out of the encoding. The approach involves using a single generative model to edit attributes by changing a single unit in the encoding. This method is more resource-efficient compared to image-to-image models for domain adaptation. The approach involves editing attributes in images by changing a single unit in the encoding, allowing for modifications to elements or attributes of the image. This method focuses on preserving identity in the latent space and factoring label information out of the encoding. The model is demonstrated on images of human faces but is generalizable to other objects. The method involves modeling a human face with separate representations for identity and attributes, allowing for easy attribute editing without affecting identity. The proposed model, Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, encourages attribute information to be factored out of the identity representation through adversarial learning. It outperforms existing models for category conditional image synthesis and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on facial classification. Our model for category conditional image synthesis has been validated through a detailed ablation study, confirming its effectiveness as a classifier with state-of-the-art accuracy on facial attribute classification. The approach of learning factored representations for images is a significant contribution to representation learning. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of certain loss functions and regularization techniques for achieving good results. In an ablation study, results show that small amounts of KL regularization are necessary for good reconstruction in the IFcVAE-GAN model. Training without L gan results in slightly lower reconstruction error but blurred images. Even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can still accurately edit attributes, although sample visual quality is poor. The model uses labeled data to learn factored representations, while other models can learn disentangled representations from unlabeled data. These models can be evaluated by training a linear classifier on latent encodings for facial attribute classification. The representation learned by various variational autoencoder models, including BID28, BID14, and BID5, can be evaluated using a linear classifier on latent encodings for facial attribute classification. The performance of the classifier is compared to a linear classifier trained on latent representations from a DIP-VAE model, known for learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data."
