It includes provisions for research funding, early career grants, ARPA-E, and Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for research funding, early career grants, ARPA-E, and Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories. These programs include education scholarship and training programs for K-12 STEM teachers, student-focused STEM programs, and new STEM education activities at various agencies. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education activities at ED, DOE, and NSF, including summer term programs, director positions, fellowship programs, and professional master's programs. It also includes White House efforts to foster innovation and competitiveness through summits, medals, and councils. Scientific and technological advances are crucial for economic growth and competitiveness in the global economy. Scientific and technological advances are essential for economic growth and competitiveness. Advances contribute to creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital, as well as increasing productivity. Various factors influence technological progress, including scientific advances, government activity, firm organization, and serendipity. The U.S. has used a combination of direct and indirect policy approaches to enhance competitiveness since World War II. The Steelman report expressed concerns about future competition, leading to increased interest in competitiveness in the 1970s. During World War II, the Steelman report raised concerns about U.S. competitiveness, anticipating future competition from other economies. By the 1970s, experts worried about the U.S. losing market share in various industries to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries. Indicators of declining U.S. technological superiority included lower productivity growth, a narrowing gap in scientists and engineers, and a decline in patents. The U.S. faced challenges in maintaining technological superiority compared to Japan and West Germany, with concerns about declining numbers of scientists, engineers, and patents. Congress responded by passing various acts to boost innovation and competitiveness, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act and the Bayh-Dole Act. Additionally, the SEMATECH consortium was established to support the semiconductor industry. In response to competitiveness concerns, various congressional acts were passed in the 1980s to boost innovation, including the creation of SEMATECH to support the semiconductor industry. By the mid-1990s, the U.S. economy and technological innovation improved, leading to success in industries like Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. In the 21st century, U.S. competitiveness is focused on globalization, federal research funding, STEM education, and the impact of international markets on American companies and workers. Increasing integration with the world economy can boost productivity and living standards. The globalization of the economy has a significant impact on American companies, workers, and families. Integration with the world economy can increase productivity and living standards, but also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages. Technology, increased global labor supply, and government policies are key factors driving globalization. The America COMPETES Act addresses these trends by authorizing direct measures in policy areas related to globalization. The America COMPETES Act addresses globalization trends by authorizing direct measures in policy areas related to trade, investment, technology, and labor. It increases federal funding for basic research in key fields and supports high-risk research and development at small and medium-sized businesses to enhance competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act focuses on job creation, funding high-risk research at small businesses, and improving the competitiveness of the U.S. labor pool. It addresses concerns about STEM education by increasing the quality and quantity of STEM teachers and encouraging more students to pursue STEM degrees. Additionally, the act authorizes measures to identify actions the U.S. can take to improve trade and investment policies. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve U.S. competitiveness by encouraging industry investment in research and development, promoting joint research activities, and facilitating technology transfer. While some experts support the Act, others doubt its effectiveness in addressing competitiveness concerns. The definition of competitiveness can vary depending on the perspective of domestic firms, multinational corporations, or domestic labor. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve U.S. competitiveness by encouraging industry investment in research and development, promoting joint research activities, and facilitating technology transfer. The definition of competitiveness can vary depending on the perspective of domestic firms, multinational corporations, or domestic labor. For individual domestic firms, competitiveness is focused on trade and the ability to compete for market share against imports or foreign firms in export markets. The U.S. trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002, growing roughly ten billion dollars per year from $16.6 billion to $43.6 billion between 2002 and 2005. The U.S. trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in 2002, growing roughly ten billion dollars per year from $16.6 billion to $55.5 billion in 2008. This deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the high technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies with overseas production facilities. However, the growing deficit may warrant closer policy scrutiny. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined after 2000 but rebounded by 2006. Competitiveness is measured by firms investing resources in the US or other countries. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete in export markets. Key measures for domestic labor are employment levels and wages. The US is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments. Investment by U.S. firms abroad was $249 billion in 2006, with concerns about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages. Most economists believe that direct investment abroad does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans. NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations. The NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations, but this classification does not include all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in their jobs. Some professionals, like teachers and managers, are not counted in the analysis of the science and engineering workforce. Additionally, there are those in science- and engineering-related occupations who may not have degrees in the field, such as patent attorneys or physicians. The need for science and engineering knowledge has expanded to various occupations beyond traditional S&E roles. The need for science and engineering knowledge has expanded to various occupations beyond traditional roles. The science and engineering workforce could be considerably larger than government analyses suggest, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. This includes individuals with degrees in science and engineering fields, as well as related fields like health or technology. The National Science Board highlights the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States. The National Science Board highlights the diverse ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006. Statistical analysts find it challenging to account for the need of all workers to have a basic understanding of STEM and the changing skills needed for employment due to computerization. The analysis found that computerization has shifted tasks from routine manual and cognitive to high-level tasks, leading to increased demand for college-educated workers. The number of workers in science and engineering occupations has grown significantly, outpacing the overall labor force growth. Recent data shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the workforce, but projections indicate growth in science and engineering occupations. The data from BLS shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with faster growth expected in computer-related occupations, life sciences, social sciences, and other related fields. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. Compensation for most STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force average, ranging from $53,000. The compensation for STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force average, ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per annum. The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased by 15% from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree were $65,000, higher than non-S&E bachelor's degree recipients. Variance exists among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields. Traditional measures of competitiveness may not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness highlights that traditional measures of competitiveness, such as trade balance and employment levels, do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, global supply chain fragmentation, and intangibles like knowledge and intellectual property are not considered. They suggest that assessing an individual's prosperity should include factors like pension funds, real estate, and purchasing power, and ensuring prosperity is equitable across society. The America COMPETES Act aims to improve STEM education in the United States by addressing the lack of proficiency among K-12 students and the need for more individuals to pursue STEM fields. It emphasizes the importance of STEM knowledge for all Americans and the potential for a better-trained workforce through enhanced STEM education. The United States needs more individuals to pursue STEM fields to stay competitive economically. STEM degrees lead to new industries and job opportunities beyond traditional roles. Current funding for science and engineering research is insufficient compared to other countries, hindering U.S. competitiveness. Additional federal funding in these areas will create new industries and enhance existing ones, making the nation more competitive. Assumptions in K-12 STEM education are based on various analyses. For instance, a study compared U.S. students' scores in science and mathematics literacy to international peers, revealing lower scores for American students. Inadequate teacher preparation and curriculum deficiencies contribute to lower scores for American middle-schoolers. The U.S. has one of the lowest rates of first university degrees awarded in STEM fields globally. In 2002, STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States compared to an international average of 26.4%. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the National Science Foundation estimate the impact of research and development investment on economic growth. Some question the exclusive benefits of U.S. research investments and whether other countries can benefit as well. STEM education is seen as a state and local issue, raising questions about the sufficiency of federal research investments. Some question the exclusive benefits of U.S. research investments and whether other countries can benefit as well. STEM education is seen as a state and local issue, raising questions about the sufficiency of federal research investments. Concerns also arise about the impact of federal investments in research and STEM education on job creation for all Americans, not just scientists and engineers. Additionally, doubts are raised about the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education, with some questioning the need for additional scientists and engineers in the workforce. Some analysts question the need for additional scientists and engineers in the United States, doubting the necessity of enhancing U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education. Concerns also focus on the potential unintended consequences of increased funding, such as an oversupply of scientists and engineers. Proponents suggest both direct measures, like increased funding, and indirect measures, such as tax policy, to address policymakers' concerns about U.S. competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act and the ACI were proposed to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness. Proponents debate between direct government assistance and indirect market-based measures for technology development. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in 2006 to tackle economic competition with other nations. The America COMPETES Act and the ACI were introduced to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness in science and technology. Provisions in both acts included increased research funding at NSF, NIST, and DOE, as well as STEM education programs. The America COMPETES Act also authorized funding for new research organizations like ARPA-E and expressed a goal for agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward research. The America COMPETES Act calls for increased funding for research in science and engineering, with a focus on high-risk, high-reward projects. It also emphasizes the importance of funding NASA at authorized levels to boost U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The act authorizes funding increases for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science over FY2008-2010, with potential doubling of funding if maintained beyond 2010. This aligns with recommendations from the National Academies to increase federal investment in long-term basic research by 10% annually over seven years. The America COMPETES Act is based on the National Academies report, calling for a 10% annual increase in federal investment in basic research over seven years. This is necessary due to stagnant funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences. High-potential high-risk research is less likely to be supported when funding is flat, and corporations are unlikely to fill this gap. The National Academies committee reviewed proposals before recommending the funding increase. The National Academies committee recommended a 10% annual increase in federal investment in basic research over seven years, citing the need for greater benefits to society and the riskiness of such research. This recommendation was based on the stagnant funding in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences, with the goal of striking a balance between urgency and efficiency in applying new funds. The Administration's chosen 7% annual rate for doubling research activities over 10 years was not explained, despite the limited funding available and the importance of federally funded science for long-term economic competitiveness. The Administration acknowledges limited funding for federally funded science, with a consensus on its importance for economic competitiveness. The National Academies' report recommended increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, even suggesting reallocating existing funds if necessary. The American Competitiveness Initiative proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasized NASA's participation in interagency efforts. The American Competitiveness Initiative proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasized NASA's participation in interagency efforts to promote innovation and economic competitiveness. The act also highlighted the importance of robust funding for NASA to contribute significantly to U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The Senate and House appropriations committees are concerned about the lack of balance in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA, with insufficient funds for important initiatives like the President's Vision for Space Exploration. The National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources, and calls for a reevaluation of NASA's tasks and resources. The America COMPETES Act urges executive research agencies to allocate a percentage of basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects. The America COMPETES Act encourages executive research agencies to allocate a portion of basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects that address fundamental challenges and involve multidisciplinary work. This provision aims to address concerns that current funding review mechanisms may not be open to new, unproven ideas. Researchers are hesitant to submit radical ideas due to low success rates, as highlighted by the National Science Board and the National Institutes of Health. The National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are facing challenges in funding radical and paradigm-shifting research ideas due to low success rates. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the need for transformative research at NSF, prompting a review of current practices to support such proposals. The Pioneer's Award by NIH aims to foster high-risk research projects. The Foundation will provide reports on supporting transformational proposals, with a focus on defining transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E to develop technologies for energy security and efficiency. ARPA-E aims to promote revolutionary advances in energy technology projects. ARPA-E, based on the DARPA model, aims to promote revolutionary advances in energy technology projects by translating scientific discoveries into technological innovations. It seeks to accelerate transformational technological advances in areas that industry may not undertake due to technical and financial uncertainty. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including an advanced civilian technology agency in the 100th and 101st Congresses. Several initiatives have been proposed in the past to create a civilian technology agency for energy research, including recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences and proposals from the Progressive Policy Institute. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also suggested the establishment of a civilian advanced research agency focused on renewable technologies and fuels. ARPA-E, inspired by DARPA, aims to bring innovation and attract top talent to energy research. The report proposes creating an ARPA-like organization for energy research to focus on transformative projects that industry won't support. It suggests starting ARPA-E funding at $300 million and increasing to $1 billion over five to six years, with a focus on bridging gaps between research, development, and innovation. The report proposes funding ARPA-E starting at $300 million, increasing to $1 billion over five to six years. The National Academies committee emphasizes the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. Details of ARPA-E's organization and mission should be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Under Secretary for Science in consultation with experts. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories for technological innovations. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations.

The Math Now program aims to improve math instruction for elementary and middle school students by providing teachers with research-based tools and professional development. Additionally, the Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) Program seeks to expand low-income students' access to AP/IB coursework by training more high school teachers in math, science, and critical foreign languages. Increased support is also provided for existing NSF programs such as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, STEM talent expansion program (STEP), and Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. The America COMPETES Act programs aim to increase the number of students receiving STEM degrees through initiatives like STEP, ATE, GRF, and IGERT. Congress debates the management of these programs by the DOE and National Laboratories, with the Administration opposing some STEM initiatives. The America COMPETES Act includes programs such as Specialty Schools in Math and Science, Experiential-based Learning Opportunities, Summer Institutes, and National Laboratories Centers of Excellence. There is a debate over whether these programs should be a DOE responsibility, with proponents arguing that interacting with DOE scientists and engineers can inspire students and teachers in STEM education. Specialty schools for math and science are public secondary schools aimed at improving academic achievement in science and mathematics. Supporters believe these schools can serve as a \"nucleus of excellence\" in attracting and inspiring the best students and teachers. Supporters argue that specialty schools in math and science can be a \"nucleus of excellence\" in attracting and inspiring students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM fields. Proponents believe that these programs make a significant impact on education quality. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education aim to assist teachers in high-need public secondary schools by providing access to laboratory equipment. The Administration emphasizes the importance of improving existing efforts before starting new programs. The America COMPETES Act authorizes STEM education programs at DOE national laboratories for high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes diverting resources from national laboratories for school-based centers, while proponents argue that these programs inspire teachers and students. The Act reauthorizes existing STEM programs at NSF and establishes a new program, with opposition from the Administration on funding increases. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes NSF's role in promoting quality math and science education. The NSF STEM education programs, including the Noyce Program, aim to promote quality math and science education at all levels across the U.S. Increasing the number of qualified K-12 math and science teachers is crucial for innovation. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program encourages STEM students to become teachers and awards grants to institutions for this purpose. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Noyce program, totaling $15,000,000. The Noyce program awards grants to STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers. Students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for service in high-need school districts. The program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach, using master teachers as role models. The Noyce program awards grants to STEM students to become K-12 math and science teachers, emphasizing practical training and preparation for high-need fields. Universities have shifted their focus to prepare students for education careers, not just research, and utilize master teachers as role models. Additionally, a new NSF program provides grants to institutions for professional science master's degree programs to meet industry workforce needs. Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs have been developed to meet industry workforce needs by providing advanced training in science or mathematics along with workplace skills. These programs, guided by industry input, typically last two years and include academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications.

President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee subcommittee. The act also mandates a National Science and Technology Summit to assess U.S. science and technology enterprises, with OSTP submitting budget priorities related to the summit's recommendations. Additionally, OSTP is tasked with developing principles for data exchange among federal scientists and engineers. The America COMPETES Act directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop principles for data exchange among federal scientists and engineers. In response, the Bush Administration issued a memorandum emphasizing the importance of open communication of scientific information to advance science and inform society. NASA's science communications policy is highlighted as a model for other federal agencies. The NASA policy emphasizes open communication of scientific information to the scientific community, policymakers, and the public. Exceptions exist for privileged information. The America COMPETES Act designated actions for OSTP, including a study on barriers to innovation and a National Technology and Innovation Medal. Dr. John Holdren was confirmed as OSTP Director in 2009 after a Senate hearing. During his nomination hearing, Dr. John Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress. He pledged to work with federal agencies to prevent censorship or distortion of scientific information for ideological reasons. Dr. Holdren emphasized the need for scientific integrity in the federal government, citing the America Competes Act's requirement for open communication of data and results from federal scientists. President Obama issued a memorandum on Scientific Integrity in 2009 assigning responsibility to ensure integrity in all executive aspects to the OSTP. President Obama assigned the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) the responsibility for ensuring scientific integrity in the executive branch. Within 120 days, the Director was tasked with developing recommendations for Presidential action to guarantee integrity based on key principles. These principles include selecting candidates based on knowledge and experience, establishing rules for scientific integrity within agencies, and ensuring accurate reflection of scientific information in policy decisions. Each agency should ensure that scientific or technological information used in policy decisions undergoes proper scientific processes, including peer review. Agencies must make these findings available to the public, address any compromises to the scientific process, and adopt additional procedures to safeguard the integrity of scientific information. Each agency must provide necessary information to ensure the integrity of scientific processes. Coordination with the Director is required for developing interim procedures. Funding details for America COMPETES Act programs are summarized in Table 2. The America COMPETES Act programs received funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act, with some programs funded at authorized levels while others were not. The future funding levels for programs like ARPA-E are uncertain, which may pose challenges for institutions and individuals. Lack of specific appropriations does not necessarily mean a program is unfunded. The America COMPETES Act programs may not be funded as the budget proposed by the Bush and Obama administrations did not align with the Act. New programs like DOE Pilot Program and National Energy Education Development are uncertain in terms of funding. The America COMPETES Act programs face uncertainty in funding levels for FY2010, with some newly authorized programs not receiving proposed funding. The Obama Administration requested funding below authorized levels, citing FY2009 ARRA funding as the highest in U.S. history.

The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the United States' first-place ranking in international competitiveness. Evaluation mechanisms assess the nation's ability to compete with other countries using inputs, outputs, and outcomes. However, there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness, as numerous indicators of innovation activity are available but may not provide an accurate assessment. The evaluation of innovation and competitiveness is complex, as various indicators may not accurately assess a nation's innovation or competitiveness. Factors like necessity, serendipity, and market demand can also drive innovation, regardless of research and development funding. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all play a significant role in funding R&D and innovation, but there is no guarantee that increased spending will lead to innovative technologies. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities are key players in funding R&D and innovation. Differentiating between research and development funding is important. University-industry cooperation serves as a liaison between basic research and industry. Analyzing non-defense R&D may provide a different perspective. Industry R&D investment nature, such as research versus development funding and sector focus, is crucial. The nature of industry R&D investment is crucial, with a focus on funding allocation between research and development, as well as specific industrial sectors. Patent data may not fully capture innovation, as not all outcomes are patentable. The number of scientists and engineers may not directly reflect a nation's innovative capacity. Government policy aims to create an environment conducive to innovation and competitiveness. Government policy focuses on creating an environment for innovation to thrive, aiming to enhance competitiveness. Monitoring and assessments are crucial for making policy adjustments as other nations also work to improve their innovation environments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a key role in monitoring and advising on global trends, identifying opportunities, and developing metrics for measuring effectiveness. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness advises on global trends in innovation, recommends improvements, and develops metrics to measure progress.
