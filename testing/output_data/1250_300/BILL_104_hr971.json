    "content": "The Act titled \"Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995\" is referred to as the short title. It includes findings related to homeowners. The Congress recognizes the strong interest of 65,000,000 homeowners in the US in preserving their property value, which is influenced by various environmental factors. The value of homes in the United States can be reduced by certain types of land development and industrial activities, affecting homeowners and their communities. Current public information procedures may not adequately inform homeowners about activities that could impact their property values. Homeowners have the right to access information about activities that could decrease the value of their homes. Within 90 days of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget must establish uniform Federal procedures for agencies. These procedures will require individuals seeking approval for property impacting activities to provide notice. The term \"application to conduct property impacting activity\" refers to requests for permits, licenses, or approvals that allow activities generating pollutants or adverse impacts affecting the value of private homes. The notice requirements for property impacting activities include providing written notice to homeowners within a 1/4 mile radius of the site and publishing notice in local newspapers. The notice must describe the nature of the application and potential impacts of the proposed activity. The notice for property impacting activities must describe the proposed activity's potential impacts on property values, provide contact information for the applicant and agency representative, and offer opportunities for public comment. Homeowners can call a toll-free number to express concerns or request more information about the application. The agency provides a telephone number for homeowners to register concerns about potential property value impacts from proposed activities. They will investigate these impacts and seek alternatives to minimize adverse effects on home values. SEC. 4. HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. (a) Right of Action.--Any person who carries out an activity authorized by a permit, license, or other approval that generates pollutants causing a total reduction in the value of one or more private homes of $10,000 or more can be sued by the homeowner. \n(b) Notice of Intent to Sue and Voluntary Claim Resolution Procedures.--Before filing a lawsuit, the homeowner must provide a 30-day notice to the defendant and the relevant agency. The homeowner must demonstrate that the defendant's activity caused a reduction in the home's value. Similarly affected homeowners can file class actions in federal court. The homeowner can bring a lawsuit if the agency fails to resolve the claim within 30 days. Any homeowner can file a lawsuit in federal court under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if their home's value is reduced by certain activities. They can recover damages up to the median value of nearby homes and receive compensation for attorney's fees. The court may also issue an injunction if the activity violates federal laws. The United States district court has jurisdiction over actions brought under this section, and may enjoin activities that violate federal laws. Frivolous lawsuits may result in the plaintiff paying the defendant's attorney fees. There is a statute of limitations of 5 years after a home's value reduction reaches $10,000. Statute of Limitations: No action may be brought under this section for any private home after 5 years from the date the home's value reduction reaches $10,000. Savings Provisions: This Act does not limit rights to pursue claims under the Constitution or any other law, and filing a suit or receiving compensation under this Act is not a condition precedent for any other legal claim. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act applies to permits, licenses, approvals issued by an agency and contracts, leases entered into after 180 days from enactment. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include:\n- Agency: as defined in section 551(1) of title 5, United States Code.\n- Potential to reduce the value: activities generating pollutants or adverse impacts affecting private homes.\n- Private home: owner-occupied dwellings, including multi-family dwellings and condominiums.\n- Reduction in value: the difference in fair market value of a home due to certain activities.\n- Person: any individual. The term \"person\" in this section refers to any individual, corporation, partnership, or organization other than a government agency. It involves determining the difference in fair market value of a home due to certain activities."
