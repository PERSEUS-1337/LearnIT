The Congress finds that during the Gulf War in 1991, Americans serving in the Armed Forces were captured, tortured, and subjected to horrendous acts by Saddam Hussein's regime. CBS News reporter Bob Simon and cameraman Roberto Alvarez were also kidnapped and tortured. Many US citizens were detained, beaten, and used as \"human shields\" by Iraq. Iraq was classified as a state sponsor of terrorism at the time. During the Gulf War in 1991, American POWs and civilian hostages suffered long-term physical and mental damage due to state-sponsored torture by Iraq. The Congress passed resolutions condemning Iraq's brutal treatment of captured US service members and demanding adherence to the Geneva Convention. In 1996, an amendment to the Foreign Act was passed by Congress. In 2002, Gulf War POWs and their families filed claims in the United States seeking compensation for torture and abuse by Iraq. In 2003, Gulf War POWs were awarded a judgment for damages after being repeatedly tortured by Iraq. Despite the ruling, they have not received payment. In 2003, Gulf War POWs were awarded damages for being tortured by Iraq. However, they have not received payment due to a waiver granted by the President, preventing further pursuit of their claims in US courts. The President directed the payment of judgments in Hill v. Republic of Iraq from blocked Iraqi accounts. He also confiscated remaining blocked assets of Iraq for Iraq reconstruction. More than 200 US citizens held hostage in Iraq are awaiting compensation in Vine v. Republic of Iraq, but are unable to enforce any judgment due to a waiver granted by the President. The United States courts may obtain jurisdiction over claims against Iraq due to a waiver granted by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act. The Third Geneva Convention prohibits absolving Iraq of liability for torture of prisoners of war. The US has a moral obligation to protect its citizens from torture and hostage-taking. Congress is committed to holding state sponsors of terrorism accountable. The United States courts may obtain jurisdiction over claims against Iraq through a waiver granted by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act. Specific cases must be settled within 30 days, or the waiver authority will terminate. Adequate settlement involves payment by Iraq or a US depository institution. The United States courts can have jurisdiction over claims against Iraq through a waiver granted by the President under the National Defense Authorization Act. Cases must be settled within 30 days, or the waiver authority will end. Adequate settlement involves payment by Iraq or a US depository institution of specified amounts to individuals with claims related to hostage taking. The National Defense Authorization Act allows the US courts to have jurisdiction over claims against Iraq related to hostage taking. Payment amounts are specified for individuals who were hostages, subjected to torture, and have not obtained a judgment on their claim before the enactment of the Act. Spouses, children, and qualifying individuals can also receive a portion of the payment. The National Defense Authorization Act allows US courts jurisdiction over claims against Iraq for hostage taking. Payment amounts are specified for hostages and individuals with compensatory damages judgments. Definitions include the term \"hostage\" as an individual in hostage status or seized during an act of hostage taking. The section provides definitions for terms related to hostage situations, including \"hostage,\" \"hostage status,\" \"hostage taking,\" \"person,\" \"torture,\" and \"United States.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the legal framework surrounding hostage incidents. The term \"torture\" is defined in the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, while \"United States\" refers to states, the District of Columbia, and other territories. A \"United States depository institution\" is a bank organized under US laws. Additionally, Section 1503 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003, was not intended to allow for the removal of certain provisions. The Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2003 and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 did not intend to remove jurisdiction over cases under section 1605(a)(7) of title 28, United States Code. Section 1083(c) of the NDAA applies to cases specified in subsection (b)(2). Section 1083(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 applies to cases under subsection (b)(2) despite any waiver for Iraq."
