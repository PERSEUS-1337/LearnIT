    "content": "In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the first known cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies are digital money validated by a decentralized network instead of a centralized intermediary. They have evolved from niche curiosities to widely used financial instruments, incorporated into various transactions and products. Governments and central banks are exploring the idea of issuing cryptocurrencies. Media coverage of cryptocurrencies is extensive, with some seeing them as the future of monetary systems. Cryptocurrencies are being considered by some government central banks as alternative electronic payment systems. The report assesses how well cryptocurrencies function in this role, highlighting potential benefits, challenges, risks, and policy issues. It reviews the basic characteristics of money, traditional money creation and transfer systems, features of cryptocurrencies, their potential benefits, challenges as money, and certain risks they pose. Cryptocurrencies are being considered by some government central banks as alternative electronic payment systems. The report assesses the features and characteristics of cryptocurrencies, their potential benefits, challenges, risks, and policy issues. Money facilitates the exchange of goods and services, avoiding the need for a barter system. Money serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value in society, allowing for more efficient transactions compared to a barter system. It can be represented by various forms such as gold, paper currency, or digital entries in an electronic ledger. To function as money, a tradable item must have value, act as a good measurement system, and be able to purchase goods and services in the future. While potatoes have intrinsic value, their limited tradability, variability in size and freshness, and inability to be divided without changing value make them impractical as a form of money. Potatoes cannot be divided without losing value due to rotting, limiting their use as money. In contrast, gold and dollars are easily tradeable, divisible, and durable, making them effective units of account and stores of value. Digital technology also allows for easy transfer of value. The question remains on how these different forms of money gain their value. Money has evolved throughout history, with early forms being precious metals like copper, silver, and gold. These metals had intrinsic value and were easily divisible, making them efficient for economic transactions. The value of money is derived from its ability to serve as a unit of account and store of value. The characteristics of precious metals made them ideal for use as money due to their elemental nature, malleability, and chemical inertness. Their scarcity and difficulty in extraction also contributed to their value. Governments played a role in assigning value to money through minting coins with a government symbol. Fiat money, on the other hand, derives its value from government decree rather than intrinsic worth. Fiat money derives its value from government decree rather than intrinsic worth. Governments control the supply of money to ensure its scarcity and minimize counterfeiting. Modern monies, like the U.S. dollar, are generally fiat money. The U.S. dollar is legal tender in the United States, backed by the government to ensure its value. The Federal Reserve maintains the dollar's value through monetary policy, as mandated by Congress in 1977. The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in maintaining the long-term growth of monetary and credit aggregates to support the economy's potential for production. With a money stock exceeding $14 trillion and an annual production of over $20 trillion, the Federal Reserve aims to achieve maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Additionally, the Federal Reserve operates electronic payment systems for interbank transfers, serving as an intermediary between banks. Banks have also evolved to provide alternatives to physical currency exchange, although this system is not without its challenges such as theft or misplacement of money. Banks have historically offered services for secure transfers of money between parties not in physical proximity. This system allows customers to store money as numerical data in ledgers, reducing the risk of theft or loss associated with physical currency. Maintaining accurate ledgers of accounts is crucial for secure money transfers. Participants must trust banks to ensure accurate records and valid transfers. Banks have market incentives to be accurate, as reputation affects customer trust. Banks create trust through market incentives and government regulations to ensure security and accuracy in electronic money transfers, addressing issues like double spending. In electronic money transfers, the issue of double spending is resolved by involving trusted intermediaries like private banks or government central banks. These intermediaries maintain private ledgers of accounts and validate transactions to ensure the payer has sufficient funds for the payment. Electronic money transfers involve deducting funds from the payer's account and adding them to the payee's account through trusted intermediaries like banks. These intermediaries ensure the integrity, performance, and availability of the payment systems by operating vast electronic networks and storing large amounts of data. They are highly regulated to ensure safety, profitability, consumer protection, and financial stability. Intermediaries maintain networks connecting banks and store large amounts of data. They are regulated for safety, profitability, and consumer protection. Intermediaries recoup costs through fees on transactions and related services. Laws like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Fair Credit Billing Act protect consumers in electronic transactions. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Fair Credit Billing Act protect consumers in electronic transactions by ensuring goods or services are delivered as agreed and requiring financial institutions to disclose costs. Some individuals may lack access to electronic payment systems due to cost or geographic barriers, leading to underbanked or unbanked populations. Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to traditional electronic payment systems. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin provide an alternative to traditional electronic payment systems. Transactions are validated by a network of computers instead of a third-party intermediary. Users establish accounts with pseudonymous names and private keys to transfer cryptocurrency. Users create wallets with third-party exchanges to access the cryptocurrency system. Cryptocurrency transactions are validated by a network of computers using private keys. Users create wallets with third-party exchanges to access the system. Blockchain technology secures transactions by preventing invalid alterations to the ledger. Validation requires solving difficult computational decryption before transactions are entered into the ledger. Cryptocurrency platforms use digital signatures to validate transactions and secure the ledger. Users trust the platform's cryptographic protocols to prevent double spending. Incentives are given to users who validate transactions by awarding them newly created units of the currency. The total amount of currency in the system is limited by the platform. Cryptocurrency platforms use digital signatures to validate transactions and secure the ledger. Users are awarded newly created units of currency for validating transactions. The total amount of currency is limited by platform protocols to create scarcity and retain value. Users can mine cryptocurrencies or purchase them on exchanges. Cryptocurrency ledgers using blockchain technology are considered secure, but hackers have exploited vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency ledgers using blockchain technology are secure, but hackers have exploited vulnerabilities to steal cryptocurrency. Analyzing data on cryptocurrency characteristics and usage can help measure its potential as an alternative payment method. However, challenges exist due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the vast number of different cryptocurrencies in circulation. Conducting a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the entire industry is difficult, so this report focuses on Bitcoin as the most well-known cryptocurrency. The report focuses on Bitcoin as an illustrative example of the cryptocurrency industry, which has a total value in circulation of almost $220 billion. Recent trends in Bitcoin prices, value in circulation, and number of transactions provide insight into the performance of cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment system. The rapid appreciation in cryptocurrencies' value in 2017 led to increased public interest, with Bitcoin's price surging to $19,650 in December 2017 before declining by 65% to $6,905 in less than two months. Other major cryptocurrencies like Ether and Litecoin have experienced similar price movements. As of October 7, 2018, the price of one Bitcoin was $6,570 with approximately 17.3 million Bitcoins in circulation, totaling about $113.6 billion. The recent volatility in cryptocurrency prices suggests they may not function well as a unit of account or store of value, impacting their use as money. The number of Bitcoin transactions can serve as an indicator of their utility, despite fluctuations in exchange rates. The price or exchange rate of a currency in dollars at any point in time does not significantly affect its function as money. The number of Bitcoin transactions can indicate the use of Bitcoin as money, with an average of 208,000 transactions per day globally in 2018. This is still limited compared to traditional payment systems like the Automated Clearing House and Visa, which process millions of transactions per day. Cryptocurrencies are still in the early stages of adoption, with potential benefits expected in the future. The use of cryptocurrencies in payment systems is limited compared to traditional systems, but their potential benefits are expected to be realized in the future. Skeptics doubt widespread adoption due to obstacles. The report discusses potential benefits, challenges, and risks of cryptocurrencies. Traditional monetary systems involve intermediaries, while cryptocurrencies offer electronic money exchange. Cryptocurrency proponents believe that decentralized payment systems operated through the internet can be more cost-effective than traditional systems for international money transfers. This is because cryptocurrencies can avoid the additional costs associated with intermediaries in international transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions can potentially avoid the high costs associated with traditional payment systems, such as fees charged by intermediaries. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act included the \"Durbin Amendment\" to limit debit card swipe fees charged by Visa and MasterCard. The Dodd-Frank Act's \"Durbin Amendment\" aimed to limit high debit card swipe fees charged by banks with assets over $10 billion. Cryptocurrency proponents believe using digital currencies could reduce costs and competition in payment systems. Trust in traditional financial institutions is crucial for their credibility, but some individuals may still mistrust them. Cryptocurrencies could be a desirable alternative for individuals who mistrust traditional financial institutions, especially in countries with a higher degree of mistrust in existing systems. Developed economies like the United States may have lower levels of mistrust due to stable economies and regulated financial institutions. Concerns about institutions going bankrupt or misleading individuals about financial risks are common reasons for mistrust. Individuals may mistrust traditional financial institutions due to concerns about institutions going bankrupt, misleading about financial risks, storing and sharing personal information, and being vulnerable to hackers. Some may prefer using cryptocurrency for higher privacy and control over personal data, while others may distrust a government's ability to maintain stable fiat currency value. Individuals who desire more privacy and control over their personal data may opt for cryptocurrency. Some may also lack trust in a government's ability to maintain stable fiat currency value, especially in light of historical incidents of hyperinflation. Cryptocurrencies rely on decentralized networks and cryptographic protocols to limit new money creation, offering an alternative to government-backed currencies. The policy approach to cryptocurrencies will likely depend on their level of adoption, as their benefits can only be realized if they are widely used as a form of money. Cryptocurrencies face challenges in widespread adoption as they need to be used as money by a substantial number of people and businesses. Currently, a small percentage of transactions globally involve Bitcoin, with many using it as an investment rather than for payments. This undermines its ability to serve as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. In 2018 through August, there were 208,000 daily Bitcoin transactions globally, with some used for investment rather than payments. Cryptocurrencies face challenges in being widely accepted due to factors like high volatility and lack of legal tender status. Trust issues in decentralized networks and satisfaction with existing payment systems also hinder adoption. Cryptocurrencies face challenges in being widely accepted due to high volatility and lack of legal tender status. Bitcoin lost almost 53% of its value in the first half of 2018, raising concerns about its ability to serve as a store of value. Scalability issues also exist, as current technologies may not support the number of transactions needed for a global payment system. The processing speed of Bitcoin transactions is slow compared to traditional payment methods like credit cards, with blocks of transactions taking up to an hour to be posted. This is due to the large computational resources required for mining transactions, which incentivized more miners to participate during periods of rapid price increases. The increasing prices of cryptocurrencies incentivized more miners to validate transactions, leading to a surge in energy consumption. However, as cryptocurrency prices have decreased, fewer miners are participating, raising concerns about the high energy requirements of mining operations. The energy needs of the Bitcoin network are comparable to a small country like Ireland, raising questions about the efficiency of cryptocurrencies compared to traditional payment systems. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrencies raises concerns about negative externalities and the lack of validation for goods or services delivered in transactions. Trust is required between parties or a trusted intermediary when transferring cryptocurrency for remote purchases. The risks of transferring Bitcoin before receiving goods can hinder its use as a medium of exchange. Cryptocurrency escrow services offer a solution by holding the buyer's funds until delivery confirmation, enabling trustless transactions. Cryptocurrency escrow services hold buyer's funds until delivery confirmation, allowing trustless transactions. However, reliance on intermediaries raises concerns about security and trustworthiness, potentially hindering widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies as payment systems. Policymakers may need to address the need for new procedures and intermediaries in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency transactions. Cryptocurrencies may require intermediaries to function as money, raising questions about their original purpose. Policymakers need to consider if existing laws adequately address risks like criminal activity and lack of consumer protections in cryptocurrency transactions. Criminals may use the anonymity of cash and decentralized nature of cryptocurrency to hide financial dealings from authorities. Some are concerned that cryptocurrency transactions could be used by criminals to evade authorities, as seen in the case of Silk Road using Bitcoin for illegal drug sales. However, law enforcement has the ability to track transactions on the public ledger, mitigating criminal use. Cryptocurrency platforms function as a public ledger, making it easier for law enforcement to track criminal finances. Despite some cryptocurrencies offering greater anonymity, their use is rare. Government authorities can regulate exchanges to report suspicious activity, as explained by FinCEN. The Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guides cryptocurrency exchanges on regulations for reporting suspicious activity. Exchangers and administrators of virtual currencies are considered money services businesses subject to federal regulation, including registration, reporting of suspicious transactions, and anti-money laundering compliance. State laws also impose various requirements on money services businesses. State and federal regulations impose registration and anti-money laundering requirements on money services businesses, including cryptocurrency exchanges. Bills in the 115th Congress aim to address the criminal use of cryptocurrencies, such as H.R. 2433 and H.R. 5036, which focus on assessing the threat of terrorism using cryptocurrencies and establishing a task force to research digital currency use in illicit activities. The House passed bills aimed at addressing the criminal use of cryptocurrencies, including directing the Treasury to pay rewards for information on terrorist use of digital currencies and establishing programs to detect illicit activities. The IRS treats virtual currencies as property for tax purposes, and legislation amends FinCEN's powers to include emerging technologies in anti-money laundering efforts. The IRS treats virtual currencies as property for tax purposes, with users owing taxes on realized gains. An analysis estimated $25 billion in U.S. tax liability on cryptocurrency gains in 2017. Concerns have been raised about potential tax evasion due to lack of clarity on reporting gains from cryptocurrencies. The use of cryptocurrency for tax evasion and to evade financial sanctions has raised concerns. Limited data is available on whether individuals are using cryptocurrency to hide income from tax authorities. Some governments, like Venezuela, Iran, and Russia, have shown interest in using digital currencies to evade financial sanctions. Some governments, including Iran and Russia, are interested in using cryptocurrencies to evade financial sanctions. Consumer protection laws and regulations apply to cryptocurrency markets, but the adequacy of these protections and the burden of regulation are debated. Concerns also exist about whether investors in cryptocurrency instruments are adequately informed of risks and protected from scams. Companies issuing cryptocurrencies or digital currency for use on their platforms need to ensure investors are informed of risks and protected from scams. While federal consumer protection laws do not specifically target cryptocurrencies, the way they are sold or marketed can still be subject to consumer protection laws. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in commerce. The Federal Trade Commission Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have the authority to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in commerce, including in the cryptocurrency industry. While the CFPB has not actively regulated cryptocurrencies, they are accepting complaints and may enforce consumer financial laws in appropriate cases. Both agencies provide informational material for consumers. The FTC and CFPB have authority over the cryptocurrency industry, accepting complaints and enforcing consumer financial laws. States also have laws against deceptive practices, with regulators able to take action against cryptocurrency businesses. Consumer protections for cryptocurrency exchanges are enforced at the state level through licensing requirements and money transmission laws. Money transmitters, including cryptocurrency exchanges, must obtain state licenses and adhere to regulatory regimes to safeguard customer funds. Consumers in the cryptocurrency industry may face risks due to their unfamiliarity with how cryptocurrencies work and their value derivation. They could unknowingly incur excessive fees, be deceived about the true value of cryptocurrencies, or face the possibility of loss due to irreversibility of transactions. Federal laws and regulations aim to protect consumers, but there are concerns about potential deception and misinformation in the industry. Cryptocurrency transactions lack the consumer protections provided by federal laws like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, leaving consumers vulnerable to irreversible transactions and potential loss. State laws and consumer protections for cryptocurrency transactions vary widely. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) protections do not apply to cryptocurrency transactions as they do not involve traditional financial institutions. State laws and consumer protections for cryptocurrency transactions vary, potentially leaving consumers in states with lax regulations inadequately protected. Policy options could include extending certain electronic fund transfer protections to consumers using cryptocurrency exchanges and granting federal agencies more regulatory authority over these businesses. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that state-by-state regulations are overly burdensome and not tailored to the unique risks of cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrency proponents argue that state regulations for exchanges are onerous and not suited to the industry's unique risks. They believe the current framework puts the US at a disadvantage in cryptocurrency development. Some suggest reducing regulatory burdens or granting federal agencies more authority. The US may be disadvantaged in cryptocurrency development due to state regulations for exchanges. Some suggest enacting federal laws to preempt state requirements. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve, could be affected by widespread cryptocurrency adoption and may consider issuing their own digital currencies. Central banks may need to issue their own digital currencies in response to the potential impact of widespread cryptocurrency adoption on monetary policy. In an economy where cryptocurrency is widely used, central banks may need to adjust their fiat currency or directly buy and sell cryptocurrencies to control their availability. This could have a destabilizing effect on other economies using the same cryptocurrency, leading to challenges in monetary policy coordination between countries. In economies with multiple currencies, the supply of cryptocurrency can be influenced by actions in other countries. The existence of multiple currencies complicates exchanges, as buyers and sellers must monitor the value of different currencies. Governments have generally not been involved in creating cryptocurrencies, aiming to eliminate the need for government intervention in money creation. Cryptocurrencies were created to eliminate government involvement in money creation. However, their decentralized nature poses risks and challenges, leading to discussions about central banks issuing their own digital currencies. The exact form of these central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is uncertain, with varying features and characteristics. Central banks are considering the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), which could vary in features and characteristics. Some argue that CBDCs could offer efficiency gains over traditional systems by providing a faster and less costly payment system. There is speculation that CBDCs could allow individuals to hold accounts directly at the central bank. Central banks are exploring the use of cryptocurrency technologies for a faster, cheaper government-supported payment system. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) could involve individuals holding accounts directly at the central bank, potentially increasing systemic stability. Critics argue that there is no urgent need for CBDCs as existing electronic payment systems are already efficient. They also raise concerns about reduced bank lending and an expanded role for central banks. Opponents of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) argue that individual direct accounts at the central bank could reduce bank lending and expand central banks' role in lending. Consumers may shift deposits from private banks to CBDCs, leading to reduced lending by private banks. Critics also believe that CBDCs could increase systemic instability by facilitating runs on private banks. There is disagreement over whether CBDCs would have a positive impact on central banks' ability to conduct monetary policy. Opponents of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) argue that individuals transferring funds to this government-backed asset could reduce bank lending and expand central banks' role. There is debate over whether CBDCs would positively impact central banks' ability to conduct monetary policy, with proponents suggesting direct transmission of policy rates and critics warning of an overly influential central bank role in financial markets. If CBDCs displaced cash and private bank deposits, central banks may need to increase asset holdings and support lending markets. The future role and value of cryptocurrencies are uncertain, with proponents claiming they will increase economic efficiency and independence from centralized institutions. Skeptics argue that technological challenges and obstacles to widespread adoption will prevent cryptocurrencies from effectively serving as money. Policymakers may face various issues related to cryptocurrency as technological advancements and economic conditions evolve. Cryptocurrencies face uncertainty in their future role and value, with skeptics doubting their ability to function effectively as money. Policymakers may encounter issues such as crime facilitation, consumer protection, industry regulation, and impact on monetary policy."
