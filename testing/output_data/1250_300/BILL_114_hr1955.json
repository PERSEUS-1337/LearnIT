    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on phosphorus loading and nutrient removal technology as effective solutions. This Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights the need for a coordinated strategy to improve nutrient discharge practices. Additionally, it establishes a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program to support the implementation of these technologies in the Great Lakes System. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in discharged wastewater. Priority is given to facilities where these technologies would have the greatest impact. Priority is given to eligible facilities for nutrient removal technologies that would produce the greatest load reductions at discharge points, provide the most environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and help meet nutrient objectives outlined in the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants under this program as prescribed by the Administrator. If approved, the grant will support the installation of these technologies. The Administrator may prescribe a form for applications for grants to install nutrient removal technologies at municipal wastewater treatment facilities. The grant amount cannot exceed 55 percent of the installation cost. Definitions include the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012 and eligible facility as a municipal wastewater treatment facility. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility within the Great Lakes System with a design capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day. $100,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2016-2020 for this purpose, with 4% allocated for administrative costs."
