It highlights that a small percentage of dealers accounted for a large proportion of traced crime guns. The Act proposes increasing the number of allowed compliance inspections of firearms dealers and enhancing penalties on gun kingpins. Section 923(g)(1)(B)(ii)(I) of title 18, United States Code is amended to increase penalties for engaging in an illegal firearms business. The amendment includes fines and imprisonment for violations of specific sections. Additionally, the United States Sentencing Commission is tasked with reviewing and amending sentencing guidelines to enhance penalties for certain offenses related to illegal firearms activities. SEC. 5 amends Section 924(a)(3) of title 18, imposing fines and imprisonment for serious recordkeeping offenses related to gun trafficking. SEC. 6 introduces suspension of firearms dealer's license and civil penalties for violations of the Gun Control Act. Subsections (e) and (f) of section 923 of title 18, United States Code, allow the Secretary to suspend or revoke a license or impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for willful violations of gun laws or failure to provide secure gun storage. The Secretary can also penalize dealers who transfer armor-piercing ammunition. The Secretary has the authority to suspend or revoke a license, impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000, or compromise violations of gun laws. Any denial, suspension, or revocation of a license must be accompanied by written notice stating the specific grounds. The Secretary has the authority to suspend or revoke a license, impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000, or compromise violations of gun laws. Any denial, suspension, or revocation of a license must be accompanied by written notice stating the specific grounds. If the Secretary denies an application for a license, or suspends or revokes a license, a hearing can be requested for review. If the decision is not reversed after the hearing, the aggrieved party can file a petition for judicial review within 60 days. Within 60 days of receiving notice, a party can file a petition with the United States district court for a de novo judicial review of a denial, suspension, revocation, or assessment. The court may consider any evidence submitted by the parties, and if it determines that the Secretary's actions were unauthorized, the court will order necessary compliance. SEC. 7 amends Section 925(b) of title 18, United States Code, by changing the termination of a firearms dealer's license upon felony conviction."
