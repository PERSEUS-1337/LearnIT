Additionally, the Act is amended to include Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science (PALS) described in section 10A. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science (PALS) described in section 10A. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include a program that awards grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to improve laboratory science access at the secondary school level through enhanced mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction. Grants are awarded based on competitive, merit-reviewed criteria, requiring partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 amended to award grants to high-need local educational agencies for partnerships to enhance laboratory science access at secondary schools. Grants require partnerships with higher education institutions, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of costs for activities under the grant shall not exceed 33 percent, and eligible agencies can receive grants for up to 3 fiscal years with a required submission of a plan. The high-need local educational agency must submit a plan for laboratory science program improvements, developed in consultation with various experts. The plan should align with State academic standards and enhance mathematics, science, engineering, and technology instruction through clear learning outcomes and sequenced laboratory experiences. The laboratory experiences must have clear learning outcomes, complement classroom instruction, integrate science content, include student reflection, and discussion. Professional development for teachers, safety requirements, maintenance of facilities, and assessment methods for research literature expansion must be described. The grant recipients must maintain instrumentation post-financial assistance and use assessment methods to expand research literature on the impact of laboratory science on student understanding and achievement. Funds should supplement existing programs, improve secondary science education through laboratory enhancements, and align with state academic standards. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing secondary school science education by improving laboratory facilities, providing equipment and materials, offering professional development for teachers, and integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction to align with State academic standards. The curr_chunk focuses on training teachers in curriculum development, integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, providing laboratory safety training, designing hands-on experiences for underrepresented individuals in STEM fields, developing evaluation tools, and other activities to achieve the goals of the program. The curr_chunk discusses the selection process for grants under the program, including the application requirements such as describing the partnership, outlining the plan, and detailing the activities to be carried out with the grant funds. The grants cannot be used for constructing new facilities. The curr_chunk outlines the activities to be carried out using grant funds, emphasizing alignment with academic standards, research-based practices, expected improvements in student performance, and activities to encourage interest in mathematics and science. The curr_chunk describes activities to strengthen math and science instruction, encourage interest in STEM fields among underrepresented individuals, assess student achievement, evaluate partnership success, and make programmatic assessments available to the research community. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for evaluating partnership applications, including effectiveness in program implementation, alignment with research and academic standards, potential for widespread implementation, and impact on student achievement. The Director will evaluate the program to identify best practices and materials developed by partnerships, comparing their effectiveness. The program aims to encourage interest in STEM fields and prepare individuals for postsecondary studies. The Director will evaluate partnerships to identify best practices and materials, comparing their effectiveness. Results will be disseminated to the public and relevant committees. Materials will be made widely available. The Director will provide technical assistance to high-need local educational agencies in developing grant applications and activities. An annual meeting will be convened to promote national collaboration among grant recipients. The Secretary of Education will convene an annual meeting of high-need local educational agencies receiving grants to promote national collaboration. The Director will provide a report on coordination with other education programs to relevant congressional committees. The President's annual budget request includes definitions for \"high-need local educational agency\" and \"National Laboratory\" as per specific legislation."
