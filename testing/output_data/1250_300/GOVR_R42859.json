The DOD and military services have spent millions on alternative fuels, with the Navy proposing a significant investment. This report also provides data on DOD's alternative fuels purchases and the status of testing platforms for alternative fuel blends. The report provides an overview of DOD's alternative fuels policy, purchases, testing platforms, and certification of fuel blends. It also discusses the Navy's biofuel production initiative under the Defense Production Act, along with legislative actions related to DOD's alternative fuels efforts. Section 314 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act assigned oversight of DOD's alternative fuels initiatives to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. This role includes leading alternative fuel activities, overseeing investments, issuing guidelines, and promoting collaboration with other federal agencies. The Secretary of Defense issues guidelines to streamline alternative fuels investments across DOD and leverage investments from other federal agencies. The goals of DOD's alternative fuels policy are to ensure military readiness, improve battlespace effectiveness, and increase fuel source options. Alternative fuels for DOD use must be drop-in, cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. DOD officials have outlined criteria for alternative fuels, including being \"drop-in,\" cost-competitive, and available in sufficient quantities. Investments in alternative fuels must be certified as part of the annual operational energy budget process. Future investments will undergo a rigorous evaluation process. Alternative fuels development will follow three phases, starting with certification. Future investments in alternative fuels will be subject to a rigorous, merit-based evaluation. DOD alternative fuels development initiatives will follow three phases: Certification, Field Demonstration, and Ongoing Purchases. Each military service has set goals regarding alternative fuels. The Army's goals in this area are not specified. The military services have set goals for increasing the use of alternative fuels. The Army aims to have 25% of energy for power generation and 50% of fuel for training met by alternative sources by 2028. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its aviation fuel requirements from alternative sources by being cost-competitive. The Air Force aims to acquire 50% of its aviation fuel requirements from alternative sources by being cost-competitive. The Navy has set ambitious goals for alternative fuels, including deploying a \"Great Green Fleet\" strike group by 2016 and meeting 50% of total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. The Navy aims to meet 50% of its total energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. To achieve this, they plan to reduce liquid fuel usage afloat and replace approximately 8 million barrels of petroleum with unblended alternative fuels. DLA Energy has procured 1.9 million gallons of alternative fuels for the military since 2007, with DOD spending $48 million to test and certify alternative fuels for service fleets. The military has spent $48 million to test and certify alternative fuels for service fleets. Various types of alternative fuels have been purchased, including Fischer-Tropsch fuels, biofuels, and alcohol-to-jet fuels. The Air Force and Navy have purchased different types of alternative fuels, with the Navy aiming to meet 50% of its energy consumption from alternative sources by 2020. Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from entering into contracts for alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies, including DOD, from purchasing alternative fuels with high greenhouse gas emissions. DOD's position is that this provision does not apply to bulk fuel purchases. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are testing alternative fuel blends for potential fleet-wide use. The Army is testing alternative fuel blends for fleet-wide use, including 50:50 blends of Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene and hydrotreated renewable jet with JP-8. They aim to certify these fuels by 2014 and are working on obtaining Air Force certification for H-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The Army plans to complete testing of tactical ground equipment systems for alternative fuels by the end of FY2014. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets and is expected to certify biofuels soon. The Air Force has certified Fischer-Tropsch fuel blends for its fleets and is expected to certify biofuels soon. Testing of alternative fuels like alcohol-to-jet, pyrolysis oils, and direct sugar to hydrocarbon will continue in the future. The Navy has tested HEFA 50:50 biofuel blends for aircraft and anticipates certification for all HEFA fuels in early 2013. Testing and certification of Fischer-Tropsch fuels is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. The Departments of the Navy, Energy, and Agriculture signed a Memorandum of Understanding in June 2011 to support the development of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry. The MOU aims to overcome start-up risks and competitive barriers in the crude oil market by investing in advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries. The initiative will produce biofuels meeting military specifications, being price competitive with petroleum, and having no significant impact on the food supply. Funding for this initiative will be provided under the Defense Production Act. The Navy, Energy, and Agriculture departments plan to fund a biofuels production initiative with $510 million over three years. The initiative aims to develop biofuels that meet military specifications, are price competitive with petroleum, and have no significant impact on the food supply. The funding will come from federal funds, industry cost-sharing, and support from the Department of Agriculture. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA-12-15-PKM) for a biofuels production initiative was released on June 27, 2012, with a government funding amount of $210 million. Awards for biofuels production facilities will be given in two phases: Phase 1 for planning and preliminary designs, and Phase 2 for construction and testing. Successful proposals require a 50% cost share, domestic production of advanced biofuels, compliance with regulations, use of renewable feedstock, production of drop-in fuel, cost-competitiveness with petroleum fuels, and a production capacity of at least 10 million gallons a year. The FOA funding level includes $100 million from the Department of Defense. The FOA funding level of $210 million for a biofuels production initiative includes funding from DOD, Navy's drop-in biofuels production initiative, and DOE. It does not include USDA funding for bio-based jet fuel production. The USDA and the Commodity Credit Corporation have the authority to increase the use of agricultural commodities for bio-based jet fuel production. Legislative activity in 2012 focused on expanding or limiting DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels and invest in production capability. H.R. 4310 contained provisions exempting DOD from certain requirements and limiting its ability to purchase more expensive alternative fuels. The Senate passed S. 3254 without restrictions on DOD's ability to purchase alternative fuels. Amendments restricting DOD's biofuels investments were removed during floor debate. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits DOD from using funds for biofuel refinery construction without matching contributions from DOE and USDA. The Department of Defense's funds for biofuels production in fiscal year 2013 cannot be used for constructing a biofuel refinery without matching contributions from the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture. The Navy requested $70 million for advanced drop-in biofuels production, part of a larger appropriation request under the Defense Production Act. The House Appropriations Committee report on the FY2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act declined to fund the $70 million requested for joint biofuel production. The House Appropriations Committee report on FY2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act declined to fund the $70 million requested for joint biofuel production as part of the Defense Production Act Fund. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 includes $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, an increase of about $134.3 million over the amount requested. The House and Senate reduced funding for advanced drop-in biofuels by $10 million, allocating $60 million in total. Additionally, $20 million was allocated for research on lowering coal emissions in the Air Force. The conferees provided $20 million for research to improve coal-to-liquid fuel emissions, aiming to make it a competitive alternative energy resource. The conferees directed the Secretary of the Air Force to inform congressional defense committees prior to any funds transfer for coal-to-liquid fuel technology. The Department of Energy requested to transfer $40 million into the Defense Production Act Fund for FY2013, with the Senate version allowing up to $100 million transfer. The Department of Energy can transfer up to $100 million of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funds into the Defense Production Act Fund. The funding for DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy was approximately $1.8 billion under the Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. Congress has oversight questions regarding the benefits of alternative fuels for the services, funding for testing and certification efforts, and coordination among the services. The Navy is leading the effort to jumpstart a domestic advanced biofuels industry with a $510 million investment. Questions arise regarding coordination among military services, funding for alternative fuels testing, and oversight by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs (ASD(OEPP)) is overseeing military services' investments in alternative fuels testing and certification. Questions arise about the adequacy of ASD(OEPP)'s oversight authority and coordination activities. Additionally, concerns exist regarding potential overlap between DOD's alternative fuel initiatives and those of other federal agencies. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act allocated $150 million to support DPA Title III funding. The FY2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-74) allocated $150 million for DPA Title III funding. The Act did not specify the use of this funding for biofuels production, but both the House and Senate reports supported DOD biofuels initiatives and recommended longer contract terms for biofuels procurement. The Senate report encouraged the Department to fund multi-year contracts for biofuels products to ensure adequate production, while the House report also expressed support for DOD biofuels initiatives. The Department may fund multi-year contracts for biofuels products up to 15 years to maximize efficiencies of scale for the best purchase price. The House Appropriations Committee report supports long-term contracts for biofuels, believing that investments in alternative energy will benefit the Nation. The Department of Energy requested authority to transfer funds to support pilot-scale demonstration projects. The Department of Energy requested authority to transfer funds to the DPA Fund to support pilot-scale demonstration projects for biomass and biorefinery systems R&D. However, the House-passed version of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act did not include language authorizing this transfer. The House Appropriations Committee declined to fund and authorize the Department of Energy's portion of the joint initiative, recommending $203,000,000 for Biomass and Biorefinery Systems R&D. The Department of Energy is directed to focus on research, development, and demonstration activities for biomass and crop-based fuels. A joint initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture for biofuels production was not justified and is not recommended for funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee may allow up to $100,000,000 transfer for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2013 allows the Secretary to transfer up to $100,000,000 for Defense Production Act Fund activities. The accompanying report supports a joint biofuel production initiative by the DOD, DOE, and USDA for innovative technologies in jet and diesel fuels. This collaboration aims to increase acceptance of advanced biofuels in the supply chain. The Department of Defense is collaborating with the Department of Energy to develop innovative technologies for jet and diesel fuels for military use. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions that exempt the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements and limit funds for the procurement of alternative fuels if the cost exceeds traditional fuel production costs. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act exempts the Department of Defense from alternative fuel procurement requirements, limiting funds if alternative fuel costs exceed traditional fuel production costs. The Act allows limited purchases of alternative fuels for fleet certification purposes. S. 3254, as passed by the Senate, does not restrict the Department of Defense's ability to procure or produce biofuels. The Senate Armed Services Committee's provisions affecting the Department of Defense's procurement and production of biofuels were struck down via floor amendments in S. 3254. S.Amdt. 2985, sponsored by Senator Mark Udall, removed Section 313 limiting the purchase of alternative fuels exceeding traditional fuel costs. S.Amdt. 3095, sponsored by Senator Hagan, removed Section 2823 prohibiting the Department of Defense from entering into biofuels refinery infrastructure contracts. The Senate Armed Services Committee's provisions on biofuels procurement and production in S. 3254 were altered by floor amendments. Section 2823, which restricted the Department of Defense from entering biofuels refinery contracts without specific authorization, was removed. Senator Inhofe's amendment to exempt the Department of Defense from a fuel purchasing restriction also failed. The amendment in question, similar to Section 313 in H.R. 4310, limits the use of funds for alternative fuel procurement by the Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013. The Secretary of Defense is allowed to purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification purposes. The Secretary of Defense can purchase limited quantities of alternative fuels for engine or fleet certification using competitive procedures to ensure the best purchase price. However, the construction of biofuels refineries or infrastructure is prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. Additionally, funds for alternative fuel procurement in fiscal year 2013 cannot be used if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels for the same purpose. The Department of Defense in fiscal year 2013 is prohibited from using funds for alternative fuels if the cost exceeds that of traditional fossil fuels, except for testing purposes. The Defense Logistics Agency purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuels for $12.0 million, the largest government purchase of biofuel, to demonstrate the capability of using alternative fuels. Despite the higher cost, the purchase is considered a research initiative. The committee supports Department of Defense initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about using operation and maintenance funds for high-cost biofuels in research and development efforts. They direct the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance on the difference between using alternative fuels operationally versus for research. The committee supports DoD initiatives to reduce fuel demand through new technologies but is concerned about using funds for high-cost biofuels in RDTE efforts. They direct the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance on the difference between operational use of alternative fuels versus continued RDTE initiatives. (Pages 80-81) H.R. 4310 / P.L. 113-6 Section 315 of the enrolled FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act states a limitation on DoD funds for biofuel refinery construction until matching contributions are received from DOE and USDA. The House Appropriations Committee did not provide funding for advanced drop-in biofuel production in fiscal year 2013, despite a request for $70,000,000 for construction or retrofit of biofuel plants. They suggested that the Secretary of Defense request funding in future years when it can be executed in a timely manner. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for a specific effort in fiscal year 2013 due to decreasing budgets. However, they provide an additional $100 million for the Defense Production Act fund, stating it is crucial for the defense industrial base. The funding is to be competitively awarded to new initiatives, with priority given to completing projects from previous years. The Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933/P.L. 113-6) appropriates $223,531,000 for the Defense Production Act Fund, with an increase of $134.3 million over the requested amount. The funding is to be competitively awarded to new initiatives, with priority given to completing projects from previous years. Additionally, $20 million is allocated for research on lowering emissions of coal to liquid fuels in the Air Force's Research & Development.
